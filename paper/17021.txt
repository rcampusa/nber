                                               ABSTRACT

This paper examines the evidence on the relationship between credit spreads and economic activity.
Using an extensive data set of prices of outstanding corporate bonds trading in the secondary market,
we construct a credit spread index that is—compared with the standard default-risk indicators—a considerably
more powerful predictor of economic activity. Using an empirical framework, we decompose our index
into a predictable component that captures the available firm-specific information on expected defaults
and a residual component—the excess bond premium. Our results indicate that the predictive content
of credit spreads is due primarily to movements in the excess bond premium. Innovations in the excess
bond premium that are orthogonal to the current state of the economy are shown to lead to significant
declines in economic activity and equity prices. We also show that during the 2007–09 financial crisis,
a deterioration in the creditworthiness of broker-dealers—key financial intermediaries in the corporate
cash market—led to an increase in the excess bond premium. These find- ings support the notion that
a rise in the excess bond premium represents a reduction in the effective risk-bearing capacity of the
financial sector and, as a result, a contraction in the supply of credit with significant adverse consequences
for the macroeconomy.

1     Introduction
Between the summer of 2007 and the spring of 2009, the U.S. economy was gripped by an
acute liquidity and credit crunch, by all accounts, the most severe financial crisis since the
Great Depression. Throughout this period of extreme financial turmoil, credit spreads—the
difference in yields between various private debt instruments and government securities of
comparable maturity—served as a crucial gauge of the degree of strains in the financial sys-
tem. In addition, movements in credit spreads were thought to contain important signals
regarding the evolution of the real economy and risks to the economic outlook, a view sup-
ported by the insights from the large literature on the predictive content of credit spreads—or
asset prices more generally—for economic activity.1
    The focus on credit spreads is motivated, in part, by theories that depart from the
Modigliani and Miller [1958] paradigm of frictionless financial markets, theories that empha-
size linkages between the quality of borrowers’ balance sheets and their access to external
finance. Fluctuations in credit spreads may also reflect shifts in the effective supply of funds
offered by financial intermediaries, which, in the presence of financial market frictions, have
important implications for the usefulness of credit spreads as predictors of economic activity.
In the latter case, a deterioration in the capital position of financial intermediaries leads to
a reduction in the supply of credit, causing an increase in the cost of debt finance—the
widening of credit spreads—and a subsequent reduction in spending and production.
    In this paper, we examine the relationship between corporate bond credit spreads and
economic activity. To do so, we first construct a new credit spread index—the “GZ credit
spread”—that has considerable predictive power for economic activity over the 1973–2010
period. Our approach builds on the recent work of Gilchrist et al. [2009], in that we use prices
of individual corporate bonds traded in the secondary market to construct this highly infor-
mative financial indicator. According to our results, the predictive ability of the GZ credit
spread for future economic activity significantly exceeds that of the widely-used default-risk
indicators such as the standard Baa–Aaa corporate bond credit spread and the “paper-bill”
spread.
    As shown by Philippon [2009], the predictive content of corporate bond credit spreads for
   1
     Financial indicators considered in this vast literature include stock prices (Fama [1981]); spreads
between long- and short-term risk-free interest rates (Harvey [1988]; Estrella and Hardouvelis [1991];
Estrella and Mishkin [1998]; and Hamilton and Kim [2002]); the Treasury term structure more generally
(Ang et al. [2006]); spreads between rates on short-term commercial paper and rates on Treasury bills
(Friedman and Kuttner [1992, 1998]; and Emery [1999]); and yield spreads on longer-term corporate debt
(Gertler and Lown [1999]; Mueller [2009]; Gilchrist et al. [2009]; and Faust et al. [2011]).



                                                   1
economic activity could reflect—absent any financial market frictions—the ability of the bond
market to signal more accurately than the stock market a decline in economic fundamentals
prior to a cyclical downturn. To address this issue, we use an empirical credit-spread pricing
framework to decompose the GZ spread into two components: a component capturing the
usual countercyclical movements in expected defaults and a component representing the
cyclical changes in the relationship between default risk and credit spreads—the so-called
excess bond premium.
    The decomposition is motivated in part by the existence of the “credit spread puzzle,” the
well-known result from the corporate finance literature, showing that less than one-half of
the variation in corporate bond credit spreads can be attributed to the financial health of the
issuer (e.g., Elton et al. [2001]). As shown by Collin-Dufresne et al. [2001], Houwelling et al.
[2005], and Driessen [2005], the unexplained portion of the variation in credit spreads appears
to reflect some combination of time-varying liquidity premium, the tax treatment of corporate
bonds, and most importantly, a default-risk factor that captures compensation demanded
by investors—above and beyond expected losses—for bearing exposure to corporate credit
risk.
    Our results indicate that a substantial portion of the information content of the GZ credit
spread for economic activity can be attributed to deviations in the pricing of corporate bonds
relative to the expected default risk of the issuer. We examine the macroeconomic implica-
tions of this finding using an identified vector autoregression (VAR) framework. According
to our analysis, shocks to the excess bond premium that are orthogonal to the current state
of the economy lead to economically and statistically significant declines in consumption,
investment, and output, as well as to appreciable disinflation. Monetary policy is eased
significantly in response to these adverse economic developments, and despite the decline in
long-term Treasury yields, such shocks cause a sharp fall in the broad stock market.
    To provide an interpretation for these “financial disruptions” in the context of the 2007–
09 crisis, we examine how shocks to the profitability of primary dealers—the highly leveraged
financial institutions that play a key role in the corporate cash market—affect credit supply
conditions as measured by the excess bond premium. Our results indicate that an adverse
shock to the equity valuations of these intermediaries—relative to the market return—leads
to an immediate and persistent increase in their credit default swap (CDS) premiums, a
response that is mirrored in an almost one-to-one basis by an increase in the excess bond
premium.
    The confluence of our results is thus consistent with the notion that an increase in the


                                               2
excess bond premium reflects a reduction in the effective risk-bearing capacity of the financial
sector and, as a result, a contraction in the supply of credit. Consistent with the financial
accelerator mechanisms emphasized by Bernanke and Gertler [1989], Kiyotaki and Moore
[1997], Bernanke et al. [1999], and Hall [2010], this reduction in credit availability augurs
a change in financial conditions with significant adverse consequences for macroeconomic
outcomes.


2     A High-Information Content Credit Spread Index
Academics, business economists, and policymakers have long relied on credit spreads to
gauge the degree of strains in the financial system. In addition, market participants view
these default-risk indicators as particularly useful for extracting investors’ expectations of
future economic outcomes, though obtaining an accurate reading of this information can be
complicated by the presence of time-varying risk premiums. In this paper, we employ the
“bottom-up” approach used by Gilchrist et al. [2009] to construct a credit spread index with
a high-information content for future economic developments. Importantly, we extend the
time span of the analysis back to the mid-1970s, thereby covering an appreciably greater
number of business cycles, a consideration of particular importance when one is evaluating
the predictive ability of financial indicators for economic activity.


2.1     Data Sources and Methods
For a sample of U.S. nonfinancial firms covered by the S&P’s Compustat and the Center for
Research in Security Prices (CRSP), we obtained month-end secondary market prices of their
outstanding securities from the Lehman/Warga and Merrill Lynch databases.2 To ensure
that we are measuring borrowing costs of different firms at the same point in their capital
structure, we limited our sample to senior unsecured issues with a fixed coupon schedule
only.
    The micro-level aspect of our data allows us to construct credit spreads that are not
subject to the “duration mismatch” that plagues the standard credit spread indexes. We do
so by constructing a synthetic risk-free security that mimics exactly the cash-flows of the
corresponding corporate debt instrument. Specifically, consider a corporate bond k issued by
firm i that at time t is promising a sequence of cash-flows {C(s) : s = 1, 2, . . . , S}, consisting
  2
    These two data sources include secondary market prices for a vast majority of dollar-denominated bonds
publicly issued in the U.S. corporate cash market; see Gilchrist et al. [2009] for details.


                                                    3
of the regular coupon payments and the repayment of the principle at maturity. The price
of this bond is given by
                                          S
                                          !
                                Pit [k] =   C(s)D(ts ),
                                               s=1
                  −rt t
where D(t) = e          is the discount function in period t. To calculate the price of the
corresponding risk-free security—denoted by Ptf [k]—we discount the cash-flow sequence
{C(s) : s = 1, 2, . . . , S} using continuously-compounded zero-coupon Treasury yields in
period t, obtained from the U.S. Treasury yield curve estimated daily by Gürkaynak et al.
[2007]. The resulting price Ptf [k] can then be used to calculate the yield—denoted by ytf [k]—
of a hypothetical Treasury security with exactly the same cash-flows as the underlying cor-
porate bond. The resulting credit spread Sit [k] = yit [k] − ytf [k], where yit [k] denotes the yield
of the corporate bond k, is thus free of the bias that would occur were the spreads computed
simply by matching the corporate yield to the estimated yield of a Treasury security of the
same maturity.
    To ensure that our results are not driven by a small number of extreme observations,
we eliminated all observations with credit spreads below 5 basis points and greater than
3,500 basis points. In addition, we dropped from our sample very small corporate issues
(par value of less than $1 million) and all observations with a remaining term-to-maturity
of less than one year or more than 30 years. These selection criteria yielded a sample of
5,982 individual securities for the period between January 1973 and September 2010. We
matched these corporate securities with their issuer’s quarterly income and balance sheet
data from Compustat and daily data on equity valuations from CRSP, yielding a matched
sample of 1,112 firms.
    Table 1 contains summary statistics for the key characteristics of bonds in our sample.
Note that a typical firm in our sample has only a few senior unsecured issues outstanding at
any point in time—the median firm, for example, has two such issues trading in any given
month. This distribution, however, exhibits a significant positive skew, as some firms can
have many more issues trading in the secondary market at a point in time.
    The distribution of the market values of these issues is similarly skewed, with the range
running from $1.2 million to more than $5.6 billion. The maturity of these debt instruments
is fairly long, with the average maturity at issue of 13 years; the average remaining term-to-
maturity in our sample is 11.3 years. However, because corporate bonds typically generate
significant cash flows in the form of regular coupon payments, their duration is considerably
shorter.

     Market value of the outstanding issue deflated by the CPI (1982–84 = 100).


    An important characteristic of our sample is the fact that about two thirds of the securities
are callable—that is, the issuer has the right to “call” (i.e., redeem) the bond issue prior
to its maturity under certain pre-specified conditions. Moreover, the share of callable debt
in the secondary market has varied substantially over the sample period, with almost all
bonds being subject to a call provision until the late 1980s. Likely spurred by the decline in
long-term nominal interest rates and the accompanied reduction in interest rate volatility,
the share of callable debt fell to its historic low of about 25 percent by the mid-1990s.
However, over the past decade and a half, this trend has been almost completely reversed,
as nonfinancial firms resumed issuing large amounts of callable senior unsecured debt.
    In terms of default risk—at least as measured by the S&P credit ratings—our sample
spans the entire spectrum of credit quality, from “single D” to “triple A.” At “BBB1,”
however, the median observation is still solidly in the investment-grade category. An average
bond has an expected return of 204 basis points above the comparable risk-free rate, while
the sizable standard deviation of 281 basis points reflects the wide range of credit quality in
our sample.
    Using this micro-level data set, we construct a simple credit spread index that is repre-
sentative of the entire maturity spectrum and the range of credit quality in the corporate
cash market. Specifically, the GZ credit spread is calculated as

   GZ spread = the average credit spread on senior unsecured bonds issued by nonfinancial firms in
   our sample (the solid line); Baa–Aaa = the spread between yields on Baa- and Aaa-rated long-term

   A1/P1 nonfinancial commercial paper and the 1-month Treasury yield (the dotted line). The shaded
   vertical bars represent the NBER-dated recessions.



where Nt is the number of bond/firm observations in month t—that is, the GZ credit spread is
simply an arithmetic average of the credit spreads on outstanding bonds in any given month.
Figure 1 shows the GZ credit spread along with two widely-used default-risk indicators that
are also available over our sample period: the spread between yields on indexes of Baa-
and Aaa-rated seasoned industrial corporate bonds, and the yield spread between 1-month
A1/P1-rated nonfinancial commercial paper and the 1-month Treasury yield (the paper-bill
spread).3
   All three credit spreads are clearly countercyclical, rising prior to and during economic
downturns. Nonetheless, the pair-wise correlations between the three series are fairly small
and do not exhibit much of a systematic pattern. For example, the correlation between
the paper-bill and the Baa–Aaa spread is 0.21, whereas the paper-bill and the GZ spread
are slightly negatively correlated, with the correlation coefficient of −0.17. Perhaps not too
surprising, the highest correlation, 0.38, is between the two corporate bond credit spread

volatile, with the standard deviations of 50 and 67 basis points, respectively. Reflecting its
broader coverage, both in terms of credit quality and maturity, the standard deviation of
the GZ credit spread—at about 100 basis points—is considerably higher.

                                 , h ≥ 0 is the forecast horizon, and c is a scaling constant
that depends on the frequency of the data (i.e., c = 1, 200 for monthly data and c = 400
for quarterly data). In the forecasting regression (2), TSt denotes the “term spread”—that
is, the slope of the Treasury yield curve, defined as the difference between the three-month
constant-maturity Treasury yield and the 10-year constant-maturity yield; RFFt denotes the
real federal funds rate; CSt denotes a credit spread; and $t+h is the forecast error. Thus, our
framework examines the marginal information content of credit spreads conditional on the
slope of the yield curve and the real federal funds rate, two key indicators of the stance of
monetary policy.4
     The timing adopted by this specification allows for the possibility of “nowcasting” (i.e.,
h = 0), and it is intended to capture the fact that when forecasting an indicator of economic
activity in period t, economists, because of reporting lags, typically do not observe the
current value of the indicator, while the current financial asset prices are readily available.
The forecasting regression (2) is estimated by OLS, with the lag length p of each specification
determined by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). For the forecasting horizons h ≥ 1,
the MA(h) structure of the error term $t+h induced by overlapping observations is taken into
account by computing standard errors according to Hodrick [1992].5
    4
      The real federal funds rate in period t is defined as the average effective federal funds rate during period t
less realized inflation, where realized inflation is given by the log-difference between the core PCE price index
in period t − 1 and its lagged value a year earlier.
    5
      As shown by Ang and Bekaert [2007], the standard errors developed by Hodrick [1992] retain the correct
size even in relatively small samples when testing the null of no predictability in the context of overlapping
observations.

    We first analyze the information content of the three credit spreads shown in Figure 1
for key monthly indicators of economic activity: the growth of private (nonfarm) payroll
employment, the change in the civilian unemployment rate, and the growth of manufacturing
industrial production. (In the case of the unemployment rate, the transformation ∇h does
not involve logs.) Using quarterly data, we also consider the predictive content of these
default-risk indicators for the growth of real GDP, the broadest measure of economic activity.


3.1    Forecasting Results
The results in Table 2 detail the predictive power of various financial indicators for the three
monthly measures of economic activity. We focus on the 3- and 12-month ahead forecast
horizons and report standardized estimates of the coefficients associated with the financial
indicators, as well as the in-sample goodness-of-fit as measured by the adjusted R2 .
   The first column in each subpanel of the table contains the results from our baseline
specification, which includes the term spread and the real federal funds rate, along with p lags
of ∇Yt−1 , as predictors. In line with previous findings, the slope of the Treasury yield curve
has significant predictive content for all three economic indicators at both forecast horizons,
with a flat or inverted yield curve signaling a deterioration in labor market conditions and a
deceleration in industrial output. The real federal funds rate has some additional predictive
power for changes in the labor market conditions at the 12-month forecast horizon, but it
has no explanatory power for the growth of industrial production at either horizon.
   The remaining three columns contain the results from our baseline specification aug-
mented with the three default-risk indicators. The paper-bill spread forecasts all three mea-
sures of economic activity, though the addition of this spread leads to only a small increase in
the adjusted R2 relative to the baseline specification. The forecasting ability of the Baa–Aaa
credit spread appears to be equally modest; although the Baa–Aaa spread contains some
marginal information for near-term economic developments, at the year-ahead horizon, this
default-risk indicator has statistically significant, but economically negligible, explanatory
power only for changes in the unemployment rate.
   In contrast to the results obtained with the two standard default-risk indicators, the
GZ credit spread is statistically a highly significant predictor of all three measures of eco-
nomic activity at both the short and longer-term horizons. Moreover, the magnitude of
the estimated coefficients implies an economically significant negative relationship between
credit spreads and future economic activity. For example, an increase of 100 basis point in
the GZ credit spread in month t implies an almost 3.0 percentage points (annualized) drop

in the growth rate of industrial output over the subsequent three months. Moreover, the
inclusion of the GZ spread in the predictor set yields sizable improvements in the in-sample
fit, ranging—at the 12-month horizon—from 12 percentage points in the case of industrial
production to about 15 percentage points for the two labor market indicators.
     Table 3 summarizes the predictive content of these financial indicators for the growth
of real GDP. According to the entries in the table, the current stance of monetary policy
has no predictive power for the next quarter’s economic growth, although the term spread
is economically and statistically a highly significant predictor of the year-ahead growth in
real output. Both the paper-bill and the Baa–Aaa spreads contain some information about
the near-term growth prospects, but the signaling ability of these two default-risk indicators
vanishes at longer horizons. In contrast, the GZ credit spread is a highly significant predictor
of real GDP growth at both the 1- and 4-quarter forecast horizons, with an increase of
100 basis points in the GZ credit spread in quarter t leading to a deceleration in real GDP
of more than 1.25 percentage points over the subsequent four quarters.


4      The Excess Bond Premium
In this section, we exploit the micro-level aspect of the data to decompose our high-
information content credit spread index into two components: a component that captures

                                                    10
the systematic movements in default risk of individual firms and a residual component—the
excess bond premium—which we argue below plausibly represents variation in the average
price of bearing exposure to U.S. corporate credit risk, above and beyond the compensation
for expected defaults.
    Our empirical methodology is related to the recent work of Berndt et al. [2008], in that
the log of the credit spread on bond k (issued by firm i) at time t is assumed to be related
linearly to a firm-specific measure of expected default DFTit and a vector of bond-specific
characteristics Zit [k], according to

                                 ln Sit [k] = βDFTit + γ " Zit [k] + $it [k];                           (3)

where the zero-mean disturbance $it [k] represents a “pricing” error.6 The credit-spread
regression (3) is estimated by OLS, and the standard errors are double-clustered in the
firm (i) and time (t) dimensions and thus are robust to both cross-sectional dependence and
serial correlation (cf. Cameron et al. [2011]).
    Assuming normally distributed disturbances, the predicted level of the spread for bond k
of firm i at time t is given by
                                               %                         &
                                $                             "  σ̂ 2
                                Sit [k] = exp β̂DFTit + γ̂ Zit +             ,
                                                                  2

where (β̂, γ̂ " ) denotes the OLS estimates of the corresponding parameters and σ̂ 2 is the
estimated variance of the disturbance term $it [k]. By averaging across bonds/firms at time t,
we can define the predicted component of the GZ credit spread as

                                                1 !! $
                                        S$tGZ =        Sit [k].
                                                Nt i k

The excess bond premium in period t is then defined by the following linear decomposition:

                                           EBPt = StGZ − S$tGZ .

Within this framework, we are interested in determining the extent to which the forecasting
power of the GZ credit spread is due to the information content of the expected default
component (S$GZ ) versus movements in the excess bond premium (EBP ).
   6
     Taking logs of credit spreads provides a useful transformation to control for heteroscedasticity, given
that the distribution of credit spreads is highly skewed.

4.1    Measuring Default Risk
To measure a firm’s probability of default at each point in time, we employ the “distance-to-
default” (DD) framework developed in the seminal work of Merton [1974]. The key insight
of this contingent claims approach to corporate credit risk is that the equity of the firm can
be viewed as a call option on the underlying value of the firm with a strike price equal to
the face value of the firm’s debt. Although neither the underlying value of the firm nor its
volatility can be directly observed, they can, under the assumptions of the model, be inferred
from the value of the firm’s equity, the volatility of its equity, and the firm’s observed capital
structure.
    While used widely by the financial industry, our choice of the Merton framework is also
motivated by the work of Schaefer and Strebulaev [2008], who present compelling micro-
level evidence showing that even the simplest structural default model—the DD-model with
nonstochastic interest rates—accounts well for the default-risk component of corporate bond
prices. In particular, such models generate sensitivities (i.e., hedge ratios) of corporate bond
returns to the issuing firm’s equity and riskless bond returns that are remarkably consistent
with those observed in the actual data.
    The first assumption underlying the DD-framework is that the total value of the firm V
follows a geometric Brownian motion:

                                    dV = µV V dt + σV V dW,                                   (4)

where µV denotes the expected continuously-compounded return on V ; σV is the volatility of
firm value; and dW is an increment of the standard Weiner process. The second assumption
pertains to the firm’s capital structure. In particular, it is assumed that the firm has just
issued a single discount bond in the amount D that will mature in T periods.
    Together, these two assumption imply that the value of the firm’s equity E can be viewed
as a call option on the underlying value of the firm V , with a strike price equal to the face
value of the firm’s debt D and a time-to-maturity of T . According to the Black-Scholes-
Merton option-pricing framework, the value of the firm’s equity then satisfies:

                                  E = V Φ(δ1 ) − e−rT DΦ(δ2 ),                                (5)

where r denotes the instantaneous risk-free interest rate, Φ(·) is the cumulative standard

                            ln(V /D) + (r + 0.5σV2 )T                         √
                     δ1 =               √                and δ2 = δ1 − σV         T.
                                     σV2 T

   According to equation (5), the value of the firm’s equity depends on the total value of
the firm and time, a relationship that also underpins the link between volatility of the firm’s
value σV and the volatility of its equity σE . In particular, it follows from Ito’s lemma that
                                               ' (
                                                V ∂E
                                          σE =       σV .                                            (6)
                                                E ∂V

                                                                      ∂E
Because under the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing framework ∂V        = Φ(δ1 ), the rela-
tionship between the volatility of the firm’s value and the volatility of its equity is given
by                                        ' (
                                           V
                                    σE =       Φ(δ1 )σV .                                 (7)
                                           E
    From an operational standpoint, the most critical inputs to the Merton DD-model are
clearly the market value of the equity E, the face value of the debt D, and the volatility
of equity σE . Assuming a forecasting horizon of one year (i.e., T = 1), we implement the
model in two steps: First, we estimate σE from historical daily stock returns using a 250-day
moving window. Second, we assume that the face value of the firm’s debt D is equal to
the sum of the firm’s current liabilities and one-half of its long-term liabilities.7 Using the
observed values of E, D, σE , and r (i.e., the daily 1-year constant-maturity Treasury yield),
equations (5) and (7) can be solved for V and σV using standard numerical techniques.
    As emphasized by Vassalou and Xing [2004], for example, the excessive volatility of mar-
ket leverage (V /E) in equation (7) causes large swings in the estimated volatility of the
firm’s value σV , which are difficult to reconcile with the observed frequency of defaults and
movements in financial asset prices. To resolve this problem, we implement an iterative
procedure proposed by Bharath and Shumway [2008]. The procedure involves the following
steps: First, we initialize the procedure by letting σV = σE [D/(E + D)]. We then use this
value of σV in equation (5) to infer the market value of the firm’s assets V for every day of
the 250-day moving window. In the second step, we calculate the implied daily log-return
   7
    This assumption for the “default point” is also used by Moody’s/KMV in the construction of their
Expected Default Frequencies (EDFs™), which are based on the DD-framework. The assumption captures
the notion that short-term debt requires a repayment of the principal relatively soon, whereas long-term
debt requires the firm to meet only the coupon payments. Both current and long-term liabilities are taken
from quarterly Compustat files and interpolated to daily frequency using a step function.

on assets (i.e., ∆ ln V ) and use the resulting series to generate new estimates of σV and µV .
We then iterate on σV until convergence.
   The resulting solutions of the Merton DD-model can be used to calculate the firm-specific
DD over the one-year horizon as

                                                 ln(V /D) + (µV − 0.5σV2 )

In this context, default occurs when the ratio of the value of assets to debt in equation (8)
falls below one (or its log is negative); in effect, distance-to-default measures the number of
standard deviations the log of this ratio must deviate from its mean for default to occur.
The implied probability of default is given by Φ(−DD), which, under the assumptions of the
model, should be a sufficient statistic for predicting defaults.
    Using this methodology, we compute the year-ahead DD for all U.S. nonfinancial corpo-
rations covered by the S&P’s Compustat and CRSP over our sample period. Figure 2 plots
the cross-sectional median and the interquartile range of the DD for the 1,112 bond issuers
in our sample. As a point of comparison, the figure also depicts the cross-sectional median

                                                                14
of the DD for the entire Compustat-CRSP matched sample (14,458 firms) of nonfinancial
firms.8 The median DD for both sets of firms is strongly procyclical, implying that equity
investors generally expect an increase in defaults during economic downturns. Indeed, during
the height of the recent financial crisis in the autumn of 2008, both measures fell to record
lows, a drop consistent with the jump in the GZ credit spread shown in Figure 1.


4.2      Credit Spreads and Default Risk
With our firm-specific measure of default risk in hand, we now turn to the estimation of the
credit-spread model given in equation (3). In our baseline specification, we regress ln Sit [k],
the logarithm of the credit spread on bond k (issued by firm i) in month t, on the distance-
to-default DDit , while also controlling for bond-specific characteristics that could influence
bond yields through either term or liquidity premiums. These pre-determined characteristics,
denoted by the vector Zit [k], include the bond’s duration (DURit [k]), the amount outstanding
(PARit [k]), the (fixed) coupon rate (CPNi [k]), the age of the issue (AGEit [k]), and an indicator
variable that equals one if the bond is callable and zero otherwise (CALLi [k]).
    The regression also includes industry (3-digit NAICS) fixed effects to control for any
systematic (time-invariant) differences in expected recovery rates across industries. Lastly,
the specification includes credit rating (S&P) fixed effects, which capture the “soft infor-
mation” regarding the firm’s financial health, information that is complementary to our
option-theoretic measures of default risk (e.g., Löffler [2004, 2007]).9
    According to Table 4, our market-based measure of default risk is statistically a highly
significant predictor of the log credit spreads. In economic terms, the estimated coefficient
on the distance-to-default implies that a decrease of one standard deviation in the year-
ahead DD leads to a widening of credit spreads of about 15 basis points. As evidenced
by the adjusted R2 , the baseline credit-spread model explains a considerable portion of the
variation in the log credit spreads.
    The distance-to-default should summarize all available information regarding the risk
of default, according to the Merton model, Consequently, movements in risk-free interest
rates should affect credit spreads only insofar as they change expected future cash flows
and, as a result, the distance-to-default. As shown by Duffee [1998], however, if the firm’s

     We eliminated from our sample all observations with the DD of less than −2 or more than 20, cutoffs
corresponding roughly to the 1st and 99th percentiles of the DD distribution, respectively.
   9
     We conducted sensitivity analysis by adding quadratic (and higher order) terms of the distance-to-
default to our baseline specification in order to allow for a nonlinear effect of leverage on credit spreads (e.g.,
Levin et al. [2004]). The inclusion of these terms, however, had virtually no effect on any of our results.

outstanding bonds are callable, then movements in the risk-free rates—by changing the value
of the embedded call option—will have an independent effect on bond prices, complicating
the interpretation of the behavior of credit spreads. In addition, callable bonds are likely to
be more sensitive to uncertainty regarding the future course of interest rates. On the other
hand, to the extent that callable bonds are, in effect, of shorter duration, they may be less
sensitive to changes in default risk.
    One possible way to deal with this issue would be to confine the analysis to a sub-sample
of noncallable bonds. However, as reported in Table 1, callable bonds account, on average, for
two-thirds of the senior unsecured corporate debt traded in the secondary market. Moreover,
given the variation in the share of callable debt over time, limiting the sample to noncallable
bonds would severely limit the time span of our data, making it impossible to shed much
light on the recent financial crisis.

    As an alternative, we control directly for the effects of the Treasury term structure
and interest rate volatility on the credit spreads of callable bonds when estimating the
excess bond premium. In addition to interacting the distance-to-default and the vector of
bond characteristics Zit [k] in equation (3) with the CALLi [k] indicator, the credit spreads of
callable bonds are also allowed to depend on the level, slope, and curvature of the Treasury
yield curve, the three factors that summarize the vast majority of the information in the
term structure, according to Litterman and Scheinkman [1991]; the credit spreads of callable
bonds can also be affected by the realized monthly volatility of the daily 10-year Treasury
yield, a proxy for interest rate uncertainty.10
    The results of this exercise are reported in the right panel of Table 4. As predicted by the
theory, an increase in the general level of interest rates and the steepening of the Treasury
term structure—the effects captured by the level and slope factors, respectively—lead to a
narrowing of the credit spreads of callable bonds. In contrast, an increase in the realized
volatility of longer-term Treasury yields boosts the spreads of callable bonds. Importantly,
the inclusion of the term structure and volatility factors noticeably improves the fit of the
credit-spread regression.
    In Table 5, we translate the coefficients from the estimated log-spread pricing equation
into the impact of variation in default risk, the shape of the term structure, and interest

     The level, slope, and curvature factors correspond, respectively, to the first three principal components
of nominal Treasury yields at 3-month, 6-month, 1-, 2-, 3-, 5-, 7-, 10-, 15-, and 30-year maturities. All yield
series are monthly (at month-end) and with the exception of the 3- and 6-month bill rates are derived from
the smoothed Treasury yield curve estimated by Gürkaynak et al. [2007].

rate volatility on the level of credit spreads. In line with the theoretical predictions, the
effect of default risk on the credit spreads of callable bonds is significantly attenuated by
the call-option mechanism, with a one standard deviation decline in the distance-to-default
implying an increase of 29 basis points in the spreads of noncallable bonds, compared with
a 13 basis points rise in the spreads of their callable counterparts.
    Consistent with the results of Duffee [1998], our estimates also imply that the shape of
the Treasury term structure and interest rate volatility have economically significant effects
on the credit spreads of callable bonds. For example, a one standard deviation increase in
the level factor implies a reduction in the credit spreads on callable bonds of almost 80 basis
points, while a one standard deviation increase in the slope factor lowers credit spreads on
such bonds 18 basis points. An increase in the volatility of long-term interest rates—by
boosting the value of embedded call options—implies a widening of callable credit spreads
of 27 basis points.

bonds has had relatively little effect. One exception is the 1979–82 period of nonborrowed
reserves targeting, a period characterized by a substantial volatility in nominal interest rates.
Given that most of the bonds in our sample during that period were callable, increased
interest rate volatility implies a higher fitted average spread, relative to the fitted value that
does not control for interest rate volatility; in addition, the excessive volatility of credit
spreads during this period implies more volatile fitted values.
    The option adjustment also had a significant effect during the recent financial crisis,
reflecting the fact that the general level of interest rates fell to historically low levels. Because
a low level of interest rates implies higher predicted values for the credit spreads of callable
bonds, our option-adjustment procedure accounts for about 200 basis points of the total
increase in the GZ credit spread during the height of the financial crisis in the autumn
of 2008. Overall, the fitted values from this specification capture a substantial fraction of
cyclical fluctuations in the GZ credit spread.
    Figure 4 shows the estimated excess bond premium—that is, the difference between the
GZ credit spread and the fitted value from the second specification in Table 4. With the
exception of the 1990–91 recession, the premium increased significantly prior to or during
all cyclical downturns. The excess bond premium fell to a historically low level in the latter
part of 2003 and remained low during the following several years, the period that, at least

                                                      19
in retrospect, has been characterized by lax credit standards, excessive credit growth, and
unsustainable asset price appreciation.
    The intensification of credit concerns in U.S. and foreign financial markets during the
summer of 2007 precipitated a sharp increase in the excess bond premium, which continued
to increase throughout the subsequent financial crisis, reaching a record high of 275 basis
points in October 2008. Although conditions in financial markets improved somewhat over
the remainder of 2008, investors’ concern in early 2009 about the viability of major financial
institutions led to another surge in the excess bond premium. Since then, this gauge of
financial disruptions has reversed all of its run-up, a pattern consistent with the improved
economic outlook and the easing of strains in financial markets.


5     The Excess Bond Premium and Economic Activity
Our decomposition of the GZ credit spread implies that an important component of the vari-
ation in corporate credit spreads is due to fluctuations in the excess bond premium. We now
examine whether movements in the excess bond premium provide independent information
about future economic activity. First, we analyze the extent to which the forecasting power
of the GZ credit spread documented in Section 3 is attributable to its predicted component
or the excess bond premium. We then add the excess bond premium to an otherwise stan-
dard macroeconomic VAR and examine the implications of innovations to the excess bond
premium for the real economy and asset prices.


5.1    Forecasting Results
Table 6 reports the results for the monthly indicators of economic activity, based on the
specification in which the two components of the GZ credit spread—S$GZ and EBP —are
allowed to enter the forecasting regression (2) separately. According to our estimates, both
the excess bond premium and the predicted GZ credit spread contain significant independent
explanatory power for all three economic indicators, at both the 3- and 12-month forecast
horizons. However, the (absolute) magnitude of the estimated coefficients on the excess
bond premium tends to be significantly larger than that of the coefficients associated with
the predicted GZ spread, a finding indicating that the information content of credit spreads
for economic activity largely reflects fluctuations in the non-default component of credit
spreads as opposed to movements in expected defaults.

    In Table 7, we repeat this forecasting exercise for the growth rate of real GDP and its
main components. To conserve space, we report the results for the 4-quarter forecast horizon
only. We do, however, perform an important robustness check by performing the analysis
for the 1985–2010 subsample, a period characterized by a stable monetary policy regime and
by significant deregulation of financial markets.11
    As indicated in the first column of the top panel of Table 7, the excess bond premium
is economically and statistically a highly significant predictor of output growth at the year-
ahead forecast horizon over the full sample period. The coefficient estimate implies that
an increase in the excess bond premium of 100 basis points in quarter t leads to a drop
in real GDP growth of more than 1.5 percentage points over the subsequent four quarters.
Consistent with our previous findings, the impact on economic growth of a similarly-sized
move in the predicted component of the GZ credit spread is considerably smaller—a 100 basis
point increase implies a deceleration in output of only 0.5 percentage points.
  11
    Formal statistical tests of the stability of the forecasting regression function do indicate a possible
structural break in the coefficients associated with financial indicators—most notably for the coefficient on
the real federal funds rate. Given the well-documented change in the monetary policy operating procedures
that took place during the late 1970s and the early 1980s, splitting the sample in 1985 thus provides a natural
point to examine the robustness of our results across different sample periods.

    The remaining columns in the top panel focus on the main categories of personal con-
sumption expenditures and private investment. The excess bond premium has substantial
predictive content for the growth of consumption spending on nondurables and services, the
major components of business fixed investment, as well as for inventory accumulation, an
especially volatile component of aggregate demand. With the exception of high–tech invest-
ment, the coefficients on the predicted component of the GZ spread are considerably smaller
(in absolute value) than the respective coefficients on the excess bond premium, again in-
dicating that movements in the excess bond premium have, in economic terms, a greater
impact on aggregate economic activity. In fact, for the most cyclically volatile series such
as inventory investment and spending on E&S and nonresidential structures, the economic
impact of the excess bond premium is more than twice as large as that of the predicted
component of the GZ credit spread.
    As shown in the bottom panel, the predictive content of the excess bond premium for
economic activity over the 1985–2010 period is, if anything, greater than that obtained
for the full sample period. The forecasting ability of the excess bond premium over the
latter subsample is especially striking in the case of real GDP growth. According to our
estimates, the predicted component of the GZ credit spread has no forecasting power for the
growth of real GDP since the mid-1980s, while the excess bond premium continues to provide
economically and statistically highly significant signals regarding economic growth prospects.
In general, the coefficients on the excess bond premium estimated over this subperiod are
noticeably higher (in absolute value) than those reported in the top panel. The estimates
based on the 1985–2010 period imply that a 100 basis points increase in the excess bond
premium in quarter t lowers output about 2.0 percentage points over the next four quarters.
    In summary, the above analysis indicates that the excess bond premium is a robust
predictor of economic activity. This finding holds true across a variety of economic indicators,
short- and longer-term forecast horizons, and sample periods. Furthermore, our forecasting
results imply that since the mid-1980s, most of the predictive content of the GZ credit spread
for economic activity can be attributed to variation in the excess bond premium rather than
to variation in default risk, as measured by its predicted component.


5.2    Macroeconomic Implications
In this section, we examine the macroeconomic consequences of shocks to the excess bond
premium. We do so by adding the excess bond premium to a standard VAR that includes
the following endogenous variables: (1) log-difference of real personal consumption expendi-

                                              23
tures (PCE); (2) log-difference of real business fixed investment (BFI); (3) log-difference of
real GDP; (4) inflation as measured by the log-difference of the GDP price deflator; (5) the
quarterly average of the excess bond premium; (6) the quarterly value-weighted excess stock
market return from CRSP; (7) the 10-year (nominal) Treasury yield; and (8) the effective
(nominal) federal funds rate. The identifying assumption implied by this recursive ordering
is that shocks to the excess bond premium affect economic activity and inflation with a
lag, while the risk-free rates and stock prices can react contemporaneously to such a finan-
cial disturbance; the VAR is estimated over the full sample period, using two lags of each
endogenous variable.
    Figure 5 depicts the impulse response functions of the endogenous variables to an or-
thogonalized shock to the excess bond premium. An unanticipated increase of one standard
deviation in the excess bond premium—about 20 basis points—causes a significant reduc-
tion in real economic activity, with consumption, investment, and output all falling over the
next several quarters. The macroeconomic consequences of this adverse financial shock are
substantial; the level of real GDP bottoms out about 0.5 percentage points below trend five
quarters after the shock, while the drop in investment is much more severe and persistent.
    The resulting economic slack leads to a substantial disinflation over time. In response to
these adverse economic developments, monetary policy is eased significantly, as evidenced
by the decline in the federal funds rate that commences about one quarter after the initial
impact of the shock. Despite the reduction in the overnight policy rate and the associated
decline in longer-term yields, the stock market experiences a significant drop, with cumulative
decline of about 7.0 percentage points relative to trend growth.
    Figure 6 shows the amount of variation in the endogenous variables explained by the
orthogonalized shocks to the excess bond premium. These innovations account for more
than 10 percent of the variation in output and 25 percent of the variation in business fixed
investment at business cycle frequencies, proportions that exceed the amount of variation
typically explained by monetary policy shocks. In addition, shocks to the excess bond
premium explain a significant portion of the variation in broad equity valuations.

Note: The figure depicts the forecast error variance decomposition from a 1 standard deviation
orthogonalized shock to the excess bond premium (see text for details). The forecast error variance
decomposition of consumption, investment, and output growth and that of the excess market return
is based on the level of the variables. Shaded bands denote 95-percent confidence intervals based on
2,000 bootstrap replications.

5.3    Interpretation
The macroeconomic dynamics reported above are consistent with the notion that the excess
bond premium provides a timely and useful gauge of credit supply conditions. A reduction
in the supply of credit—an increase in the excess bond premium—causes a drop in asset
prices and a contraction in economic activity through the financial accelerator mechanisms
emphasized by Bernanke and Gertler [1989], Kiyotaki and Moore [1997], Bernanke et al.
[1999], and Hall [2010]. Our findings also provide empirical support for the recent work of
Gertler and Kiyotaki [2009] and Gertler and Karadi [2010], who introduce macroeconomic
models in which shocks to the value of assets held by financial intermediaries—by reducing
the supply of credit—have independent effects on the real economy.
    Given the inherent asymmetric feature of debt contracts, our results could also reflect the
fact that prices of corporate bonds—compared with equity prices—are able to better capture
the downside risks to economic growth. Thus, fluctuations in the excess bond premium may
be due in part to a small but time-varying risk of economic “disasters.” As shown recently
by Gourio [2010], a small increase in the probability of such an extreme event can cause a
collapse in investment in a canonical real business cycle framework, vis-à-vis a sharp increase
in the risk premium that significantly boosts the cost of capital.
    To the extent that financial disturbances alter risk perceptions in financial markets,
changing risk attitudes of the marginal investors pricing corporate bonds may also influence
a broader supply of credit. By and large, the corporate bond market is dominated by institu-
tional investors such as large banks, insurance companies, and pension funds, intermediaries
that possess specialized knowledge about the corporate bond market and in many cases are
highly leveraged. These investors also face either explicit or implicit capital requirements,
and as their financial capital becomes impaired, they act in a more risk-averse manner. This
reduction in their effective risk-bearing capacity leads to an increase in the excess bond pre-
mium and a reduction in the supply of credit available to potential borrowers—both within
the corporate cash market and through other sources of external finance—resulting in the
type of asset market dynamics analyzed by He and Krishnamurthy [2010] and Adrian et al.
[2010a,b].
    Suggestive evidence supporting the link between the excess bond premium and risk at-
titudes and balance sheet conditions of financial intermediaries is provided in Figure 7.

       Note: Sample period: 1973:M1–2010:M9. The solid line in both panels depicts the estimated

survey of commercial banks and the other obtained from market prices—is strikingly high,
especially in the latter part of our sample.
    Panel (b) highlights the link between the excess bond premium and the profitability of
the U.S. financial corporate sector as measured by its return on assets (ROA). Note that
periods of elevated profitability are consistently associated with low levels of the excess bond
premium, while the declines in ROA are mirrored by sharp increases in the excess bond
premium. These comovements are consistent with the view that our proxy for the price
of default risk responds to changes in the risk attitudes of financial intermediaries, at least
as reflected in their willingness to make C&I loans and changes in the conditions of their
balance sheets.
    The 2007–09 financial crisis offers a unique opportunity to explore this hypothesis further.
Given that the origin of the crisis can undoubtedly be traced to the financial sector (e.g.,
Brunnermeier [2009] and Gorton [2009]), we collected market-based data on the health of the
financial sector, namely, the credit default swaps and equity valuations of primary dealers,
major banks and securities broker-dealers that trade in U.S. Government securities with the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York. By buying and selling an array of securities for a fee
and holding an inventory of securities for resale, these highly leveraged financial intermedi-
aries play a key role in most financial markets. As documented by Adrian and Shin [2010],
broker-dealers differ from other types of institutional investors by their active pro-cyclical
management of leverage: Expansions in broker-dealer assets are associated with increases
in leverage as broker-dealers take advantage of greater balance sheet capacity; conversely,
contractions in their asset holdings are associated with the de-leveraging of their balance
sheets.
    The solid line in Figure 8 depicts the excess bond premium, while the overlayed dotted
line represents the average 1-year CDS spread for these institutions. The striking degree of
comovement between the two series over the period shown again supports the interpretation
that the excess bond premium fluctuates closely in response to movements in capital and
balance sheet conditions of key financial intermediaries.13 Indeed, the collapse of Lehman
Brothers on September 15, 2008—a watershed event in the recent crisis—provides a dramatic
participate in each survey. Banks are asked to report whether they have changed their credit standards
over the past three months on the major categories of loans to businesses and households. The series
plotted is the net percentage of banks that reported tightening their credit standards on C&I loans to large
and middle-market firms. Reported net percent equals the percent of banks that reported tightening their
standards minus the percent that reported easing their standards. For the full text of the questions and
more information on the survey, see http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/SnLoanSurvey/.

     Prior to 2003, only a small subset of broker-dealers had CDS contracts traded in the market.

example of how disruptions in the effective risk-bearing capacity of the financial sector can
influence the supply of credit.
    To analyze more formally how shocks to the profitability of financial intermediaries affect
our gauge of credit supply conditions, we estimate a VAR, consisting of the option-implied
volatility on the S&P 500 (VIX), the (value-weighted) excess market return, the (value-
weighted) excess portfolio return of broker-dealers, the average 1- and 5-year broker-dealer
CDS spreads, and the excess bond premium. By including both the 1- and 5-year CDS
spreads, we allow such financial shocks to affect the market assessment of near- and longer-
term default risk for these institutions. The VAR, using three lags of each endogenous
variable, is estimated over the 2003:M1–2010:M9 period and also includes a dummy variable
for September 2008.14
    Within this multivariate framework, we trace out the impact of an orthogonalized shock
to the excess return of broker-dealers, an innovation that, according to our identification
scheme, is uncorrelated with contemporaneous movements in the broad stock market and
stock market volatility. The impulse responses shown in Figure 9 indicate that such an
adverse shock to the profitability of these key financial intermediaries leads to an immediate

    Standard regression diagnostics revealed that this observation exerted an unduly large influence on the
estimated coefficients.

rise in their near- and longer-term CDS spreads. Moreover, CDS spreads continue to widen
for about three months after the initial impact, and they return only very gradually to
their steady-state values. This persistent deterioration in investor assessment of the broker-
dealers’ creditworthiness is manifested by a sustained increase in the excess bond premium,
the response of which is very close to that of the 1-year CDS spread, likely the most accurate
market-based indicator of near-term default risk in the financial sector.
    Taken together, the evidence presented above is consistent with the view that systematic
deviations in the pricing of corporate bonds relative to the expected default risk of the
underlying issuer reflect shifts in the effective risk aversion of the financial sector. Increases
in risk aversion lead to a decline in asset prices and a contraction in the supply of credit,
both through the corporate bond market and the broader commercial banking sector, factors

that contribute significantly to a resulting slowdown in economic activity.


6     Conclusion
This paper examined the role that credit spreads play in determining macroeconomic out-
comes. We did so by constructing a new corporate bond credit spread index—the GZ credit
spread—employing an extensive micro-level data set of secondary market prices of outstand-
ing senior unsecured bonds issued by a large panel of U.S. nonfinancial corporation. Com-
pared with the widely-used default-risk indicators, the GZ credit spread was shown to be a
robust predictor of future economic activity across a variety of economic indicator, short-
and longer-term forecast horizons, and sample periods.
    Using a flexible empirical framework, we then decomposed the GZ credit spread into
two parts: a component reflecting the available firm-specific information on default risk
and a residual component—the excess bond premium—that we argued plausibly represents
variation in the pricing of default risk, rather than in the risk of default. According to our
results, most of the predictive power of the GZ credit spread is accounted for by movements
in the excess bond premium—indeed, over the 1985–2010 period, the excess bond premium
accounts for all of the predictive content of the GZ credit spread for output growth.
    Innovations to the excess bond premium that are orthogonal to the current state of the
economy were shown to cause substantial and protracted contractions in economic activity,
an appreciable disinflation, a decline in both short and long-term risk-free rates, and a fall in
the broad stock market. In turn, these shocks to the excess bond premium were linked to the
deterioration in the profitability and creditworthiness of broker-dealers, marginal investors
in the corporate debt market. All told, our findings are consistent with the notion that an
increase in the excess bond premium reflects a reduction in the effective risk-bearing capacity
of the financial sector and, as a result, a contraction in the supply of credit with significant
adverse consequences for the macroeconomy.
