Hysteresis from Employer Subsidies

                                         ABSTRACT

This paper uses administrative data to analyze a large and 8-year long employer payroll tax rate
cut in Sweden for young workers aged 26 or less. First, we document that while active, the
reform raised youth employment among the treated workers. The long-run effects are twice as
large as the medium-run effects and likely driven by labor demand (as workers' take-home wages
did not respond). Second, we document novel labor-demand-driven "hysteresis" from this policy
­ i.e. persistent employment effects even after the subsidy no longer applies ­ along two
dimensions. Over the lifecycle, employment effects persist even after workers age out of
eligibility. Two years after the repeal, employment remains elevated at the maximal reform level
in the formerly subsidized ages. These hysteresis effects triple the direct employment effects of
the reform. Discrimination against young workers in job posting fell during the reform and does
not bounce back after repeal, potentially explaining our results.

Governments use an array of active labor market policies, in particular subsidies, to improve
employment of disadvantaged groups. Oftentimes, the policies are presented as a one-time push
to lift individuals onto better employment trajectories. Yet, evidence for active labor market
policies to entail such persistent effects on employment is scarce. This elusive policy persistence
is puzzling in light of the large body of evidence for employment hysteresis -- i.e. persistent
employment shifts even after the original cause has disappeared (Blanchard and Summers 1986)
-- from non-policy labor market shocks such as job loss (Davis and Von Wachter, 2011), recession
shocks (Blanchard and Katz 1992, Yagan, 2019), trade shocks (Autor et al. 2014), or graduating
in a bad economy (Kahn 2010 and Oreopoulos, Von Wachter, and Heisz 2012).
       Our paper breaks new ground by investigating whether employment subsidies can deliver
employment hysteresis. To do so, we study a large and long-lasting employer-borne payroll tax
cut for young workers aged 26 or less in Sweden that started in 2007 but was then suddenly
repealed in 2015. This setting is uniquely suited for a comprehensive and credibly identified
test for hysteresis from labor demand policies in three ways. First, it features sharp age cutoffs
of eligibility, permitting us to study lifecycle hysteresis, i.e. whether previously treated workers'
employment biographies are affected after they have aged out of the subsidy. Second, the
abolition of the subsidy after having been in place for multiple years, long enough to have
treated cohorts over their entire initial careers, allows us to additionally measure persistent
aggregate hysteresis effects on Swedish youth overall. Third, as we show in the data, the tax
differential by age translates fully into a labor cost differential with no differential in net wages.
Specifically, the labor cost of young workers (relative to slightly older workers) fell by 12%
during the tax cut and then went up correspondingly by 14% when the tax cut was repealed
(or workers age out), allowing us to study employment effects, the focus of this paper.
       Our first empirical finding is that during the years the tax cut was in place, it caused
large and growing employment effects on the directly treated youth aged 26 and below. The
estimated employment effects are around 2 points three to five years into the reform ­ consistent
with previous work studying the early years of the subsidy.1 Strikingly, these effects double, to
4­5 points, by the sixth and seventh year into the reform. This multi-year build-up of the
treatment effect can be driven either by a slow adjustment in labor demand, such as under
gradual accumulation of youth-specific capital, employer learning, or erosion of labor market
discrimination against the young. It also suggests the possibility of hysteresis-like effects.
   1
    Earlier work had found significant but modest positive effects on youth employment rates (and no net-wage
incidence) in the early years of the reform, Skedinger (2014), Egebark and Kaunitz (2013, 2018), and Saez,
Schoefer, and Seim (2019). These studies have investigated neither the later years of the reform nor its repeal.



                                                       1
   Next, we turn to a sharp test to cleanly isolate hysteresis effects, studying the evolution
of employment as workers age out of the policy, as well as after the repeal of the reform.
We document substantial employment hysteresis on both margins in response to the employer
subsidies.
   We start with lifecycle hysteresis. Here, several years into the reform, we find clear positive
and growing hysteresis employment effects emerging among slightly younger ages, i.e. among
young workers previously exposed to the tax cut after they age out and hence their wages are no
longer subsidized. The multi-year lead-up required to see these effects explains why they were
missed by the existing short-run analyses (and perhaps may never have emerged in shorter-run
policies). The lifecycle hysteresis suggests that the positive youth employment gains caused by
the reform have consequences for the subsequent careers of initially directly treated workers.
   Finally, we turn to aggregate hysteresis in the time series, studying the aftermath of the
repeal in 2015. Strikingly, despite the associated large increase in youth labor costs, in the
first two years after the repeal for which we have data, we do not see any reduction in youth
employment. We view this as simple and compelling evidence for market-level hysteresis effects
due to the clean and sharp difference-in-difference nature of our quasi-experimental policy vari-
ation and its sharp deactivation at repeal, compared to, e.g., trade shocks or recessions. (In
these cases, the path of the driving force is not directly observed, so rather than exclusively
hysteresis, persistent employment effects may simply reflect direct contemporaneous responses
to a gradually decaying original driving force.) In our case, the persistent youth employment
effects could be explained by the time it takes for employers to factor in the repeal into their
personnel decisions. Alternatively, it could reflect a persistent change in hiring decisions and
organization. For example, firms might have developed youth labor intensive technologies that
cannot be reversed quickly.
   It is also conceivable that the payroll tax cut reduced discrimination against the young in
hiring decisions, and that such discrimination does not come back after the repeal. Consistent
with this explanation, we find a sharp decrease in the fraction of job postings with minimum
age requirements after the reform starts with no bounce back after the reform ends (in contrast,
job postings with gender requirements stay flat). These patterns echo evidence in the anti-
discrimination literature that affirmative action policies can have long-term effects on minority
employment even after the policies end. For example, Miller and Segal (2012) study affirmative
action quotas imposed by federal courts in the 1970s for municipal police in the US and find that
gains in the black workforce share due to the quotas do not erode after the policy ends. Even
more striking, Miller (2017) studies federal affirmative action regulation of private employers,

                                                2
and finds that the black workforce share continues to grow even after private employers are no
longer regulated. He argues that this persistence is driven by permanent changes in screening
methods for potential hires.
    Future years after the repeal will show whether the youth employment gains start to disap-
pear. One implication of our three employment findings combined is that overall employment
effects of the reform are much larger (and fiscally cheaper) than the effects initially estimated
by previous work on the early years of the reform and excluding hysteresis (Skedinger 2014,
Egebark and Kaunitz 2013, 2018, and Saez, Schoefer, Seim 2019).
    Our paper is connected to other literatures on hysteresis effects. First, there is a large
literature that studies policies targeting disadvantaged areas (see Kline and Moretti 2014 for a
recent survey). For example, the Tennessee Valley Authority program to develop the US South
during the Great Depression recently analyzed by Kline and Moretti (2013) had permanent
effects on economic development. More recent policies, such as the US empowerment zones seem
to have more modest effects (see e.g., Busso, Gregory, and Kline 2013). Second, World War II
was a huge labor demand shock for American women. While female labor force participation
fell back shortly after the war (Goldin 1991), geographical variation shows that there was some
long-run persistence (Acemoglu, Autor, Lyle 2004 and Goldin and Olivetti 2013). Third, a
number of studies in behavioral economics have shown persistent effects of temporary policies
on various individual behaviors such as energy use (Allcott and Rogers 2014), exercise (Charness
and Gneezy 2009), smoking (Gin´
                              e, Karlan, and Zinman 2010), and voting (Fujiwara, Meng, and
Vogl 2016).


I     Institutional Setting and Data
I.A       Payroll Tax Cut for Young Workers in Sweden
Swedish payroll tax. In Sweden, the entirety of the payroll tax on earnings is nominally
paid by employers and the tax is proportional to wage earnings with no exemption and no cap.
The payroll tax rate is uniform across industrial sectors and covers all employers public and
private. The top series in the solid line in Figure 1a depicts the normal payroll tax rate from
2004 to 2019. The normal tax rate has been quite stable at around 31-32 percent over this
period.


Young workers' payroll tax cuts. The second series in the dashed line in Figure 1a depicts
the preferential payroll tax rate for young workers. In 2007-9, a new center-right coalition


                                               3
government implemented a payroll tax cut targeted toward young workers. The explicit aim
of this reform was to fight youth unemployment, which had risen in previous years, and was
perceived to be excessively high. It was enacted as a permanent tax change (with no change
in benefits). By January 1st, 2009, the payroll tax rate was 15.49 percent (less than half the
normal rate of 31.4%) for all workers turning 26 or less during the calendar year. To be precise,
in 2009, the payroll tax cut applied to all workers born in 1983 or later on the totality of their
2009 earnings; in 2010, the payroll tax cut applied to all workers born in 1984 or later, etc.
Hence, a worker's only determinant of eligibility for a full calendar year is year of birth (and
not actual age when the earnings are received). Correspondingly, in our analysis, age is always
defined as year of observation minus birth year (regardless of birthday date within the year).
The tax cut is directly administered through the payroll tax software used by employers where
individual earnings and year of birth are reported on a monthly basis by employers. Therefore,
take-up is close to 100 percent.


Repeal in 2015-16. The left-wing opposition parties were against this payroll tax cut from
the start. They lost the 2010 election but narrowly won the 2014 election on September 14.
Therefore, in 2015, the new center-left government abolished the payroll tax cut for young
workers. The lower payroll tax rate for the young expired in steps in 2015-6 as depicted and
explained in Figure 1a. The bill was passed on March 25, 2015 following a proposal put forward
on October 7, 2014, just after the election. On August 1, 2015, all workers turning 25 and less in
2015 had their taxes increased to 25.46 percent (63% of the tax rate gap was closed). On June
1, 2016, the normal payroll tax rate was restored for all workers. The payroll tax cut lasted 9
years, and 6.5 years in its strongest form.

I.B    Administrative Data from Statistics Sweden
Our analysis is based on the full population of all Swedish residents (as of December 31 each
year) aged 16 and above for years 1990-2017. To study employment, we obtain annual earnings
and employment spells from matched employer-employee records covering 1985-2017. For each
spell, these data record annual wage payments and months worked (used to administer the
social security and income tax systems). Additionally, from the Income Tax Register, we re-
trieve total wage earnings. From the Integrated Database for Labour Market Research (various
administrative records compiled by Statistics Sweden), we obtain the unemployment history
(days registered with the unemployment insurance agency and benefits receipts), gender, year
and month of birth.

                                                4
       To study wages, we also link to this baseline population a matched employer-employee annual
data set: the Structure of Earnings Survey, which covers worker-level wages, occupational codes
and hours of work, for a very large sample of firms. The data set covers all industrial sectors,
and specifically all public sector employees and around 50 percent of private sector workers.2
The information is collected during a measurement week (in September-November, hence the
2016 data covers post-abolition wages) for all workers employed for at least one hour during that
week. The wage concept is the full-time equivalent monthly wage prevailing in the given month,
including all fixed wage components, piece-rate and performance pay and fringe benefits. Our
wage concept is defined as the full-time equivalent contracted monthly wage. We also adjust
wages for inflation (CPI base-year 2018) and convert to US dollars using an exchange rate of 9.8
SEK/USD (as of 9/30/2019). We use this wage concept to study the incidence of the payroll
tax cut on market wages in Section II.A.


II        Empirical Analysis: Direct Employment Effects, and
          Hysteresis
We first analyze the effects of the payroll tax reform on cohort-specific wages to determine the
incidence of the payroll tax, and then move to employment effects and its dynamics.

II.A        Wage Incidence: Effects on Net and Gross Wages
Figure 2 depicts the average monthly wage in Sweden by age for different time periods for all
employees in the Structure of Earnings Survey data. The top panel depicts net wages defined as
monthly wage earnings net of payroll taxes. The bottom panel depicts gross wages defined as
monthly wage earnings gross of payroll taxes, i.e. the labor costs the employer pays including
payroll taxes. Age is defined as the age reached during the calendar year (the relevant concept
for the payroll tax cut). 2003-2006 are pre-tax cut years (red square series). 2007-2015 are tax
cut years (blue circle series). 2016-2017 are post-repeal years (green triangle series). The reform
applies to ages up to 26 in 2009-2014 and up to age 25 in 2007-8 and 2015 (as depicted by the
two dashed vertical lines, see Figure 1 for details). The size of the tax cut is less in 2007-8 and
2015 as the tax cut is phased-in and phased-out.
       The top panel shows that net wages are continuous at the age thresholds, and the bottom
panel shows that gross wages are discontinuous. In the bottom panel, the discontinuity happens
   2
    The sample is a stratified random sample of firms, with larger weights on larger firms. All firms with more
than 500 employees are included. Our wage results are robust to reweighting the wage sample to match the
industry- and the firm-size distribution of the total population of employees.

                                                      5
at age 25 to 26 in years 2007-2008 and 2015 when the tax cut did not cover workers aged 26.
In years, 2009-2014, when the reform applied to workers aged 26 as well, the discontinuity in
gross wages is between ages 26 and 27. As a result, the labor cost of young workers went down
by about 12% during the tax cut and then went up correspondingly by 14% when the tax cut
was repealed. (The tax rate for young workers is 15.49 percent while the normal rate is 31.42
percent, hence a reduction of labor costs of (31.42-15.49)/(100+31.42) = 12.1%.)
      This implies that employers do not adjust wages by age in response to the payroll tax cut
and its subsequent repeal, and therefore absorb fully the tax discontinuity created by the age
and time specific payroll tax reform.3 This is consistent with earlier analyses of the payroll tax
introduction, which found no or very little effect on net wages (Skedinger 2014, Egebark and
Kaunitz 2013, 2018, Saez, Schoefer, and Seim 2019). These analyses however did not study the
longer-run nor the post-repeal period. This complete absence of incidence on net wages also
goes against the standard view in public economics that employer payroll taxes are borne by
employees. Our results imply that the tax changes translate fully into changes in the labor costs
of young workers relative to slightly older untreated workers, permitting us to study employment
effects of the reform-induced cost reduction of youth labor next.

II.B       Effects on Employment: During and After the Subsidy
Our wage results imply that an employer would save 12% of labor costs by replacing an ineligible
older worker (say, aged slightly above 26) by an eligible young worker (aged 26 or less), given
the lack of net wage incidence. In Sweden, CVs typically include age and job applications often
include social security IDs that reveal birth dates. Hence employers can generally observe age
before hiring. As these two groups of workers should be close substitutes, profit maximizing firms
should want to hire more eligible workers or put more effort in retaining eligible workers (relative
to ineligible workers). Indeed, this labor demand increase triggers the wage pressure that
eventually equalizes gross wages across treated subsidized and control groups in the standard
competitive model.


Methodology. To analyze such employment effects, we examine the employment rate in the
labor force by age group and over time using the individual annual earnings data (see Section I
for details). The employment rate is defined as the ratio of employment to the labor force. The
  3
    Perhaps wages do not appear to respond in ongoing jobs due to wage rigidity or implicit contracts. To
test this, we repeat Figure 2 but limiting the sample to new hires in Appendix Figure A1, and even for this
subsample, we do not see any discontinuity in net wages either when the reform is put in place or when it is
repealed.


                                                     6
employment numerator is defined as all employed residents with annual wage earnings above a
small annual threshold. The small annual threshold is equal to $4,490 in 2012 (in 2019 USD)
(and adjusted for median wage growth in other years).4 The labor force denominator is defined
as all residents who are either (i) employed with annual wage earnings above the small annual
threshold or (ii) unemployed (defined as having registered with the Unemployment Office at
any point during the year).
       Figure 3a depicts the unadjusted employment rate by age and time periods. Series in red
squares are before the payroll tax cut is in place. Series in blue circles are when the reform is
in place in three periods 2010-11, 2012-13, 2014-15 with growing circle sizes over time.5 Series
in green triangles are after the repeal i.e. 2016-17 ­ and this post-repeal period serves as our
additional time series for a DiD strategy to test persistence and aggregate hysteresis effects in
all age groups.
       Figure 3b presents an adjusted difference-in-difference version of these results, by measuring
employment rates by age and single years relative to 2006, which controls for the business cycle
overall employment effects. The normalization is made by aligning the unemployment rate (one
minus the employment rate) for ages 35-40 to the 2006 level for each year (multiplicatively) and
then taking the difference in employment rates with 2006.6 That adjusted series can therefore
be read as the deviation of employment rates by age and year (relative to 2006) expressed in
points of employment and controlling for the overall level of unemployment across years. The
35-40 workers hence serve as our "far-away" control group never directly affected by the reform
that permits us to investigate spillovers onto the "nearby" control group (workers aged 27 and
above), as would arise from lifecycle hysteresis effects.7 (Because employment rates in the top
panel for ages 35-40 are very close in all periods (within 1 percentage point), results are robust
to the normalization choice.)

We have three sets of results on the dynamics of the employment effects of the payroll tax cut
and the aftermath of the repeal.
   4
     This earnings threshold is a social security benchmark against which benefits are indexed, and corresponds
approximately to working at 20 percent of full-time a full year at the minimum wage in the restaurant sector.
   5
     We exclude 2007-8 when the reform was not yet fully phased-in and 2009 the first year when the reform was
phased-in (as 2009 was a recession year making it less comparable to other years).
   6
     Formally, if eat is the employment rate at age a in year t, and uat = 1-eat is the unemployment rate in year
t at age a, the normalized unemployment rates are u     ^at = uat ·(u35-40,2006 /u35-40,t ) and hence the normalized
employment rates are e     ^at = 1-u  ^at = 1-(1-eat )·(u35-40,2006 /u35-40,t ). We plot the series: e ^at -e
                                                                                                            ^a,2006 =
(eat -ea,2006 )·(u35-40,2006 /u35-40,t ).
   7
     The only exception are workers aged 35 in 2017, the latest year we observe, which were treated for half a
year, when the reform started in July 2007.



                                                         7
Long- vs. medium-run effects while the reform is active. First, the data reveal a clear
increase in youth employment rates from pre-reform periods (2003-4 and 2005-6) to early years
of the reform (2010-11 and 2012-13) as documented in Saez, Schoefer, and Seim (2019). In
these early years, the employment effects are concentrated at ages 22 to 24 with smaller effects
for workers close to the age threshold (25 and especially 26 year old). It is possible that effects
are smaller for the oldest treated workers because employers understand that such workers will
age out of the reform quickly (recall that employers can observe age on job applicants' CVs
or applications in most cases, and otherwise infer it from their education biography). Effects
are also smaller for very young workers (aged 20 or 21), perhaps because such workers are
very young relative to other employees making it more challenging for employers to find them,
evaluate them, and incorporate them into their workforce.
   Interestingly however, in 2014-2015, there is a clear further increase in youth employment
while the employment rates of older workers aged 30-40 remain stable. Therefore, the effect
of the reform appears much stronger in 2014-2015 than in earlier years. By year 2015, the
employment effect is about three times as large as in 2010. In fact, as the reform matures, the
employment effects both deepen and widen: the effects are larger at all ages but especially the
very young. It is striking to see how monotonically the age gradients line up across years.


Lifecycle hysteresis and spillovers on control ages. Second, workers slightly older than
26 and hence no longer eligible for the tax cut appear to have a higher employment rate in 2014-
2015 than in earlier years. These workers were exposed to the reform, suggesting that exposure
to the reform has hysteresis effects on employment (or that spillover effects on the group level
may take longer to materialize). Both panels show clearly that the effect of the reform spills over
gradually across slightly older groups. The spillover is almost perfectly monotonic, providing
compelling evidence that it is reform-driven.


Post-repeal hysteresis for all young workers. Third and perhaps most striking, the em-
ployment effects of the young if anything keep increasing in 2016 and 2017 ­ after the tax cut is
repealed. This suggests that the positive employment effects of the reform do not vanish after
the payroll tax cut ends ­ a clear indication of hysteresis effect at this group level. Future years
will show whether the youth employment gains start to disappear as more years elapse after the
repeal.
   Moreover, the lifecycle hysteresis, or spillover, effects also continue after the reform, mirroring
the reform-period shape (even appearing to be further increasing). This is particular clear in


                                                  8
the normalized bottom panel, where we disaggregate by individual years.


Placebo test: 2004-5. Finally, the bottom panel includes two pre-reform years 2004 and
2005, which can serve as a placebo test (recall that the bottom panel is normalized relative to
2006). For these years, we do not detect any employment effects at any age, nor any pre-trend
upward in youth employment rates (if anything the reverse), further lending credence to our
identification assumption.


Regression evidence. Table 1A provides the corresponding estimates using a basic difference-
in-differences regression based solely on the aggregate unadjusted cohort-year time series as
depicted in Figure 3a. We use data at the year×age level with 21 age categories a (20 to 40),
and 12 years t (2003 to 2017, excluding 2007-2009 when the reform was partially phased-in and
also the global recession year), yielding a total of 12 × 21 = 252 year×age level observations.
To estimate treatment effects and spillovers, we also create 6 coarser age groups denoted by
A, comprising directly treated ages 20-26, and various spillover groups namely 27-28, 29-30,
31-32, and 33-34, and finally our baseline control age group 35-40. Following Figure 3, we also
group years into 5 periods denoted by T , comprising 2003-4 (pre-period), 2005-6 (base period
against which effects are estimated), 2010-3 (medium run i.e. combining the two nearly identi-
cal gradients in Figure 3a), 2014-5 (long run), 2016-7 (post-repeal). We run the following basic
difference-in-differences regression at the year×age level:

                                 eat = 0 + a + t + AT + at .                                   (1)

The regression includes the set of treatment age fixed effects a , and year fixed effects t . The
coefficients of interest are the interaction effects AT =     T   A   AT · 1(a  A  t  T ), and are
reported in the table for each T and A (interactions exclude the 2005-6 baseline control period).
These coefficients correspond to the average of the employment rates by age group and (now
grouped) periods depicted in Figure 3b (except that the figure separates out 2005 and that we
run the regression on unadjusted gradients reported in Figure 3a). Robust standard errors are
reported.
   The table confirms and quantifies the visual impression in Figure 3b. In 2010-13, the medium
run, the effect on employment for the treated young (20-26) is 2.3 points. In 2014-15, the longer
run, this effect jumps to 4.4. This shows that the effect doubles from the early years to the late
years of the reform. In 2016-17, after the repeal, the effect increases further to 6.0 points. The
effect for ages 27-28 is small and insignificant in the early years 2010-13 but becomes significant

                                                9
for years 2014-15 (1.3 point effect) and even larger after the repeal (2.2 points). At ages 29-30,
we find a significant effect of 1.0 point after the repeal (recall that these workers were exposed
to the tax cut when they were younger). The placebo years 2003-4 do not show any effect either
for the treatment group or for the other ages, supporting the validity of our research design.


Heterogeneity. Figure 4 explores heterogeneity by gender (top panels) and by local youth
unemployment rate (as of 2006). The methodology is otherwise the same as in Figure 3, bottom
panel (raw employment rates are presented in Appendix Figure A2). The y-axis scales are the
same for comparison.

Gender. The top panels show the employment rate effects by age and year relative to 2006 for
females (left) and for males (right). The figure shows a similar effect of the reform by gender
in early years (2010-11, 12-13), but the effect on young female workers grows much more in
subsequent years and remains much higher for females after the tax cut is repealed (although
hysteresis effects are present for both genders).

Local youth unemployment rate. The bottom panels show the employment rates by age and year
relative to 2006, separately for regions in the top quintile of their 2006 youth unemployment
(left) and for bottom quintile regions (right). In 2006, just before the reform, there was wide
variation across Sweden's 21 regions in youth unemployment. Regions in the bottom quintile
had rates in the range of 10.5-12.4% compared to 20-23.3%, i.e. about twice as high, in regions
in the top quintile.
   The figure reveals a much larger effect of the payroll tax cut in high youth unemployment
regions, already in the medium run. Strikingly, in the longer run, the acceleration of the
treatment effect the national analysis indicated is particularly pronounced in the high youth
unemployment regions (an effect not driven by mean reversion as the flat pre-period gradients
indicate). In neither group do the gains immediately disappear as workers age out of the
policy, since employment effects appear among the older ineligible workers, particularly so in
the later years of the policy. Most strikingly however, in the high youth unemployment regions
the additional gains in employment are not more quickly undone, but the larger treatment
effect persists even after the subsidies are abolished. As a result, even two years after the
policy was repealed, the regions maintain the substantial gains towards convergence in youth
unemployment, as illustrated in Appendix Figure A2, which plots the unadjusted employment
rate levels.

III     Implications of Hysteresis for Policy Effectiveness
We now present a quantitative assessment of how the hysteresis-like employment dynamics we
have uncovered affect the policy evaluation of the reform.


Jobs created. First, in Table 1B, we calculate the count of job creation from the policy,
separating the contributions of the direct effects and the hysteresis effects. Table 1B is organized
as our regression Table 1A, with rows denoting periods and columns denoting age groups. The
job-years are defined as 1 more employed person in a given year (i.e. with annual earnings
above the aforementioned threshold). These effects are computed as the product of the age-
year-specific treatment effect from Table 1A, multiplied by the age group's pre-period (2006)
labor force count (detailed in the table note). The additional last entry of each row and column
additionally includes a total count for a given age group or period as well as the share of that
entry contributing to total job creation (itself reported in the bottom right corner).
   Out of the total 179,581 job-years created (bottom right entry), nearly 95% were created
among the directly treated 20-26 olds. The dynamics of job creation reveal, first, that 30% of
these jobs were created in the final two years of the policy (2014-5), as many as within the
four-year medium run period.
   Second and perhaps most strikingly, two fifths of these jobs among ages 20-26 were created
after the repeal of the policy (2016-17), hence from hysteresis effects. Across all age groups,
these two post-repeal years account for 79,239 (44.1%) of all jobs created .
   Lifecycle hysteresis effects are strongest among the 27-28 year olds, accounting for 13,831
jobs. Spillover effects on the even older groups are smaller while the policy is active, but
strikingly start showing up even among the 29-30 year olds after the repeal.


Payroll tax costs per job created. Second, we provide simple evaluation of a widely used
policy number, namely fiscal costs per job created, here in terms of payroll tax revenue foregone,
but excluding revenue gains from the larger tax base. Our comprehensive analysis dramatically
raises this jobs per dollar measure not just because overall job creation is larger (as reported in
Table 1B), thereby raising the numerator ­ but additionally because any additional jobs from
hysteresis come for free as they are no longer actually subsidized ­ i.e. they do not enter in the
denominator (the fiscal cost).
   We calculate the baseline (2006) payroll tax base for ages 20-26 (labor income) and multiply
it with the payroll tax subsidy rate (15.9ppt, namely the gap between the regular and lowest


                                                11
tax rate, 31.4% vs. 15.4%), yielding lost payroll tax revenue of $1,496,753,536 (in 2019 USD)
per year. Dividing by the age 20-6, medium-run job creation (per year), the per-job year cost
was $113,943 during the medium run. In the longer-run period 2014-15 considered on its own,
the per-job cost among the 20-26 year old drops by nearly half, to $60,648. Our full analysis
of all policy years plus the "free" post-repeal hysteresis effects, implies an average per-job cost
among ages 20-26 of $70,494 even when including the four expensive medium-run years. When
we furthermore include the spillover treatment effects the slighter older workers exhibit, the
comprehensive measure implies another slight reduction in costs to $66,678 ­ This is a reduction
by 41% compared to the $113,943 effectiveness measures if drawing from narrower treatment
effect estimates restricted to the initial reform years such as in Saez, Schoefer, Seim (2019).


IV      Hysteresis Mechanism: The End of Youth Discrimi-
        nation?
We conclude with a discussion of the mechanisms that may drive the hysteresis in youth em-
ployment. The employment response we have uncovered is likely due to labor demand effects
rather than labor supply effects because the net wage of eligible young workers does not increase
(Section II.A), and hence labor costs were lowered one to one (and in light of the high youth
unemployment). Sluggish adjustment from attention to the tax reversal may explain the find-
ings. Alternatively, it could reflect a persistent or even permanent changes in labor demand, for
example if firms switched to youth intensive technologies that cannot be reversed quickly.
   Conceivably, the payroll tax cut also removed discrimination against the young in hiring
(such as posting job ads requiring prior years of experience or some minimum age), and such
discrimination did not come back after the tax cut repeal as employers had learned about
employing young workers more effectively and perhaps revised beliefs about their productivity.
   We investigate this potential mechanism using job vacancy postings from the Swedish Pub-
lic Employment Service (PES). Employers post vacancies free of charge on the PES platform
("Platsbanken"), which covers a large share of all posted vacancies in Sweden, around 30-50%
between 2006-2013 (Arbetsf¨
                          ormedlingen 2014). Any job seeker can register with the portal at
no cost, and UI recipients must enroll. The open-source data span 2006-17, and cover 4.9 million
job ads corresponding to around 9 million jobs (due to multi-job listings). The listings include
the job description and desired characteristics of the hire.
   Using text search for discriminatory key phrases, we classify these listings by whether they
discriminate against youth (our focus) and also by gender (a control demographic dimension).


                                                12
The main step was two external researchers manually reviewing and classifying a random sample
of 3,000 ads for discriminatory phrases; we then classify the universe of vacancies using text
search following these phrases, by youth and by gender phrases. Anti-youth discrimination
manifests itself largely as a minimum age cutoff in the description. Appendix A and Appendix
Figure A3 report the full list of the age and gender phrases, and their time series.
       Figure 1b shows the time series of this share of anti-youth phrases in job listings (solid
blue lines with circles). Since the data start in 2006, we are unable to test a parallel pre-trend
assumption. But the time series of youth discrimination starts off high in the pre-reform years
in 2006 and 2007, reaches its peak in 2007 (the year the reform starts getting phased-in), and
then steadily declines steadily over time, contining to fall and reaching its the lowest levels in
the post-repeal years, consistent with our hysteresis effects.
       As a control time series, Figure 1b also plots the share of listings containing phrases of
gender discrimination (dashed red line with squares). This control time series is very stable,
with only a small trend downwards. Importantly, the two series reach nearly the same level
in the end of the time period, whereas the youth discrimination share was initially three times
as high. The pattern (plotted for private-sector jobs) is robust to including public-sector jobs,
restricting to permanent or full-time positions, and weighting each ad by its underlying number
of open positions.

We tentatively conclude that a persistent reduction in discrimination against young workers
could explain our results, but do not here provide a definite test of this mechanism. Our
findings suggest that a dedicated empirical study isolating youth discrimination in the labor
market may be promising.8
   8
    In Sweden, discrimination in hiring decisions has been documented in field studies in the context of older
workers in a sample that excluded workers younger than 35 (Carlsson and Eriksson 2019). Indirectly related
but consistent with anti-youth discrimination, field experiments and resume studies have found evidence for
discrimination of online platform workers with fewer evaluations (Pallais 2014), and applicants with longer
unemployment durations (Eriksson and Rooth 2014 for Sweden, Kroft, Lange and Notowidigdo 2016 for the
United States).

     Notes: Panel (a) depicts the normal payroll tax rate (solid line) and the lower rate for young workers (dashed line) in Sweden over time. The payroll tax
     rate in Sweden applies to the totality of earnings and is nominally fully paid by employers. The first reform lowered the payroll tax rate for earnings received
     on or after July 1, 2007 for all workers turning 19 to 25 during the calendar year down to 21.3 percent. The second reform further lowered the tax rate
     down to 15.5 percent for earnings received on or after January 1, 2009 for all workers turning 26 or less during the calendar year. The reform was repealed
     in three steps on May 1, 2015, August 1, 2015, and on June 1, 2016. In the first step on May 1, 2015 (not depicted on the figure), which lasted 3 months
     only, the tax cut was repealed for workers turning 26 in 2015 (and was actually further lowered for workers turning 23 or less to be budget neutral). In
     the second step on August 1, 2015, which lasted 10 months, all workers turning 25 and less in the calendar year had their taxes increased to 25.46 percent
     (63% of the tax rate gap was closed). In the third step on June 1, 2016, the normal payroll tax rate applies to all workers. Panel (b) shows the share of
     all (4.9 million) vacancies posted on the Platsbanken platform of the Swedish Employment Service, that are discriminating either against the young or by
     gender using a text search for phrases associated with discrimination by youth or gender (see Appendix for details, and Appendix Figure A3 for time series
     by phrase). We restrict attention to private sector jobs (around 65% of all ads), but our results are robust to this restriction. Youth discrimination falls
     during the reform and does not bounce back after repeal (while gender discrimination, as a placebo test, is stable).

Notes: This figure depicts the average monthly wage in Sweden by age for different time periods using the
Structure of Earnings Survey data. The survey measures wages mostly for the month of September (with some
measurements in October and November). The top panel depicts net wages defined as monthly wage earnings
net of payroll taxes. The bottom panel depicts gross wages defined as monthly wage earnings gross of payroll
taxes. The wage is defined as the full-time equivalent contracted monthly wage. It is adjusted for inflation (CPI
base-year 2018) and converted to US dollars using an exchange rate of 9.8 SEK/USD (as of 9/30/2019). Age is
defined as the age reached during the calendar year, which is the relevant concept for the payroll tax cut. 2003-6
are pre-tax cut years (red square series). 2007-15 are tax cut years (blue circle series). 2016-2017 are post-repeal
years (green triangle series). The reform applies up to age 26 in 2009-14 and up to age 25 in 2007-8 and 2015 (as
depicted by the two dashed vertical lines, see Figure 1 Panel (a) for details). The sample includes all employed
individuals in the Structure of Earnings Survey, which covers all industrial sectors (see Section I.B). The top
panel shows that net wages are continuous at the age thresholds and the bottom panel shows that gross wages
are discontinuous. This implies that employers do not adjust wages by age in response to the payroll tax cut
and its subsequent repeal. Hence, young workers become cheaper to employers during the reform.

Notes: The top panel depicts the employment rate by age and time periods. The employment rate is the
employment to labor force ratio. The employment numerator is all residents employed with annual wage earnings
above a small annual threshold ($4,490 in 2012 and adjusted for median wage growth in other years). The labor
force denominator is defined as all residents who are either (i) employed as just defined for the numerator; (ii)
unemployed defined as having registered with the Unemployment Office at any point during the year. The
bottom panel shows the employment rate by age and single years relative to 2006. The normalization (detailed
in Footnote 6) is made by aligning multiplicatively the unemployment rate (one minus the employment rate)
for ages 35-40 to the 2006 level for each year and then taking the difference in employment rates with 2006.
The figure shows a strong and increasing positive effect of the reform on the employment rate of young targeted
workers. The effect does not diminish after the reform is repealed (2016 and 2017). The figure also shows an
increase in the employment rate of workers exposed to the reform after they aged out consistent with a hysteresis
effect.

Notes: This figure shows the employment rates by age and year relative to 2006 by gender (top panels) and by
local youth unemployment rate (bottom panels). The methodology is the same as in Figure 3, bottom panel,
but splitting the sample by gender (top panels) and by regions based on their youth unemployment rates in
2006 (bottom panels). For bottom panels, the 21 Swedish regions are divided into quintiles weighted by the
number of young in the labor force in 2006 so that each quintile includes roughly the same number of people.
The normalization (detailed in Footnote 6) is made by aligning multiplicatively the unemployment rate (one
minus the employment rate) for ages 35-40 to the 2006 level for each year and then taking the difference in
employment rates with 2006 (raw employment rate series by gender and local unemployment areas are presented
in Appendix Figure A2). The scale on the female vs. male panels (and for low vs. high youth unemployment
rate) is the same for comparison. Panels (a) and (b) show a similar effect of the reform by gender in early years
(2010-2012), but the effect on young female workers grows much more in subsequent years and remains much
higher for females after the tax cut is repealed. Panels (c) and (d) show a much larger effect of the reform in
high youth unemployment areas both during the reform and after the repeal, and also for people who age out
of the reform. Hence, hysteresis effects appear much stronger in high unemployment areas.

Notes: Panel A presents the effects of the payroll tax cut on employment rates in percentage points by periods
(by row) and by age groups (by column) using the aggregated times series by age and year displayed in Figure 3
bottom panel. We omit the phase-in period and the global recession year (2007-9), so that we have twelve years
(2003-6 and 2010-17) and 21 ages (20-40), rendering 252 observations in total. We first divide our "treated" ages
into groups as follows: 20-26; 27-28; 29-30; 31-32 and 33-34. We then regress the outcome variable (employment)
on year dummies, age dummies and interactions between the five treatment-age-groups and time periods, defined
as in the rows (excluding 2005-6 as the omitted category). The table reports coefficients on the interactions.
We report robust OLS standard errors. The treatment effect provides an average effect by age groups and
periods using the age distribution of the labor force in 2006. Labor force (LF) is defined as all residents who are
either (i) employed with annual wage earnings above a small annual threshold ($4,490 in 2012 and adjusted for
median wage growth in other years); or (ii) unemployed (defined as having registered with the Unemployment
Office at any point during the year). Panel B computes the reform-induced creation of job-years. We take the
age-group×period treatment effects AT from DiD regression model (1) reported in Panel A. We multiply each
AT with the labor force body count of age group A in the pre-period 2006, i.e. EAT = AT LFA,2006 . In the
bottom line of each entry, we report the share of a given entry contributing to total job creation is EAT /ET .
The last row contains age-specific job creation over all years EA = T EAT . The rightmost column presents
total time-specific job creation over all cohorts ET = A EAT . The bottom right entry reports total overall
employment effects E = A T EAT . Since our time periods combine multiple years, we also multiply a
given time period's treatment effect by its length in years (4,2,2).

A      Classifying Job Listings by Hiring Preferences
Text search procedure. From the full vacancy data set, which includes around 4.9 million
posted vacancies over the period 2006-2017, we extracted a random sample of 3,000 ads. Two
research assistants independently classified these 3,000 ads as discriminatory against young, and
by gender (men or women). From the set of ads marked by at least one reader as discrimina-
tory, we determined discriminatory phrases. We then text-searched the full set of vacancies for
these phrases, and reviewed a random sample of 1,000 ads classified as discriminatory to de-
termine false positives. We iterated this procedure until such false positives became negligible.
The final round of this procedure yielded our partitioning of the full sample of vacancies into
discriminatory (either by gender, against youth, or both) and non-discriminatory.

Youth phrases. We exclude nondiscretionary age restrictions imposed by legal constraints
(e.g., taxi drivers with minimum legal ages). The set of phrases (and their English translations)
used to classify jobs as discriminatory against youth (where "\d" denotes digits) are, in phrase-
specific time series, depicted in Appendix Figure A2b) and listed below:

Gender phrases. For gender discrimination, we search for ads that are directed particularly
to men or women. The list of terms (phrase-specific time series are depicted in Appendix Figure
A2b) is below:

   · "(G|g)¨
           arna (kille|tjej)" ­ "Preferably man/woman".

   · "(D|d)u ¨
             ar (en )?(kvinna|man|kille|tjej)" but does not contain
     "((K|k)vinna|(M|m)an|(K|k)ille|(T|t)jej) eller (kvinna|man|kille|tjej)" ­
     "You are a man/woman/guy/girl" but not
     "man/woman/guy/girl or a man/woman/guy/girl", to avoid strings such as "You are a
     man or a woman".

   · "(S|s)¨
           oker (en )?(kvinna|kvinnlig|man|kille|tjej)" but does not contain
     "((K|k)vinna|(M|m)an|(K|k)ille|(T|t)jej) eller (kvinna|man|kille|tjej)" ­ "Looking for a
     man/woman/guy/girl" but not "man/woman/guy/girl or a man/woman/guy/girl".

   · "h¨
       andig (kvinna|man|kille|tjej)" ­ "Handy man/woman/guy/girl".

However, many ads state that they seek to hire a man/woman to make the gender distribution
more balanced. We do not label those ads as discriminatory and identify them by including
the strings "j¨
              amlikhet" ­ "equality"; "j¨
                                        amst¨

Notes: This figure repeats the wage statistics displayed in Figure 2 but limiting the sample to new hires or job
switchers, defined as having a new firm identifier as the main (i.e., highest paying) employer relative to September
of the previous year. It includes both job-to-job transitions as well as new hires among the nonemployed. As
we found in Figure 2, there is no discontinuity in net wages (top panel) and a corresponding discontinuity in
gross wages due to the tax differentials. This implies that employers do not pass on the payroll tax cut or its
abolition to young workers (relative to older workers).

Notes: The figure depicts the employment rate by age and time periods by gender (top panels) and by local youth
unemployment rate (bottom panels). The methodology is the same as in Figure 3, top panel, but splitting the
sample by gender (top panels) and by regions based on their youth unemployment rates in 2006 (bottom panels).
In 2006, just before the reform, there was wide variation across Sweden's 21 regions in youth unemployment.
Regions in the lowest quintile of youth unemployment rates (left panel) had rates in the range of 10.5-12.4% while
regions in the highest quintile (right panel) had youth unemployment rates in the range of 20-23.3%, i.e. about
twice as high. Regions are divided into quintiles weighted by the number of young in the labor force in 2006 so
that each quintile includes roughly the same number of individuals. The employment rate is the employment
to labor force ratio. The employment numerator is all residents employed with annual wage earnings above
a small annual threshold ($4,490 in 2012 and adjusted for median wage growth in other years). The labor
force denominator is defined as all residents who are either (i) employed as just defined for the numerator; (ii)
unemployed defined as having registered with the Unemployment Office at any point during the year. The
top panels show a strong and positive effect of the reform on the employment rate of young targeted workers.
The effect appears much stronger for females than for males especially in later years. The panels also show an
increase in the employment rate of workers exposed to the reform after they age out consistent with a hysteresis
effect for both genders. The bottom panels show a much larger effect of the reform in high youth unemployment
regions both during the reform and after the repeal, and also for people who age out of the reform.

Notes: This figure shows the share of all vacancies posted on the website Platsbanken, which is the online job
portal provided by the Swedish Employment Service, that are discriminating against the young (Panel (a)) or
on the basis of gender (Panel (b)). Discrimination is defined as follows (detailed in Appendix A). Out of the
4.9 million job ads that were posted during the years 2006-2017, two research assistants independently read
and coded a random sample of 3,000 ads as discriminatory against young or against men or women. We then
matched the two samples of discriminatory ads, resolved inconsistencies and selected discriminatory phrases.
We then extracted a random sample of 1,000 ads contained the phrases, and refined the phrases until the share
of false positives was negligible. This graph shows the share of ads that includes a given phrase. "\d" denotes
digits for age-related phrases.
