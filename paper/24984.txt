Uncertainty in both financial markets and the real economy rises sharply during recessions. We
develop a model of informational interdependence between financial markets and the real
economy, linking uncertainty to information production and aggregate economic activities. We
argue that there exists mutual learning between financial markets and the real economy. Their
joint information productions determine both the allocative efficiency in the real sector and the
market efficiency in the financial sector. The mutual learning creates a strategic complementarity
between information production in the financial sector and that in the real sector. A self-fulfilling
surge in financial uncertainty and real uncertainty can naturally arise when both sectors produce
little information in anticipation of the other producing little information. At the same time,
aggregate output falls as the real allocative efficiency deteriorates. In the extension to an OLG
dynamic setting, our model characterizes self-fulfilling uncertainty traps with two steady-state
equilibria and a two-stage economic crisis in transitional dynamics.

1    Introduction

Uncertainty in both Þnancial markets and the real economy rises sharply during recessions. The
recent Þnancial crisis of 2007-2009 presented one of the most striking episodes of such heightened
uncertainty. The Þnancial market uncertainty, measured by the VIX index, jumped by an astonish-
ing 313% in the Great Recession. The increase in measured real uncertainty was equally astounding.
For instance, the macroeconomic uncertainty measured in Jurado et al. (2015) almost doubled,
and Bloom et al. (2012) report a 152% increase in the micro-level real uncertainty measured by the
Þrm-level dispersion of output. What causes such sudden spikes in uncertainty? Why do Þnancial
uncertainty and real uncertainty move together? Why do they rise sharply in recessions? These
challenging questions are of central importance for understanding the interaction between Þnancial
markets and the real economy. The purpose of this paper is to provide a theoretical framework to
address these questions.
    We develop a model of informational interdependence between Þnancial markets and the real
economy, linking uncertainty to information production (or acquisition) and aggregate economic
activities. As the starting point of our theory, we argue that there exists mutual learning between
Þnancial markets and the real economy. Their joint information productions determine both the
real production e!ciency in the real sector and the price e!ciency in the Þnancial sector. As an ex-
ample, oil producing companies scrutinize oil future prices when making their production decisions,
while the Þnancial market studies the Þnancial reports from these producing companies to learn
information when trading on oil futures. This mutual learning creates a strategic complementarity
between information production in the Þnancial sector and that in the real sector. A self-fulÞlling
surge in Þnancial uncertainty and real uncertainty can naturally arise when both sides produce little
information in anticipation of the other producing little information. At the same time, aggregate
output falls as the real production e!ciency deteriorates.
    We formalize the idea in an extended Grossman-Stiglitz (1980) model. Our key innovation
is that we introduce a real sector along the lines of Dixit-Stiglitz (1977) – in our framework,
Þrms have to make investment decisions under imperfect information about two dimensions of
uncertainty: their idiosyncratic productivity and demand shocks. We start with one Þrm and
one Þnancial market in our baseline partial equilibrium model for a given aggregate output. To
reduce uncertainty, the Þrm can learn about its idiosyncratic productivity shock by incurring a
cost, but it has to infer its demand shock from the information provided in the Þnancial market
where speculators (or traders) have a comparative advantage in acquiring information about the
demand shock. In this context, the Þnancial price is jointly determined by the Þrm’s information
production and thereby its disclosure and the demand information produced by Þnancial market
speculators. To understand strategic complementarity between these two sources of information,


                                                 1
Þrst suppose that the Þrm makes more accurate information disclosure about its productivity shock.
The reduced uncertainty about the productivity shock attracts more informed traders and induces
more aggressive trading. Hence, the amount of information produced on the demand shock in the
Þnancial market increases. Conversely, suppose that the Þnancial market becomes more informative
about the demand shock for some reason. The reduced uncertainty regarding the demand enables
the Þrm to make better investment decisions and hence achieve a higher proÞt for every realized
supply shock. This implies that the stake is higher for the Þrm to acquire information about
its productivity shock. Hence, the Þrm has stronger incentives to acquire information about its
productivity shock.
   As the marginal beneÞt of acquiring information for the Þrm depends on aggregate output
(besides Þnancial price informativeness), the nature of equilibrium also depends crucially on the
level of aggregate output. When the aggregate output is su!ciently high, the Þrm’s incentive to
acquire information is already strong enough and acquiring information is a dominant strategy for
the Þrm. The resulting equilibrium is hence unique in which the Þrm produces and discloses more
precise information and the Þnancial market generates a more informative price signal. As a result,
both Þnancial and real uncertainty are low. At the other extreme, when the aggregate output is
su!ciently low, not acquiring information is a dominant strategy for the Þrm. Anticipating this,
speculators in the Þnancial market also have little incentive to acquire information about the Þrm’s
demand shock. The equilibrium is hence also unique. However, when the aggregate output is in
the intermediate range, the economy has two self-fulÞlling equilibria. The information produced
by the Þrm and the information generated by the Þnancial market in one equilibrium (the “good”
equilibrium) are much more precise than those in the other equilibrium (the “bad” equilibrium).
Consequently, a surge in uncertainty can suddenly strike as a self-fulÞlling equilibrium phenomenon.
   We then extend the baseline model to a macroeconomic general-equilibrium framework with
aggregate production to endogenize the aggregate output. The Þnal consumption good is produced
with a continuum of intermediate capital goods as the input according to a Dixit-Stiglitz production
function. Each intermediate capital good is produced by one Þrm located on an island in the spirit
of Lucas (1972). When information signals on some islands become noisier, the real investment
decisions on those islands become less e!cient and consequently the aggregate output declines. This
causes the aggregate demand faced by other islands to drop. Thus, incentives to acquire information
in the real sector on those other islands are also reduced, which decreases information acquisition
in their Þnancial sectors as well. The aggregate output hence declines further, which in turn aects
those islands experiencing the original shock. In short, the complementarity in goods production
due to the Dixit-Stiglitz demand externality across islands generates further complementarity in
information production across islands. As a result, the complementarity forces for equilibrium
multiplicity are strengthened in the general equilibrium. Similar to the partial equilibrium model,


                                                 2
the economy may feature multiple (two) equilibria. In particular, in general equilibrium, a self-
fulÞlling rise of uncertainty is accompanied by the reduction in investment e!ciency and the fall
in aggregate output.
      We derive four key implications of our macroeconomic model. First, an adverse shock originating
in either the real sector or the Þnancial sector that impairs their ability to conduct information
acquisition can have a large impact on the aggregate economy due to the compound feedback loops.
In fact, both aggregate investment and the endogenous aggregate TFP are decreasing in information
precision. Hence, a small shock in information acquisition cost can have a large impact on all three
quantities (aggregate investment, endogenous aggregate TFP, and aggregate output) in the same
direction, in particular when it triggers a self-fulÞlling “bad” equilibrium.1 Second, our model
endogenizes together the three variables – Þnancial uncertainty, real uncertainty, and aggregate
economic activities – and shows countercyclical uncertainty as observed in the data. Third, our
model provides an information contagion channel, where a shock that directly aects only a small
fraction of islands can generate a global recession on all islands through the endogenous information
mechanism. Fourth, our model with a production economy sheds light on several puzzling empirical
facts on asset price comovement. More information about idiosyncratic shocks results in individual
asset prices being more responsive to idiosyncratic shocks and relatively less responsive to the
aggregate shock. Hence, a lower degree of comovement of asset prices as well as a higher e!ciency
of resource allocation is expected to be accompanied by a higher GDP.
      Finally, we extend the static model into an OLG dynamic framework, deriving several additional
economic insights. The OLG model provides a dynamic equilibrium setting to study the process of
saving and capital accumulation. The equilibrium, therefore, is dynamically linked across periods
through savings. The nature of the equilibrium in each period is path-dependent, depending not
only on the realization of the productivity shock in the current period but also on the capital
accumulation in past periods. We show that our dynamic model possibly has two steady-state
equilibria, meaning that the economy can exhibit self-fulÞlling uncertainty traps. Interestingly, the
transitional dynamics of our OLG model characterizes a two-stage economic crisis. An adverse
shock to fundamentals Þrst triggers a downward spiral of information production and economic
activities. The initial impact is relatively small, but it makes way for a perfect storm of self-
fulÞlling uncertainties as the aggregate economy declines further. The resulting drop in output and
the increase in measured uncertainties are huge. More speciÞcally, we show that a medium-sized
shock to the economy initially generates a mild recession along a unique equilibrium path. But as
capital accumulation deteriorates the economy will eventually reach a tipping point, where multiple
equilibria start to emerge. Then a self-fulÞlling uncertainty crisis can suddenly throw the economy
into a new “bad” equilibrium path. Output and capital fall dramatically and uncertainties spike.

In contrast, a small shock always generates a unique equilibrium path without the second stage.
       These implications of our OLG model are also qualitatively consistent with some observed
patterns of the recent Þnancial crisis. The crisis originated in a relatively small mortgage sector,
which started to decline in 2006. A mild economy-wide slowdown came later in the fourth quarter
of 2007. The recession did not look particularly severe until the third quarter of 2008,2 when full
Þnancial panic broke out after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and aggregate output fell sharply.
It is now widely believed that a deterioration in fundamentals and a loss of conÞdence together
drive this type of two-stage crisis.3
       Empirical studies support our model’s key implication on information quality across business
cycles. Jiang, Habib and Gong (2015) show evidence that management forecast errors, measured
by the dierence between forecasted earnings per share (EPS) and actual EPS, increase during
economic recessions. Loh and Stulz (2017) document that forecast errors of Þnancial analysts are
signiÞcantly higher during recessions/crises than good times.
       Related literature.       A burgeoning literature in Þnance studies the informational feedback
eects of Þnancial markets (see Bond, Edmans and Goldstein (2012) for an extensive survey of this
literature). This literature argues that Þrm managers on the real side of the economy learn from
Þnancial prices. Among others,4 Goldstein, Ozdenoren and Yuan (2013) and Sockin and Xiong
(2015) develop clean model frameworks showing how prices in the secondary Þnancial market can
aggregate the dispersed information of speculators and guide Þrm managers or investors to make
better real investment decisions. The learning in this literature is one way – the real sector learns
from Þnancial markets. On the other hand, the accounting literature emphasizes the opposite
direction of learning – arguing that Þrm managers typically know more than Þnancial market
participants – and focuses on studying how Þrm managers (i.e., insiders) disclose information
to the capital market, based on which Þnancial speculators trade and security prices are formed.
Our paper advances these two bodies of literature by introducing and studying mutual (two-way)
learning between the real sector and Þnancial markets, similar to Sockin (2017), Straub and Ulbricht
(2017), and Wu, Miao and Young (2017). The two-way learning mechanism sheds light on important
questions, such as how a Þnancial price is formed, where the information comes from, and how the
sources of information interact.

     The Federal Open Market Committee minutes repeatedly emphasize uncertainty as a key factor driving the
2001 and 2007-2009 recessions (see, e.g., Bloom et al. (2012)). On many occasions, the Chairman Ben Bernanke
highlighted the loss of conÞdence as an important factor for the Great Recession. For example, at the stamp lecture
on January 13, 2009, he said “Heightened systemic risks, falling asset values, and tightening credit have in turn taken
a heavy toll on business and consumer conÞdence and precipitated a sharp slowing in global economic activity.”

       The Þnance literature pioneered by Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) and Verrecchia (1982) studies
information production (or acquisition) in Þnancial markets. The recent work of Goldstein and
Yang (2015) analyzes a model where two dierent groups of Þnancial traders are informed of
dierent fundamentals of a security. They show that trading as well as information acquisition
by these two groups of Þnancial traders exhibit strategic complementarities. Ganguli and Yang
(2009) study a model where traders can obtain private information about the supply of a stock in
addition to that about its payo. They show complementarity in information acquisition and the
existence of multiple equilibria. Our model introduces the real sector and aggregate production into
a Grossman-Stiglitz-type model; information acquisition in our model takes place both in the real
sector and in Þnancial markets. Adding to this literature, our paper shows that complementarity in
information production exists between the real sector and the Þnancial sector. Our model provides
a micro-foundation for the two-factor structure of the asset payo in Goldstein and Yang (2015).
Our paper also adds to the recent literature by showing that the informational interplay between
the real sector and the Þnancial sector can give important macroeconomic implications.5
       A large literature in macroeconomics documents robust evidence of countercyclical uncertainty
– both real uncertainty and Þnancial uncertainty increase during recessions. Real uncertainty is
often proxied by Þrm-level dispersion in earnings, productivity and output, and the volatility of
aggregate output forecast error, while Þnancial uncertainty is often measured by Þnancial market
volatility and the VIX index (Bloom (2009), Bloom et al. (2012), Jurado et al. (2015)). An ongoing
heated debate in this literature concerns the question of causality, i.e., whether uncertainty is a
cause of or merely a response to recessions and where it comes from (see, e.g., Bachmann and Bayer
(2013, 2014)). Interestingly, a recent paper by Ludvigson et al. (2017) empirically identiÞes that
sharply higher real uncertainty in recessions is most often an endogenous response to other shocks
that cause business cycle ßuctuations, while uncertainty in Þnancial markets is a likely source of the
ßuctuations. Our paper contributes to the debate by providing a theoretical framework that is able
to address the three variables – real uncertainty, Þnancial uncertainty, and aggregate economic
activities – simultaneously and show how they are related.6
       Bacchetta, Tille and Wincoop (2012) also study the self-fulÞlling nature of uncertainty. They
construct an interesting endowment economy in which agents have mean-variance preferences. If
the agents believe pure sunspots matter for asset prices, then the perceived risk of future prices
will increase. As a result, the current asset prices will indeed be aected. The uncertainty is
   5
     Goldstein and Yang (2017a) analyze a model where there are multiple dimensions of uncertainty and market
prices convey information to real decision-makers. They focus on studying the eect of disclosing public information
on real e!ciency. They also study the information acquisition of Þnancial speculators, but not that of the real sector.
   6
     Benhabib, Liu and Wang (2016b) study endogenous information acquisition of Þrms that links real uncertainty
and economic activities. However, there is no Þnancial market in the model there and that paper does not touch upon
Þnancial uncertainty. Veldkamp (2005) and Van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp (2006) study learning asymmetries in
business cycles, without involving Þnancial markets.



                                                          5
self-fulÞlling because there also exists another equilibrium in which the asset prices are certain
and hence bear zero risk. Fajgelbaum, Schaal and Taschereau-Dumouchel (2016) propose a theory
of self-reinforcing episodes of high uncertainty and low activity, through the mechanism of the
“wait-and-see” eect together with agents learning from the actions of others. In contrast to these
contributions, self-fulÞlling uncertainty in our model comes from the information interdependence
between Þnancial markets and the real economy. This information interplay also allows us to study
the impact of uncertainties on real economic activities.
    Our model is related to a small body of the macroeconomics literature that studies how Þnancial
markets aect business cycle ßuctuations through information channels.7 Angeletos, Lorenzoni
and Pavan (2010) build a two-stage feedback model where Þnancial markets in the second stage
learn from the volume of asset selling of entrepreneurs in the Þrst stage, which generates strategic
complementarity in investment that ampliÞes non-fundamental shocks. Benhabib, Liu and Wang
(2016a) present a self-fulÞlling business cycle model, where Þnancial market sentiments aect the
price of capital, which signals the fundamentals of the economy to the real side and consequently
leads to real output that conÞrms the sentiments. David, Hopenhayn and Venkateswaran (2016)
conduct a quantitative study that links imperfect information and resource misallocation, where
Þrms learn from both internal sources and stock market prices about one dimension of fundamental
uncertainty. The information is exogenous in their paper, and they conclude that Þrms turn
primarily to internal sources for information, rather than to Þnancial markets.8 Compared with the
aforementioned studies, ours shows that the amount of information in the economy is endogenous,
and that there is feedback between the level of economic activity and the amount of information,
ampliÞed through the mutual learning between Þrms and Þnancial markets.
    Our model’s cross-sectional implication on asset pricing comovements is closely related to and
motivated by the study of Peng and Xiong (2006), who show that limited investor attention leads
to category-learning behavior, i.e., investors tend to process more market- and sector-factor infor-
mation than Þrm-speciÞc information. As a consequence, return correlations between Þrms can
be higher than their fundamental correlations and sectors with a higher average return correlation
across Þrms will exhibit less informative stock prices. Similarly, Veldkamp (2006) argues that the
low price of high-demand information makes investors want to purchase the same information that
others are purchasing, resulting in comovement of asset prices. Unlike us, these works study pric-
ing comovements in an exchange economy and hence they do not link the pricing comovements to
ßuctuations in the business cycle and investment e!ciency as we do in our paper.
   7
     Among others, Reis (2006), Angeletos and Pavan (2007), Hellwig and Veldkamp (2009), Vives (2016), Colombo,
Femminis and Pavan (2014) and Mäkinen and Ohl (2015) study information acquisition and e!ciency.
   8
     Because David, Hopenhayn and Venkateswaran (2016) consider neither endogenous information acquisition nor
the feedback on information production between the real side and Þnancial markets, incorporating our mechanism in
their quantitative study may bring new results; see our numerical calibration in Section 6.



                                                       6
    Finally, equilibrium multiplicity due to strategic complementarity in information production in
our model also adds to the large literature on coordination failures and multiple equilibria. Multiple
equilibria exist in these models because each individual agent would like to do what others do. So
if there is enough heterogeneity to reduce their incentives to act like others, multiple equilibria can
disappear. For example, Ball and Romer (1991) show that if the Þxed menu cost is heterogeneous,
equilibrium multiplicity is still possible but depends crucially on the shape of the distribution
function of the Þxed menu cost. Morris and Shin (1998) show that heterogeneity in information
can lead to a unique equilibrium in an otherwise multiple-equilibria model of currency attacks.
Schaal and Taschereau-Dumouchel (2015) apply the global games approach developed by Morris
and Shin (1998) to remove multiple equilibria in a model in which Þrms coordinate on capacity
utilization. Interestingly, we Þnd that heterogeneity across Þrms in productivity or the information
acquisition cost can actually increase, rather than reduce, the possibility of multiple equilibria in
our model. This result is in sharp contrast to the types of coordination failure in other models.
    The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the simple baseline model. In Section
3, we extend our baseline model to study endogenous information. In Section 4, we further extend
the model to a macroeconomic framework. In Section 5, we extend the static model to an OLG
dynamic framework. Section 6 provides numerical illustrations of our model. Section 7 concludes.


2     The Baseline Model

In this section, we present a simple baseline model with one Þrm, one Þnancial market, and with
exogenous information. The Þrm faces two uncertainties: demand shock and supply (or productiv-
ity) shock. The Þrm has some information about the supply shock while the Þnancial market has
some information about the demand shock. We show that there exists two-way learning between
the Þrm and the Þnancial market.


2.1   Setup

There are two types of agents: Þrm m and a group of Þnancial market traders (speculators). There
are two types of goods: an intermediate capital good and a Þnal good. The price of the Þnal good
is normalized as the numeraire, S  1.
    Intermediate Goods Firm          Firm m is an intermediate goods Þrm. It produces the interme-
diate capital good \m using the Þnal good as input according to the production function

                                   \m = ]Dm Nm       for 0 ?  ? 1>                               (1)

where ] is the common productivity shock to the whole economy (regarded as a constant in the

                                                  7
baseline model), Dm is Þrm m’s productivity, and Nm is the investment input of the Þnal good.9 The
input Nm fully depreciates after production. We will show that Þrm m borrows the investment input
at interest rate Ui  1.
       The market demand function of the intermediate capital good \m is assumed to be
                                                        µ        ¶
                                                            1
                                                 \m =                 m \ ,                                         (2)
                                                            Sm

where Sm is the price of the capital good m (in terms of the Þnal good), and m measures the
idiosyncratic demand shock to good m. Moreover, in the baseline model \ is an exogenous constant,
which corresponds to the aggregate output (real GDP) (denote |  log \ ), whereas parameter 
measures the price elasticity of demand.
       Financial Market and Traders (Speculators) A Þnancial market exists, where speculators
trade a Þnancial asset (a derivative) contingent on the Þrm’s asset value or Þrm value (also its total
income):10
                                                     Ym = \m Sm .                                                    (3)

SpeciÞcally, we assume that the payo of the Þnancial derivative contract takes the form of

                                                     ym = log Ym .

Note that the log form is for tractability.11 Denote by tm the market trading price of the Þnancial
derivative contract. That is, the long position of one unit of the Þnancial asset (derivative) incurs
an initial outlay of tm and entitles to having the risky payo ym later.
       The utility function of speculators is assumed to be

                                                            ¡     ¢
                                            X (Z l ) =  exp Z l >

where Z l is the end-of-period wealth for speculator l 5 [0> 1], and  is the risk-aversion (CARA)
coe!cient. The initial wealth for a speculator is assumed to be Z0 and the risk-free (gross) interest
rate is Ui  1. This means that if a speculator takes a position of p units of the Þnancial asset,
   9
      The label “Þnal” here only means that this good is a dierent good from the intermediate good. In our static
model, the input Nm (the Þnal good) comes from endowment, which will be clear in Section 4.1. In the extended
dynamic model, the input Nm in the current period is the savings after consumption (i.e., the Þnal consumption good)
from the last period.
   10
      For our one-period static model, in the balance sheet of the Þrm at the end of the period, the asset value of the
Þrm is its total income; the debt value is the investment cost; and the equity value is the net proÞt. Hence, assuming
a log-normal distribution of Ym is consistent with the literature where the asset value, not the equity value, is assumed
to follow a geometric Brownian motion (see, e.g., Merton (1973) and He and Xiong (2012)).
   11
      Goldstein and Yang (2017a) study the Þnancial asset’s payo being nonlinear with a log-normal distribution. They
show numerically that being more informative about one factor motivates speculators to acquire more information
about the other factor.

his end-of-period wealth would be

                             Z l = (Z0  ptm ) Ui + pym = Z0 + p(ym  tm ).


       The assumption that speculators trade a derivative contract contingent on the Þrm’s asset value,
Ym , is made for tractability. This is along the line of the assumption in the literature that a Þrm’s
asset value or sales revenue follows a geometric Brownian motion (see, e.g., Merton (1973) and He
and Xiong (2012)). The Þnancial derivative can also be contingent on the Þrm’s product price,
Sm (that is, ym takes the form of ym = log Sm ). In the latter case, the Þnancial market can be
interpreted as a commodity Þnancial futures market that specializes in trading Þnancial futures
regarding the intermediate capital good \m , in the spirit of Sockin and Xiong (2015). Assuming
that the underlying asset of the derivative is either Ym or Sm is to ensure that the payo of the
underlying asset follows a log-normal distribution and thus to achieve tractability. This parallels
the modeling device that assumes a speciÞc function form of noisy trading (or asset supply) as in
Goldstein, Ozdenoren and Yuan (2013), Sockin and Xiong (2015), and Goldstein and Yang (2017a).
       The net aggregate supply of the Þnancial asset (i.e., derivative) is assumed to be 0. The demand
of noise/liquidity traders in the Þnancial market is qm , where qm follows distribution qm  Q (0>  31
                                                                                                     q ).

       Uncertainties and Information            The Þrm faces two uncertainties: productivity (or supply)
shock Dm and demand shock m . Their prior distributions are log Dm  dm  N ( 12  31    31
                                                                                     d >  d ) and
log m  %m  N ( 12  31    31
                        % >  % ). And dm and %m are independent. The common productivity shock ]
is public information (denote } = log ]).
       In the baseline model, we assume that the Þrm and the Þnancial market have some exogenous
(imperfect) information about dm and %m , respectively. SpeciÞcally, the Þrm possesses or is endowed
with a noisy signal about its own productivity:

                                                  vm = dm + hm ,

where hm  Q (0>  31
                   v ). Firm m will disclose its signal vm to the Þnancial market.
                                                                                  12 For simplicity,

we assume that the Þrm has no private information about the demand shock, %m .13
       In the Þnancial market, as in Grossman and Stiglitz (1980), there is a continuum of traders
with unit mass. The traders are of two types: informed and uninformed. An informed trader l has
a noisy private signal
                                                  {lm = %m + (lm ,
  12
     As will become clear later, a Þrm has incentives to disclose its information to the Þnancial market because
the disclosure can “attract” more information from the Þnancial market, which can guide the Þrm to make better
investment decisions. Goldstein and Yang (2017a) show that Þrms always have incentives to disclose their information
orthogonal to traders (see also Bond and Goldstein (2015)).
  13
     We will relax this assumption in Section 3.3 to allow the Þrm to have information on the demand shock as well.

where (lm  Q (0>  31       l
                    { ) and (m is independent across dierent informed traders l. An uninformed
trader has no private signal regarding %m . The proportion of informed traders is , which is exoge-
nous in the baseline model.
   Timeline      The sequence of events (within the one period) in the baseline model is as follows:
   W1 : Firm m discloses its signal vm to the Þnancial market.
   W2 : Financial market trading takes place, and Þnancial price tm is realized.
   W3 : Firm m makes its investment decision, Nm , based on information {vm > tm }.
   W4 : The income or asset value, Ym , is realized. The payo of the Þnancial contract is delivered.
   The timeline setting allows us to capture the two-way informational learning and production
in a simple way. As the standard accounting literature studies, Þnancial market participants learn
from a Þrm’s disclosure in trading securities and conducting price discovery. In other words, the
Þrm’s information acquisition often occurs before Þnancial trading and Þnancial price formation.
On the other hand, the Þnancial price, which is forward-looking, incorporates some information
that the Þrm manager does not have and thus can learn in making real investment decisions, as a
large Þnance literature on the feedback eects studies.


2.2   Equilibrium

The equilibrium consists of a Þnancial market equilibrium at W2 and the Þrm’s investment decision
at W3 . We conduct analysis by backward induction.
   Firm m’s Investment Decision at W3                Firm m maximizes its expected proÞt:

                          Nm  N(vm > tm ) = arg max E [Sm \m  Ui Nm |vm > tm ]                     (4)
                                                     Nm


with constraints (1) and (2). Here E(·|vm > tm ) is the conditional expectation operator over dm and %m .
It is well understood that a Þrm’s objective is not always well deÞned in an asymmetric-information
environment. For simplicity and convenience, we assume that Þrms maximize their expected proÞt.
Alternatively, we can assume that Þrms are run by risk-neutral entrepreneurs.

   An informed speculator chooses his risky asset holdings, pLl , to maximize his utility:

                                                           £                       ¤
                           pLl (vm > tm > {lm ) = arg max E X (Z Ll )|vm > tm > {lm ,                (5)
                                                     pLl


where Z Ll = (Z0  f) + pLl (ym  tm ) and f denotes a constant expense, to be explained later. An

                               pX l (vm > tm ) = arg max E X (Z Xl )|vm > tm ,                                                 (6)

where Z Xl = Z0 + pX l (ym  tm ). In (5) and (6), E(·) is the expectation operator over ym .
   The equilibrium of our baseline model is formally deÞned as follows.

DeÞnition 1 An equilibrium consists of the Þnancial price function tm = t (vm > %m > qm ) and the
Þrm’s investment decision function Nm = N(vm > tm ), such that
   1. Price t (vm > %m > qm ) clears the Þnancial market at W2 :
                                   Z   1                               Z    1
                                              Ll
                                          p gl + (1  )                       pXl gl + qm = 0,                               (7)
                                   0                                    0

where, for given Nm = N(vm > tm ), pLl and pX l solve (5) and (6), respectively.
   2. Given price t (vm > %m > qm ), investment decision N(vm > tm ) solves the Þrm’s problem (4).

   The equilibrium deÞned in DeÞnition 1 highlights the two-way feedback (i.e., a Þxed-point
problem) between the Þnancial market and the real economy. On the one hand, the Þnancial price
at W2 should reßect the (forward-looking) investment decision at W3 (and thereby the Þnancial
asset’s fundamentals at W4 ). On the other hand, the Þnancial price at W2 inßuences and guides the
investment decision on the real side of the economy at W3 .


2.3   Characterization of Equilibrium

First, we characterize the Þnancial market equilibrium. We conjecture that log Nm  nm = n(vm > tm )
is a linear function in DeÞnition 1. Plugging (1) and (2) into (3) yields
                                  µ      ¶              µ      ¶
                             1         1                     1       1
                         ym = %m + 1      (} + dm ) +  1      nm + |,                                                       (8)
                                                                  

which depends on %m , dm and nm . However, speculators are certain about nm but not %m and dm ,
because nm is a function of signals vm and tm and thus speculators perfectly foresee the investment
decision of the Þrm.
                                           E[ym |vm >tm >{lm ]3tm                                   E[ym |vm >tm ]3tm
   In solving (5), we Þnd pLl =            Y du[ym |vm >tm >{lm ]
                                                                   .   Similarly, (6) gives pXl =   Y du[ym |vm >tm ] .   We also
conjecture a linear price function:

                                       tm =  0 +  1 (%m +  2 vm +  3 qm ),                                                 (9)

where  0 ,  1 ,  2 and  3 are coe!cients. When combined with vm , price tm can be converted into


                                                                   11
another piece of public information about %m :

                                                   tm   0   1  2 vm
                                t̃m (tm > vm ) =                         = %m +  3 qm  %m + (tm ,                (10)
                                                           1

where (tm  Q (0>  31         31 =  2  31 . Information set {v > t } is a one-to-one mapping to
                    t ) with  t      3 q                        m m

{vm > t̃m }.
     Plugging (8) and (9) into the expressions of pLl and pX l , together with (7), yields the Þnancial
market equilibrium. We have Lemma 1.

Lemma 1 In the equilibrium of the Þnancial market, for a given ,  t is an increasing function
                 C t
of  v , i.e.,   C v   A 0.
Proof. See Appendix.

     Lemma 1 states that when the precision of the Þrm’s disclosed information about dm increases,
the informativeness of the Þnancial price about %m also increases. The intuition is as follows. The
total uncertainty over ym is the sum of uncertainties over dm and %m . When uncertainty over dm
decreases under a higher precision  v , informed traders have incentives to trade more aggressively,
which overwhelms the trading of noise/liquidity traders, thus increasing the informativeness of the
Þnancial price.
     Lemma 1 shows that the Þnancial price comes partially from information disclosure in the real
sector and partially from price discovery in the Þnancial market. These two sources of information
interact.
     Next, we move to characterize Þrm m’s investment decision at W3 . The Þrst-order condition of
(4) implies
                                                              1    v         t
                               nm = n(vm > t̃m ) = !00 + (1  )        vm +           t̃m >                       (11)
                                                               d + v       % + t
where  =        1
                          5 (1> ) and the constant coe!cient !00 is provided in Appendix. Because t̃m
               (13 1 )31
is a linear function of vm and tm by (10), (11) implies that nm is also a linear function of vm and tm ,
which conÞrms the earlier conjecture.

Lemma 2 The Þrm’s investment decision at W3 , N(vm > tm ), is given by (11) (together with (10)).
Proof. See Appendix.

     The realized proÞt for Þrm m at W4 is (dm > %m > vm > t̃m ) = Sm (%m > \m ) \m (dm > Nm )  Nm (vm > t̃m ). Hence,
the expected proÞt perceived at the stage of investment at W3 is E [(dm > %m > vm > t̃m )|vm > t̃m ]. Exploiting

The intuition behind the above comparative statics is easy to understand. When the Þrm has a
more precise signal about dm or %m , it makes a better investment decision because its investment
can be more closely aligned with the realized productivity or demand shock. Moreover,

which means that the precisions of signals dm and %m are complementary in aecting the Þrm’s ex
ante proÞt. In other words, the informational value of knowing about one shock increases with
the information precision of the other shock. The intuition is as follows. When  t is higher, the
Þrm has more accurate information about its demand. This enables the Þrm to make a better
investment decision that is more closely aligned with the true demand shock and increases its proÞt
multiplicatively for every realized productivity shock. Therefore, the incremental proÞt of knowing
the realization of the productivity shock (versus not) is also higher for a higher  t . This means
that the Þrm has a higher stake to acquire information about dm when  t is higher. Similarly, we
have
                                  C2                             C2
                                         A0        and                   A 0.

   A key insight of the baseline model is that the learning between the Þnancial market and the
real economy occurs both ways. The Þnancial market learns information from a Þrm’s disclosure
in trading, and conversely, the Þrm learns information from the Þnancial price in making its real
(investment) decision.

3     The Model with Endogenous Information

In this section, we study the model with acquisition of endogenous information. The purpose is to
understand the information acquisition of the Þrm and that of the Þnancial market, and how they
interact.


3.1    Setup

We add W0 to the timeline. At W0 , after the common productivity shock ] is realized (which be-
comes public information), the Þrm and the Þnancial market simultaneously make their information
acquisition decisions.
    By paying an information acquisition cost e A 0 (in terms of the Þnal good), the Þrm receives
a signal vm = dm + hm with hm  Q (0> ¯31
                                        v ); otherwise, it receives a less precise signal vm = dm + hm
with hm  Q (0>  31
                  v ), where 
                             ¯v A  v . And  v = 0 corresponds to the extreme case where the Þrm
receives a useless signal. In short,  v 5 { v > ¯v }. In addition, in the spirit of the classic moral hazard
problem (concerning hidden actions), we assume that a Þrm’s choice of information precision  v is
private information (i.e., unobservable to outsiders including Þnancial market participants).
    In the Þnancial market, a trader can choose to be informed or uninformed. By paying an
information acquisition cost f A 0 (in terms of the Þnal good), a trader receives a private signal
{lm = %m + (lm with (lm  Q (0>  31
                                  { ), as speciÞed in the baseline model; otherwise, it receives no signal
(or equivalently a useless signal). The proportion of informed speculators, , is endogenous.
    Our assumption that the Þrm and Þnancial markets have comparative advantages in acquiring
information about dierent types of uncertainties is realistic. On the one hand, the Þrm has advan-
tage over outsiders including Þnancial analysts in obtaining information about its own productivity
shock. On the other hand, Þnancial analysts in major investment banks specializing in dierent
regional or sectoral submarkets could, on aggregate, be better informed about the demand for the
Þrm’s product than the Þrm itself. Furthermore, in Section 3.3, we will relax the assumption to
allow the Þrm to obtain information on the demand shock as well.


3.2    Equilibrium

Information Acquisition Decision of Speculators                   Proportion  is determined such that an
uninformed speculator and an informed one have the same expected utility:

                                               HY (Z Ll )
                                                           = 1,                                           (15)
                                               HY (Z X l )
                   £                ¤
where HY (Z l )  E X (Z l )|vm > tm . We have the following result.


                                                      14
Proposition 1 In the equilibrium of the Þnancial market with endogenous ,  t is a function of
                                                                                                       C t             C t

Proof. See Appendix.

       Proposition 1 states that with taking the endogenous  into account, the informativeness of
the Þnancial price about %m increases as the precision of the Þrm’s information about dm increases.
The intuition behind the comparative statics is as follows. There are two driving forces under the

becomes more valuable. For example, in the extreme case when Y du 1  1 dm |vm is very large,
being informed has little advantage over being uninformed. Hence, when the precision of signal vm
increases and thus Y du (dm |vm ) decreases, an uninformed speculator has incentives to switch to being
informed by paying a cost f.14 When more speculators acquire information, price informativeness
                                                                      C t
also improves. As for the comparative statics                          Cf    ? 0, a lower f induces more traders to become
informed, causing price informativeness to improve.

information acquisition decision given by (17) is a step function, written as  v ( t ; \> ]> e).

    Of course, there is a third force, which is the classic free-rider problem in Grossman and Stiglitz (1980). A more
informative price reduces the incentive for a trader to acquire information.




                                                                       15
Proposition 2 The optimal information acquisition decision of the Þrm at W0 ,  v ( t ; \> ]> e), is
given by (17).
Proof. See Appendix.

    Proposition 2 states that if and only if the Þrm expects the Þnancial e!ciency  t to exceed
the threshold value ˆt (\> ]> e) would it choose a high precision  v = ¯v . This is because precisions
of signals dm and %m are complementary in aecting the Þrm’s ex ante proÞt. Intuitively, when
the uncertainty over %m is reduced, information about dm becomes more valuable in maximizing the
Þrm’s expected proÞt. The equilibrium  v also depends on \ and ]; that is, when \ or ] is higher,
the marginal beneÞt of increasing the signal precision  v is also higher, and so the Þrm is more
likely to acquire information about dm .
    Proposition 2 is a novel result of our model. Earlier work in the literature such as Goldstein
and Yang (2015) has shown information production complementarity within the Þnancial market.
Our paper shows information production complementarity between the real side of the economy
and the Þnancial side.
    Full Equilibrium        With both Proposition 1 and Proposition 2, we are now able to characterize
the full equilibrium. Proposition 1 gives the reaction function  t ( v ; f) while Proposition 2 gives
the reaction function  v ( t ; \> ]> e). Let

    iii) Case 3: ˆt ?  Wt The equilibrium is unique: ( v >  t ) = ¯v >  WW  t ,

    where threshold ˆt = ˆt (\> ]> e) is given by (18).
Proof. See Appendix.

    The intuition behind Proposition 3 is as follows. The two-way feedback in information produc-
tion between the Þnancial sector and the real sector can generate a unique equilibrium or multiple

                                                         16
equilibria, depending on parameters \ , ], e and f. For illustration, let us change \ while keeping
], e and f constant. Recall that when aggregate output \ is su!ciently low (high), the Þrm’s
incentive to acquire information is already weak (strong) enough. SpeciÞcally, if \ is so low (and
hence threshold ˆt (\> ]> e) is so high) such that not acquiring information is a dominant strategy
for the Þrm (regardless of whether Þnancial price informativeness  t =  Wt or  WW
                                                                                  t ), then a unique
equilibrium exists in which the real side does not acquire information and the Þnancial e!ciency
is also at a lower level. This is case 1. Conversely, if aggregate output \ is so high (and hence
threshold ˆt (\> ]> e) is so low) such that acquiring information is a dominant strategy for the Þrm,
then a unique equilibrium exists in which the real side acquires information and the Þnancial e!-
ciency is also at a higher level. This is case 3. Between these two extreme cases, there are multiple
self-fulÞlling equilibria, which is case 2.

to a horizontal shift of curve  t ( v ; f) in Figure 1) also leads to dierent cases of equilibrium.


3.3        Discussions

Before closing this section, we discuss two simpliÞed assumptions of our model. First, for tractability
and to obtain closed-form solutions, we have assumed the binary choice of information acquisition
of the Þrm. We can instead assume that the Þrm’s information acquisition is a continuous choice,
and our model results would not change qualitatively. Second, for simplicity, in Section 2 we have
assumed that the Þrm has no private information about the demand shock %m . We can relax this
assumption, and our model results would be robust. To save space, we relegate the details to
Appendix B.


4         The Macroeconomic Model

In this section, we extend the model to a macroeconomic framework. The extended model provides a
macroeconomic background for the baseline model and endogenizes various exogenous speciÞcations
and variables of the baseline model. In particular, the aggregate output (i.e., real GDP), \ , is
endogenized, which gives a number of novel implications.

which endogenizes the demand function of (2).
       Intermediate Goods Firms There is a continuum of intermediate (capital) goods Þrms with
a unit measure, indexed by m. The setup for a typical Þrm, Þrm m, is presented in Section 2.1. We
may think of each intermediate good as being produced by one Þrm that is located on an island in
the spirit of Lucas (1972). Both dm and %m are i.i.d. across Þrms (or islands).
       Financial markets        In the Þnancial market(s), there is a continuum of Þnancial assets.
Financial asset (derivative) m is contingent on intermediate goods Þrm m’s asset value, Ym = \m Sm .
The payo of Þnancial derivative contract m is ym = log Ym . The demand from noise/liquidity traders
for Þnancial asset m is qm  Q (0>  31
                                     q ), and qm is independent across Þnancial assets. It might be the
case that each island has one Þnancial market with Þnancial asset m being traded in the Þnancial
market on island m or the case that there is only one Þnancial market (exchange) where all the
Þnancial assets are traded. In the current framework of the aggregate economy, we may interpret
noise trading as: 1) foreign capital ßow, or 2) liquidity trading by some investors who must trade
(for exogenous reasons such as balancing portfolios, endowment shocks, and so on).16
       The setup for information acquisition for a Þrm and on a Þnancial asset is the same as that in
Section 3.
       Investors    The economy consists of a continuum of [0> 1] × [0> 1] investors. Each investor
is endowed with Z0 units of the Þnal good at W0 .17 Each investor has three identities: capital
supplier (i.e., lender), Þrm owner (i.e., shareholder), and Þnancial market trader. The economy
is decentralized, analogous to the Robinson Crusoe economy. The decisions of an investor made
under dierent identities are independent.
       We assume that Z0 is su!ciently high and a storage technology exists, so that in equilibrium
Ui = 1.18 An investor maximizes utility

     David, Hopenhayn and Venkateswaran (2016) also use the general equilibrium framework with noise traders.
  17
     Clearly now, by calling the “Þnal” good, we do not only mean the good produced with the intermediate inputs
under Dixit-Stiglitz aggregation but also the endowment which can be used for either consumption or capital. The
point is that the endowment good and the good produced under Dixit-Stiglitz aggregation are the same good.
  18
     More speciÞcally, Z0 is greater than the aggregate investment given in (25) later.

The term   " is the aggregate net proÞt of the Þrms distributed to an investor (as an owner of
Þrms), where " 5 {0> e} is the aggregate information acquisition cost to the Þrms.19 The term Gl
is his payo in Þnancial market trading. If he is an informed trader in Þnancial market m, then
Gl = f + pLl (ym  tm ); if he is an uninformed trader, then Gl = pX l (ym  tm ). Notice that for
simplicity and expositional clarity, we have assumed here that an investor can trade only in one
Þnancial market (asset). In Section 4.4.2, we will provide a robustness analysis and show that our
model insight is intact if investors are allowed to access all Þnancial assets and hold a portfolio.
      It is easy to show that the trading (asset holding) and information acquisition decision of an
investor (as a Þnancial market trader) is exactly the same as that in Sections 2 and 3.


4.2      Equilibrium

Within each island, the equilibrium is given by Propositions 1-3. Now we study the equilibrium
of the aggregate economy, endogenizing \ . We consider the symmetric equilibrium, in which all
intermediate goods Þrms have the same level of information precision.
      To Þnd the symmetric equilibrium, we proceed in two steps. First, suppose that the equilibrium
information precision on the representative island (or equivalently all islands m 3 6= m) is given by
( v >  t ), and work out the aggregate output \ . Second, given this \ , characterize the partial
equilibrium on island m as studied in Section 3.2.
      We take the Þrst step and Þnd that the aggregate output is given by

    Equation (23) implies that despite heterogeneity among Þrms caused by idiosyncratic produc-
tivity shocks and demand shocks, our economy works as if there existed a representative Þrm with
productivity D and aggregate investment N. Proposition 4 follows.

Proposition 4 Both the endogenous aggregate TFP, D, and the aggregate investment, N, are
increasing in  v and  t (given by (24) and (25), respectively). Hence, the aggregate output \ is
increasing in  v and  t (given by (23)).
Proof. See Appendix.


    Proposition 4 highlights two eects of information frictions. First, given N, the endogenous
                                                                                                            CD
aggregate TFP, D, measuring the e!ciency of resource allocation, has the properties of                      C v   A0
      CD
and   C t   A 0. E!cient allocation requires more resources to be allocated to Þrms with higher realized
Dm and m . In other words, e!cient investment Nm should be more aligned with realized Dm and
m . So, more precise information about Dm and m achieved through information acquisition helps
improve allocative e!ciency. Second, higher uncertainty also leads to a lower level of aggregate
                            CN               CN
investment, that is,        C v   A 0 and   C t   A 0.
   Next, we take the second step. That is, given \ derived in the Þrst step, characterize the
                                            ³         ´
partial equilibrium on island m. Denote by  mv >  mt the equilibrium on island m. By the partial
                                                            ³             ´
equilibrium result shown in Section 3.2, we have  mv =  v  mt ; \> ]> e and  mt =  t ( mv ; f), where
\ = \ ( v >  t > ]) is given by (23).
                                         ³           ´
    By the symmetric equilibrium, we have  mv >  mt = ( v >  t ). Thus, the full equilibrium of the
aggregate economy is given by the following joint equations:

       v =  v ( t ; \> ]> e)                                           (A Þrm’s optimal information choice) (27)
       t =  t ( v ; f)                                                        (Financial market equilibrium) (28)
       \      = \ ( v >  t > ]) = ] · D ( v >  t ) [N ( v >  t ; ])] >   (Aggregate economy equilibrium) (29)

where (27), (28) and (29) are given by Proposition 2, Proposition 1 and Proposition 4, respectively.

Proof. See Appendix.



       The intuition behind equilibrium multiplicity in Proposition 5 is very similar to that behind
equilibrium multiplicity in Proposition 3 – the root cause is strategic complementarity in informa-
tion production. In the partial equilibrium, strategic complementarity in information production
exists within an island (between the Þnancial sector and the real sector), which can generate mul-
tiple equilibria. In the full equilibrium, strategic complementarity in information production exists
within an island and between islands, and hence multiple equilibria become even more likely. In
Proposition 3, the threshold for the existence of multiple equilibrium depends on \ or ] (or, more
                   1      1
precisely, \  ] 13  seen in (12) and (18)). The only dierence now is that \ itself is endogenous
and is a function of  v >  t and ]. Hence, the endogenous \ adds a further reinforcing channel,
with the result that the general equilibrium becomes more sensitive to the change in ] than the
partial equilibrium and multiple equilibria become more likely.20
       To illustrate Proposition 5, Figure 2 depicts \ as a function of ] with f and e Þxed (recall
equation (26)). In Figure 2, when ] is low enough such that ] 5 (4> ]), there is a unique “bad”
                                                  ¡       ¢
equilibrium; when ] is high enough such that ] 5 ]> ¯ +4 , there is a unique “good” equilibrium.
            £     ¤
When ] 5 ]> ]¯ , there are two self-fulÞlling equilibria. Similarly, when ] is kept constant, a
change in e or f also leads to dierent cases of equilibrium (where a change in e or f shifts the
thresholds ] and ]¯ in Figure 2).
  20
    In Appendix C.2, we will also show that the results of Proposition 5 do not change qualitatively under the setup
of continuous information acquisition of Þrms.

4.3     Implications

Now we discuss four key implications of the general equilibrium given in Proposition 5.


4.3.1    (Implication 1) AmpliÞcation Eects

A small adverse shock (i.e., a small increase in f or e, or a small decrease in ]) can have a large
impact on the aggregate economy (aggregate output \ ) due to the compound feedback loops of
information ampliÞcation. For illustration, Figure 3 depicts the ampliÞcation eects when an
adverse shock to f hits the economy (while e and ] stay the same), where each arrow represents
an economic force given in equations (27)-(29). Detailed numerical illustrations of the comparative
statics with respect to f, e, and ] will be provided in Section 6. Our information channel of
ampliÞcation contrasts with the Þnancing channel in Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) and Jermann and
Quadrini (2012), where an adverse shock originating in either the real sector or the Þnancial sector
can also lead to a large drop in the aggregate output.
   In particular, the ampliÞcation in our model can arise from the presence of multiple equilibria
(i.e., discontinuity). That is, a small aggregate shock or pure self-fulÞlling beliefs in the absence of
any aggregate shock can trigger the equilibrium to switch from one regime to the other, generating
a very large drop in the aggregate-level output and investment. As illustrated in Figure 2, a small
change in ] around ] = ]¯ (i.e., a slight decrease in ] from above ]¯ to below ])¯ can trigger the
equilibrium to switch from “good” to “bad”, resulting in a large drop in \ . This implies that a
positive shock and a negative shock to ] potentially have asymmetric eects on equilibrium output.
                                             ¯ When ] increases, the equilibrium output increases
Suppose that initially ] is (slightly) above ].
steadily. However, when ] declines, the equilibrium output may exhibit a sudden large decline if

                                                  24
the economy falls to the bad equilibrium. It also implies that a small shock and a big shock to ]
can have dramatically dierent implications. While a small decline in ] leads to a steady decrease
in output, a big decline in ] may trigger a self-fulÞlling crisis. Conducting comparative statics with
respect to f and e instead of ] shows similar patterns (see Section 6).

Our model endogenizes together the three variables – Þnancial uncertainty, real uncertainty, and
aggregate economic activities – and show how they are related. The residual Þnancial uncertainty

4.3.3      (Implication 3) Contagion and Spillover

Our model implies information contagion and spillover. An adverse shock that directly aects only
a small fraction of islands can generate a global recession on all islands through the endogenous
information mechanism. Figure 4 illustrates the eects, where the arrows have the same meanings
as in Figure 3. In Figure 4, an adverse shock to f on some islands has a negative spillover eect
on all other islands. Of course, an adverse shock to e has a similar eect. This implication of our
model is consistent with a large amount of anecdotal evidence that idiosyncratic Þrm-level shocks
can be the origin of aggregate ßuctuations (i.e., microfoundation for aggregate shocks; see Gabaix
(2011)).
       Formally, we conduct a simple extension of our main model to allow for heterogeneity in e or f
across islands. Let the information acquisition cost be e = eK for a fraction of islands, m 5 [0> $],
and e = eO for the remaining fraction of islands, where eK A eO and 0  $  1. Suppose that in
                                                                     ¡     ¢
equilibrium the information precision is given by ( v >  t ) =  v >  Wt for the Þrst fraction of islands
                     ¡           ¢
and by ( v >  t ) = ¯v >  WW
                              t    for the remaining fraction of islands. Then, the aggregate endogenous
TFP is given by
                                         1                1   ¸ 31

                                                                     3

                                 D = $D 31 + (1  $) D̄ 31                                                 (32)

and the aggregate output \ is given by (26), where D = D  v >  Wt and D̄ = D ¯v >  WW
                                                                                       t .

       Now we are able to formalize the contagion eect. For a given ] and f, deÞne eWW such that
] = ](eWW > f), where function ] is given in Proposition 5. Suppose that e = eO in the economy
initially for all islands, where eO is slightly lower than eWW . By Proposition 5, the economy initially
has two equilibria, where one equilibrium is that all islands are with the “good” equilibrium –
                                                           ¡           ¢
the information precision for all islands is ( v >  t ) = ¯v >  WW
                                                                    t . Consider now the case where a
small fraction of islands suer a shock in the sense that their information acquisition cost increases
slightly to e = eK (which is slightly above eWW ). Then, the islands suering the shock inevitably
                                                    ¡          ¢
falls into the “bad” equilibrium with ( v >  t ) =  v >  Wt . This decreases \ by (32). Because \ is
reduced, all other islands are aected and can also inevitably fall into the “bad” equilibrium (by
Proposition 3). That is, the unique “bad” equilibrium for the whole economy can be the outcome.
In other words, the market e!ciency, the real allocative e!ciency, and the expected output in value
(i.e., the real GDP Sm \m ) on all islands will all go down. Again, a numerical illustration of this
result will be provided in Section 6.

   The evidence of countercyclical uncertainty in the macroeconomics literature is in line with the Þndings in the
Þnance literature that the volatility of stock returns is higher in bad times than in good times.

4.3.4     (Implication 4) Cross-sectional Implications

Our general-equilibrium model with production and a continuum of assets is particularly useful
for studying asset price comovements. Empirical studies have established several interesting but
puzzling patterns of comovements, summarized below.

   i) A negative relation exists between the degree of comovement of stock prices in a sector and the
        informativeness of the stock prices (e.g., Durnew et al. (2003)). Stock prices move together
        more in poor economies than in rich economies (e.g., Morck, Yeung and Yu (2000)).

  ii) There is a decline in comovement of asset prices across sectors over time (e.g., Campbell et
        al. (2001)).

 iii) Correlations between U.S. stocks and the aggregate U.S. market are much higher for downside
        moves than for upside moves (e.g., Ang and Chen (2002)).

 iv) Industries with larger Þrm-speciÞc variation in stock returns have higher economic e!ciency
        of corporate investment (e.g., Durnew, Morck and Yeung (2004)).

   Now we show how our model can help shed light on these intriguing empirical regularities. The
intuition is easy to understand. In our model, an individual asset price tm is eectively driven by
three components: aggregate productivity ], the Þrm’s signal vm = dm + hm , and informed traders’
signals {lm = %m + (lm . The aggregate price index is instead driven by the aggregate productivity ]
alone by the law of large numbers. When the signals vm and {lm become more precise, the individual
price tm becomes more responsive to idiosyncratic shocks dm and %m and relatively less responsive to
the aggregate shock ]; therefore, the correlation between an individual asset price and the aggregate
price index becomes lower. At the same time, the e!ciency of resource allocation, characterized

                                                  27
by the endogenous TFP D, becomes higher and the aggregate output increases. In short, a lower
degree of comovement of asset prices as well as a higher e!ciency of resource allocation is expected
to be accompanied by a higher aggregate output.
   Formally, for simplicity and to sharply deliver the message, we study two extreme cases of the
model. Consider two countries which dier only in information acquisition costs. We assume that
country I has extremely high information acquisition costs, say, eL = fL = 4, whereas country II
has information acquisition costs that are close to zero, namely, eLL $ 0 and fLL $ 0. Moreover, if
agents acquire information, their signals are perfectly informative, namely  v =  { = 4; otherwise
                                                                                       ¡  ¢2

which is increasing in $. It is also true that fruu(tmL >       tmL gm) A fruu(tmLL > tmLL gm).
   The above model results explain the four empirical patterns listed at the beginning of this
subsection. First, sector IZ (type-I islands), relative to sector II, has a higher degree of asset price
                                                  R
comovement by fruu(tmL > tmL gm) A fruu(tmLL > tmLL gm) and also a lower degree of Þnancial price
informativeness by  Wt ?  WW
                            t . Second, the improvement of information technology may correspond
to a decrease in $ over time for a country, and hence our model implies that comovement in asset
prices decline over time. Third, economic downside moves may correspond to periods with a higher
$, so asset price comovement is higher in such periods. Fourth, country I with a lower GDP has
a higher degree of asset price comovement than country II. Sector I, which has a higher degree of
asset price comovement, has a lower investment e!ciency by D ? D̄.
   The puzzling empirical facts on asset price comovement, which are di!cult to explain with
traditional asset pricing theory, have inspired numbers of theoretical studies. Notably, Peng and
Xiong (2006) develop a novel model based on limited investor attention. A key element of their
model is that investors tend to process more aggregate information than Þrm-speciÞc information.
This is similar to our model, where aggregate shock ] is observable by Þnancial investors while Þrm-
speciÞc shocks dm and %m are imperfect information. Peng and Xiong (2006) study a pure exchange
economy and show that their model can explain facts i) and ii). Our model with a production
economy complements their work. By linking asset price comovements to information production
and investment e!ciency in a production economy, we are able to explain the two additional facts
iii) and iv). In Section 6, we will also oer a dierent mechanism for why information on aggregate
shocks is more easily available to investors based on the insight of Hayek (1945). Basically, we argue
that when investors with dispersed information are trading some “aggregate” production factors in
the economy such as capital and labor, the realization of aggregate shocks can be revealed through
information aggregation of prices, while such “aggregate” assets may hardly exist for Þrm-speciÞc
shocks. Similarly, if investors can observe all asset prices on all islands, the realization of an
aggregate shock can also be revealed by aggregating all asset prices.


4.4     Model Extensions

In the section, we conduct two extensions on our macroeconomic model.


4.4.1    Heterogeneity and Multiplicity

In this subsection, we extend our macroeconomic model by considering heterogeneity of Þrms
and studying its eect on equilibrium multiplicity. Interestingly, we Þnd that heterogeneity can
actually increase, rather than reduce, the possibility of multiple equilibria in our model. This result
is in sharp contrast to the types of coordination failure in other models, which have shown that

                                                    29
heterogeneity can make multiple equilibria disappear.23
       Formally, we consider the case where there is heterogeneity in em (the Þxed cost of a Þrm’s
information acquisition). In Appendix C.1, we will also study heterogeneity in the observable
part of Þrm-speciÞc productivity and the results are similar. Let em be drawn from a continuous
distribution with cumulative density function (c.d.f.) as J (·) in support [0> 4). This implies that
                                                                                             ¡          ¢
in equilibrium a fraction of islands will have less precise information (i.e., ( v >  t ) =  v >  Wt ) and
                                                                                        ¡         ¢
the other fraction of islands will have more precise information (i.e., ( v >  t ) = ¯v >  WW
                                                                                               t ). Let us
denote the Þrst fraction by $ and then the endogenous TFP is given by (32). Thus, the aggregate
output \ is function of D. In the same spirit of Proposition 3, we Þnd that there are three types
of islands in equilibrium. Lemma 3 follows.

Lemma 3 Suppose that $ is given and thus so are D and \ for a realized ]. In equilibrium, for
                                                                                  ¡     ¢

Proof. See Appendix.


       The intuition behind Lemma 3 is very similar to that behind Proposition 3. For a given \
and ], when em is su!ciently low, the dominant strategy for Þrm m is to acquire information (i.e.,
 v = ¯v ) even if the Þnancial market is less informative (i.e.,  t =  Wt ). A similar argument applies
to other ranges of em .
       Lemma 3 essentially shows how the two thresholds eW and eWW are determined for a given $. An
equilibrium means a Þxed-point problem between (eW > eWW ) and $. Proposition 6 follows.

Proposition 6 When there is heterogeneity in em 5 [0,4) across Þrms, for a realized ], there are
always multiple equilibria in which $, the endogenous TFP, and aggregate output are driven by a
sunspot variable 0  v  1, such that

                                                    $ = vJ(eW ) + (1  v)J(eWW )>

where eW and eWW are respectively determined by (33) and (34). The endogenous TFP is given by
(32) and the aggregate output is given by \ = \ (D; ]) according to the formula in (26).
Proof. See Appendix.


   Proposition 6 illustrates that heterogeneity in em increases the likelihood of multiple equilibria.
In fact, Proposition 5 corresponds to the case of no heterogeneity in em , in which multiple equilibria
occur only under an intermediate level of realized ] and feature two symmetric equilibria (i.e.,
$ = 0 or $ = 1). In contrast, Proposition 6 shows that for any realized ] there are multiple
equilibria and for a given ] the multiple equilibria feature a continuum of $ driven by sunspots.
   The reason for this intriguing result is that there are two layers of coordination problems in
our model. Given other islands’ information decisions, within an island, there exists a coordination
problem between the Þrm and the Þnancial market on that island. The second coordination problem
occurs across islands due to the Dixit-Stiglitz demand externality. Heterogeneity in the information
acquisition cost reduces the incentive of the Þrm on a particular island to coordinate with Þrms
on other islands. So information production across islands will be less synchronized. However,
enough heterogeneity in the information acquisition cost naturally divides islands into three types
as shown in the partial equilibrium of Proposition 3. As a result, two equilibria will always exist on
some islands – islands on which the information acquisition cost em falls into a range such that the
partial equilibrium in Proposition 3 has multiple (two) equilibria. Since the total fraction of islands
with the “good” equilibrium is indeterminate, the aggregate economy hence features a continuum
of equilibria.


4.4.2   Investors Holding a Portfolio

In Section 4.1, we assumed that an investor can trade only in one Þnancial market (asset). Now
we show that our model insight is intact if investors can hold a portfolio with access to Þnancial
assets on all islands.
   For expositional clarity, we slightly modify the setup of the macroeconomic model in Section
4.1 by letting there be m = 1> 2> 3> =====M discrete islands. The Dixit-Stiglitz production function in
(19) is alternatively assumed as
                                                 5                    6    

which is exactly the same as the trading (asset holding) decision of a speculator in Section 2. It is
also easy to show that the results of information acquisition decisions for speculators in Section 3
apply here. In Appendix (the proof in Section 4.4.2), we will also show that the results for Þrms’
information acquisition and the aggregate economy equilibrium do not change qualitatively.


5    The Dynamic Model

In this section, we extend the static model to an OLG framework. The OLG model provides a
dynamic equilibrium setting to study the process of saving and capital accumulation. The exogenous
endowment Z0 in the static model is now endogenized. The equilibrium, therefore, is dynamically
linked across periods through savings – the nature of equilibrium in the next period endogenously
depends on not only the aggregate productivity shock ] in that period but also the aggregate
output in the current period.
    We derive three additional economic insights. First, we show that the dynamic model possibly
has two steady-state equilibria, which means that the exhibition of self-fulÞlling uncertainty traps
holds true in the dynamic setting. Second, when we study the transitional dynamics under a per-
manent negative shock, the dynamic model characterizes a two-stage economic crisis. Third, in the
dynamic model, the aggregate shock ] is endogenously revealed through information aggregation
of prices, rather than assumed constant and publicly observable as in the static model.

5.1      Setup

Agents In each period, there are three types of agents: investors (who were workers in the last
period), entrepreneurs,24 and workers. There is a continuum of [0> 1] × [0> 1] investors (workers)
and a continuum of [0> 1] entrepreneurs. Each worker is endowed with one unit of time. A worker
supplies labor for a wage when he is young, and saves up his wage as capital and becomes an investor
when he is old. An investor earns income on his capital and then consumes. Each entrepreneur is
a monopoly producer for an intermediate good on one island; he earns a proÞt and then consumes.
       Production Production of an intermediate good needs the inputs of capital and labor subject
to information frictions as in the baseline model. SpeciÞcally, the production function of interme-
diate good m is
                                                        ³         ´

where Nmw is the input of capital, which fully depreciates after production, Qmw is the input of labor,
and  5 (0> 1). There is a Þnal good production sector as in the static model, with the production
function

where m 5 [0> 1],  A 1 is the elasticity of substitution between intermediate capital goods, and mw
measures the demand shock to intermediate good m. Denote dmw  log Dmw and %mw  log mw . The
price of the Þnal good is normalized as the numeraire price in each period w.
       Timeline In each period w, there are Þve stages.

Stage 1: The old generation of workers becomes investors who possess capital which is carried over
         from the last period. A new generation of workers and a new generation of entrepreneurs are
         born.

Stage 2: Entrepreneurs and investors simultaneously make their information acquisition decisions
         as in Section 3. Entrepreneur m acquires information about productivity shock dmw and in-
         vestors acquire information about demand shocks {%mw }.

Stage 3: As in the timeline in the baseline model of Section 2, an entrepreneur Þrst discloses
         his signal to the Þnancial market, and then Þnancial market trading takes place, and then
         entrepreneurs make their investment decisions.

Stage 4: Production output is realized. Output is divided among workers (wages), investors (cap-
  24
    For simplicity, we assume that entrepreneurs survive only for one period and in each period a new generation of
entrepreneurs is born. Alternatively and equivalently, we can assume that entrepreneurs survive for two periods and
in each period there are two overlapping generations of entrepreneurs; in that case, entrepreneurs sit idle in the Þrst
half of their life (young) and are active only in the second half of their life (old).

      ital returns), and entrepreneurs (proÞts). The payos of Þnancial contracts are delivered.
      Investors and entrepreneurs consume and then die.

Stage 5: Workers receive private signals about the aggregate productivity shock ]w+1 in the next
      period which is realized but is not public information. Workers trade their capital (wages)
      and bonds among themselves. The capital price and the return on bonds, Ui w+1 , are realized.
      Workers then proceed to the next period.


5.2    Equilibrium

At stage 5 of period w  1, workers invest their wage income in capital and bonds based on their
dispersed information about ]w . A typical worker l faces the following budget constraint:

                                       1 · Nwl + (1@Ui w ) · Ewl = Zw31 >

where Zw31 is his wage income, and Nwl is the number of units of capital and Ewl is the number of
units of bonds that he invests in. One unit of consumption good at this stage can be transformed
into one unit of capital and hence the price of capital is one. One unit of capital allows its owner
to obtain the rental return Uw in the next period w. The bond is traded at the discounted price
1@Ui w and hence the return on the bond is Ui w ; in other words, Ui w is the intertemporal interest
rate between w  1 and w. Each worker receives a noisy private signal about ]w . Since there is
no aggregate noise trading, ]w is revealed through the bond price 1@Ui w as in Vives (2014) and
Benhabib, Liu and Wang (2016a). It must also be true that Ui w = Uw in equilibrium. Since the net
bond supply is zero, the aggregate capital in the next period w is Nw = Zw31 × 1 = Zw31 .
    In period w, investor l, who was a worker in the last period, starts o with Nwl units of capital
and Ewl units of bonds. At stage 3, investors trade risky assets with payo ymw = log (\mw Smw ) at
prices tmw . Hence, when trading risky assets, an investor’s problem is

                                             ¡   £  ¡           ¢¤ ¢

                                       y wl >plmw

                                       s.t.         Fwl = Uw Nwl + (ymw  tmw )plmw + Ewl

where Fwl is investor l’s consumption, Nwl is his capital purchased in the previous period , Ewl is his
total purchase of bonds, plmw is his position on risky asset m, and f is the information acquisition
cost as in the static model. And ywl is an indicator function, which equals 1 if the investor acquires
information and 0 if not. Because ]w is revealed by 1@Ui w in the last period w1, the information set
      n                    o
Iwl is vmw > tmw > {lm > ]w if acquiring information and {vmw > tmw > ]w } if not, where vmw is entrepreneur m’s
signal and disclosure about dmw and {lm is investor l’s signal about %mw . For simplicity and tractability,
we assume in the dynamic model that information acquisition costs (e and f) are direct utility costs

   At the production stage, entrepreneur m’s problem is to solve

    Proposition 7 implies that for the dynamic model, whether a unique equilibrium or multiple
equilibria exist depends not only on the realization of shock ]w in the current period but also on
the capital stock (Nw = Zw31 Qw31 ) in the last period. In other words, the nature of equilibrium is

                                                          36
path-dependent. This is in contrast to the result in Proposition 5 for the static model, where the
existence of a unique equilibrium or multiple equilibria depends only on the realization of shock ].
       Based on Lemma 4 and Proposition 7, we can Þnd the law of motion for capital:

       Proposition 8 highlights self-fulÞlling uncertainty traps in the dynamic economy. Figure 5 illus-
trates Proposition 8. Two remarks are in order. First, even if we impose an equilibrium selection
to choose the “good” equilibrium in each period (in which case the jump point in Figure 5 is
unique at Nw = N), there are still possibly multiple steady-state equilibria. Second, while Figure
5 indicates the existence of two possible equilibrium paths starting in the range (N> N̄), nothing
prevents the equilibrium from switching between the two branches of capital accumulation in that
Nw range. The coordination problem for agents, whether to acquire high or low information (i.e.,
                ¡           ¢   ¡          ¢
( vw >  tw ) = ¯v >  WW
                         t    or  v >  Wt ), is independent across periods since a new generation of agents
replaces the old generation each period. Equilibrium switches between periods can be driven by a
stochastic sunspot or sentiment process such as a Markov chain, or animal spirits.25

       Next, we examine the transitional dynamics. Suppose that initially ]w = ], which is constant
and a bit higher than ] WW , and suddenly at w = w0 a permanent negative shock hits ]w . Proposition
9 shows the transitional dynamics under a permanent negative shock.

Proposition 9 (Transitional Dynamics) Suppose that initially ]w = ] A ] WW and the economy
                                                                                           0
is in the steady state, and at w = w0 a negative shock hits ]w resulting in ]w = ] ? ]. If the shock is
                             0
small enough such that ] A ] WW , the transitional dynamics of Nw are given by (41(a)) for w A w0 ; if
                                                   0
the shock is medium-sized such that ] W ? ] ? ] WW , the transitional dynamics of Nw can be (41(a))
for w0 ? w ? w1 and (41(b)) for w  w1 , where w1 is the time point of equilibrium switching.
Proof. See Appendix.



       Figure 6 illustrates Proposition 9. When the shock is small, the dynamic economy still has a
unique “good” steady-state equilibrium. However, when the shock is medium-sized, it triggers a
regime change: from the existence of a unique “good” steady-state equilibrium to the existence of
two steady-state equilibria. The case of a medium-sized shock characterizes a two-stage economic
crisis. The negative shock itself does not cause a big decline in economy activities at the beginning.
After the shock, the capital accumulation is initially along the unique path (i.e., the upper branch
toward the new “good” steady-state equilibrium in Figure 6) and the capital stock is declining over
time but the recession is mild. However, once the capital stock Nw has declined to a certain point
                   ³ 0´
such that Nw  N̄ ] , the second path of equilibrium is opened.26 A sunspot or sentiment can
suddenly switch the equilibrium path to the lower branch, in which case a surge in real uncertainty
and Þnancial uncertainty accompanied by a big drop in output strikes. After that, the economy
further declines and gradually converges to the new “bad” steady-state equilibrium. Numerical
illustrations for the transitional dynamics will be provided in Section 6.

6         Numerical Illustrations

Our analytic analysis in the previous sections has demonstrated that the information interplay
between the real sector and the Þnancial sector can have strong eects on the economy. Our model
is too stylized to be calibrated with the data. We will therefore assign values to parameters in our
model to conduct several numerical illustrations below.
         Table 1 summarizes the parameter values chosen. We set the elasticity of substitution between
intermediate goods, , to 6 as in David, Hopenhayn and Venkateswaran (2016). This implies that
the gross markup is 15%. We set the degree of decreasing returns to scale of production  to 0=8,
consistent with the recent estimates of Gopinath et al. (2016). We set the risk (CARA) coe!cient
 to 8, considering that CARA can be calibrated as the relative risk aversion (RRA) divided by
wealth and the wealth level of a typical investor in our model is GDP.27 We borrow the unconditional
residual uncertainty parameter from David et al. (2016), where  d = 4=9383. We set ¯v = 6=5746,
implying that a Þrm can reduce its residual uncertainty (standard deviation) on the productivity
shock to 0=30 by paying the information acquisition cost. We set  v = 3, implying that the residual
uncertainty in productivity equals 0=36 if a Þrm does not pay the information acquisition cost. We
set  % = 0=04, implying that the contribution of demand shocks to Þrms’ sales volatility is around a
half of that of productivity shocks along the line of Foster, Haltiwanger and Syverson (2008). For
simplicity, we set the precision of informed traders’ signal  { to inÞnity, meaning that an informed
trader can perfectly informed of the demand shock through his private signal. We set the common

productivity ] = 6=5, the information acquisition cost for a Þrm e = 0=03, and the information
acquisition cost for a Þnancial trader f = 0=105 by considering that in equilibrium only a fraction of
traders choose to acquire information. These parameter values lead to two self-fulÞlling equilibria
in our model.

   Table 2 summarizes key results of the two self-fulÞlling equilibria in Section 4. First, both
aggregate output and investment fall dramatically (by 58% and 58%, respectively) when the econ-
omy falls into the “bad” equilibrium. Second, information production from the Þnancial sector and
that from the real sector are both lower in the “bad” equilibrium than in the “good” equilibrium.
The Þrms and Þnancial traders face productivity shocks with a posterior standard deviation of
           1                                                           1

equilibrium. These numbers imply a 20% increase in Þnancial uncertainty and a 20% increase in
real uncertainty from the “good” equilibrium to the “bad” equilibrium. Third, the resulting infor-
mation production declines have important consequences for allocation e!ciency. The endogenous
TFP declines by about 16%. To understand the decline, we compute two alternative counterfactual
                                   v >  Wt ), the level of endogenous TFP when only the quality of
endogenous TFP. We Þrst compute D(¯
the information provided by the Þnancial market deteriorates while the quality of the information
provided by Þrms stays at the level ¯v . We Þnd that TFP would decline by about 13%. The
other 3% decline in the endogenous TFP is due to the decline in Þrms’ information production as
indicated by D( v >  WW

the quality of the information provided by Þrms deteriorates while the quality of the information

   As the nature of equilibrium depends crucially on the values of ] , e and f, our second exercise is
hence to conduct complete comparative statics to understand their impact on equilibria in Section
4 in a quantitative sense. We Þx all other parameter values (given in Table 1) but change one of
], f and e each time and compute the equilibria accordingly. We report the results in Figure 7.
Figure 7 has three columns, summarizing the comparative statics with respect to ] , e, and f. The
Þrst panel plots the equilibrium aggregate output, the second the posterior standard deviation of
Þrms’ productivity shocks (given in (31)), and the third the posterior standard deviation of Þrms’
demand shocks inferred from Þnancial prices (given in (30)).




                                 Figure 7: Comparative static analysis



   The Þrst column of Figure 7 shows that the equilibrium is unique if ] A ]¯ = 7=3701 or

                                                  41
] ? ] = 6=2893. Suppose that the economy initially starts with aggregate common productivity
] = 7=5205. A small drop in ] by more than 2 percent would trigger a self-fulÞlling crisis (also
see Figure 2). In the second and third columns of Figure 7, the model generates two self-fulÞlling
equilibria when the information acquisition cost, f or e, is at the intermediate level. Due to the
binary information choice of the Þrm, aggregate output is insensitive to the change in e under a
given equilibrium. Similar to the eect of ], if the initial level of e or f is close to their lower
threshold for multiple equilibria, then a small shock (i.e., a small increase in e or f) can cause a
sudden large decline in aggregate output.
      Our next exercise is to show information contagion in our model. Again we assume that all
parameters are initially as given in Table 1, except that we set e = 0=0353, slightly lower than the
upper threshold of e to have multiple (two) equilibria. According to Figure 7, the economy initially
has two equilibria. Now we assume that a small fraction  = 5% of Þrms suer a shock in the sense
that their information acquisition cost e increases slightly to 0=0355, which means that a unique
“bad” equilibrium takes hold in the economy of these islands by Figure 7. How about the other
95% of islands? The economy of the other 95% islands will inevitably fall into the bad equilibrium
unless their acquisition cost e decreases below 0=0347.
      Finally, we give numerical illustrations for our OLG model, particularly the results in Propo-
sition 9. As production in the OLG model has inputs of both capital and labor, we set  = 0=5
as in Zhu (2012).28 In order to quantitatively examine the eect of a small-sized shock versus a
medium-sized shock on ]w , we set  v = 5=5. The values of other parameters are as given in Table
1. Suppose that initially ]w = ] = 4=0961. Based on Proposition 8, we Þnd that the dynamic
                                                                               ¡           ¢
economy has a unique “good” steady-state equilibrium, in which ( vw >  tw ) = ¯v >  WW
                                                                                        t . Suppose
that the economy initially stays in this steady state for the Þrst three periods, w = 1 to 3. Assume
that in period w = 4 suddenly there is a permanent shock on ]w such that ]w declines by 5% to
]w = ] 0 = 3=8913. We examine what happens to the dynamic economy.
      The left panels of Figure 8 show four phases of the dynamics. First, the shock has a direct
impact. In period w = 4, the aggregate output \w immediately drops by 5%, which is exactly the
size of the shock. The capital stock Nw declines by the same magnitude in the following period
w = 5.      Second, after the shock, the economy moves along a unique path, which is toward the
new “good” steady state, until w = 8. The time between w = 4 to w = 8 corresponds a time of a
mild recession, in which aggregate output \w and capital Nw gradually decline further by less than
5%. Third, in period w = 9, because the capital stock is already su!ciently low and enters the
region of Nw  N̄ (] 0 ) as shown in Proposition 9, the second “bad” equilibrium path is opened,
which gives room for equilibrium path switching. A sunspot or sentiment can suddenly switch
 28
      Even if we set  = 0=8 as in earlier this section, the quantitative result here changes little.




                                                             42
the equilibrium path to the lower branch toward the “bad” steady state. Once that happens, the
economy experiences a plunge with \w falling by roughly 9% in one shot at w = 9. At the same time,
real uncertainty and Þnancial uncertainty surge, as shown in the panels in the third and fourth
rows of Figure 8. Fourth, after that, the economy moves along the path toward the “bad” steady
state, and \w and Nw declines further by around 8%.
   In contrast, if the shock is small, e.g., 2=5% as shown in the right panels of Figure 8, then
only the Þrst and second phases take place but not the third and fourth phases. After the shock,
the economy moves along the unique path toward the new “good” steady state. The total drop in
\w and Nw throughout the whole process is around 5%. There is no increase in real uncertainty or
Þnancial uncertainty in the entire process.

7    Conclusion

We develop a model of informational interdependence between Þnancial markets and the real econ-
omy. We endogenize Þnancial and real uncertainty and show how they relate to aggregate economic
activity. Information production in the real sector and that in the Þnancial sector exhibit strategic
complementarity. The key reason is that a Þnancial price is a combination of Þrm disclosure and
Þnancial market price discovery. When a Þrm tries to maximize its monopoly proÞts in the real
sector and speculators try to gain from arbitraging in Þnancial markets, it is optimal for them to
learn from each other. The mutual learning results in strategic complementarity in information
production. In the general equilibrium, the amount of information available in the economy and
the aggregate economic activity feed back into and reinforce each other. We derive a number of
implications of our general-equilibrium macro model. In the extension to the dynamic OLG setting,
our model shows self-fulÞlling uncertainty traps and characterizes a two-stage economic crisis.
    We have studied information production in a model with monopolistic competition with a
constant markup. A vast IO literature has also studied information acquisition and disclosure
under an oligopoly market structure (see, e.g., Vives (1984, 2008) and Yang (2018)). Examining
how dierent market structures aect the two-way feedback between Þnancial markets and the
real economy in general equilibrium will be an interesting topic of future research, as it can shed
some light on how informational frictions aect markups, a major driving force for business cycles
(Rotemberg and Woodford (1999)).

Proof of Proposition 6: Suppose an equilibrium is already found in which $ satisÞes J(eW ) ?
$ ? J(eWW ). Then, a slight increase in $ to $ + must be another equilibrium because J(eW+ ) ?
$ + ? J(eWW+ ). For the corner case, if an equilibrium satisÞes J(eW ) = $ ? J(eWW ), it is easy to show
that $ + or $3 must be another equilibrium because either J(eW+ ) ? $ + ? J(eWW+ ) or J(eW3 ) ?
$ 3 ? J(eWW3 ) must hold. A similar argument applies to the corner case of J(eW ) ? $ = J(eWW ).

B.1 Continuous Information Acquisition of the Firm
For tractability and closed-form solutions, we have assumed the binary choice of information ac-
quisition of the Þrm. Now we assume that the Þrm’s information acquisition is a continuous choice
and show that our model results do not change qualitatively. SpeciÞcally, to obtain signal vm with
                                                                                         Ck          2

   The two reaction functions (curves)  t ( v ; f) and  v ( t ; \> ]> e) give a unique equilibrium or
two (stable) equilibria for dierent levels of \ or ] as in Proposition 3. Similar to Figure 2 (for
the binary choice of information acquisition), Figure B.1 illustrates dierent cases of equilibrium
under the continuous choice of information acquisition.29


B.2 Signals about the Demand Shock of the Firm
For simplicity, in Section 2 we have assumed that the Þrm has no private information about the
demand shock %m . Now we relax this assumption. SpeciÞcally, we assume that the Þrm also
exogenously possesses a noisy signal on the demand shock:

                                                {m = %m + m ,                                            (B.3)

where m  Q (0> 1 ). It discloses this piece of information to the Þnancial market.
       In this case, the Þnancial market equilibrium gives (15), that is,
                              v

                                                           C
Based on (B.4), the key result of  t =  t ( v ; f) with C tv A 0 in Proposition 1 still holds. Intuitively,
the additional piece of disclosed information on m is public information for all Þnancial market
speculators. This is equivalent to these speculators having more precise information about the
prior distribution of m , and nothing else is aected.
    Firm m’s information set becomes {vm > {m > tm }. The ex ante expected proÞt of Þrm m perceived

    For a medium level of \ , the two curves have three intersections. The middle intersection corresponds to an
unstable equilibrium while the other two correspond to stable equilibria.

These are the key properties that are necessary for Proposition 2 to still hold. So Proposition 3
also holds.31
    Furthermore, we can let the Þrm endogenously choose to acquire signal {m . SpeciÞcally, it is
assumed that by paying an information acquisition cost ê A 0 (in terms of the Þnal good), the
Þrm receives a signal given in (B.3). It is easy to show that when ê is su!ciently low, the Þrm
endogenously chooses to acquire signal {m .

results demonstrate that even if the Þrm and the Þnancial market acquire information on the same
shock, their information acquisitions can exhibit a strategic complementarity (for the parameter
region of  % +   +  t A 2). The intuition behind the strategic complementarity is similar to the
explanation for (14). When  t is higher, the Þrm’s proÞt is scaled up. So the Þrm has a higher
stake to improve   when  t is higher. Of course, there is another standard substitution eect.
When the complementarity eect dominates the substitution eect (the condition  % +  + t A 2),
the overall eect is a strategic complementarity.

     According to Goldstein and Yang (2017a,b), the Þrm may optimally choose not to disclose its information on the
demand shock. In this case, the results of our main model will certainly hold true.

equilibrium means a Þxed-point problem between (W > WW ) and $. Therefore, similar to Propo-
sition 6, we have the following result: When there is heterogeneity in m across Þrms, there are

C.2 Continuous Information Acquisition of Firms in General Equilibrium
We continue to use the setup of continuous information acquisition of Þrms in Appendix B.1 and
show that the equilibrium of the full model is similar to that in Proposition 5. We still consider the
symmetric equilibrium, in which all intermediate goods Þrms have the same level of information
precision. We use Figure C.1 for illustration.
   As shown in Appendix B.1, the response function of a Þrm,  v ( t ; \> ]> e), has the properties
of C t A 0, C
   C v                       C v
             C\ A 0 and C] A 0. Then, when \ or ] increases, the curve of  v ( t ; \> ]> e)
                v

in Figure C.1 shifts upward.
                          ¡       We ¢ can Þnd a unique tangent point K. Denote the coordinates of
point K by ( t >  v ) =  K      K
                            t ,  v . Then, we can Þnd the unique corresponding ] that satisÞes

respectively deÞned in (24) and (26).¡ Similarly,   ¢  we can Þnd  a unique tangent point O. Denote the
coordinates of point O by ( t >  v ) =  t ,  v . Then, we can Þnd the unique corresponding ]¯ that
