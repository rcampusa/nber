We develop a theoretical model to study how changes in the durability of the goods affects prices
of stolen goods, the incentives to steal and the equilibrium crime rate. When studying the
production of durable goods, we find that the presence of crime affects consumer and producer
surplus and thus their behaviour, market equilibrium, and, in turn, the social optimum. Lower
durability of goods reduces the incentive to steal those goods, thus reducing crime. When crime is
included in the standard framework of durable goods, the socially optimal durability level is
lower. When considering different stealing technologies, perfect competition either over-produces
durability or produces zero (minimum) durability. The monopolist under-produces durability. The
model has a clear policy implication: the durability of goods, and the market structure for those
goods, can be an effective instrument to reduce crime. In particular, making the durability of a
good contingent upon that good being stolen is likely to increase welfare. We also study the
incentives to develop and use this optimal technology.

1. Introduction

Economic incentives are drivers of crime (Draca, Koutmeridis, and Machin, 2018). Durability, usually
referred as the inverse of the speed at which quality deteriorates, is an important feature of the quality
of the goods that is valued by consumers and affects the prices they are willing to pay for them.
Acquisitive crimes have mostly the purpose of selling the stolen goods. Therefore, durability affects the
incentives of prospective criminals to steal durable goods. In fact, most of the crime is property crime,
and mainly involves durable goods, which are not consumed or destroyed and can be used for a period
of time and are therefore costlier. The most popular of those are smartphones.

Crime and the durability of goods are then strongly connected issues. However, surprisingly, they have
been studied separately and there has not been any link between the literature on the production of
durable goods and the literature on crime. This paper explores the relationship between crime and the
durability of goods from a theoretical perspective. The paper draws important conclusions for both
topics and relevant policy implications to reduce crime. Advancing research on crime reducing and
crime deterrence strategies is highly important, especially for regions where crime and violence are
pervasive and bear substantial costs.

Interventions that attempt to reduce the level of durability of goods make stealing less profitable, which
leads to a reduction in the incidence of acquisitive crimes. Additionally, making the durability of goods
contingent on those goods being stolen would also likely increase welfare by diminishing the future
utility or resale value of those goods if they are stolen and therefore reduce the stealing level. Moreover,
traditional policy recommendations to reduce crime, such as an increase in the severity or celerity of
sanctions, probably have a lower impact in the long run through the equilibrium effect that the reduction
of crime have on the durability of the goods.

In this paper we develop a theoretical model to study the connection between durability and crime. To
do so we propose a model that adds crime to the standard framework of the production of durable goods.
Crime produces market and non-market externalities because the losses and damages it causes go
beyond the stolen objects and can lead to high social costs including long-lasting negative consequences,
even death. Therefore, by taken into account the possibility of the goods being stolen changes
significantly the standard results of the literature on durability. This is especially the case in countries
were crime is high and property crimes are very violent. In Latin America and Caribbean, for example,
the homicide rate in the occasion of robberies can be 15 per 100,000 inhabitants in some countries,
which is15- 20 times the overall homicide rate in advanced economies (UNODC; LAPOP, 2017).


                                                                                                          2
Our model has clear policy implications: the durability of goods, and the market structure under which
goods are produced, can affect crime. The model shows that crime reduces the optimal level of
durability. Unlike a scenario without crime, perfect competition does not provide the optimal durability
level, even if we do not consider the non-market externalities caused by crime. Two technologies for
stealing are studied: the random stealing technology in which durability is not observable (all types of
goods have the same probability of being stolen); and the selective stealing technology in which
durability is observable and, then, criminals target it. Perfect competition sets a durability level that is
higher than the social optimum, i.e., it over-produces durability under the random stealing technology
and produces zero durability under selective stealing. The monopoly market structure sets a durability
level that is lower than the social optimum, i.e., it under-produces durability, regardless of the stealing
technology. If we also consider the non-market externalities caused by crime, the optimal social level
of durability gets closer to the one that prevails under monopoly. If this externality is big enough, even
the monopoly market structure could over-produce durability.

In a setting with crime and production of durable goods, the model implies that the optimal situation
would be to make the durability of goods contingent on those goods being stolen. In this case, criminals
would not have any utility from stealing durable goods and therefore in equilibrium these goods would
not be targets. We study the conditions under which this technology of contingent durability is developed
and adopted under the different market structures considered in the paper. Results show that under a
monopoly market structure this technology could arise endogenously. However, in the case of perfect
competition and random stealing, public policies to create the incentives to produce and implement such
a technology would be needed.

Advancing the understanding of the causes of crime and of policies that could reduce crime rates is
important both for developed and developing countries. Crime has negative effects on the welfare of
individuals and societies. Crime and the threat of crime distort the allocation of resources from
governments, households, and firms, which translate into significant social and economic costs of crime
(Sah 1991; Jaitman 2017). Furthermore, understanding property crime is important as most of the crimes
recorded by the police are property crimes. In the United States, property crime represented 87 percent
of total crime in 2014, and financial losses suffered by victims of these crimes totalled approximately
$14.3 billion (FBI 2014). In England and Wales, property crime accounted for 70 percent of all crimes
recorded by the police in 2013–2014 (UK Office of National Statistics 2014). The consistently high
proportion of offenses attributable to property crimes means that acquisitive crimes are important drivers
of overall crime trends.



                                                                                                          3
A large component of property crimes worldwide involves durable goods. From 2002 to 2012 mobile
phones are the group of goods that increased the most in the range of goods stolen during burglaries in
England and Wales, accounting for 32 percent of stolen goods in burglaries in 2012 (Draca, Koutmeridis,
and Machin, 2018). Official data indicate that in 2013 more than a quarter of all thefts and over half of
grand larcenies from a person in New York City involved a smartphone. In Latin America, the most
violent region on earth (Jaitman, 2017), the share of durable goods in thefts and robberies is even greater.
According to victimization surveys in Chile, durable goods represented 96 percent of thefts and
robberies in 2013, in Colombia and Mexico cellular phones represent around 50 percent of thefts per
year (Chilean Subsecretaria de Prevención y Delito 2014, DANE 2014, and INEGI 2014). Motor
vehicles are another example of durable stolen goods that are often stolen, though its incidence in crime
decreased due to the implementation and expansion of technologies such as the electronic immobilizer
(Van Ours and Vollaard, 2016).

There has been remarkable progress in the analysis of crime from the criminology and crime economics
perspectives since Gary Becker’s seminal paper in 1968. Studies focusing on factors that increase the
expected costs or reduce the expected benefits of committing crimes led to important, mainly empirical,
contributions to the crime-reducing impact of different law enforcement, education, and employment
policies (see, for example, Machin et al., 2013 and Machin and Draca, 2015). However, the literature
on crime has mostly focused on the demand side of stolen goods (the criminals) and has not addressed
the producer side of the potentially stolen goods as an important determinant of the features of goods
that affect their prices. Durability is one of such features.

This paper therefore contributes to the increasing literature on crime economics with a novel approach.
The paper formally assesses the link between crime and the level of durability of goods. The production
of the potentially stolen goods is an understudied area which is relevant to find more effective crime
prevention and crime deterrence policies. The paper also contributes to the literature on goods durability.
Microeconomic theory has studied the optimal durability of goods to disentangle whether, under the
monopoly market structure, social optimum durability is achieved. This literature, which has evolved
since the 1960s, has found that under reasonable assumptions a monopolist under-produces durability,
as this feature of the goods links the production of present and future periods and in turn allows for
higher prices of new goods in the future periods. However, the microeconomic literature has not studied
the link between the optimal durability of goods and crime and crime.3

 The literature on durable goods has developed along various dimensions since the main contributions in the
1970s, which included Akerlof (1970) on adverse selection, Swan (1970, 1971) on optimal durability, and Coase
(1972) on time inconsistency. Although Akerlof’s contribution was not on durables, his main application was to

                                                                                                             4
The remaining of the paper is structured as follows. Next section discusses economic incentives to
commit crimes and the role of durability in the crime economics framework. Section 3 presents the
standard durability model and introduces the externality of crime. It then presents the set-up for our
analysis. Section 4 develops the model and studies the results under both monopoly and perfect
competition market structures. Section 5 concludes with a discussion of the main policy implications
derived from the analysis and presents avenues for future research and action.




2. Economic Incentives and Crime

How could the durability of goods affect the equilibrium crime rate? In the crime economics basic
framework (Becker 1968; Erlich 1973), durability can be considered one of the characteristics of goods
that potential criminals take into account when making their decision to get involved in illegal activities.
The durability increases the attractiveness of the goods. Under that framework, individuals act rationally
and therefore seek to maximize their well-being, comparing the expected costs and benefits of
participating in the legal or illegal sector. The benefits of committing a crime can be pecuniary benefits
and psychological benefits. The costs from participating in the illegal sector are usually the probability
of apprehension times sentences handed down to criminals. Thus, an individual will become a criminal
only if the net expected return of that activity exceeds the net return that will be obtained through a legal
activity which in a simplified form is the salary earned.

Under this crime economics framework, criminals can be deterred from committing crimes by policies
that either reduce the expected net benefits from crime vis-à-vis legal activities or increase the expected
payoff from working legally. For example, increasing the certainty, celerity, and severity of punishment
can reduce the net return to crime (by increasing the expected cost of criminal activity), while increases
in salaries in the legal sector can reduce the number of criminals. The parallel of that concept for the
purpose here is that a reduction in the durability of stolen goods can also reduce crime, since it reduces
the pecuniary benefits of crime. This is because it is intuitive to think that the less durable a good, the
lower its resale price will be and the lower its consumption value for the thief. Consequently, as the


the automobile market. In the 1990s, asymmetric information and adverse selection were included in models of
durable goods, and the literature initially advanced these models and then turned to other developments more
consistent with the real world. There have been important contributions in terms of the choice of the durability
level which we aim to contribute to. Studies include Hendel and Lizzeri (1999), Mussa and Rosen (1978), and
Waldman (1996a, 1996b), as well as product-line literature on the introduction of new products and research and
development, and on leasing markets, especially for cars (Hendel and Lizzeri 2002). However, this literature still
does not consider the presence of crime and its effect on the production of durability nor it addresses the
possibility that reducing the durability of a good could reduce the incentives to steal it.

                                                                                                                 5
benefits of illegal activities decrease, ceteris paribus, criminals will find it less profitable to devote
themselves to illegal activities. In an extreme case, if durability is zero once the goods are stolen, and
thus goods do not yield services after being stolen, criminals would not benefit from stealing goods, and
this type of acquisitive crime would not occur.

In fact, there seems to be supportive evidence for the criminological approach outlined by Clarke (1999,
2000), who stressed the role of a range of price and nonprice attributes in determining rates of theft
across goods. Durability is one such attribute that translates into prices. Due to the value of durability,
depending on the technology, it may be impossible or very difficult for the goods to be subject to theft.
As we will discuss later, what would be optimal is to have a level of durability that is contingent upon
the good being stolen. A proxy of this technology is available for mobile phones. If you report the device
as stolen and include it in international black lists through its unique identification number (IMEI) such
that companies can make the reconnection impossible. Thus, the only possible use of a stolen mobile
phone is to dismantle and sell the parts. Similar technologies were also developed for cars, other durable
targets, that can block the ignition to prevent anyone from starting the car upon it being stolen, or LoJack
tracking technologies of stolen cars when the police are given notice (see Ayres and Levitt, 1998,
Morgan et al. 2016, Potter and Thomas, 2001, for more information on the impact of vehicle security
technologies).

Although crime economics literature has expanded in the last decades, there are still gaps. Crime
economics has focused mainly on the deterrence effects of changing the costs of committing crimes,
particularly increases in the certainty, celerity, and severity of punishment through criminal justice
system reforms or law enforcement interventions (for a review see Chalfin and McCrary, 2017, and
Nagin, 2013). Another strand of the literature focuses on changes in the incentives to engage in legal
activities and explores the relationship between crime and unemployment or crime and education (Bell,
Costa and Machin 2016; Fougère, Pouget, and Kramarz 2009; Freeman 1999; Machin and Meghir
2004).

Less studied has been the question of how changes in the benefits from or returns to criminal activity
affect observed crime levels. In the case of property theft, a key determinant of the benefits derived from
crime is the financial value of stolen property, which is important both in terms of the resale potential
of the property and the extent of its utility for the criminal’s personal consumption. Thus, changes in
these benefits may affect criminal participation decisions. There are a few empirical studies that address
the issue of how the economic return of property crime may change crime levels. These include Reilly
and Witt (2008) on changes in prices of audio-visual goods, and D’Este (2014) on the availability in the


                                                                                                          6
United States of pawnshops, which are usually associated with increasing opportunities to sell stolen
goods. Also, Draca, Koutmeridis, and Machin (2018) study how criminals respond to changes in prices
by estimating crime-price elasticities estimated from a comprehensive crime dataset containing detailed
information on stolen items for London between 2002 and 2012. They find significant positive crime-
price elasticities for a panel of 44 consumer goods (mobile phones being the top 1) and for commodity
related goods (jewellery, fuel and metal crimes). The potential gains are a major empirical driver of
criminal activity and the changing structure of goods prices explains up to 15 percent of the observed
fall in property crime across all goods categories, and the majority of the sharp increases in the
commodity related goods observed between 2002 and 2012.

To the best of our knowledge the existing crime economics literature has not studied how the supply of
goods may affect crime. Analysing the production side of goods can shed light on a wider variety of
crime prevention policies that involve not only the public sector but also the private sector. Clearly,
lowering durability reduces the incentives to steal durable goods. This would potentially displace some
criminals to other types of crime (crowding out) and also would reduce the incentives to engage in illegal
activities (crowding in). The measurement of these effects is, nevertheless, beyond the scope of this
paper.




3. Introducing the Externality of Crime in the Durability Framework

Durable goods pose a number of questions for microeconomic analysis. One of the most important
questions that has been studied is whether a monopolist produces the “optimal” level of durability, or
more generally, under which conditions a monopolist under-produces the optimal durability level. All
the literature either implicitly or explicitly assumes that welfare is the sum of producer and consumer
surplus, and perfect competition leads to the optimal level of durability. In this section we first review
the main results in the durability literature and then introduce the externality of crime which is the key
building block of our model.

The initial main results in the literature concerning the choice of durability come from Swan (1970,
1971) and Sieper and Swan (1973), who consider a variety of settings in which the socially optimal
durability level is that which minimizes the cost of producing the service stream provided by the firm’s
output choices. Swan (1971) shows that, as a monopolist has an incentive to minimize the cost of
producing whatever service stream it provides, that monopolist will produce output with the socially
optimal level of durability. There are three important assumptions that lead to Swan’s results. First, the

                                                                                                        7
firm commits to a choice of price and durability for the future at an initial date. Second, the durable
product is valued for the services it yields, implying that units of services are perfect substitutes
irrespective of the age or the durability of the product from which they are derived. And third, the
lifetime distribution of the service stream generated by the durable good is fixed at the date of
production.

Bulow (1982, 1986) relaxes the first of the assumptions and shows that the firm faces a time-
inconsistency problem in a two-period setting due to the durability of the product, so the monopolist has
to reduce durability in the first period to mitigate this problem. Rust (1986) relaxes the second and third
assumptions and also finds that the monopolist chooses durability levels that are below the socially
optimal level. Hendel and Lizzeri (1999) use a model in which output can also be distorted and show
that the choice of durability is not optimal as durability may even be over-provided by the monopolist.

Along these lines Waldman (1996a) relaxes the second assumption in a set-up in which the monopolist
sells new goods of a better quality in each period and there is an operating second-hand market in which
old units are traded among consumers. One of the main results of his model is that durability is set below
the socially optimal level by the monopolist. The logic is that because new and used units are substitutes,
albeit imperfect ones, the price of a used unit on the second-hand market constrains the monopolist in
terms of the price it charges for new units. By reducing durability below the efficient level and thus the
quality of used units below that level, the monopolist reduces the substitutability between new and used
units, which, in turn, allows the firm to increase the price of new units. It is possible, in fact, to generalize
the above argument to state that a durable goods seller will have less incentive to reduce durability as
market power declines.4 For further developments of this model see Waldman (2003, 1996a, 1996b).5



4
  The logic is as follows. The return to reducing durability is the higher price the firm receives in the future for its
new units of output. A reduction in market power should thus decrease the firm’s incentive to reduce durability
for two reasons. First, similar to the above argument concerning perfect competition, as market power declines,
the price for new units will be determined more by the competition between the sellers of new units than by the
substitutability between new and old units. Second, there is a public good aspect to the problem that becomes more
important as market power declines. That is, the return to reducing durability is the higher price for new units in
the future, and as market power declines each seller is a smaller part of the total market and should thus internalize
a smaller and smaller proportion of this return (Waldman 1996a).

5
  Like Waldman (1996a), Waldman (1996b) also considers a durable goods monopoly model where new units of
output are of higher quality than old units. However, in contrast to the first analysis, in Waldman (1996b) the
monopolist does not face a durability choice; rather, quality deteriorates at an exogenously fixed speed. The focus
in Waldman (1996b) is on the incentive for a durable goods monopolist to eliminate the second-hand market.
Finally, another strand of the literature on the durability choice shows that it can also affect technological progress.
If products are too durable, potential innovators may lack the incentives to invest in the development of a new
technology and the economy may stagnate as a result (Fishman, Gandal, and Shy 1993).


                                                                                                                      8
3.1. Welfare function with crime

If we introduce the possibility that goods could be stolen and resold in a secondary illegal market, the
results regarding the socially optimal choice of durability may be affected. We begin our theoretical
investigation with the traditional utilitarian welfare function. We assume a simple additive relationship
of the form:

                                 𝑊 = ∑𝑖 𝐶𝑆𝑖 (𝑞𝑖 , 𝐷𝑖 ) + ∑𝑗 𝑃𝑆𝑗 (𝑞𝑗 , 𝐷𝑗 ) ,

where 𝐶𝑆 stands for consumer surplus and 𝑃𝑆 for producer surplus, 𝑞 is the quantity and 𝐷 the quality
of the good, and 𝑖 indexes consumers while 𝑗 indexes firms. Quality is positively associated with the
durability of the good and in this case the only feature of quality considered is the durability so D will
represent the durability in the rest of the paper. Following Waldman (1996a), we will refer to durability
as the choice of the inverse of the speed with which the quality of a unit deteriorates.

It is intuitive to think that the greater the durability of a good, the higher its selling price and the larger
the likelihood of property crimes to which it may be subject. This in turn will reduce welfare, thus the
welfare function becomes:



                        𝑊 = (∑ 𝐶𝑆𝑖 (𝑞𝑖 , 𝐷𝑖 ) + ∑ 𝑃𝑆𝑗 (𝑞𝑗 , 𝐷𝑗 ), 𝐶𝑟𝑖𝑚𝑒(𝑞, 𝐷)).
                                  𝑖                  𝑗


It is clear that the cost of crime includes externalities. Apart from the losses and inconveniences of
acquisitive crimes, thefts can become violent, producing further physical and psychological injuries.
Robbery is an intrinsically violent crime, and, in fact, it is defined as theft accomplished by force or the
threat of physical injury. Robbery is mainly of durable goods. In an extreme case, violent robbery proves
fatal to the victim. This is a relatively rare event given that there are millions of thefts and robberies
annually. Nevertheless, the probability of robbery homicides is a major contributor to the public’s fear
of crime. The costs associated with fatal robberies, the fear of getting robbed, and the psychological
traumas caused by being robbed are clearly not included in the traditional welfare (consumer surplus +
producer surplus) model. The size of this non-market externality seems to vary across countries. We
present empirical support for this point in Figure 1, which shows the percentage of victims of a crime
due to armed robbery, and Figure 2, which shows the homicide rate of victims killed during the
commission of a robbery per 100,000 people.




                                                                                                             9
More violent acquisitive crimes seem to be common in Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC), but
less so in developed countries. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, in 2014
approximately 15 percent of robberies led to homicides in LAC, compared to the world average of 9.1
percent (considering a sample of 33 countries). In countries such as Jamaica, 46 percent of homicide
victims were killed during the commission of a robbery compared to 5 percent in the United States.

This heightened degree of violence is also illustrated in victimization surveys. According to the 2014
Latin American Public Opinion Project, armed robbery accounted on average for 26 percent of total
crimes in the region in 2014. In contrast, in the United States, only 5 percent of crimes were armed
robberies. Furthermore, in 2014, 13 percent of victims of crime in LAC were victims of unarmed
robbery, but which involved assault or physical threat, while in the United States that figure was for
only 5 percent of crimes. In developed countries crime has a lower incidence but still represents sizeable
costs. For example, recent estimates of the costs of victimization for Australia show that the impact of
violent crime is on average around USD65 for victims in an individual level model (Johnston, Schields,
and Suziedelyte, 2017).

As will be shown in the following section, the durability of goods influences the incidence of crime. The
choice of a lower level of durability by producers would reduce the amount of robberies and
consequently reduce violence and the externality of crime. If our objective is to reduce crime, we need
to set 𝐷 (the durability of goods) low. The optimal action, provided the necessary technology is cheap
enough, is to design a good that once stolen depreciates completely as will be developed later.
Unfortunately, the technology for achieving this is not cheap enough or even available for all goods.

4. The Model

This section introduces the possibility of the occurrence of crime into the durable goods theoretical
framework. We build upon Waldman (1996a), who models a world without crime and shows that a
monopolist would produce a durability level lower than that which is socially optimal in a two-period
model. We first present Waldman’s results in order to then develop the model with the introduction of
crime. Thus, we take Waldman’s model to be our benchmark world without crime.

In our case, in the second period there is a second-hand market for used goods, but there is also a stolen
goods market. Two technologies for theft are introduced: “selective stealing,” in which the goods are
targeted by the thieves and the most valuable goods are stolen “first”; and “random stealing,” in which
all the goods have the same probability of being stolen. The social optimum is characterized taking into



                                                                                                        10
consideration both the consumer and producer surplus as well as the externality that arises because of
crime. Finally, we solve the model for the case of the monopolist.

4.1. The Benchmark Durability Model

Waldman (1996a) considers a world without crime and a monopoly that faces pricing problems of what
might be a product line: a quality-differentiated spectrum of goods of the same generic type. In this case
it is a durable good that yields unit services that are not perfect substitutes in production and in
consumption irrespective of the durability of the product. The seller knows the distribution of tastes and
demands in the market but cannot distinguish between buyers so cannot engage in price discrimination.

Waldman (1996a) presents a two-period world in which output lasts for two periods, 𝑡 = 1, 2. In each
period the firm chooses how much durability to build into its output, where the durability choice, denoted
as 𝐷𝑡 in period 𝑡 , affects both the marginal cost of production and the speed with which quality
deteriorates. In each period, the firm faces a constant marginal cost of production 𝑐(𝐷𝑡 ) where 𝑐 ′ (0) =
0; 𝑐′(𝐷) > 0 and 𝑐′′(𝐷) > 0 for all 𝐷 > 0. Waldman (1996a) assumes no fixed costs, although adding
small fixed costs does not change his results qualitatively.

In each period 𝑡, new units of the product are of quality 𝑄 𝑁 , while in the second period units that are
                                                                             ′
one period old are of quality 𝑄 0 (𝐷1 ), where 𝑄 0 (0) = 0; 𝑄 0 (∞) < 𝑄 𝑁 ; 𝑄 0 (0) = ∞, 𝑄 0 ′(𝐷) > 0, and
𝑄 0 ′′(𝐷) < 0 for all 𝐷 ≥ 0.

There are two types of consumers, and each type lives two periods. There is a mass of size 𝑛1 of type 1
consumers and a mass of size 𝑛2 of type 2 consumers. The gross utility of a representative consumer of
type i is 𝑣𝑖 𝑄 with 𝑣2 > 𝑣1 > 0 when the good is bought legally (in Waldman's model, the only
possibility because so far, we have not incorporated illegal markets). Consumers are constrained to
consume zero units or one unit of the good. Finally, firms and consumers have a common discount factor
𝛿, 0 < 𝛿 < 1.

The timing is as follows: in the first period, the firm sets the durability choice and price for a new unit
of output and the consumers decide what to purchase; in the second period, the firm sets the durability
choice and price for a new unit of output, consumers decide what to purchase from the firm, and a
second-hand market also emerges in which consumers can trade used goods at prices that equate supply
and demand.




                                                                                                        11
To reduce the number of cases that need to be considered, Waldman (1996b) assumes the following
restrictions on the parameters:

                                               𝑛1 > 𝑛2                                                 (1)
                                𝑣1 𝑄 𝑁 + 𝛿𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷) < 𝑐(𝐷)         ∀𝐷                                 (2)
                                    𝑣2 (𝑄 𝑁 − 𝑄 0 (∞)) > 𝑐(0),                                         (3)


where equation (1) implies that the demand for used goods is greater than the supply so in equilibrium,
if there is a market for used goods, as turns out to be the case, the price is positive. Equation (2) It states
that the valuation of type 1 consumers (𝑣1 ) is sufficiently small that the firm does not have an incentive
to sell a new unit of output to a type 1 consumer in either period. Finally, the interpretation of equation
(3) is that the valuation of type 2 consumers is high enough to ensure that the firm finds it profitable to
produce new units of output in the second period.

Waldman solved the model for a monopolistic firm and finds the following equilibrium characterized
by 𝑃𝑡𝑁′ , the equilibrium price for a new unit of output in period t, and 𝐷𝑡′ ,the monopolist’s equilibrium
durability choice in period t. In the second period the optimal durability would be 𝐷2′ = 0 as there is no
further period. Waldman solves the model for the monopolist who chooses the durability of goods in
period one, 𝐷1′, to maximize its pofits:

          𝑀𝑎𝑥𝐷1 = 𝑣2 𝑄 𝑁 − 𝑐(𝐷1 ) + 𝛿{(𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷1 ) + 𝑣2 [𝑄 𝑁 − 𝑄 0 (𝐷1 )] + 𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷1 )) − 𝑐(0)}.

The price the monopolist can charge in period one to high value consumers is 𝑃1𝑁 = 𝑣2 𝑄 𝑁 +
𝛿𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷1 ) and in period two the price of new goods is 𝑃2𝑁 = 𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷1′ ) + 𝑣2 [𝑄 𝑁 − 𝑄 0 (𝐷1 )]; so that
high type consumers are willing to buy a new good from the monopolist and sell their old good in the
second-hand market to low type consumers. Therefore, the monopolist would choose a durability 𝐷1′
that is defined implicitly by the following equation (4) if 2𝑣1 > 𝑣2 :


                                        𝑣2
                               𝛿 [2 −      ] 𝑣 𝑄 0 ′(𝐷1′ ) − 𝑐′(𝐷1′ ) = 0                              (4)
                                        𝑣1 1




In t = 2, type 2 consumers sell old units to type 1 consumers at price 𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷1′ ).

Note that if 2𝑣1 ≤ 𝑣2 , the equilibrium is characterized by: 𝑃1𝑁′ = 𝑣2 𝑄 𝑁 ; 𝐷1′ = 0



                                                                                                             12
                                             𝑃2𝑁′ = 𝑣2 𝑄 𝑁 ; 𝐷2′ = 0.

Is 𝐷1′ the socially optimal level of durability? Waldman solves the problem to find 𝐷1∗ , the socially
optimal level of durability that should be such that the marginal costs of increasing durability should
equal the marginal benefit to consumers of increased durability. Thus, the socially optimal durability
choice in period 1 satisfies this condition:


                                      𝛿𝑣1 𝑄 0 ′(𝐷1∗ ) − 𝑐′(𝐷1∗ ) = 0                                         (5)




The first order condition in (5) is the same first order condition as in perfect competition. Therefore, in
Waldman setting perfect competition produces the socially optimal level of durability and the results
show 0 < 𝐷1′ < 𝐷1∗, thus the monopolist under-produces durability. The underlying reasoning is that if
the monopolist produces durable output in t = 1, then in t = 2 the price of the second-hand market limits
what the firm charges for new units, as consumers have old units and otherwise would keep consuming
those rather than buy new ones. Given this linkage between periods, the monopolist has incentives to
lower the durability of the first period to be able to charge a higher price in the second period for its new
units. Therefore, Waldman (1996a) concludes that the durability in equilibrium is lower than it would
be at the socially optimal level in period one (though in the second period it is socially optimal). Finally,
Waldman shows that if v1 is small enough, the monopoly does not have incentives to produce durable
goods in the first period and thus eliminates the second-hand market in the second period.

4.2 The Model with Crime

In this section we allow for crime to occur in the model. We state the general problem with the necessary
modifications to include the possibility of crime and in the following sections we will provide the
solution for perfect competition, for the social optimum and for the monopolist in order to compare the
three scenarios.

To allow for crime to occur we introduce a stealing function that could be considered as a reduced form
of a crime model. At the beginning of the second period the consumer who owns a good can be victim
of a theft or robbery.6 We assume that there is a cost of stealing a mass of size 𝑚 goods, given that there


6
  We use the terms “theft” and “robbery” interchangeably in this paper to refer to the subtraction of goods from
the legal owner. Use of violence is not included in this model, thus there is no difference between theft and robbery
here. The externality of crime exists both for thefts and robberies.

                                                                                                                   13
                                                                                             𝑚2 𝑘
is a mass of size ℎ goods that could be stolen. This cost is defined as: 𝑠(𝑚; ℎ) =            ℎ
                                                                                                    (for example,

assume 𝑘 ≥ 𝑣2 𝑄 𝑁 ). 7 When a good is stolen, the owner loses the good and can neither consume nor sell
it.

In this setting the utility function of the consumer also changes to incorporate buying from the illegal
market. On the demand side, there are still two types of consumers. There is a mass of size 𝑛1 of type 1
consumers, and a mass of size 𝑛2 of type 2 consumers. Consumers can distinguish perfectly between
used and stolen goods. The gross utility of a representative consumer of type i is 𝑣𝑖 𝑄, with 𝑣2 > 𝑣1 > 0
when the good is bought legally and 𝛼𝑣𝑖 𝑄 when it is bought illegally (i.e., if it was stolen and sold in
the illegal market) with 0≤ α <1. The three assumptions on the parameters made in the previous section
still hold, but equation (1) now means that in equilibrium, if there is a market for used goods, the price
is positive and there could be incentives for stealing the good.

The sequence of the game is as follows. In the first period, production takes place and firms market their
output. In the second period, goods bought in the first period can be stolen, production takes place, and
firms, owners of used goods, and thieves can sell their goods.

Note that if a technology were available to make the durability of goods contingent upon the good being
stolen, it would be optimal to set durability equal to 0 for the stolen goods. This would reduce the value
of the stolen goods to zero and thus, there would be no crime. When such a technology to discriminate
durability in the second period is possible, it is similar to setting 𝛼 = 0. Therefore, the model goes back
to Waldman (1996a), a world without crime, as stated earlier. As noted above, this seems to be the
direction in which technological developments and regulations tend to be evolving to.8

However, such a technology is not available for all goods. Thus, we examine the case where it is not
possible to make durability contingent upon goods being stolen. We implicitly assume that if it is
possible to provide a differential durability for goods when they are stolen but the technology cannot
make the good completely worthless, this would reduce consumers’ valuation of stolen goods but not to
zero. We can think that this reduces the valuation to α < α’, where α’𝑣𝑖 𝑄 would be the valuation of a
stolen good for a consumer of type i if there is no reduction in durability when the good is stolen.


7
  To simplify matters, we take this stealing cost function as a reduced form of the crime model à la Becker (1968).
8
  For example, new smartphones have applications to allow for blocking a lost or stolen device and make the
mobile phones worthless in the illegal market. Similarly, the car industry is promoting the use of immobilizers. In
addition to these, police departments are encouraging consumers to register their goods in rosters such as
"immobilize.com" to control that in second-hand shops there are no sales of stolen goods or promote reporting to
the police thefts of phones to block the unique identification number of the devices (IMEI).

                                                                                                                14
Moreover, in section 4.6. we study the incentives to introduce a technology to produce durability
contingent on the goods being stolen under different market structures.

We introduce two different technologies of stealing goods. In the first one, whenever there is
heterogeneity of the goods (i.e., goods with different 𝐷), the ones with a higher durability and thus a
higher resale value are stolen, which we call selective stealing. In the second one, the thieves are not
able to distinguish the quality of goods, or equivalently the stolen good arrives randomly, so any good
has the same probability of being stolen. We call this random stealing.

We proceed now to solve the model backwards in general terms without choosing stealing technologies
or market structure. Note that when there is a market in the second period for used and stolen goods the
price of old used goods with durability 𝐷(𝑃2𝑂𝐷 ) and the price of stolen goods with durability 𝐷(𝑃2𝑆𝐷 )
are characterized by the same functions, regardless of the market structure and stealing technology
considered.

Lemma 1. Whenever there is a market in the second period for used and stolen goods:

    1. The price of the used goods with durability D is:
                                                𝑃2𝑂𝐷 = 𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷1 )
    2. The price of the stolen goods with durability D is:
                                               𝑃2𝑆𝐷 = 𝛼𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷1 )

The intuition of lemma 1 is that, since the quantity of consumers who demand both used and stolen
goods is higher than the supply, the equilibrium price is the buyers’ reservation price.

4.2.1. Stealing Technologies

We introduce two different technologies of stealing goods. In the first one, whenever there is
heterogeneity of the goods (i.e., goods with different 𝐷), the ones with a higher durability and thus a
higher resale value are stolen, which we call selective stealing. In the second one, the thieves are not
able to distinguish the quality of goods, or equivalently the stolen good arrives randomly, so any good
has the same probability of being stolen. We call this random stealing.

Note that under selective stealing the costs of stealing are independent of the durability of the good, and
the price of output depends positively on the durability of the good. Therefore, when there is selective
stealing, the goods chosen to be stolen are those with greater durability. Given 𝐹(𝐷), the distribution of
durability 𝐷, when there is selective stealing the thieves’ problem is deciding the cut-off point of

                                                                                                        15
durability. The gains of stealing are the price of the goods stolen minus the cost of stealing. Thus, the
thieves have to solve the following problem:

                                                                       ∞
                                          ∞                          (∫𝐷 𝑓(𝑠)𝑑𝑠ℎ)2 𝑘
                                𝑀𝑎𝑥𝐷 ℎ ∫𝐷 𝛼𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝑠)𝑓(𝑠)𝑑𝑠 −               ℎ
                                                                                       .


The first order condition is:


                                 0 (𝐷 ∗ )𝑓(𝐷 ∗𝑆𝑆 )
                                                        2(1 − 𝐹(𝐷 ∗𝑆𝑆 ))𝑓(𝐷 ∗𝑆𝑆 )ℎ2 𝑘
                      −ℎ𝛼𝑣1 𝑄                         +                               = 0,
                                                                     ℎ

or similarly:


                            −𝛼𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷∗𝑆𝑆 ) + 2(1 − 𝐹(𝐷 ∗𝑆𝑆 ))𝑘 = 0.                                (6)

Therefore, we obtain the following result:

Lemma 2. When there is selective stealing goods of a durability greater than 𝐷 ∗𝑆𝑆 are stolen, while
those of lesser durability are not stolen. Whenever there is a positive mass of goods of durability 𝐷 ∗𝑆𝑆 ,
some of the goods of a durability equal to 𝐷 ∗𝑆𝑆 are stolen and some are not. 𝐷 ∗𝑆𝑆 is defined implicitly
by equation (6).

We now introduce the random stealing technology. Given the distribution of durability 𝐷 (𝐹(𝐷)),
when there is random stealing the goods that are stolen are randomly “chosen.” Thus, the thieves’
decision involves the quantity of goods to be stolen and not the cut-off point of durability, as in the
previous case. This quantity comes from maximizing the gains of stealing, which are the quantity stolen
times the average price, minus the stealing cost. Thus, in order to determine the optimal quantity, thieves
have to maximize the following problem:

                                               ∞
                                                                           (𝑚)2 𝑘
                                𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑚 (𝑚 ∫ 𝛼𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝑠)𝑓(𝑠)𝑑𝑠 −                     ).
                                              0                              ℎ
The solution to this problem is:




                                                  ∞
                                           ℎ ∫0 𝛼𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝑠)𝑓(𝑠)𝑑𝑠                                    (7)
                                      ∗
                                    𝑚 =                                .
                                                          2𝑘


Therefore, we obtain the following result:


                                                                                                           16
Lemma 3. When there is random stealing the quantity of stolen goods is given by equation (7).

Note that given the assumption about k, this value is always smaller than h, which represents the mass
that can be stolen.

It is important to note that in the case of selective stealing thieves decide on a threshold in the durability
level above which they steal, whereas in random stealing they choose the optimal quantity of goods that
they would steal. In this case of random stealing then there will be a probability of goods being stolen
                                                                                                 𝑚∗

In the following sections we solve for the optimal durability for the cases of perfect competition, the
social optimum and the monopolist highlighting the similarities and differences among the different
cases and between this crime scenario and Waldman model.

4.3. Perfect Competition

In this section we solve the optimal durability for the perfect competition case. Given the assumptions
stated in section 4.2. and Lemma 1, firms should solve for the level of durability and prices in each
period. In the second period the optimal durability is 𝐷2𝑃𝐶 = 0 where PC denotes perfect competition.
So, the problem that the firms should solve is to choose the optimal level of durability to produce in the
first period taking into account that now goods can be stolen in the second period which is taken into
consideration by the consumers while making buying decisions. In the second period the prices for the
used and stolen goods, if these markets emerge, are those of Lemma 1. We explore the solution for the
different stealing technologies.

Lemma 2 provides a threshold of durability 𝐷 ∗𝑆𝑆 above which goods are stolen under the selective
stealing technology. Given lemma 2, it is possible to infer that nobody will produce, under perfect
competition, a good with durability greater than 𝐷 ∗𝑆𝑆 , since this good will be stolen with probability
one. This is because type 2 consumers are indifferent to buying such a good or buying a good with
durability 𝐷 = 0, which is never stolen. Thus, the goods would have the same price, and a good with
durability 𝐷 = 0 is cheaper to produce.9 In addition, if a good of durability 𝐷 is stolen with positive
probability (but smaller than one), it is better to sell a good with durability 𝐷 − 𝜀, which is never stolen,




9
  If there is a cost of being a victim of a robbery beyond the loss of the good, as happens, the consumer will
strictly prefer to buy a good with durability 𝐷 = 0.

                                                                                                                 17
since the utility of the consumer is higher and it is cheaper to produce. Thus, we have the following
result:

Proposition 1. Under perfect competition and selective stealing, only goods with durability 𝐷 = 0 are
produced. There is no crime and the price is 𝑃1𝑃𝐶

                                                                  = 𝑐(0). Type 1 consumers never
consume this good.

This means that under selective stealing and perfect competition, there are no durable goods. This is
because it is not possible to sustain any positive durability for a used good.

Now we turn to the case of random stealing. Lemma 3 provides the optimal amount of goods to be stolen
if durability is unobservable or goods appear randomly, and from Lemma 3 the probability of goods
                     𝑚∗
being stolen is      ℎ
                          . When we study the case of perfect competition, we know that the probability that a
good is stolen is independent of the durability of the good. It is important to note that each firm will
maximize its profit, taking the probability as given (as they are too small to affect this probability), and
produce the quality that maximizes consumers’ utility. Competition will drive profits to zero. The
durability level that would be produced comes from maximizing the utility of the consumer, taking the
probability of stealing as given, minus the production cost. Thus, firms solve the following problem:
                                                   ∞
                                                  ∫0 𝛼𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝑠)𝑓(𝑠)𝑑𝑠
                   𝑀𝑎𝑥𝐷1 = 𝑣2 𝑄 𝑁 + 𝛿 {[(1 −                             ) 𝑣1 𝑄0 (𝐷1 )]} − 𝑐(𝐷1 ),      (8)
                                                          2𝑘

          𝑚∗       ∫0 𝛼𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝑠)𝑓(𝑠)𝑑𝑠
where          =                          is the probability that a good is stolen and 𝑓(𝑠) the distribution of
          ℎ                2𝑘

durability.

Proposition 2. Under perfect competition and random stealing, the durability 𝐷𝑃𝐶 is given, implicitly,
by the following equation:

                                      𝛼𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷𝑃𝐶 )
                           𝛿 [(1 −                  ) 𝑣1 𝑄 0 ′(𝐷𝑃𝐶 )] − 𝑐 ′ (𝐷𝑃𝐶 ) = 0.               (9)
                                           2𝑘

Proof: All the firms will set durability that maximizes equation (8). Then, all of them will produce the
good with the same durability, that is, 𝐷𝑃𝐶 , so:

                                            ∞
                                          ∫0 𝛼𝑣1 𝑄0 (𝑠)𝑓(𝑠)𝑑𝑠 𝛼𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷𝑃𝐶 )
                                                             =              .
                                                  2𝑘               2𝑘

Note that equation (9) always has a unique solution because:


                                                                                                              18

                                                        ] − 𝑐 ′′ (𝐷)   < 0 ∀𝐷, and
               𝛼𝑣1𝑄 0 (∞)

                  2𝑘

Thus, under random stealing and perfect competition, there are durable goods and there is also crime. If
we compare the optimal level of durability in perfect competition in this setting with crime with the
result in Waldman of equation (5), we see that the durability level without crime is lower for perfect
competition.

Having determined the levels of durability in perfect competition under both selective stealing
(Proposition 1) and random stealing (Proposition 2), we turn now to the social optimum and the
monopoly market structure. In both cases we will restrict our analysis to having homogeneity regarding
durability. We did not prove that this has to be the case, but neither did we find a case in which this does
not hold. We use this assumption so that we can make comparisons with the perfect competition case.
Given that there is only one level of durability, which goods are going to be stolen is random under both
technologies. Thus, under centralized decision (social optimum and monopoly) the durability is
independent on the stealing technology.

4.4. Social Optimum

The social optimum comes from solving the following problem:

                                                                2𝑘
                                                                                                   2

                                                           2𝑘                             2𝑘          𝑛2
                                                                           𝑣1 𝑄0 (𝐷1 )

Note that the first argument is the total market surplus, and the second term is the externality that derives
from crime. The first argument is composed of the consumer surplus plus the producer surplus:

consuming in the second period those goods that are not stolen and are produced in the first period.
𝛿{𝑣2 𝑄𝑁 − 𝑐(0)} is the welfare produced by the production of goods in the second period that are
consumed by type 2 consumers. We also incorporate into the welfare function the welfare obtained by
                                                                             2

                                                                                   )],   where 0 ≤ 𝜙 < 1 is the weight that we

give to this welfare. We discount it since it is appropriated by thieves.

Having set the problem, the optimal durability is that which makes:


                   𝛼𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷𝑆𝑂 )     𝛼 2 𝑣1 𝑄0 (𝐷𝑆𝑂 )    𝛼 2 𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷𝑆𝑂 )

                               2𝑘

In order to compare the social optimum with the case of perfect competition and monopoly, we will
assume away the externality 𝑊2 = 0 and we will not consider the welfare appropriated by the thieves,
i.e., 𝜙 = 0. Note that the first assumption increases the social optimum because the cost caused by the
externality is not considered, while the second assumption reduces the social optimum because it reduces
the benefits.

Under these assumptions the social optimum satisfies the following equation:

                𝛼𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷𝑆𝑂 )
     𝛿 [1 −                    ] 𝑣1 𝑄 0 ′(𝐷𝑆𝑂 ) −   𝑐′(𝐷𝑆𝑂 ) = 0.                                                            (10)

Note that equation (10) always has a unique solution because:

4.5. Monopoly

We now switch to the case of a monopoly market structure. We will first analyse the case where 2𝑣1 >
𝑣2 . The monopolist will solve the following problem:10

                                                 𝛼𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷1 )
𝑀𝑎𝑥𝐷1 = 𝑣2 𝑄 𝑁 − 𝑐(𝐷1 ) + 𝛿 {(1 −                             ) 𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷1 ) + 𝑣2 [𝑄 𝑁 − 𝑄 0 (𝐷1 )] + 𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷1 ) − 𝑐(0)}.
                                                     2𝑘

The price that the monopolist would charge in the first period for a good with durability 𝐷1 is 𝑣2 𝑄 𝑁 +
         𝛼𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷1 )
𝛿 (1 −       2𝑘
                      ) 𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷1 ),    which is the valuation that the type 2 consumer obtains from consuming

the good in the first period 𝑣2 𝑄 𝑁 plus the price that he or she gets from selling the good to a type 1
consumer in the second period, 𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷1 ), which is discounted by the discount rate 𝛿 and the probability
                   𝛼𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷1 )
of being stolen        2𝑘
                                .   This amount minus the production cost 𝑐(𝐷1 ) is the monopoly’s profit in the

first period. In the second period, the monopolist would charge a price of 𝑣2 [𝑄 𝑁 − 𝑄 0 (𝐷1 )] + 𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷1 )
and have a cost of 𝑐(0), and these benefits would be discounted by the discount factor.

Therefore, the monopolist would decide on a durability that is defined implicitly by the following
equation:

                                     𝛼𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷𝑀 )     𝑣
                         𝛿 [1 −                      − 𝑣2 + 1] 𝑣1 𝑄 0 ′(𝐷𝑀 ) − 𝑐′(𝐷𝑀 ) = 0.
                                          𝑘                1                                                                  (11)

Equation (11) is the analogous to equation (4) but adding crime. Comparing the two equations it is easy
to show that with crime the optimal level of durability for the monopolist is lower than in the model
without crime. Note that for the case in which we have assumed 2𝑣1 > 𝑣2 , equation (11) has a unique
solution that comes from the following facts:

                   𝛼𝑣1 𝑄 0 (0)   𝑣2                    ′
     1. 𝛿 [1 −         𝑘

                   𝛼𝑣1 𝑄 0 (∞)   𝑣2                     ′
     2. 𝛿 [1 −         𝑘

  The Appendix shows that the monopoly will never choose to sell new goods in the second period only to type
2 consumers who have been victims of a robbery.

                                                                                                                                     21
In the case where 2𝑣1 ≤ 𝑣2 , the right-hand side of equation (11) is smaller than zero, thus the solution
is to set 𝐷 = 0. Therefore, in this case, the monopoly would not be able to provide any durability. Note
that this result is the same as in Waldman (1996a) as we showed in section 4.1.

4.6. Endogenous Crime Contingent Durability Technology

In the preceding sections we have noticed that one of the main policy implications for scenarios with
crime would be to reduce to zero the level of durability upon the good being stolen. A technology that
would produce that outcome would increase welfare and in the model the results would go back to the
benchmark model without crime (Waldman 1996b). The existence of such crime contingent durability
technology was considered an exogenous variable up to now.

In this section we analyse which are the market structures and the stealing technologies that would
provide incentives to adopt, and to develop such technology. The existence of this technology would be
endogenous. Therefore, we first need to examine the incentives to adopt this technology if it is available,
as a necessary condition to later analyse the incentives to develop such technology. If the technology
which makes durability contingent upon the goods being stolen is available the following proposition
holds:

Proposition 3. When there is a technology available to make durability contingent on the goods being
stolen (D=0 if the goods are stolen) which is cheap enough but not free: 1) It is socially optimal to
implement such technology (if 𝜙 is small enough), 2) Under perfect competition and selective stealing
it would be implemented, 3) A monopoly would implement the technology, and 4) Under perfect
competition and random stealing such technology would not be implemented.

Proof: 1) Crime reduces the Social Welfare. Therefore, if this technology sets D=0 if the goods are
stolen, crime would disappear. Thus, it is socially optimal to implement such technology provide it is
cheap enough. 2) Consumers are willing to pay to have this technology that would make crime disappear
and prevent them from being victims of thefts or robberies. Consequently, firms under perfect
competition would implement it. 3) Following the same reasoning as 2), the monopoly would implement
the crime contingent durability technology. 4) Assuming that thieves cannot distinguish between goods
with and without the technology, under random stealing the technology does not change the probability
of goods being stolen. Therefore, consumers are not willing to pay for having the technology, thus
perfect competitive firms would not implement it.




                                                                                                        22
Therefore, when the technology is available (and cheap enough) all the results go back to the benchmark
model without crime but the case of perfect competition and random stealing which remains as in
Proposition 2.

We now turn to discuss when firms would have incentives to invest in the development of crime
contingent durability technologies. As in standard economic models, firms would have incentives to
invest in developing a technology whenever they can appropriate its benefits. This is also the case of
crime contingent durability technologies. Monopolies are able to appropriate part of the benefit while
perfect competitors do not. Thus, under the monopoly market structure there would be investment to
develop the technologies unlike the perfect competition setting. Instruments generally used to provide
incentives to invest in research and development are patents which imply giving to the innovator the
“legal monopoly” for a certain period of time. Therefore, in the case of perfect competition it is necessary
a “public intervention” to generate investment to develop a technology, or that the technology is
developed and then sold to the firms (see Romer, 1990). Moreover, in the case of random stealing a
“public intervention” would also be necessary to implement such technology when it is available.

4.7. Results’ Comparison Under Alternative Setups

Waldman’s model is naturally the benchmark case analysed. In this benchmark, there is no crime and,
hence, the social welfare function does not take into account either crime externalities or the transfers
associated with crime. Thus, comparing our results with those of Waldman is the same as comparing a
world with crime (our model) to a world without crime (Waldman’s model).

The monopolist in a world with crime produces less durability than it does if there would not be the
possibility of crime occurring (Waldman’s model). The level of durability under perfect competition
and the social optimum are also smaller than under Waldman’s analysis as can be showed comparing
the first order conditions that implicitly define the optimal durability of section 4.1 with section 4.3-4.6.
A big difference is that while under Waldman’s setup the results with perfect competition and the social
optimum are the same, in our setup with crime they are not due to the externalities that crime produces.
There is over-production of durability under random stealing and under-production under selective
stealing.

From our model it can be easily shown that when there is random stealing if 2𝑣1 > 𝑣2 , 0 < 𝐷𝑀 <
𝐷𝑆𝑂 < 𝐷𝑃𝐶 , and if 2𝑣1 ≤ 𝑣2 , 0 = 𝐷𝑀 < 𝐷𝑆𝑂 < 𝐷𝑃𝐶 , which means that there are durable goods under
the random stealing and perfect competition scenario, crime can occur. When there is random stealing,
the monopolist sets a durability level that is lower than the social optimum, i.e., it under-produces

                                                                                                          23
durability, but perfect competition sets a durability level that is higher than the social optimum, i.e., it
over-produces durability. The intuition of this result is that the firms in perfect competition do not
internalize the fact that they can affect the probability of goods being stolen by their durability choice.
Therefore, they take such probability as given and, in the aggregate, they produce a level of durability
that turns out to be higher than the social optimum. The monopolist, to the contrary, directly affects the
aggregate level of durability and the incidence of crime and internalize this fact.

However, when there is selective stealing if 2𝑣1 > 𝑣2 , 0 < 𝐷𝑀 < 𝐷𝑆𝑂 , there are durable goods under
monopoly so crime can occur, while there is no crime when there is perfect competition. If 2𝑣1 ≤
𝑣2 , then 0 = 𝐷𝑀 < 𝐷𝑆𝑂 . In both scenarios, the durability level that prevails with a monopoly is lower
than the socially optimal level. Remember that from proposition 1 we know that when there is selective
stealing, durability under perfect competition is equal to zero.

To avoid crime in equilibrium, it would be optimal to have a crime contingent durability technology to
reduce durability to zero upon the goods being stolen. In the previous section we expanded the model
to consider the incentives to adopt and to develop such technology. Table 1 summarizes the different
results for all market structures studied and also adds the results on the optimal durability when there
are no costs, low costs, or high costs to develop the crime contingent durability technology.

Additionally, note that if we take into account the non-market crime externality (𝑊2 < 0), this reduces
the socially optimal level of durability. As a consequence, the socially optimal level of durability gets
closer to the monopoly level in the case of random stealing as well as the case of selective stealing. 11
Note that if the externality is big enough, even the monopoly will over-produce durability under the
random stealing technology (when 2𝑣1 > 𝑣2 ). If we consider the thieves’ profits as part of welfare
(0<ϕ), this increases the socially optimal level of durability. Thus, in turn increases the difference
between the social optimal and the monopoly level of durability.

5. Conclusions and Policy Implications

The social costs of crime are high as crime distorts the allocation of private and public resources, and
the behaviour and welfare of people. It is important to understand the underlying causes of crime, and
how potential criminal responds to changes in incentives to be able to apply more effective crime
deterrence policies. There is evidence that criminals respond to economic incentives. In particular the


11
  We are only considering property crimes of durable goods, so we do not study any type of displacement of crime
(functional, of types of crime, for example) due to changes in the durability in this model and do not assess the
potential changes in welfare that may occur if such displacement takes place.

                                                                                                              24
price of the potentially stolen goods affects the aggregate level of crime (Draca, Koutmeridis, and
Machin, 2018). Crime economics field has been growing considerably in the last decades. However, the
link between crime and the production of the stolen goods has been understudied.

This paper provides the first theoretical examination of the relationship between crime and the durability
of goods, which is a feature of the quality of goods that affects the goods’ prices. Therefore, a novel
contribution of the paper is that when we incorporate the cost of crime (based on the rational model of
crime economics) into the standard framework of durable goods, the traditional results of durable goods
are modified.

On the one hand, we show that the level of durability affects crime. The economic analysis of crime
supposes that individuals act rationally, i.e., they measure the costs and benefits of their actions.
Therefore, a reduction in the durability of stolen goods reduces the pecuniary benefits of crime, as it is
intuitive to think that the lower the durability of a good, the lower its selling price will be. Consequently,
the level of durability affects the benefits associated with illegal activities, measured in monetary terms.,
a decrease in the durability of goods will reduce the benefits of illegal activities relative to legal
activities, and as the costs will remain the same, the net expected return from crime will decline and
criminals will find it less profitable to devote themselves to illegal activities.

On the other hand, we show that crime affects the level of durability. In order to study this, we developed
a theoretical model that adds the cost of crime to the standard framework of durable goods. Crime affects
the consumer and producer surplus and thus the behaviour of consumers, firms, the market equilibrium,
and, in turn, the social optimum, which is even more distorted given the market and non-market
externalities produced by crime.

The model shows that including the possibility of crime modifies the standard results of the literature,
even in cases where monopoly and perfect competition market structures produce the same level of
durability. We find that perfect competition does not provide optimal durability, even if we do not
consider the externalities caused by crime. More specifically, perfect competition sets a durability level
that is higher than the social optimum (under random stealing), i.e., it over-produces durability and
produces no durable goods when there is selective stealing, while the monopolist sets a durability level
that is lower than the social optimum, i.e., it under-produces durability. If we also consider the non-
market externality that emerges when firms take into account that higher durability increases crime, and
that crime reduces welfare, the socially optimal level of durability declines. As a consequence, the
socially optimal level of durability gets closer to the one that prevails under monopoly. We find that if
this externality is big enough, even the monopoly will over-produce durability.

                                                                                                           25
These results show the relevance of considering crime in general equilibrium models. Furthermore, it is
important to note that the effects of traditional policy recommendations to reduce crime, such as an
increase in the celerity or severity of sanctions, are probably in the long run reduced through an increase
in the durability of the goods by the firms in response to a smaller crime incidence.

Finally, our model has clear policy implications: less durability is an effective instrument to reduce
crime. Therefore, interventions that attempt to reduce the level of durability of goods make stealing less
profitable, which leads to a reduction in the number of thefts of such goods. In particular, making the
durability of a good contingent upon that good being stolen is likely to increase welfare. This paper
shows the conditions under which such technology would be produced and implemented. Results show
that under a monopoly market structure this technology could arise endogenously. However, in the case
of perfect competition and random stealing, it is necessary that public policies create the incentives to
produce and implement such a technology.

The telecommunications industry seems to be moving in that direction, with the implementation of
applications that would block the smartphones if they are stolen or the possibility to report the stolen
IMEI to incorporate it in international black lists and make the durability of the phone to vanish
immediately within countries that enforce the GMSA black list (international list of stolen phones). The
evidence related to mobile phones is still incipient but points to promising results. The Home Office and
the Behavioural Insights Team (2016) argue that the fall in levels of cellular phone theft – especially
during 2013–2015– can be related to improvements in cellular phone security introduced by
manufacturers during this period. Although the authors do not use a rigorous methodology, they show
that the cellular phone industry helps make cellular phones less attractive to thieves by making them
harder to use and reducing their value after they have been stolen.12 In a similar vein, the Technological
Advisory Council (2014) shows evidence that industry’s effort to develop mechanisms to help
smartphone owners reduce the impact of smartphone theft is affecting criminal activity. 13 Overall, these
pieces of empirical evidence are in line with the policy implications of our model, and show that

   These security measures include requiring access control such as a unique code (a PIN, password, or some form
of pattern) or biometric authentication to be entered onto the handset to unlock it; tracing the location of the handset
using a remote service; wiping data from the handset; or locking the handset remotely. All these measures reduce
the durability of the stolen cellular phone. However, these features only protect the cellular phone if they are
switched on.

   For instance, in the first five months of 2014, just after Apple introduced Activation Lock, robberies and grand
larcenies of Apple products from persons in New York City dropped by 19 percent and 29 percent, respectively,
compared to the same time period in the previous year (The Office of the New York State Attorney General 2015).
Similarly, in the six months after Apple made Activation Lock available, iPhone robberies declined 38 percent and
24 percent in San Francisco and London, respectively (The Office of the New York State Attorney General 2015).

                                                                                                                     26
industry’s effort to develop mechanisms to increase the security of goods, and at the same time reduce
their durability if the goods are stolen, seems to be promising for reducing crimes against property.

Appendix

This appendix shows that a monopoly market structure will never choose to sell new goods in the second
period only to type 2 consumers who have been victims of a robbery and therefore have a higher
willingness to pay than consumers who were not victims of a robbery. Thus, the monopolist could decide
to sell in the second period only to those who have been victims of a robbery. However, we show that
this would never happen in equilibrium.

The proof consists in two steps. First, we show that if there is such an incentive in the second period, it
is better for the monopolist to anticipate this in the first period. Second, we show that for the monopolist,
it is always better to produce in the first period a good of durability 𝐷 = 0 than to sell in the second
period only to consumers who have been victims of a robbery. Thus, all the cases are covered by
comparing 𝐷 = 0 with the case of selling new goods to every type 2 consumer in the second period,
whether or not the type 2 consumer has been the victim of a robbery.

In the second period, type 2 consumers who have been victims of a robbery are willing to pay 𝑣2 𝑄 𝑁 for
                               𝛼𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷𝑀 )
a new good. Since there are         𝑘
                                             𝑛2   type 2 consumers who have been victims of a robbery, the

total profit from selling just to these consumers is:

                                       𝛼𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷𝑀 )
                                                     𝑛2 (𝑣2 𝑄𝑁 − 𝑐(0)).
                                            𝑘

If the monopolist wants to sell to all type 2 consumers, the price should be 𝑣2 [𝑄 𝑁 − 𝑄 0 (𝐷𝑀 )] +
𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷𝑀 ), which is the price that consumers who have not been victims of a robbery are willing to pay.
In this case the monopoly profit is:

                               𝑛2 [𝑣2 [𝑄𝑁 − 𝑄 0 (𝐷𝑀 )] + 𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷𝑀 ) − 𝑐(0)].

The monopolist prefers to sell in the second period to consumers who have been victims of a robbery
whenever:

             αv1 Q0 (DM )
                          n2 (v2 QN − c(0)) > n2 [v2 [QN − Q0 (DM )] + v1 Q0 (DM ) − 𝑐(0)].
                  k

If this is the case, “anticipating” this gives to the monopolist a profit of:

                                       𝛼v1 Q0 (DM )                𝛼v1 Q0 (DM )
         v2 QN − c(𝐷𝑀 ) + 𝛿 {(1 −                  ) v2 Q0 (DM ) +              (v2 QN − c(0))},
                                           2𝑘                           𝑘


                                                                                                          31
which is clearly greater than:

                                 𝛼v1 Q0 (D1 )
    v2 QN − c(𝐷1 ) + 𝛿 {(1 −                 ) (v1 Q0 (D1 ) + v2 [QN − Q0 (D1 )] + v1 Q0 (D1 )) − 𝑐(0)}.
                                     2𝑘

Given that in the second period the monopolist will sell only to consumers who were victims of a robbery
                                                                            αv1 Q0 (DM )
in the first period, it is better to sell the goods at 𝑣2 𝑄 𝑁 + 𝛿 {(1 −         2k
                                                                                        ) 𝑣2 𝑄 0 (𝐷𝑀 )},   which is
                                 αv1 Q0 (DM )
greater than 𝑣2 𝑄 𝑁 + 𝛿 {(1 −                 ) 𝑣1 𝑄 0 (𝐷𝑀 )}.
                                     2k


We prove that there are no parameter values such that the monopolist wants to sell the goods in the first
period, anticipating that in the second period the monopolist will only sell to consumers who have been
victims of a robbery. This is because this strategy is dominated by selling a good of quality 𝐷 = 0.

A monopolist when it sells goods anticipating that in the second period it will only sell to consumers
who have been victims of a robbery gets profits equal to:

                                               𝛼v1 Q0 (D1 )                𝛼v1 Q0 (D1 )
     𝑀𝑎𝑥𝐷1 = v2 QN − c(𝐷1 ) + 𝛿 {(1 −                      ) v2 Q0 (D1 ) +              (v2 Q𝑁 − 𝑐(0))}.
                                                   2𝑘                           𝑘

If this expression is maximized at 𝐷1∗ the value is:

                                     𝛼v1 Q0 (𝐷1∗ )                 𝛼v1 Q0 (𝐷1∗ )
       v2 QN − c(𝐷1∗ ) + 𝛿 {(1 −                  ) v2 Q0 (𝐷1∗ ) +               (v2 Q𝑁 − 𝑐(0))},            (11)
                                         2𝑘                             𝑘

while producing a good of quality 𝐷 = 0 gives to the monopoly profits equal to:



                                 v2 QN − c(0) + δ {(v2 QN − c(0))}.                                          (12)

Subtracting equation (11) from equation (12) we obtain:

                                                𝛼v1 Q0 (𝐷1∗ )
                 c(𝐷1∗ ) − c(0) + 𝛿 {(1 −                    ) [v2 Q𝑁 − 𝐶(0) − v2 Q0 (𝐷1∗ )]},
                                                    2𝑘

which is greater than 0 given assumption 3.
