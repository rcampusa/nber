                      DYSFUNCTIONAL NON-MARKET INSTITUTIONS
                                  AND THE MARKET


                                    ABSTRACT




       There is a widespread belief that when significant market failure oc-

curs, there are strong incentives for non—market institutions to develop

which go at least part of the way to remedying the deficiency.        We demon-

strate that this functionalist position is not in general valid.        In partic-

ular, we examine a situation where insurance is characterized     by sorsi haz-

ard.    We show that when market insurance is provided, supplementary mutual

assistance between family and friends (unobservable to market insurers) -         a
form of non—market institution —   will   occur and may be harmful.    This example

suggests that non—market institutions can arise spontaneously even though

they are dysfunctional.

tionalist1 view is suppo ted by Arrow 11965] who argues

the market fails to achieve an optimal state, society will,                  to some extent


at least, recognize       the gap, and non—market       institutions will arise attempt-


ing to bridge it        (p.   18),   but also that such institutions will normally be

ameliorative.        We agree with the first part of this position —            that   market

failure will tend to spawn non—market Institutions.                 But it is our contention

that there is no a priori presumption            that equilibria with voluntary non—

market institutions deal better with the problems arising from market failure

than the market alone.          That a non—market institution arises to fill some

perceived need does not mean that it in fact serves that need.

     The Incongruence between intentions and consequences has been much re-

marked.      In a celebrated statement, Adam Smith [1937,            p. 423]   argues that

individuals pursuing their own self—interest             may promote the social good:2
      ——
             every   individual ——      endeavours as much   as he can to direct [his

                                                            —— He generally
     capital] that its produce may be of the greatest value

     intends only his own gain ——            [but   by labouring to render] the annual

     revenue of the society as great as he can
                                               --              is -—   led   by an invisible

     hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention
                                                               —-                  to   promote

      the public interest.

The obverse of this observation            is that harm may derive from well—intentioned

 actions.3     Smith goes on to argue [1937, Bk. IV,          Ch.   II] that, because of

 forseen consequences,        most government regulation, however benign in intent,

 is either useless or hurtful.            In a similar vein, we shall argue that In the
presence of market failure, equilibrium may be characterized by spontaneous,

non—market     institutions which are completely dysfunctional;     by "spontane-
ous', we mean arising from the decentralized       and uncoordinated   actions of

atomistic economic agents;       and by "completely dysfunctional',    having the op-
posite effects to those intended.

     This paper illustrates this important principle with an example which is

of interest in its own right.        The literature over the past fifteen yeara has

directed attention to the ubiquity of moral hazard and incentive problems.

One of the ways the market responds to moral hazard is to provide
                                                                  incomplete

insurance,    since with incomplete    insurance individuals still have some incen-

tive to take actions which reduce the probability of the insured—against

event occurring.     But they must then bear more risk than they would like.         A

principal    function of mmny non—market institutions, meanwhile,      is to help

those who have suffered some misfortune, which entails the provision        of in-

surance:     The marriage vows formalize and sanctify the mutual insurance as-

pects of the family;     the acid test of a friend is his willingness to help

in times of need;     charity is regarded mm meritorious and is subsidized by

the government;     and many government social assistance programs, such as

unemployment insurance and workmen's compensation, have m strong insurance

component.     The importance   of non—market insurance is illustrated by what

happens if an individual catches pneumonia as a result of going on m hiking

trip with inadequate rain gear:       His employer gives him compensated sick

lemve;     part or all of his medical expenses are reimbursed by his insurance

policy or the state;     uncovered    medical expenses may be partially deductible

from his income tax;     and family and friends rally round to provide other

forms of support.     Such extensive support, while directly helpful, deleteri-

ously affects individuals'      care to avoid accidents.   In terms of the example,

 ance than the market and the insurance they provide crowds out the market

 insurance.   Our analysis therefore   indicates that dysfunctional          non—market

                                          3

he can.



1.     The Basic Model

        We first describe the canonical moral hazard model without non—market

Insurance         (Arnott and Stiglitz (l9SSa}.                There is a single accident;      the

probability            of its occurrence,         p, depends   on the individual's efforts at

accident avoidance,                e.    The accident—avoIdance       function is cc';ex:

        p         0,      p" a 0.

The individual's wealth is w, and d is the damage caused by the accident.

The individual purchases all his market insurance from one insurance                           firm in
a competitive insurance market.5 The insurance policy pays a (the (net)

payout) if the accident occurs, and the individual pays the insurance firm                             (3

        For simplicity, we assume a separable,

        When individuals purchase all their market insurance from a single in-

[19741) that the competitive equilibrium insurance contract will

provide only partial insurance                    and will typically ration the amount of insur-

contract occurs at the point of maximum utility (point                                             12   in the Figure) on

the insurance          firms           zero profit locus (ZPL):                    (l—p)3—ps = 0.                The slope of

                                                                   5
dividual's     accident—avoidance         effort is observable                    by neither his partner

nor market insurers.           Equilibrium may entail a combination of market and

non—market     insurance.      Subsequently,           we shall investigate the efficiency

properties     of the equilibrium.

      There are four events —          neither             the individual nor his partner has an

accident, the individual has an accident but his partner does not, etc.                                            Let

e denote the individual's           effort and                 his partner's.         Then the probability

that neither the individual nor his partner has an accident is

(l—p(efl(l—p(&)) and the individual's utility in this event is u(w—),                                        etc.


Thus, an individual's expected utility is

      EU = u(w—j3)(l—p(e))(l—p())              +   u(w—d+a)p(e)p()
                                                                                           — e,
         +   u(w—f3—3)(l—p(e))p()          +   u(w—d+a+3)p(e)(1—p())                                         (5)

whi.h may be written more succinctly as

      EU =                      +         +                        +               — e,
              u0(l—p)(l—)           u1p       u2(l—p)                  u3p(l-j)                              (5')

where        e u(w-),            u(w—d+a),                 e   u(w—f3-3),    and           e u(w-d+a÷6), and
        u0                u1                    u2                                  u3
p s   p().
      We assume that H and W are smart, and take into account how the other

will adjust effort in response to a change in 6.6 But both assume that the

market contract will be unaffected by their actions.

       In deciding on his own ievel of effort, given a,                              fi,    and   3,   the individ-

ual treats his partner's            effort as fixed.                   Thus, the equation characterizing

his levei of precaution (assumed strictly positive) is
                                                   —   1       = 0,                                          (6)

which gives

       e =   e(a,j3,6),                                                                                      (Ta)


and by symmetry

         =   e(a,8,3).                                                                                       (7b)

The individual and his partner perceive expected utility to be related to 3

in the following way:

              =                                            +
                     (—u2(l—p)+u3p(l—))                         (—u0(1—)+u1—u2+u3(l—flp'
              +                                                               .                                   (8)

insurance         companies          adjust a and               In response to a change In            5.    Combining

Thus, at the competitive equilibrium in the absence of insurance,                                           the

ners perceive a mutual insurance pact to be beneficial                                      and would therefore

provide one another with non—market insurance to supplement their market

Insurance.               The intuition for this result is as follows:                           At   0,    the partners

are rationed in the amount of insurance they can purchase at the price q0.

They perceive that by entering Into a mutual insurance pact, they can acquire

additional               insurance at this price, contingent                       on one and only one of the

                                                                                                              =

an   individual regards a unit Increase In 5 as equivalent                                      to a unit Increase
in a with probability (i—p) (the probability that his partner is not sick

when he   is)    combined with a unit increase in                    with probability p (the proba-

bility his partner is sick when he is not);                    or,    equivalently,         as an expected

increase of (l—p) in the amount of insurance,                   a,    obtained at the price

(i.e., the movement from B to              4'   in   the Figure).     As already noted, in reason-

ing in this way, individuals neglect that when everyone enters into such a

pact, which reduces effort (eq.                 (10)) and increases      the probability of acci-

dent, market insurers are forced to offer a less attractive                          contract       in order

to maintain zero proftts.

equilibrium      market contract maximizing expected utility subject to zero prof-

its.    Thus, in the presence of non—market                 insurance,      the equilibrium market

contract maximizes

       Given the assumed information technology, it can be shown that the

non-market insurance is unambiguously harmful and dysfunctional.                              The line

of proof is straightforward:               Welfare is at least as high if the market

insurer chooses a,       ,        and 6 as if he chooses just a and           fi,   with    6 being

chosen by the non—market insurer.                    And if the market insurer chooses             a,   (3,

     The equilibriumwithout non—market          insurance cannot be improved upon,

and, if it were possible,      it would be desirable to outlaw the provision of

non—market insurance.       The intuitive rationale for this result is as follows:

The provision of non—market insurance does not enhance the risk—sharing

capabilities    of the economy.    Rather, such insurance crowds out market

insurance.     Not only is it less effective     than market insurance since it

randomizes   an individual's event-contingent       consumption, and is provided by a

risk—averse agent    (see Marshall [l976]), but also the simultaneous provision

of market and non—market      insurance violates exclusivity    (see Arnott and

Stiglitz [1986]).

     The government    may be able to influence the amount of non—market insur-

ance provided.     First, in designing its own insurance,      it should take into

account the effect on non—market       insurance;   second, it can tax or regulate

the assistance    provided by charitable organizations, where such benevolence

interferes   with the efficient provision of market insurance;       and third, it

can institute a host of second—best policies to influence the amount of non—

market insurance provided, such as the taxation of complements to non—market

insurance.     But in many contexts,   such as the mutual assistance provided by

friends and family in times of need, the extent to which the government           can

and should intervene is circumscribed       by social custoa and civil libertarian

concerns.    Furthermore,    no intervention is warranted if the costa of inter-

vention exceed the benefits.

     The above analysis was predicated on the asaumptions that a market which

provides insurance against the accident in question exists and that there are

no transactions costs associated with the provision of insurance.          If market

insurance against a given accident does not in fact exist, non—market inaur—



                                            9
ance is unambiguously beneficial.     And when transactions   costs are taken into

account, non—market insurance may be beneficial      if it is provided at lower

transaction cost than market insurance.       Taking these considerations    into

account, our analysis can be interpreted      in terms of the historical    evolution

of insurance institutions.    In traditional societies,    non—market   institutions

develop to provide insurance, which are unambiguously beneficial and func-

tional.    As time proceeds and the economy becomes more developed, the set of

insurance markets becomes more complete and the transactions       costs associated

with the markets for insurance fall.     Concomitantly,   the non—market    insurance

institutions   remain, but are partially displaced by insurance markets.        In

the limit, as the transactions    costs associated with the provision      of insur-

ance go to zero, the non—market    institutions remain and are harmful;       they
become not only vestigial, but also dysfunctional.



3.   Effort Observable by the Non—Market Insurer

      This case is more interesting since there appear to be two offsetting

effects.    On the one hand, because individuals have information on their

partner's effort, which an insurance company does not, the provision         of non-

market insurance has the potential    of enhancing the risk—sharing capabili-

ties of the economy.    On the other hand, the provision of insurance by a

risk—neutral   agent is typically more efficient than by a risk—averse       agent,

if they have access to the same information.       Furthermore,   the simultaneous

provision of market and non—market    insurance, by violating exclusivity,      typi-

cally creates uninternalizedexternalities.        This line of reasoning suggests

that the provision of non—market    insurance   in this case may be beneficial       in

some circumstances   and harmful in others.

     We continue with the same model.     When effort is observable within the


                                        10
family but not to the insurmnce firm, and when, ms we have assumed, individ-

uals are identical, family members will effectively choose the level of pre-

cautIon to take cooperatively.             Each will take a and              to be fixed, and

choose 5 and e to maximize

          =              +          +              +                — e.

This yields the following first—order conditions:

     e:                                                     =   1                                   (l5a)

              (-u2+u3)p(l-p)

Eq. (lSb) implies that

     5 =            .                                                                               (l5b'
Because the partners can observe each other' s effort and treat a and                          (3   aa

fixed, they perceive there to be no moral hazard problem associated                           with the

insurance      they provide and hence provide               (as) full insurance        (as possible).

This stands in contrast to the previous section where, as a result of the

inability of each partner to observe the other's effort, only partial non—

market insurance was provided (see             (9)).

     The insurance firm effectively chooses a and 3 to maximize expected

   lity, subject to (15a), (lSb) and the zero profit constraint.                            The

competitive equilibrium with non—mmrket insurance is characterized                           by the

constraints      and first—order        conditions of this program.

     We now investigate the welfare properties of the equilibrium.                            To do

this, we assume that the planner chooses a,                     ,   and   5, knowing    that individ-

uals choose e according to (iSa), which takes account of the fact that S is

chosen with effort observable, and subject to the break—even constraint on

market insurance.

Thus, when effort is                 observable by the              non—market insurer, the equilibrIum is

constrained         efficient,

        The results of the two cases analyzed above lead naturally to the con-

jecture that in intermediate situations                                 in which non—market insurers observe

their partners'           effort imperfectly, but better than the market insurer, a

super-optimal            amount of non-market                 insurance will be provided that may or may

not be better than no non—market                            insurance at all.            The analysis could be ex-

tended to compare the optimal and equilibrium number of members in a non—

market insurance group;                       in a large group, there is greater diversification

of risk, but more imperfect observability.

        In the above analysis, we took the observability of one partner's acci-

dent—preventioneffort by the other as exogenous.                                        In fact, however, the de—




                                                                   12
gree of such observability           is a function of the indirect monitoring system

—    the   system whereby one partner observes the other's effort
                                                                  —               as well   as the

incentive each partner has to observe the other, which is determined by the

extent of interdependence        —    the   dependence   of one partner's      utility on the

other's effort.        These considerations       suggest a neglected       feature of contract

design.       A principal with many agents can reduce moral hazard either by

directly monitoring his agents or by setting up an indirect monitoring mystom

with interdependence.        While the literature has given considerable attention

to direct monitoring,       it has largely ignored the design of indirect monitor-

ing systems c interdependence.7



4.     Conclusions

           Elsewhere we have argued that aoral hazard and incentive problems are

pervasive,       not only in insurance markets, but in labor, capital, and product

markets as well.        In these circumstances, competitive market economies are

generally not constrained Pareto efficient               ——   there   are interventions    which

respect the costs of information             (and other transactions costs) that are

      fare—enhancing    (Arnott and Stiglitz [1986]).

           Within economics, there Is a long—standing view that when there are such

market IneffIciencies,       individuals will get together to develop institutional

arrangements that alleviate these market failures.8'9 In this paper, we have

presented a counter—example,            In our stark model, though the market response

to imperfect       information   (the rationing of Insurance) did indeed give rise to

a non—market response, whether the non—market                 response was welfare—enhancing

turned out to depend on whether the non—market                 Institution was informational—

ly advantaged relative to the market instItution.                     More specifically,    if non—

market insurers were no better—informed                than the market, then the non-market



                                                  13
insurance crowded out the more efficient market insurance and welfare was un-

ambiguously lowered;    if,   however, non—market   insurers were better—informed,

the non—market   insurance might or might not be beneficial.

     How the government should respond to this type of non—market failure

depends on context.    At the least, government should take into account the

response of non—market insurers to the insurance which it provides.        More

generally, our paper suggests that non—market       institutions may arise spon-
                                                                 11
taneously   and persist, even though they are dysfunctional. 10,       The import-

ance and scope of this possibility,     as well as the appropriate policy re-

sponse to such non—market failure, merits considerable further investigation.

     In anthropology there is a functionalist tradition of long standing
     which attempts to explain social institutions (political, economic,
     sociological, cultural, and psychological) as functional adaptations to
     a society's environment or ecosystem. Functionalist theories differ in
     their degree of subtlety and sophistication and in their emphasis, but
     none seem to make a sharp distinctionbetween equilibrium and optimum.
     In most theories, however, there seems to be a presumption that
     institutional adaptation to the environment is efficient.  See Keesing
     [1981] for an informative discussion of contemporary traditions in
     anthropology.

2.   This conjecture, appropriately formalized — the Fundamental Theorem as—
     sertthg the Pareto efficiency of market economies
                                                       — is the central re-
     sult in the Old Welfare Economics.

3.   Smith tl937, p. 423]:   'By pursuing his own interest [the individual]
     frequently promotes that of society more effectually than when he really
     intends to promote it'.

4.   The term "social insurance' is perhaps more appropriate, but is used in
     some countries to refer to social security. The term "informal
     insurance  is appropriate for the example, but the phenomenon we
     identify arises in formal, non—market institutions as well.
5.   See Arnott and Stiglitz [l988b] for a discussion of the rationale   for
     this exclusivity provision.

6.   We would obtain the same qualitative results if we assumed Instead that
     H and W Ignore that the other will adjust effort in response to a change

7.   One exception is Carmichael [1988]. He considers peer review in the
     university setting, which is a form of indirect monitoring system, and
     argues that the institution of tenure is needed to make peer review
     incentive—compatible.

8,   In our example, the market by itself is constrained Pareto efficient.
     However, there is terceived market failure, and the non—market
     institution (the provision of supplementary non—market insurance) arises
     In response to this perceived market failure.
          In an expanded version of our model in which there are many kinds
     of accidents and many commodities, the market is not constrained Pareto
     efficient;   there Is genuine potential market failure (Arnott and
     Stiglitz [1986]). Our result concerning the possible dysfunctionality
     of spontaneous non—market institutions carries over to this more
     realistic setting.

9.    The conjecture that the resulting equilibria are efficient is often
      attributed to Coase [1960]. He seems, however, to have been more con-
      cerned with small group externalities than with more generalized
       atmospheric'   externalities.

10.   In one sense, this result should come as no surprise, since it is by now
      well—recognized that, even in large economies, Nash equilibria are
      Pareto efficient only under special circumstances. One of the great
      achievements of modern economics was to identify a special set of
      assumptions under which competitive economies are Pareto efficient.

11.   Akerlof [1980] has argued that inefficient social customs may persist as
      Nash equilibria, and that there can be an arbitrarily large set of
      social customs sustainable as Nash equilibria.
           The point in our paper is related but different. Akerlof considers
      the possible persistence of inefficient institutions, but does not in-
      vestigate how the institutions came into being. We show not only that
      an inefficient institution can persist, but also that it can arise
      spontaneously.  Furthermore, while in the Akerlof model, there are
      multiple equilibria of which some may be efficient, in our model there
      is a unique equilibrium.
