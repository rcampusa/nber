                Propagation of Shocks in a High-Inflation Economy:

        The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical answers to questions

related to the propagation of shocks in a high-inflation economy. Do one—time

inflationary shocks give rise to long—term persistence, or inertia? Do bal-

ance of payments' shocks trigger a process that, through indexation and

monetary accomodation, results in long-term changes in inflation? Within the

context of a specific hypothesis, influential both in policy discussions and

in economic analyses, the paper addresses these issues using Israeli data and

vector-autoregression techniques. The evidence does not support the hypoth-

esis that one-time nominal shocks have a persistent effect on the inflation

rate, or the hypothesis that long-term changes in inflation are triggered by

autonomous fluctuations in the trade balance.

 1.   Introduction

      Despite the advent of high inflation in Israel and other economies (e.g.,

 in Latin America), there is no widely accepted explanation for the

fluctuations in inflation rates and for the transmission mechanisms of nominal

shocks in these economies. In fact, there are only very few studies that have

empirically examined the propagation mechanism of inflation in economies

characterized by high degrees of indexation and monetary accommodation. The

extent and role of expectations inertia, of government management of the

exchange rate and controlled prices, and of government deficits and monetary

accommodations are all examples of key issues subject to sharp debate and:
               1
controversy.

      The purpose of this paper is to investigate key aspects of the propa-

gation mechanism in the context of the Israeli economy for the first half of

the 1980's. Israel represents an interesting case for examining the

propagation mechanism of nominal shocks. During the first half of the 1980's,

this economy was characterized by high and volatile rates of inflation,

substantial monetary accommodation, a high degree of indexation, balance of

payments crises, and a persistent policy of direct management of the exchange

rate and of price controls, through government subsidies, in an attempt to

slow down inflation.

      One approach to the analysis of the propagation mechanism is to relate

inflation to fundamentals, like current and expected future changes in the

money supply, the government budget, as well as in external variables. In an

open economy, the analysis has to take into account the exchange rate regime

and the interactions between the balance of payments and domestic infla-

tion.2 Another approach emphasizes the independent role that key variables,

like e.g. the foreign trade deficit, may have in generating inertia—type
                                      2




effects in the inflationary process. The basic idea underlying this approach

is that, due to institutional adjustments to inflation, and to accommodating

monetary and fiscal policies, the stabilizing forces in high-inflation

economies are generally weak, thus leaving the inflation rate in a "meta-

stable" equilibrium. As a result, it is claimed, even a one—time shock to the

price level, resulting e.g. from a change in the trade deficit, can lead to a

long—term rise in the rate of inflation.3

     Interestingly, similar controversies between theories that link inflation

to fundamentals and theories that stress the independent role of balance of

payments fluctuations emerged in the context of the German hyperinflation of

the early 1920's.

    "The main division of opinion regarding inflation and dislocated exchanges
    lies between inflation and balance of payments theories. The former
    traces causation from quantity of money to domestic prices to rate of
    exchange; the latter, from real balance factors to rate of exchange, to
    certain domestic prices, and sometimes further to quantity of money."
    [Ellis (19314, p. 289)].

     The "inertia approach" has been very influential. In fact, the actual

policies implemented by finance ministers in Israel during the first half of'

the 1980's have been based, to some extent, on these ideas. The same is true

for policies implemented in other countries, like e.g. Argentina in the late

1970's. Given the wide application of this approach in the design of policy,

we confront in this paper some of its implications against time series data.

     In particular, we consider the empirical implications of a specific

hypothesis about the propagation mechanism. This hypothesis specifies a link

between balance of payments crises, the policy reactions that they generate,

and their implications for the inflation process. According to this hypothesis,

balance of payments crises have played a key role in the acceleration of

inflation through time. In response to these crises, it is claimed, the

government devalues the domestic currency and lifts some of the existing price
                                        3



 controls.   The initial cost-push effects that result from these measures are

 then quickly translated into an increase in the general price level through

 widespread indexation and monetary accommodation. To the extent that the

 economy is in a "meta-stable" equilibrium, this one-time increase in the price

 level is transformed into a persistent acceleration in the rate of' inflation.4

      In the context of this specific mechanism, our purpose in this paper is

to provide empirical answers to the following questions: (1) Do one-time

shocks to the variables that are suggested by the hypothesis above give rise

to long term persistence, or inertia, of' inflation? (ii) Do trade-deficit

shocks generate the dynamic response implied by the hypothesis? (iii) What is

the role of exchange-rate management and of price controls in the dynamics of

inflation? (iv) How important, statistically, are different nominal shocks in

the transmission of inflation? We provide in this paper answers to these

questions by using a model-free estimation method: Sims' vector auto-

regression technique.5 By using this method, we are also able to present

important "stylized facts" regarding the propagation of shocks in the high-

inflation economy of Israel.

     The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and

discusses main developments in the 1980's. Section 3 reports the results of

autoregressive analysis of a five-variable system, using Israeli monthly data

for the first half of the 1980's. Section 4 presents our main conclusions.


2. Data Description

     The discussion above suggests that at least five variables should be used

in the present empirical, analysis: a measure of trade balance fluctuations;

policy—determined variables like exchange rate depreciation, controlled—prices

inflation, and the extent of monetary accommodation; and the inflation rate.

Accordingly, the following monthly time series are used in our vector
autoregression analysis: DEFt is an index of the ratio of the foreign trade

deficit to industrial production; DSt is the monthly percentage change in

the exchange rate of the Israeli shekel relative to a basket of five foreign

currencies (U.S. dollar, pound sterling, deutschemark, Dutch florin, and

French franc); DPCt is the monthly percentage change in the price index of

goods and services that are subject to government price controls; DMt is the

ratio of public sector monthly monetary infusion to beginning of month's Ml

money supply; DPt is the monthly percentage change in the consumer price

index. The data sources are various reports of the Bank of Israel and the

Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics.

     Figure 1 plots inflation (DPt), exchange rate depreciation (DSt),

controlled-prices' inflation (DPCt), and the ratio of money creation induced by

the government budget deficit to Ml (DMt). From 1980 until the last quarter of

1983 the inflation rate was quite stable, but relatively high (5-7 percent per

month). Following the October 1983 crisis, higher inflation erupted and more

unstable rates have been observed (10-15 percent per month). Of particular

interest are the sharp reductions in the rate of inflation following the

"package deal" policy of' the end of 198L, the rise of inflation at the beginning

of 1985 after the collapse of this policy, and the disinflation that followed

the new stabilization policies that were adopted since mid-1985. Exchange-rate

depreciation and controlled-prices' inflation exhibit similar patterns of

behavior, reflecting their joint management by the government. Typically, upon

the adoption of' a new inflation—stabilization program there are sharp increases

in these prices set by the government, in an attempt to "correct" for their

previous erosion relative to the general inflation rate. Later on, these

variables are slowed down with the purpose of disinflating the economy. These

cycles reflect the unsustainability in the long run of price-management policies
                                       5



 that are not accompanied by contractionary adjustments in the government budget

 and the money supply. Regarding the latter, it can be seen from Figure 1 that

 money creation induced by the government budget deficit exhibits remarkable

 similar behavior to that of inflation. Figure 2 plots the trade deficit which

 exhibits wide fluctuations reaching a peak in 1983 following a previous policy

 of slowing down devaluation and controlled-prices' inflation. The focal point

of our empirical analysis is to test a specific hypothesis that links these

 trade deficit fluctuations with movements in the variables depicted in Figure 1.


3. Analysis

     Let      be a (5x1) vector giving the stochastic processes followed by

the foreign trade deficit/output ratio (DEFt), exchange rate depreciation

(DSt), controlled prices' inflation (DPCt), money creation induced by the

government budget deficit (DMt), and inflation (DPt):


                                       DEFt

                                           DSt

                                       DPCt

                                           DMt

                                      — DPt_

     The second-order vector autoregression for this process is6:


                            A0 + A1Xt 1 +           +
                                            A2Xt2       Ut                   (1)


where A0 is a (5x1) vector of constants, A1 and A2 are (5x5) matrices of

least squares coefficients, and Ut S a (5x1) vector of least squares dis-

turbances. The latter are also termed innovations, in that they represent the

part of X that cannot be predicted linearly from two lagged values of X.

Equation (1) is the form actually estimated in this section, using monthly
                                                 6




data for Israel from 1980:1 to 1985:12. Due to data transformations, the

sample period for the dependent variables is 1980:L_1985:12. The estimated

coefficients are difficult to interpret in the present framework, and thus are

not reported here. (They are available from the authors upon request.)

     Given the estimated parameters of the A matrices, it is possible to

solve Equation (1) for            in terms of the u process,


                   C0 +      u,
                                  +
                                      C1u1   +
                                                 C2u2   +   ... +        .   (2)

This is the system's vector moving average representation. Since the u pro-

cess is composed of disturbances that may be contemporaneously correlated, it

is useful to transform this process into one with contemporaneously orthogonal

disturbances. This can be done by imposing a specific ordering of the vari-

ables, thus yielding the orthogonalized moving average representation--or

impulse response function


                         +
                             e    +
                                      Q1e1   +
                                                 Q2e2   +   ... + Q.e.   ,   (3)

where, by construction, the e process contains mutually orthogonal distur-

bances that are functions of the u's. The coefficients of the impulse

response function in (3) represent dynamic multipliers, in that they display

the current and subsequent responses of' the system to shocks in the components

of e. The specific variables' ordering used in this section, suggested by

the hypothesis to be tested, is as in the list of components of' Xt; that is,

DEFt enters first, DSt second, and DPt enters last.

     Table 1 reports the correlation matrix of contemporaneous disturbances.

Seven out of the ten reported cross-correlations are of a small order of

magnitude. The remaining three cross—correlations are around the 0.8 value,

and correspond to the three price variables that are included in our

analysis: DSt, DPCt, and DPt.

      In order to analyze the dynamic effects of shocks we plot in Figures 3

 through 7, the responses, derived from the impulse response function up to 214

months, to a one-standard deviation shock in each one of the five variables

considered. Each figure corresponds to a different shock.

     Consider first the effects of trade-deficit shocks depicted in Figure 3.

A worsening in the trade deficit is followed by an acceleration in exchange

rate depreciation, in controlled prices' inflation, and in overall inflation.

This shock is also followed by an increase in money creation which can be in-

terpreted as reflecting monetary accommodation. The responses of both infla-

tion and exchange rate depreciation reach their peaks by two months after the

occurrence of the shock. Interestingly, this observed propagation mechanism

conforms closely to the one specified in the Introduction. However, in con-

trast to the "inertia approach" all these responses to a trade deficit shock

are of a temporary nature and no long-term persistence or inertia are

detected.

     Figure 14 gives the dynamic responses to exchange rate depreciation

shocks. An increase in exchange rate depreciation is followed by temporary

increases in controlled—prices inflation, overall inflation, and money crea-

tion. In terms of the implied effect on the real exchange rate, it can be

seen that the increased nominal depreciation is partially offset by the in-

creased inflation. Thus, a nominal depreciation shock induces a depreciation

in the real exchange rate, but only to a small extent. This shock has negli-

gible effects on the foreign trade deficit, which first increases and later on

decreases.

     Variables' responses to a shock in the inflation rate of controlled goods

and services are depicted in Figure 5. A shock increase in this inflation

rate is shown to be followed by short-lived accelerations in exchange rate
                                         8



depreciation and in overall inflation which are subsequently reversed to

decelerations in these two variables. The shock is also followed by monetary

contraction. These findings are consistent with the view that although

increases in controlled prices are inflationary in the short run, they need

not be so in medium or long runs--especially in view of the reduction in

subsidies that they induce. Thus, typically these increases in controlled

prices may lead to a fall in the budget deficit and in money creation that

they induce. That is, shocks to inflation of controlled prices do not

generate long term inflation inertia. Last, these shocks have only mixed and

small effects on the foreign trade deficit.

     Figure 6 gives the effects of monetary shocks. A shock increase in the

monetary infusion induced by the government budget deficit is followed by

accelerations in the four nominal variables considered (DSt, DPCt, DMt,

and DPt). As above, these accelerations are only temporary. The monetary

shock has a somewhat surprising effect on the trade deficit, which moves in an

opposite direction than that of the shock.

     The dynamics of the system in response to an inflation-rate shock are

depicted in Figure 7.   A shock increase in inflation is accompanied by

subsequent increases in foreign exchange depreciation and by monetary

accommodation. The response of DPCt shows wide fluctuations. It first

decreases and then increases; one possible explanation would be that in the

short run the government is attempting to offset the inflationary shock by

decreasing DPCt. As expected, the shock is followed by an appreciation of

the real exchange rate. However, its effects on the foreign trade deficit are

mixed.

     Having traced out the system's responses to innovations, there is still a

question as to the relative importance of each type of the shocks in

statistically accounting for its own   behavior   over time as well as that of the
                                         9




  other variables. To assess this issue, we turn to the system's variance

 decompositions, which give the proportion in the forecast error variance of

 each variable that is accounted for by each one of shocks' variances. The i-

 months ahead error in forecasting X linearly from its own past is given by


              X -   Et.Xt   e Q1e1 + Q2e2       +   ... + Q.1e.1               (14)



 where Et_Xt is the linear least-squares forecast of X given

          etc.

       Table 2 reports variance decompositions for i    24 months. The figures

 reported in the table indicate that trade deficit shocks and exchange rate

depreciation shocks are mostly autonomous, in that in each case lagged own

shocks account for more than 70 percent of own forecast error variance. A

similar, yet somewhat weaker finding holds for monetary shocks, despite the

accommodation uncovered in the above analysis of dynamic responses. On the

other hand, most of' the forecast error variance in controlled prices'

inflation and in overall inflation is accounted for by the variance of foreign

exchange depreciation. In all cases, the variance of foreign trade deficit

shocks has a relatively minor role in accounting for variances in the other

variables considered.


14.   Conclusions

       Our key findings on the propagation mechanism of the inflation process in

the high—inflation economy of Israel during the first half of the 1980's are

as follows:

       (i) There is no evidence in support of the notion that some shocks in

Israel give rise to long term inflation persistence. This finding obviously

questions the notion that the inflation rate is in a "meta—stable" equilibrium.

      (ii) In most cases, and for most shocks, there is a close link among the

nominal variables considered (DSt, DPCt, DMt, and DPt). This link is to be
                                        10




expected in a highly indexed economy that is also characterized by extensive

monetary accommodation.

     (iii) Although some of the results tend to confirm the hypothesis that

trade deficit shocks trigger inflationary responses, these shocks turn out to

be unimportant in accounting for the behavior of key nominal variables. For

example, only 11 percent of the forecast error variance of inflation is

accounted for by these shocks; this is so even though the fact that the

present orthogonalization procedure allows these shocks to enter first.

     (lv) The results highlight the important role of innovations in exchange

rate depreciation in accounting for the behavior of inflation and of con-

trolled—prices' inflation.

     Cv) Monetary shocks have only a partial role in the propagation

mechanism, and most of the statistical evidence is consistent with the

existence of monetary accommodation.7

     Although these findings are informative, there are at least four reasons

for suggesting caution in interpreting and applying them. First, the analysis

assumes that during the sample period the coefficients characterizing the

vector autoregression remained invariant. Unfortunately, the small number of

observations available for the period under study prevented us from testing

this assumption. Second, we analyze the responses of the variables only with

respect to random disturbances. There could obviously be important real

events affecting the dynamics of inflation in Israel that are not captured by

the innovations in the vector autoregression. Third, as previous work (using

U.S. data) indicates, the results could be sensitive to changes in the list of

variables included in the analysis as well as to the measurement arid

definition of these variables. Fourth, as suggested by the Lucas-critique,

the findings of the present vector autoregression analysis may have limited
                                      11




use in determining the effects of changes in policy rules on the propagation

mechanism of the inflation process.

     All in all, the findings reported in this investigation constitute a set

of "stylized facts" that structural models of the propagation of shocks in a

high-inflation economy such as Israel should account for.

     3mis approach, and its applications to Israel, has been put forward by

Bruno and Fischer (1986).

     While not rigorously formulated, this hypothesis served as a basis for

the adoption of some of the policy measures that were included in two recent

inflation stabilization programs in Israel. The hypothesis is formulated in

Liviatan and Piterman (1986), though it is not subjected to econometric

tests. Fischer (1985) indicates that policy-makers in Israel seem to be

concerned with high inflation rates only to the extent that the latter are

accompanied by deteriorations in the balance of payments. The notion that

monetary policy, and thus inflation, responds to fluctuations in the balance

of payments is familiar from the literature on policy reaction functions for

open economies; see e.g., Black (1983). Similar points were made in the

discussions following the German hyperinflation:

    "There are certain instances in which a rise of' prices follows necessarily
    and inevitably from the phenomena of foreign trade and the position of the
    rate of exchange; ... However great the pressure may be upon the central
    bank, however much further credit extensions and note issues may seem
    imperative, further inflation is an act of its own authority for which it
    is answerable." (Ellis (193L), pp. 268—269).

and Weiss (1985).
