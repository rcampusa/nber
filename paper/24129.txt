                                         ABSTRACT

We investigate the effect of the Risk Corridors (RC) program on premiums and insurer
participation in the Affordable Care Act (ACA)’s Health Insurance Marketplaces. The RC
program, which was defunded ahead of coverage year 2016, and ended in 2017, is a risk sharing
mechanism: it makes payments to insurers whose costs are high relative to their revenue, and
collects payments from insurers whose costs are relatively low. We show theoretically that the
RC program creates strong incentives to lower premiums for some insurers. Empirically, we find
that insurers who claimed RC payments in 2015, before defunding, had greater premium
increases in 2017, after the program ended. Insurance markets in which more insurers made RC
claims experienced larger premium increases after the program ended, reflecting equilibrium
effects. We do not find any evidence that insurers with larger RC claims in 2015 were less likely
to participate in the ACA Marketplaces in 2016 and 2017. Overall we find that the end of the RC
program significantly contributed to premium growth.

1. Introduction

       Risk stabilization in insurance markets is a central regulatory consideration. Several key

goals of risk stabilization programs are to ensure financial protection of consumers from market

volatility, encourage participation of insurers in the marketplace, manage the risk pool and

address concerns such as adverse selection by consumers and risk selection by insurers. Such

goals become even more pronounced for newly established insurance marketplaces where

insurers have limited information on the risk pool and consumers face heightened uncertainty on

volatility of the products and prices. However, risk stabilization through regulation creates

incentives as firms share profits. It is important to understand how firms respond to such

financial risk sharing regulations and the impact of their response on pricing and market

participation.

       In this paper, we study the impact of one type of a risk stabilization regulation – risk

corridor (RC) program - in the context of the Health Insurance Marketplaces established in 2014

as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The RC program subsidized insurers whose medical

costs exceed a target, equal to 80 percent of revenue, and taxed insurers with costs below the

target. We ask, whether the RC program that intended to share risk among insurers actually

improved risk sharing, or instead it incentivized some insurers to reduce premiums. We first

build a model to study incentives created by the RC program on the pricing decisions of health

insurers. Next, we examine the model using data from the Health Insurance Marketplaces

established by the ACA. In 2016 there was an unexpected “de-funding” of the program. We use

this as a natural experiment to test the implications of the model on premiums and insurer

participation in the marketplaces.



                                                                                                    1
       Our model shows that it can be optimal for some insurers to set premiums low enough to

receive a RC payment. For insurers claiming an RC payment (because their medical costs exceed

a target), the RC program acts as an implicit subsidy, effectively reducing marginal costs by as

much as 40 percent. Intuitively, if a claiming insurer reduces its premium, its revenue and costs

both rise, leaving true profit roughly unchanged. Its RC payment rises, however, because costs

have increased faster than the RC target amount, which is equal to only 80 percent of revenue.

Thus the RC program encourages insurers to reduce premiums, acting as an implicit subsidy.

Defunding or ending the RC program removes this subsidy, raising premiums, reducing

profitability and potentially discouraging participation. In equilibrium, these effects may be

large, as non-claiming insurers (those with costs below the target) respond to the premium

increases of claiming insurers by raising their own premiums.

       We use two primary data sources to study RC program incentives. The first source is

insurers’ financial filings, which record RC claims (RC owed amounts to insurers) or RC

contributions (RC payments from insurers to the program) in 2014 and 2015. The second source

is an insurer-plan level dataset recording the prices and characteristics of all plans in the

Marketplaces in 2015-2017, from which we infer insurer prices and participation decisions. In

2015, 74 percent of insurers had RC claims, and the average claim amount was $53 per member

month, or 12 percent of medical claims incurred.

       We evaluate the model using a difference-in-differences framework, with claiming

insurers the “treatment” group and non-claiming insurers the “control.” Consistent with our

model, we find that that insurers who made RC claims in 2015 had 7 percent higher premium

increases over the next two years than did non-claiming insurers, even after adjusting for the

higher medical claim costs and lower baseline premiums of claiming insurers. We also find



                                                                                                    2
evidence of spillovers from claiming to non-claiming insurers. Conditional on its own claiming

status, an insurer with more competitors making RC claims in 2015 itself had larger premium

growth from 2015 to 2017. This spillover implies that our simple comparison of claiming and

non-claiming insurers potentially understates the true effect of the RC program. To measure the

full, equilibrium effect of the program, we look at market-level exposure to the RC program,

defined as the fraction of insurers with RC claims in 2015. We find a large and statistically

significant association between overall RC exposure in a given market and premium increases

from 2015 to 2016 and from 2015 to 2017, even after adjusting for the financial health of the

market. Despite the premium effects, we do not find robust evidence that the RC program

affected insurer participation in the Marketplaces.

       Several pieces of evidence suggest that the end of the RC program itself caused the faster

premium growth that we document. We show in placebo test that RC claiming insurers in 2014

had no differential premium growth in 2015, before the program was defunded. Similarly,

markets with more claiming insurers in 2014 did not see faster growth in 2015. These facts help

rule out mean reversion as an alternative explanation. We rule out several further alternative

explanations. The end of reinsurance does not explain our result, as reinsurance is negatively

correlated with RC claiming, conditional on our controls. Another explanation is that claiming

insurers simply mistakenly priced too low. Although we cannot completely rule out insurer

mistakes, we show that insurers with more experience selling products in the individual market

for health insurance prior to the establishment of Health Insurance Marketplaces in 2014—ones

less likely to misprice—were more likely to make RC claims, and their premiums responded the

most to defunding. Finally we present evidence against the “invest-then-harvest” hypothesis.

This hypothesis implies that firms priced low to gain market share while the RC program was in



                                                                                                  3
effect, and then raised prices to take advantage of consumer inertia. As Ericson (2014) argues,

we can test this hypothesis by looking at whether prices rise faster on older health plans, which

have more locked in enrollees. We find no evidence for such differential price growth.

       Our results help explain rising premiums in 2017. Our estimates imply that each

additional insurer making RC claims in a given rating area (relevant geographic market for

insurance products in Health Insurance Marketplaces) in 2015 was associated with 4.2 percent

higher premium growth in 2016, and 6.6 percent higher growth in 2017. Part of the 2017

premium growth was likely due to the end of the RC program. We can use our estimates to

obtain the overall effect of ending the RC program, although doing so requires extrapolating far

outside the range of identifying variation in the data. This extrapolation implies that ending the

RC program accounts for 86 percent of all premium growth between 2015 and 2017.



2. Related Literature

       The establishment of the Health Insurance Marketplaces in 2014 was one of the signature

changes of the Affordable Care. Prior to them, obtaining health insurance in the individual

market (i.e., not through an employer) was a difficult process, involving costly consumer search,

frequent rejections, and high premiums (see, e.g., Abraham and Karaca-Mandic (2011),

Abraham et al. (2013) and Karaca-Mandic et al. (2015)). The Marketplaces created a centralized

platform for insurance purchase. Accompanying regulations required guaranteed issue and

prevented medical underwriting, permitting insurers to charge different prices only on the basis

of location, age, and tobacco use. As there was considerable uncertainty about who would sign

up for coverage, the ACA included temporary provisions to share risk between insurers and the

government. We focus on the risk corridors program.



                                                                                                     4
        Initially the Marketplaces appeared to work well, attracting many enrollees and insurers.

In 2015, 11.6 million people signed up for insurance coverage in the Health Insurance

Marketplaces, and the average Marketplace had 4.9 insurers offering coverage. 1 In 2016,

however, premiums rose by 9 percent and insurer participation fell to 4.2 insurers. In 2017,

premiums rose a further 25 percent, and participation fell to 2.9 insurers per market. Rapid

premium increases and declining insurer participation provoked considerable concern among

policymakers. Mark Dayton, governor of Minnesota, publicly noted that the “Affordable Care

Act is no longer affordable,” 2 and the Senate majority leader cited both premium increase and

insurer exits to justify legislative action. 3

        These premium and participation trends coincided with important regulatory changes in

the Health Insurance Marketplaces related to the RC program. The RC program was scheduled

to expire at the end of 2016, as was the reinsurance program. However, the ACA did not

appropriate funding for the RC program, which in fact was defunded for coverage year 2016 by

the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act (Cromnibus), 4 effectively ending

the RC program a year early. Cromnibus was championed by Senator Marco Rubio, who

boasted that he “Killed Obamacare” by cutting pivotal funding for insurers, 5 a claim which

pundits echoed. 6

       Our results are related to the literature on reinsurance, i.e. insurance for insurers, of which

the RC program is an example. Geruso and McGuire (2016) and Layton et al. (2016) study the

tradeoffs in the design of reinsurance programs, arguing that programs that share risk between

insures and the government result in weaker cost-control incentives for insurers. Our focus on

the empirical consequences of the RC program for premium and participation complements these

papers, which do not consider pricing incentives, nor estimate insurer responses. Our finding that

insurers respond to the incentives embedded in the RC program is consistent with a broader

literature on the strategic response of insurers to supply-side subsidies. For example Brown et al.

(2014) show evidence that when reimbursement for diabetes care is higher, insurers enroll more

diabetics in the presence of risk adjustment (cream skimming). Similarly Geruso and Layton,

(2015) find that risk adjustment creates incentives for insurers to report more diagnoses per

patient (upcoding). Geruso, Layton, and Prinz (2016) show that insurers tailor their plan design

to attract enrollees whose costs are below their risk adjustment payment. Additionally, Carey

(2017) shows that risk adjustment payments influence which prescriptions drugs are covered by

health plans and how much they cost to patients.

       Our findings also contribute to the recent literature on pricing and participation on the

health insurance marketplaces. This literature has documented that more insurer competition

leads to lower prices (Dickstein et al. 2015; Dafny, Gruber, and Ody, 2015) and that insurer

participation is positively related to market size (Dickstein. et al. 2015; Abraham et al. 2017).

These results give few insights about why premiums have risen. Garthwaite and Graves (2017)

argue that falling insurer participation reflects a natural shake out as insurers learned whether

they could profitably operate on the Health Insurance Marketplaces. We show that the defunding




                                                                                                    6
and end of the RC program meaningfully raised premiums, although it did not reduce

participation.



3. Background

3.1 Risk Corridors and the Premium Stabilization Programs

           The RC program is meant to provide insurance against having higher than expected

claims costs, financed with payments from insurers with lower than expected claims costs. 7 It is

therefore a profit-sharing program between the government and insurers. Essentially, the RC

program allows insurers’ markups of premium revenue over medical claims to fall within a

narrow range around a target. Insurers with a markup in this range neither make a payment nor

receive one, so we call them “neutral.” If markups are too high, then insurers must make a

payment into the RC program; we call such insurers “contributing.” If markups are too low, then

insurers receive a payment from the RC program; we call such insurers “claiming.”

           The target for medical claims costs is equal to 80 percent of premium revenue. If the

insurer’s claims fall between 97 and 103 percent of the target, the insurer neither makes nor

receives a payment (so it is neutral). If the insurer’s medical claims fall between 103 and 108

percent of the target, insurer receives a payment equal to 50 percent of the excess over 103

percent. If the insurer’s medical claims exceed 108 percent of the target, then insurer receives a

payment equal to 2.5 percent of the target (i.e. 50 percent of 108-103), plus 80 percent of the

excess over 108 percent. The situation is reversed for insurers with low expenses: they pay in 50

percent on the margin if medical claims are between 92 and 97 percent of the target, and 80

percent on the margin if claims are below 92 percent of the target. Figure 1, panel A illustrates



7
    Our description of the RC program, as well as reinsurance and risk adjustment, draws heavily on Cox et al. (2017).

                                                                                                                     7
the RC payments as a function of claims, both relative to the target amount. As we emphasize in

the model below, the dollar amount for the target is tied to premiums, so an insurer who sets a

lower premium (holding fixed its claims) gets a higher RC payment.

       The RC program is one of three “premium stabilization programs” created by the ACA.

The others are reinsurance and risk adjustment. Reinsurance and the RC program were both

legislated to be in effect for 2014-2016; risk adjustment was permanent. Risk adjustment

redistributes revenue among Marketplace insurers, from insurers that enroll few people with

expensive diagnoses to insurers that enroll relatively many people with expensive diagnoses. It is

not a net subsidy. The reinsurance program, however, is a subsidy for Marketplace insurers: it

pays fraction of any individual’s medical costs that exceed an attachment point ($45,000 in 2014

and 2015, and $90,000 in 2016).

3.2 Defunding the risk corridors program

   As legislated in the Affordable Care Act, the RC program need not be budget neutral; if all

insurers experience high medical claims relative to premiums, then the program would call for

large net payouts, financed from general revenue. However, the program was made budget

neutral by the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act (Cromnibus) of

December, 2014. Cromnibus required that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services only

use payments from contributing insurers to pay claiming insurers. Although the Department of

Health and Human Services (HHS) was authorized to look for additional sources of funds,

Section 227 of the Cromnibus specifically prohibited HHS from borrowing from other accounts.

In October 2015, CMS announced that in the first year of the RC program, insurers submitted

claims for $2.87 billion in losses, against gains that totaled only $362 million (Department of

Health and Human Services 2015; Jost 2015). The shortfall for 2014 meant that health insurers


                                                                                                  8
were to be paid only 12.6% on the dollar for their RC claims. 8 Because 2014 claims have

seniority over subsequent years, 2015 and 2016 losses were likely to be paid even less.

Cromnibus essentially defunded the RC program.

    Although Cromnibus passed in 2014, we assume that the earliest it could affect insurers’

pricing and participation decisions was for coverage year of 2016. This is because participation,

pricing, and enrollment decisions in the Marketplaces are made several months before the start of

the coverage year. The process begins in May-June before the coverage year, when participating

insurers must submit plan information, including premiums, for certification. After all plans are

finalized and certified in late October, data is locked down and insurers cannot change their

premiums or plan offerings. Then open enrollment begins, typically running from mid-

November through mid-January of the coverage year (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid

Services, 2014). Thus, by the time Cromnibus was passed, insurers had already committed to

their 2015 participation and pricing decisions.

    It is possible that insurers anticipated Cromnibus’ defunding of the RC program, and priced

accordingly, but several considerations make this unlikely. First, insurer anecdotes indicate that

they were counting on receiving RC payments. For example, the CEO of Health Republic of

Oregon, said in 2015, “We were stable, had a growing membership and could have been

successful if we had received those payments. We relied on the payments in pricing our

plans.” 9 Second, it would have been difficult for insurers to know, even after Cromnibus, exactly

how little the RC program would pay out, because the exact payment amount depends on the

realized revenues and losses of all insurers. Third, the Department of Health and Human Services

(HHS), which oversees the RC program, continued to indicate as late as February 2015 (two

months post-Cromnibus) that it expected all RC claims to be paid in 2016. Even if contributions

fell short of claims, the regulations indicated that “HHS will use other sources of funding for the

risk corridors payments, subject to the availability of appropriations.” 10 These appropriations

ultimately did not become available, of course. In fact, such assurances may have persuaded

some insurers that the RC payments would eventually come through. The shortfall of the RC

program became the clear October 1, 2015 through a CMS letter stating that 2014 RC payments

would be prorated at 12.6 percent. 11 At that point, it was too late to adjust premiums for 2016.

Therefore, while we expect the effect of RC defunding on premiums and participation to occur

the earliest for the 2016 coverage year, for some insurers, it may not be until the 2017 coverage

year.

3.3 The Minimum Medical Loss Ratio Requirement

        The RC program interacts with another ACA regulation: the minimum medical loss ratio

(MLR) requirement, which requires that insurers’ qualified medical expenses equal at least 80

percent of their premium revenue in the individual market. If expenses fall below this target,

then insurers must rebate the difference to their enrollees. The MLR appears to be a reasonable

target for regulating insurers’ profits (Karaca-Mandic, Abraham, Simon, 2015). The MLR’s 80

percent target roughly coincides with the 80 percent target for the RC program. 12 For the

   https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs-and-Initiatives/Premium-Stabilization-
Programs/Downloads/RiskCorridorsPaymentProrationRatefor2014.pdf
12
   An important distinction to make is that MLR is defined at the state-year level for the entire individual market
business of an insurer, including both the exchange and the off-exchange markets. On the other hand, RC is defined
for an insurer-year, only for the exchange market. The MLR target and the RC target can diverge if off-exchange
business is an important part of an insurer’s individual market operations. However, for insurers in our analysis

                                                                                                                 10
purposes of MLR calculations, RC contributions count as cost (i.e. RC contributions are paid

before MLR rebates). As a result, although the RC program subsidizes insurer losses, it does not

penalize insurer gains, because the required RC contribution for a high-margin insurer would go

to the MLR program in the absence of the RC program.


    4. Model

    We develop a model of the RC program to understand its implications for firm-level pricing

and participation decisions, as well as market-level premiums.

4.1 Firm-level pricing decisions

        We begin by considering the premium response of a single insurer to the incentives

created by the RC program. We model insurers as price setters here because the ACA’s

guaranteed issue provision bars insurers from setting quantity—they must sell insurance to

everyone who demands it. We focus on price setting rather than cost reduction because we

believe that insurers can much more easily control their prices than their costs. We assume that

insurer 𝑖𝑖 sets premiums to maximize profit, equal to revenue less total variable costs and fixed

costs, plus a RC transfer:

                              𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 = 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖 (𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 , 𝑝𝑝−𝑖𝑖 ) − 𝑉𝑉𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖 (𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 , 𝑝𝑝−𝑖𝑖 ) − 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 + 𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖 ,

where 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖 is demand, 𝑉𝑉𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖 is variable cost, and 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 is the fixed cost. In general, 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 depends on the

premiums of all the competitors of 𝑖𝑖, 𝑝𝑝−𝑖𝑖 , but for notational simplicity we omit this dependence

in this subsection, and we drop the 𝑖𝑖 subscript. We write variable cost as the product of demand

𝑞𝑞(𝑝𝑝) and an average cost curve 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴(𝑝𝑝). 13 Average cost may depend on price because of adverse

selection, which implies that as the price rises, relatively healthy people are less likely to buy


sample, exchange premiums represent 89 percent of all premium review in 2015, and exchange costs represent 98
percent of all costs.
13
   We think of marginal costs here as reflecting both actual claims costs and associated variable costs, such as
utilization review and disease management. These associated costs also count as costs for the RC program.

                                                                                                                   11
coverage, resulting in higher average costs of the insured. 14 The risk adjustment program may

offset adverse selection; the extent or presence of adverse selection does not affect our results.

           We model the RC transfer to firm 𝑖𝑖 as a piecewise linear function of variable costs 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 =

𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐, with kink points determined by the cost target, which is equal to revenue 𝑅𝑅 = 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝, scaled by a

factor 𝑇𝑇. In the individual insurance market, 𝑇𝑇 = 0.8. There are five line-segments, with four

kink points, 𝑘𝑘1 , … , 𝑘𝑘4 , and four non-zero slopes 𝑚𝑚1 , … , 𝑚𝑚4 These kink points are 0.92, 0.97,

1.03, and 1.08 and the slopes are 0.8, 0.5, 0.5, and 0.8, as shown in Figure 1.

           We write the RC payment function as

                                   𝑚𝑚1 (𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 − 𝑘𝑘1 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇) + 𝑚𝑚2 (𝑘𝑘1 − 𝑘𝑘2 )𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇,    𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 ≤ 𝑘𝑘1 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇

                𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉, 𝑅𝑅) =                                               0,   𝑘𝑘2 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 < 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 ≤ 𝑘𝑘3 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇

The RC payment is affected by prices in two ways, through both revenue and costs. As long as

demand responds to prices, the program creates complex pricing incentives, as Panel A of Figure

1 illustrates. With inelastic demand, the RC function is simply piecewise linear in 𝑝𝑝. With elastic

demand, however, the function is highly nonlinear, and can give rise to surprising pricing

incentives.

           We begin by providing some intuition on how the RC program skews pricing incentives,

particularly for claiming insurers. Inspection of the RC equation reveals that claiming insurers

would increase their profits if they could raise costs and revenue by one dollar each. Doing so


14
     Einav, Finkelstein, and Cullen (2010) model adverse selection in this way.

                                                                                                                 12
raises RC payments by about $0.13, and otherwise leaves profits unchanged. It may seem

surprising that raising both revenue and costs can increase RC payments, since on the margin

each $1 of cost above the target only raises payments by $0.8. The reason this strategy is

profitable is that the target rises slower than revenue. Increasing revenue and cost by $1 raises

the target by only $0.8, and so the RC payment by roughly $0.16 (=0.2*0.8). (The exact increase

in RC payment is $0.13 because the RC program only covers 80 percent of costs that exceed 108

percent of the target). These calculations suggest that, on the margin, claiming insurers might

prefer small or even negative mark ups. Thus, we expect that the RC program distorts downward

the pricing decisions of claiming firms.

        We show this more formally by considering the first order condition for an insurer that is

on the last line segment, meaning that its costs are more than 8% above its target, or put

differently that its premium is low relative to its target. The first order condition for such an

insurer is

                          (1 − 𝑚𝑚4 )                          𝐴𝐴𝐶𝐶 ′ (𝑝𝑝)   1                 𝐴𝐴𝐶𝐶 ′ (𝑝𝑝)  1               (1)

where 𝜂𝜂 ≡ − 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 /𝑞𝑞 is the firm’s semi-elasticity of demand, and 𝑠𝑠 ≡ 1−𝑇𝑇(𝑚𝑚                                 . In the
                                                                                          4 𝑘𝑘4 −𝑚𝑚3 (𝑘𝑘4 −𝑘𝑘3 ))


absence of the risk corridor program, the first order condition is

                                                               𝐴𝐴𝐶𝐶 ′ (𝑝𝑝) 1
                                             𝑝𝑝 = 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴(𝑝𝑝) −              + .
                                                                   𝜂𝜂      𝜂𝜂

Equation (1) is equivalent to the usual first order condition for a profit-maximizing firm, except

for two factors. First, adverse selection means that when the firm raises its price, its average cost

may rise as well, making it want a lower price, all else equal; the 𝐴𝐴𝐶𝐶 ′ (𝑝𝑝) term captures this

effect. Second, the firm acts as if it faces cost curve of 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠(𝑝𝑝) rather than 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴(𝑝𝑝). At the program

parameters, 𝑠𝑠 ≈ 0.61, so the RC program induces insurers with large claims to price as if they

                                                                                                                            13
faced a 39 percent marginal cost subsidy. For insurers locating on the second-to-last budget

segment, the first order condition implies a subsidy of 15 percent of marginal cost. 15

            Figure 1, panel B illustrates the pricing distortion created by the RC program. We show

variable profit as a function of premium, for an insurer with constant average costs normalized to

1 and an iso-elastic demand curve with an elasticity of 𝜖𝜖 = −4. 16 With this demand curve, the

insurer optimally charges a premium of (1 + 1⁄𝜖𝜖 )−1 percent of cost. In the absence of the RC

program, the optimal premium is 133 percent of cost. With the RC program, if the insurer did not

re-optimize, it would end up making a payment into the RC program equal to roughly half of its

profit. With re-optimization, however, the insurer can do better by charging a much lower

premium and making a large RC claim. With the RC program, the insurer acts as though it faces

a cost of 0.61, and so it charges a markup of 33 percent above that, or a premium of 81 percent of

its true cost (i.e. 1.33*0.61). The RC’s implicit subsidy is so large that it can be optimal for a

firm to price below cost.

       4.2 Reinsurance, Risk Adjustment, and Cost-Sharing Reductions
Our model easily accommodates reinsurance and risk adjustment, and our results are essentially

unchanged once we incorporate them. 17 These programs both essentially involve changing the

average cost function. Reinsurance can be modelled as a reduction in average costs equal to the

expected reinsurance payment per enrollee. Cost-sharing reductions (CSR) are additional

discounts that reduce the enrollees’ copayments, coinsurance or deductible if they meet income

eligibility criteria. As such, risk adjustment and cost-sharing reductions affect pricing decisions


                                                          1               𝑠𝑠 ′ 𝐴𝐴𝐶𝐶 ′                     1−𝑚𝑚3
15
     For such insurers, the first order condition is 𝑝𝑝 = + 𝑠𝑠 ′ 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 −                 , where 𝑠𝑠′ =                  = 0.85.
                                                          𝜂𝜂                  𝜂𝜂                        1−𝑚𝑚3 𝑘𝑘3 𝑇𝑇
16
   This may seem like a very elastic demand curve, but Abraham et al. (2017) estimate that the average Marketplace
plan in 2015 had an elasticity of -4.6 with respect to the unsubsidized premium (i.e. gross of the premium tax
credit), which is the relevant elasticity from the insurer’s perspective.
17
   Here we abstract from the influence of risk adjustment on benefit design, which Geruso, Prinz, and Layton (2017)
study.

                                                                                                                                 14
by changing the average cost function (but not revenue). We can therefore account for these

                     � (𝑝𝑝) = 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴(𝑝𝑝) + 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝑝𝑝) + 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝑝𝑝)
                     𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴

where 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝑝𝑝), and 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝑝𝑝) are the expected per-enrollee reinsurance,

and Risk Adjustment, payment when the premium is 𝑝𝑝. Risk Corridor payments are calculated

on costs net of reinsurance, risk adjustment, and CSRs, so the first order condition for optimal

pricing under the RC program becomes

                                                               � ′ (𝑝𝑝)
                                                               𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴      1
                                                    � (𝑝𝑝) −
                                           𝑝𝑝 = 𝑠𝑠 �𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴               �+ .
                                                                   𝜂𝜂    𝜂𝜂


Allowing for reinsurance or cost sharing reductions does not change the conclusion that the RC

program causes insurers to price as though they face an average cost curve scaled by 𝑠𝑠.

4.3 Insurer participation decisions

    Given participation decisions, the RC program distorts premiums downward. The RC

program may also affect insurer participation in the Marketplace. To see this, let 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖∗ be firm 𝑖𝑖’s

maximal profit, assuming it decided to participate. Insurer 𝑖𝑖 participates if 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖∗ > 𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖 . The RC

program affects participation by changing maximal profit. It is straightforward to see that the RC

program must increase profit. At any premium, profit is weakly higher under the RC program

(given MLR regulations), so the maximal profit must also be higher under RC program. Thus,

our model implies at least a small effect of the program on participation.

    However this effect need not be large. In particular, even firms making large risk corridor

claims may experience small changes in profit and therefore small changes in participation

probabilities. Figure 2 gives the intuition. Under the RC program, the firm charges a low

premium and receives a large risk corridor payment. Absent the RC program, the firm would

                                                                                                                    15
charge a much higher premium, undoing most of the loss from the end of the RC program. Thus,

even though insurers suffered large losses from the surprise defunding of the RC program, there

is no guarantee that insurers will have low profit going forward.

   4.4 Equilibrium premium effects

   So far, we have considered the premium and participation decisions of a single insurer,

taking the premiums and participation of other insurers as given. It is likely, however, that the

RC program has aggregate, market-level effects, influencing the premiums even of non-claiming

insurers. These aggregate effects arise through two potential channels. First, if the RC program

induces entry, then firms may face stiffer competition and steeper residual demand curves,

leading to further lower premiums. Second, naturally, when the RC program induces a claiming

firm to reduce its premium, a non-claiming firm may want to reduce its premium as well,

assuming that premiums are strategic complements. The possibility that the RC program may

have spillover effects onto non-claiming insurers is important for our empirical approach. It

implies that non-claiming insurers are not a valid control group, and any comparison of claiming

and non-claiming insurers may understate the full effects of the RC program. We account for this

possibility by directly estimating spillover effects in some specifications, and by looking at

market level effects in others.

5. Data

5.1 MLR filing data

       The MLR filing data are derived from reports that insurers submit annually to the Center

for Medicare and Medicaid Services to document their compliance with the minimum MLR

requirements. Since 2014, insurers also report information on their Marketplace business,




                                                                                                    16
including any RC claims or contributions. The MLR filing data are publicly available. 18 The unit

of observation is an insurer-state, since MLR filings, insurance regulation, and premium rate

review occur at the state level. (We will often refer to observations as “insurers” for simplicity,

noting that an insurer is actually an insurer-state, such as “Aetna in Indiana.”)

        We use the 2014 and 2015 MLR filing data to define our independent variables and our

analysis sample. Our key independent variables are premiums earned, medical claims incurred

(net of risk adjustment payments made or received, and cost sharing reduction (CSR) subsidies

received), member-months of enrollment, reinsurance payments (through the premium

stabilization program), and, most importantly, RC claims. We define insurers as claiming if they

have positive RC claims, contributing if they have negative RC claims, and neutral if they have

zero RC claims.

        We define the analysis sample as insurers in the MLR data that met several sample

selection criteria. First, we only consider insurers who reported positive Marketplace enrollment,

Marketplace premiums, and Marketplace medical claims in their 2015 MLR filings. We focus on

Marketplace participation because only Marketplace plans are eligible for RC payments, and we

define the sample based on 2015 variables because future values of RC claims are affected by its

defunding. Next, we follow a two-step procedure suggested by Karaca-Mandic et al. (2015) to

identify and exclude erroneous observations from the raw data. First, we flag observations with

extreme values, defined as insurers with claims cost incurred and premiums revenue both in the

top or bottom percentile; or with, either RC net payment per member per month (PMPM) 19 or

ratio of claims to premiums fell into the top or bottom percentile. Second, we exclude the six


18
  See https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Data-Resources/mlr.html
19
  For claiming insurers, this amount is the payment per member-month that they expected to receive from the RC
program, while for contributing insurers, this is the payment per member-month that they contributed to the RC
program.

                                                                                                                 17
flagged observations in 2015 with fewer than 1,000 member-years of enrollment. We excluded

these insurers because the MLR regulations do not apply to insurers with fewer than 1,000

member-years, and we are concerned about small insurers having implausibly large ratios of

claims to premiums (and hence large RC payments per member). This leads to a sample of 339

insurer-states participating in 2015. We excluded two insurers whom we could not match to the

HIX data (described below), for a final sample of 337 insurers participating in 2015, of whom

282 continued to participate in 2016, and 204 in 2017.

5.2 HIX Compare Data

        The HIX dataset, compiled by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, contain information

on the premiums and characteristics of Marketplace plans offered in 2014-2017. 20 We observe

each plan’s metal level (measuring plan's generosity, with bronze being the least generous and

platinum being the most), plan type (PPO, HMO, EPO, POS, or other), and premium. The ACA

allows insurers to charge different premiums in different geographic rating areas, which are

typically aggregations of counties; we observe each plan’s premium in each area where it is

offered. We exclude 23 plans with monthly premiums over $10,000, which we believe are

erroneous. In 2015-2017, we observe all plans in all rating areas. In 2014, however, we only

observe silver plans for the states that did not use healthcare.gov (for the healthcare.gov states,

we observe all plans). We observe the Health Insurance Oversights System (HIOS) identifier of

  We obtained the 2014 and 2017 data from http://www.rwjf.org/en/library/research/2017/04/hix-compare-2014-
2017-datasets.html. The 2015 and 2016 data were incomplete so we obtained an updated from Vericred, the data
vendor. We expect that these data will be publicly available soon. We found that the 2014 and 2015 data sets are
incomplete; some insurers with Exchange enrollment in the MLR data do not appear in the latest data release. (There
were two such insurers in 2014, and 15 in 2015). By combining these two releases, we ended up with a nearly
complete set of all Marketplace offerings in 2015-2017 and silver offerings in 2014. We believe we have all or
nearly all offerings because of the very high match rate between the MLR and HIX data: 337 of the 339 Marketplace
insurers in the MLR in 2015 are also in the HIX data, and 283 of the 286 in 2014.

                                                                                                                18

where we impute it based on the reported insurer’s name.

        We use the HIX dataset to define our insurer-level outcomes. Our first outcome is an

insurer-state-year-level premium index, obtained by aggregating premiums across plans and

rating areas, and adjusting for plan characteristics. We aggregate premiums to the insurer-state

level because RC claiming varies across insurer-states, not plans. To aggregate, we estimate the

following hedonic regression for the log premium of plan 𝑖𝑖 offered by insurer-state observation 𝑗𝑗

in rating area 𝑎𝑎 and year :

                             log 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝜇𝜇𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 + 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 + 𝛾𝛾𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 + 𝜃𝜃𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 .

This regression projects log premiums onto fixed effects for metal level, plan type, rating area-

year, and insurer-state-year. 21 We take the insurer-state-year fixed effect 𝜃𝜃�𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 to be the premium

index of insurer-state 𝑗𝑗 in year 𝑡𝑡. It measures how high 𝑗𝑗’s premiums are in a given year,

adjusting for the generosity (i.e. metal level) and type of plans 𝑗𝑗 offered, as well as

characteristics of the market where j offered plans in year t. We normalize the premium index to

zero in 2015 for each insurer-state.

        Our second outcome is simply exchange participation, coded as one if an insurer-state

offers at least one plan in any rating area in the HIX data in a given state and year. 22 We define

participation as an indicator variable equal to one if an insurer-state offers at least one

Marketplace plan in a given year. By construction, participation is equal to one in 2015 in our

analysis sample.




21
   The dependent variable in these regressions is the premium a 27-year-old would pay. The premium for any other
age is equal to this premium times an age factor, so the log price index we estimate is valid for all ages.
22
   We use the HIX data rather than the MLR filing data to define participation because the MLR data are only
available through 2015.

                                                                                                               19
5.3 Constructing a Rating Area-level dataset

         We construct a rating-area level data set to study aggregate, market-level premium

effects. The rating area is the natural market, because insurers must set a single premium within

that rating area for a given plan. For each of the 504 rating areas in the data, we defined the

market premium as the “benchmark” premium in that rating area, following past literature

(Dickstein, Michael J. et al. 2015; Dafny, Gruber, and Ody 2015; Krinn, Karaca-Mandic, and

Blewett 2015). The benchmark premium is the premium of the second lowest premium silver

plan offered. 23 This premium which is important in because it determines the generosity of the

advanced premium tax credit. We also record the number of insurers offering plans in each rating

area and year. We define aggregate rating area RC exposure as the fraction of insurers operating

in a given rating area who had positive RC claims. 24

5.4 Summary statistics

         Table 1 presents summary statistics for the insurer-year dataset, separately for claiming,

neutral, and RC contributing insurers in 2015. Of the 337 Marketplace insurers in 2015, 74

percent (N=248) were claiming, and 9 percent (N=31) were contributing; the remaining 17

percent (N=58) were neutral. Among claiming insurers, RC claims were large: $53 per member

month, or about 12 percent of average medical claims costs. Claiming insurers did not have

especially low premium revenue, but they did have high claims costs and high reinsurance




23
   As with the insurer-level premium index, we focus on the premium a 27 year-old faces. Premiums for other ages
scale with this premium.
24
   Although a given insurer’s RC claims are specific to a state but not a rating area, different areas in a given state
can nevertheless have different exposure, because of differences in the insurers operating there. For example, Ohio
has 17 rating areas, and there were 16 active insurers across the state. However, they were not all active in every
rating area. Blue Cross served all 17 areas, whereas the low-cost insurer Molina served only eight; risk corridor
exposure was about 20 percent lower in areas that Molina served.

                                                                                                                      20
payments, 25 Consistent with these high costs, claiming insurers had high reinsurance payments.

Claiming insurers were more likely to have participated in the 2012 market: they had more

covered lives, and a larger share of them covered at least 1000 lives. Unadjusted rates of

participation fell substantially for claiming insurers; only 80 percent participated in 2016, and 54

percent in 2017. For claiming, contributing, and neutral insurers, premium indexes increased on

average in 2016 and 2017, but the increase was especially large for claiming insurers.

         Table 2 provides summary statistics for the rating area-year dataset. In the average rating

area in 2015, participating insurers had RC claims of about $41 per member month, and 78

percent of insurers had RC claims. We report in Table 2 the within-state standard deviation of

all variables, including RC exposure. Much of the variation in RC claiming is across states, but

some of it is across markets within a given state, which is important because all of our

regressions include state fixed effects. The table shows substantial changes in premiums and

participation. From 2015 to 2016, benchmark premiums rose on average by 9 percent and the

average number of participating insurers fell from 4.9 to 4.2. In 2017, average premiums

increased a further 25%, and participation fell by 1.4 insurers. We now turn to investigating

whether the 2016 defunding and 2017 end of the RC program can explain these trends.



6. The effect of the risk corridor program on participation and premiums

6.1 General approach to identification

         The model implies that the RC program reduced premiums for claiming insurers and for

their non-claiming competitors. Empirically, we examine whether claiming insurers had larger



25
  This might seem inconsistent with our model, which implies that claiming insurers have low premiums but not
necessarily high costs. The claims and premiums in Table 1, however, are not adjusted for differences across
insurers in the generosity of plans they offer, and indeed claiming insurers also offer relatively generous plans.

                                                                                                                     21
premium increases after the 2016 RC defunding and 2017 program end. We also consider

market-level premium responses, which we expect to be larger in markets in which more insurers

made RC claims, and participation decisions. Our identification strategy takes advantage of the

fact that RC defunding and ending affect 2016 and 2017 decisions, but not earlier ones, and that

they differentially affect firms who would make claims under the program, not neutral or

contributing firms. We therefore compare the change in outcomes from 2015 to 2016 or from

2015 to 2017, for RC claiming insurers, relative to neutral or RC contributing insurers. Using a

control group in this way lets us control for simultaneous trends such as changes in the

reinsurance program or late Medicaid expansions, as well as any other shock at the state-year

level that is common to all insurers.

       Our approach relies on the assumption that, in the absence of defunding or ending the RC

program, claiming, neutral, and contributing insurers would have similar trends in participation

and premiums. It might seem strange to include RC contributing insurers in the “control” group,

since their premium decisions seem affected by the RC program. However, as we noted in

Section 2.3, for RC contributing insurers, the minimum MLR requirements supersede the RC

program, and the RC program has no additional effect on premiums or profits.

       This assumption could fail because claiming is a function of premium revenues and

medical claims expenses. If there is mean reversion in these variables, or other sources of

differential trends, then our estimates will be biased. We address this bias by controlling linearly

for 2015 premiums and medical claims expenses (per member month) in all specifications. The

effect of RC is still identified with these controls because of the nonlinearity in the RC payment

system. These controls help address the possibility that low premium or high claims cost insurers

may have differential trends in future premium or participation decisions.



                                                                                                  22
        We also conduct placebo tests to validate our identification strategy. These tests are based

on the premise that RC claims in 2014 should not be correlated with premium or participation

decision in 2015, because insurers made their 2015 pricing and participation decisions without

knowledge that the RC program was defunded. It is possible, however, that mean reversion in

premiums and claims, or other failures of parallel trends, yield differential trends among

claiming insurers. In that case we would expect to see an “effect” of the RC program defunding

even in 2015. Thus, these placebo tests provide a useful check on the main threat to

identification.

        Our basic approach assumes substantial persistence in RC claiming, because we relate

outcomes in 2016 and 2017 to RC claims in 2015. We think of RC claims in 2015 as a proxy for

“RC claims in 2016, had the RC program not been defunded.” This interpretation is valid only if

there is indeed a high correlation between past and current RC claims. Appendix Table A1

documents this persistence, showing high autocorrelation between 2015 and 2014 in RC claims.

6.2 Insurer-level premium effects

        We estimate insurer-level premium effects with the following regression:

                        𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 − 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡0 = 𝛼𝛼 1�𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗 > 0� + 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 𝜃𝜃 + 𝜇𝜇𝑠𝑠 + 𝜖𝜖𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗   (2)

        Our dependent variable is the difference in the premium index (in logs) of insurer 𝑗𝑗

(recall that insurer j represents an insurer-state pair) between year 𝑡𝑡 and a base year 𝑡𝑡0 (2015 in

our main specifications). We estimate separate models for the 2015-2016 premium changes, the

2015-2017 premium change, and (as a placebo test) the 2014-2015 premium change. The key

independent variable is an indicator for whether insurer 𝑗𝑗 has any RC claims in the base year. 𝛼𝛼

measures the differential premium increase for such insurers. X includes controls for the base

year medical claims expenses (net of risk adjustment and CSR payments), premium revenue, and


                                                                                                        23
member months in 2015. We also control for insurer characteristics (nonprofit status and

membership in a large insurer group such as Anthem) and state fixed effects, 𝜇𝜇𝑠𝑠 , which account

for statewide trends such as late Medicaid expansion or differential support for the Marketplaces.

           We present the estimates in Table 3. In column (1) we look at the 2015-2016 price

change. Consistent with the model, we estimate that RC claiming insurers have higher premium

growth in 2016 (relative to their 2015 premiums), but the effect is not statistically significant. In

column (3), we repeat the same estimation for the premium difference from 2015 to 2017. We

estimate a coefficient of 0.07 on 𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗 , meaning that insurers who made a RC claim in 2015

increased their prices by 7 percent more than other insurers in the same state in 2017, after

adjusting for differences in medical claims, premium revenue, and enrollment.

           These specifications assume that there are no differential trends in premiums among

claiming insurers, after adjusting for our controls. To test this possibility, we re-estimate the

models in columns (1) and (2), but regressing the difference in hedonic premium index (logs) in

2014-2015 on 2014 RC claiming. The coefficient on the interaction, 0.001, is small and

statistically insignificant. Differential trends by claiming status do not appear to explain the

results.

           These specifications identify the effect of the RC program by comparing premium

changes among claiming and non-claiming insurers. This comparison understates the program’s

effect if there are any spillovers from claiming to non-claiming insurers. We test for such

spillovers by augmenting Equation (2) to allow insurers to react to their rivals’ claiming status.

Specifically we estimate

      𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 − 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡0 = 𝛼𝛼1�𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗 > 0� + 𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗 + 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 𝜃𝜃 + 𝑍𝑍𝑚𝑚(𝑗𝑗) 𝛾𝛾 + 𝜇𝜇𝑠𝑠 + 𝜖𝜖𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗   (3)




                                                                                                                                     24
where 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗 is the fraction of 𝑗𝑗 ′ 𝑠𝑠 competitors making RC claims in the base year 𝑡𝑡0 .

We calculate this fraction by calculating, for each rating area in which 𝑗𝑗 operated in 𝑡𝑡0 , the

fraction of other insurers with RC claims. We then average over the rating areas in which

𝑗𝑗 operated in 𝑡𝑡0 to obtain the rival claim rate. 26 Because the rival claim rate depends on the

markets in which 𝑗𝑗 operated in 𝑡𝑡0 , we control for the average characteristics of the markets in

which 𝑗𝑗 operated, 𝑍𝑍𝑚𝑚(𝑗𝑗) : the average premium revenue, medical claims, and enrollment of

insurers who operated in those markets in 𝑡𝑡0 , and the fraction of markets that have one insurer,

two insurer, and so on, through six insurers.

         We allow for spillovers in columns (2), (4), and (6) of Table 3. We find that the rival

claiming rate has a large association with 2016 and especially 2017 price increases, although

only the 2017 association is statistically significant. These coefficients mean that a one standard

deviation increase in the rival claiming rate is associated with a roughly 3 percent increase in

premiums in 2016, and an 8 percent increase in 2017. By contrast we find an insignificant and

economically small effect of spillovers in 2015. We conclude from Table 3 that the RC program

had a meaningful effect on premiums, including both a direct effect on claiming insurers and an

indirect, spillover effect on non-claiming insurers.

6.3 Market-level premium effects

         Given the spillovers on non-claiming firms, it is possible that the equilibrium effects

greatly exceed the firm level effects of the RC program. We measure the overall, equilibrium

effects of defunding and end of RC program by looking at the relationship between market-level

premiums and market-level exposure to the RC program. Figure 2 shows a scatter plot of the



26
  We weight each rating area by the number of plans that 𝑗𝑗 offers in it, to account for the possibility that some rating
areas are more important for 𝑗𝑗 than others.

                                                                                                                      25
change in log benchmark premium from 2015 to 2016 and 2017, against rating area average RC

claims. Because the data are noisy, we bin the data. There is a clear, positive relationship:

markets with more RC exposure 2015 experienced larger premium increases in 2016 and 2017.

       This figure does not adjust for possible confounders, the most important of which is that

markets with a large aggregate RC claims may have many insurers in financial distress, with

high medical claims or low premium revenue, who would have raised their premiums even had

the risk corridor program continued. We control for such confounders using an aggregate version

of Equation (2):

                   𝑝𝑝𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 − 𝑝𝑝𝑎𝑎𝑡𝑡0 = 𝛼𝛼(𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶)𝑎𝑎 + 𝑋𝑋𝑎𝑎 𝜃𝜃 + 𝜇𝜇𝑠𝑠(𝑎𝑎) + 𝜀𝜀𝑎𝑎 .   (4)


The dependent variable here is the change in benchmark premium in rating area 𝑎𝑎 from a base

year 𝑡𝑡0 to a reference year 𝑡𝑡. We consider 2015 as a base year and 2016 and 2017 as the

reference years in our main specifications, and 2014 as the base year and 2015 as the reference

year in placebo tests. Our interest is in 𝛼𝛼, the coefficient on area-level RC exposure, measured as

the percentage of insurers in area 𝑎𝑎 with positive RC claims in the base year. 𝛼𝛼 indicates the

association between rating area premium growth and RC exposure. We interpret this association

as the overall equilibrium effect of the RC program. This effect reflects both the direct effect on

claiming insurers, and any spillover effects on non-claiming insurers. To account for the

financial position of insurers in area 𝑎𝑎, we include several controls: average claims expenses

(adjusted for risk adjustment and CSR payments) and premium revenue in 2015, as well as total

enrollment, among insurers in the rating area in the base year. We also include state fixed effects

to account for state wide trends in claiming.

       Table 5 shows the results for our market-level models. Our sample includes all 504 rating

areas. In column (1) we look at the 2015-2016 premium changes and in column (2) we look at

                                                                                                               26
2015-2017 changes. In both cases we find a statistically significant association between rating

area RC exposure in 2015 and subsequent premium increases. The coefficients indicate that each

one percentage point increase in the percent of RC claiming insurers in the market is associated

with 0.22 percent higher premium growth from 2015 to 2016, and a 0.34 percent higher growth

from 2015 to 2017. By contrast we find no association between RC claiming and price growth

between 2014 and 2015. We expect to find no effect in 2015, because the RC program was still

in effect then. Thus, generally rising premiums in areas with more RC claiming do not appear to

explain the observed association between aggregate RC claims in 2015 and premium increases in

2016 and 2017.

        A back-of-the-envelope calculation helps put these estimates in perspective. In 2015 the

average rating area had 4.9 insurers, and 78 percent of insurers in a rating area had made RC

claims, implying that roughly 4 out of 5 insurers making RC claims. If an additional insurer

made an RC claim – roughly a 20 percentage point increase in the claiming rate – then premiums

would have increased by 4.2 percent more in 2016 and 6.6 percent more in 2017. This is a

meaningful fraction of the actual benchmark premium increase of 37 percent between 2015 and

2017 (from $230 to $314).

        We can also use the estimates to measure the effect of ending the RC program on

benchmark premiums. We obtain this effect by asking how premium growth would have

changed if no insurers had any RC claims, meaning that 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 equals zero

(instead of its average of 0.78). We caution that this requires extrapolating well outside the range

of identifying variation in the data. Conditional on the state fixed effects, there is relatively little

variation in 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶; in the most extreme case, it varies by about 0.50 (meaning that

in one state, there are rating areas 25 percentage points above and below the state average



                                                                                                            27
𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶). Our estimates imply that if the RC program had not ended, premium

growth from 2015 to 2017 would have been about 5 log points, instead of 30. This is a large

difference and given the reliance on functional form required to justify our extrapolation, we

conclude only that the end of the RC program likely had a meaningful effect on aggregate

premium growth in 2017.

6.4 Participation Effects

         We estimate the effect of the RC program on Marketplace participation with regressions

of the following form:

                       Pr(𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗 ) = 𝐿𝐿�𝛼𝛼1�𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑚𝑚𝑗𝑗 > 0� + 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 𝜃𝜃 + 𝜇𝜇𝑠𝑠(𝑗𝑗) �,     (5)


where 𝐿𝐿 is the logit function and our outcome is exchange participation in 2016 or 2017. We

control for the same variables used in the premium analysis: premiums per member month,

claims per member month, member months of enrollment for insurer 𝑗𝑗, all in 2015, as well as

not-for-profit status, membership in a large insurer alliance, and state fixed effects. 27 Although it

appears that we estimate equation (2) in levels, we are in fact identifying off of changes in

participation, because our sample consists of insurers that participated in 2015. The only way

participation is not equal to one, therefore, is if it changes. We ask whether participation is more

likely to change in 2016 (and in 2017) among insurers with larger RC claims in 2015, relative to

other insurers in the same state and adjusting for financial position.

         Table 5 shows the estimates of 𝛼𝛼. We show the results without state fixed effects in

column (1). We find no statistically significant relationship between RC claims and 2016

participation or 2017 participation. We also find a small and insignificant participation effect in a


27
 In some states the 2016 and 2017 participation rate was 100 percent, so their fixed effects are not identified, and
we must omit them. In robustness tests below, we estimate linear probability models with state fixed effects, in
which case we can include all states.

                                                                                                                   28
placebo specification looking at the effect of 2014 RC claiming on 2015 participation. These

specifications therefore show little participation effects of the RC program. We conclude that

rather than exit the marketplace entirely, insurers reacted to the end of the RC program by raising

premiums.

6.5 Robustness checks

       In Appendix A, we conduct an extensive series of robustness tests, which we summarize

here. For the insurer-level results, we primarily consider robustness to a richer set of controls:

nonlinear functions of claims and premiums, richer insurer characteristics (Blue status, and

indicators for membership in each of the largest cross-state insurer alliances), and reinsurance

payments per member month. We also consider excluding contributing firms—who ended up

with MLRs below the statutory minimum—from the analysis. Our estimates are fairly similar

across specifications. For the market-level results, we consider nonlinear functions of market-

level premium revenue, member months, and claims costs, as well as demographics of the

population. We also consider weighting each market by its population. Across all these

specifications, we find only small differences in our estimates, except that the RC program has a

substantially larger effect when we weight our estimates with market population.

7. Alternative explanations

7.1 “Invest-then-harvest” pricing strategies

       We have found robust evidence that insurers making RC claims in 2015 had larger

premium growth in 2016 and 2017 than non-claiming insurers, which we attribute to the program

defunding and the end. An alternative explanation is that these premium increases represent an

“invest-then-harvest” or “penetration pricing” strategy whereby insurers initially price low, to

achieve high market share, and then raise premiums, exploiting substantial inertia in health


                                                                                                     29
insurance enrollment (e.g., Handel, 2013). Ericson (2014) shows that insurers pursued such a

strategy during the rollout of Medicare Part D. As low-premium insurers receive RC payments,

this strategy generates a correlation between RC claims and future premium growth.

         The invest-then-harvest explanation cannot account for all the results we have

documented, because it predicts that insurers making RC claims should not exit the market. We

further show that invest-then-harvest is unlikely to explain much of the observed differential

premium increase among claiming insurers. Our approach uses the test of Ericson (2014), who

notes that under invest-then-harvest strategies is that in a given year, older plans should have

higher premiums than newer plans, all else equal, because a greater share of their demand

consists of inert enrollees who have already made their enrollment decisions. To test this

prediction, we estimate the following regression:

               ln 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 = 𝛽𝛽1 �𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 2� + 𝛽𝛽2 �𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 3� + 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,   (6)

where ln 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the premium of plan 𝑖𝑖 offered by insurer 𝑗𝑗 in area 𝑎𝑎, state 𝑠𝑠, and year 𝑡𝑡, and

𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 measures the age of the plan in a given rating area, i.e. the number of years it has been

continuously offered in that rating area, as of 𝑡𝑡. We include fixed effects year-by-area, year-by-

metal level, and year-by-insurer fixed effects. 28 (Note that, although we have four years of data,

we cannot identify an age fixed effect because it is collinear with a 2017 dummy.) The invest-

then-harvest strategy implies that 0 < 𝛽𝛽1 < 𝛽𝛽2 . We estimate equation (6) treating each plan in a

given rating area as a different insurance plan, since insurers can charge different premiums for

the same plan in different rating areas. 29 We report these estimates in Table 6. Across all

specifications, the plan age fixed effects are economically small—never larger than 0.01—and

   These regression contains a large vector of fixed effects, so we estimate them using the reghdfe command,
described in Correia (2016).

for the patterns we have documented. 30

7.2 The end of reinsurance program

The reinsurance program ended at the beginning of 2017, at the same time the RC program

ended. This is only a problem for our analysis to the extent that reinsurance differentially

affected RC claiming insurers, however. RC claiming insurers had high reinsurance payments in

2015, as Table 1 shows, so perhaps they raised their premiums in 2017 because of the end of

reinsurance. To investigate the importance of reinsurance, we add 2015 reinsurance payments

per member per month as an additional control in our pricing regression, Equation (2). The

estimates are in Table 7.

        We find that the estimated effect of the RC program on premium growth becomes larger

when we control for reinsurance, as the comparison of columns (1) and (2) show. This is

surprising because we also find that reinsurance payments in 2015 are positively associated with

price growth in 2017. In columns (3)-(5) of the table, we show that conditional on our controls,

reinsurance payments are negatively correlated with RC payments. This explains why our results

are robust to controlling for reinsurance, despite the clear unconditional correlation between

reinsurance and RC claiming, and the conditional association between reinsurance payments in

2015 and subsequent price growth.

7.3 Mispricing and insurer learning




30
  Note that this finding in no way invalidates the results in Ericson (2014). The Health Insurance Marketplaces
differ in important ways from Medicare Part D. In particular, there is considerable churn in the Marketplaces, as
people may lack employer-sponsored insurance in one year and then obtain it the next, whereas there is essentially
no churn in eligibility for Medicare.

                                                                                                                 31
A potential alternative explanation for our results is insurer learning. In 2014 insurers faced

considerable uncertainty about the costliness of Marketplace enrollees, and some insurers may

have set premiums too low. Such insurers would have made RC claims early on, and then raised

their premiums, even independent of any true effect of the RC program.

   Although insurer learning likely contributes to the overall price dynamics during this period,

several factors suggest that insurer learning do not explain all the results here. First, we observe

no response in 2015 to 2014 RC claiming, although learning would imply faster premium growth

in 2015 for 2014 claiming insurers. Second, we control for premiums and claims, so we control

for premium changes that are linearly related to premiums and claims. Third, if learning or

mispricing is a problem, then it is likely a problem for neutral as well as claiming insurers, as

neutral insurers have thin margins as well. Yet we see in Figure 3 that neutral insurers have

premium changes like contributing insurers, not like claiming insurers. Fourth, experienced

insurers—ones with at least 1,000 covered lives in the 2012 individual market—were more likely

to make RC claims, as Table 1 shows. They also responded somewhat more to defunding and the

end of the RC program, as Table 8 shows. Under the hypothesis that these insurers understood

the market best, this is suggestive evidence that learning does not explain the observed

association between RC claiming and premium growth. We view this evidence as suggestive,

because experience in 2012 may be an unreliable guide to 2014, after community rating and

guaranteed issue came into effect, and because the estimates in Table 8 are somewhat noisy.

Nonetheless the available evidence suggests that, although learning is important in influencing

premium and participation dynamics during this period, it likely does not explain our key

findings.

   8. Conclusions


                                                                                                    32
       In 2016 and 2017, premiums in the Health Insurance Marketplaces rose rapidly, while

insurer participation fell. At the same time, the RC program was defunded and then ended.

Collectively, insurers in 2015 expected to receive billions of dollars from this program. We have

shown theoretically that the RC program encourages claiming insurers to reduce their premiums,

with likely spillover effects to non-claiming insurers, so the end of the program could have

caused premiums to rise. Empirically, we find that insurers making RC claims in 2015 had larger

premium increases by 2017, and markets in which more insurers made RC claims had much

larger premium increases. We found no evidence, however, that insurers making RC claims were

particularly likely to exit the market. It is possible nonetheless that the RC program encouraged

participation. One motivation for the program was to protect insurers from aggregate uncertainty

in 2014 about the likely composition of enrollees. Our design, which looks at behavior after this

uncertainty is resolved, cannot detect this effect.

       The end of the RC program may explain much of the dramatic increases in premiums in

2017. We simulate this effect by asking how premiums would have changed had no insurers

made RC claims in 2015. This simulation is outside the range of the variation we use for

identification, so we view it as suggestive rather than definitive. However, we find that in the

absence of the RC program ending, premiums would have risen by only 10 percent between

2015 and 2017, instead of the actual 37 percent we observe. This finding suggests that rising

premiums in the Marketplaces in 2017 do not necessarily reflect market instability or an adverse

selection death spiral, but rather the end of a large, effective subsidy.

Notes: Table shows coefficients on the indicated variables, from a regression of the change in insurers’ log premium
index between the indicated years. Insurer controls, not shown, include medical claims PMPM, premium revenue
PMPM, member months PMPM, a nonprofit indicator, and an indicator for membership in a large insurer alliance.
Market level controls, also not shown, include within-market averages of premium revenue PMPM, medical claims
PMPM (net of risk adjustment and cost sharing reduction subsidies), and member months (averaged over the
markets in which the insurer operates), as well as a set of controls for the fraction of markets in which the insurer
operates that have exactly one, two, three, four, five, six insurers. (Seven or more insurers is the omitted category.)
Variables are measured at the time of the base year (2015 in columns 1-4, 2014 in columns 5-6). The sample
consists of insures on the exchange in both the base and the final year, and meeting the sample inclusion criteria in
the base year. Robust standard errors in parentheses.

year, against a dummy for having RC claims in 2015 (for participation in 2016 and 2017) or 2014 (for participation
in 2015), as well as the indicated controls. Because we include state fixed effects, the sample excludes states with
100 percent participation in the indicated year. 2015 participation is a placebo test as the RC program was in effect
then. Medical claims PMPM are net of risk adjustment payments and cost sharing reduction subsidies. Average
effect is the change in predicted participation rates from setting the RC coefficient to zero. Robust standard errors in

Notes: Table shows that controlling for reinsurance payments raises the coefficient on RC claiming, because
reinsurance is conditionally correlated with price increases, but conditionally negatively correlated with claiming.
Columns (1) and (2) show the results of regressing the change in log premiums between 2015 and 2017 on RC
claiming dummy, reinsurance per member per month (in $100s), and the baseline controls (medical claims PMPM,

Appendix A: Robustness tests
   We consider a series of tests to show that our results are robust to the key threats to

identification, and to alternative specifications. Our robustness tests differ slightly from outcome

to outcome, because of differences in the underlying data, but in general we show robustness to

how we control for 2015 premiums and claims, to the presence of other controls, and to

functional form. We find that our estimates are typically similar across alternative

specifications, but in some specifications, they are substantially larger.

A.1 Robustness of insurer-level premium estimates

       Appendix Table A2 shows the robustness of the insurer-level premium estimates.

Column (1) shows the baseline estimates. Our key identification assumption is that, had the

program not been defunded or ended, insures with RC claims would have had similar trends in

premiums as non-claiming insurers. The main threat to identification is that, by construction,

insurers with large RC claims in 2015 had high costs relative to premiums, so our main

specifications control for 2015 medical claims and premium revenue, as well as total enrollment.

However, there need not be a linear relationship between participation probabilities (or

participation indices) and premium revenue, medical claims, or enrollment. In column (2) of the

table, we add controls for all second-order terms: quadratics for medical claims, premium

revenue, and enrollment, plus all two-way interactions. The estimated coefficients are a bit

smaller and the 2017 coefficient is now marginally significant (p=0.07). In column (3), we add

additional controls for the insurer, in particular we add a set of dummy variables indicating Blue

status, and indicating membership in each of the five largest insurer alliances (Aetna, Cigna,

Humana, UnitedHealthCare, and Wellpoint). These additional controls change the estimated

coefficients only slightly. In column (4), we control for 2015 reinsurance claims PMPM, and in



                                                                                                  45
column (5) we control for all variables considered. The coefficients are quite similar to the

baseline estimates. In column (6), we exclude from the sample RC contributors, insurers who

paid into the RC program in 2015. Thus in this column we are identified by comparing claiming

insurers to neutral insurers, whose claims are between 77 and 83 percent of premium revenue,

and who therefore more closely resemble claiming insurers. We continue to find similar effects

of the defunding and end of the RC program, although the 2017 standard error rises and the point

estimate is only marginally significant (p=0.07), reflecting our lower power. Overall we

conclude that our insurer-level premium estimates are not highly sensitive to the exact set of

controls used or the comparison group.

A.2 Robustness of market-level price effects

       Appendix Table A3 shows the robustness of the market-level results. Column (1) reports

the baseline estimates, where we relate the change in premiums in a given rating area to the

fraction of insurers making RC claims in 2015. We show in column (2) that further controlling

for the average RC claim amount does not much change the estimated coefficient, and indeed the

amount claimed is less important than the fraction claiming. In column (3) we add a richer set of

controls: the average of the nonlinear terms for premium revenue, medical claims, and member

months, controlling for quadratics and interactions among these variables, each interacted with

2016 and 2016 dummies. The 2016 and 2017 coefficients on average owed amount are quite

similar. In column (4), we show that the results are also robust to controlling for a large set of

interactions between rating area characteristic. In particular, we use ACS data to obtain for each

rating area the log population, and the fraction age 0-17, 18-64, male, college educated, white,

black, income below 124% of FPL, and income 125-400% of FPL. These variables are available

at the county level, not the rating area level, so we omit the 28 rating areas that are not exact


                                                                                                     46
aggregations of counties. The estimates are slightly larger with these controls. Finally in column

(6) we re-estimate, weighting each rating area by its population (as estimated in the ACS).

Weighting by population produces substantially larger estimates, with a coefficient of 0.35 in

2016 and 0.53 in 2017. We focus on the smaller, unweighted result to be conservative.

A.3 Robustness of participation estimates

       Appendix Table A4 shows the robustness of the participation estimates. Column (1)

reports the baseline estimates, for 2016 in Panel A and 2017 in Panel B. In columns (2)-(6) we

go through the same robustness tests as in the premium specifications, controlling nonlinearly for

the financial variables, adding richer insurer controls, controlling for reinsurance, or excluding

contributors. In none of the specifications do we find a significant association between RC

claiming and insurer participation. In the final column, we estimate a linear probability model,

and we continue not to find a significantly negative association (for 2016 we find a marginally

positive association). Thus the non-association between participation and RC claiming is robust

to alternative controls and specifications.

insurance controls, and reinsurance controls. In column (6) we use the base controls but exclude contributing
insurers. Columns (1)-(6) are estimated with logistic regression and the reported coefficient is an adjusted log odds
ratio. In column (7) we estimate a linear probability model. Robust standard errors in parentheses.
