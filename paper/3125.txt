       A MULTI -COUNTRY STUDY OF THE INFORMATION IN THE TERM STRUCTURE
                                  ABOUT FUTURE INFlATION


                                            ABSTRACT

      This paper provides evidence on what the term structure (for maturities of twelve months
or less) tells us about future inflation in ten OECD countries. The empirical results on the
information in the term structure contrast with those that find that the level of interest rates
help forecast the future level of inflation. Instead, they indicate that for the majority of the
countries in the sample, the term structure does not contain a great deal of information about the
future path of inflation. The results for France. the United Kingdom and Germany tell a
different story1 however. In these countries the term structure contains a highly significant
amount of information about future changes in inflation.
       The evidence in this paper suggests that central banks for most of the countries studied
here should exercise some caution in using the term structure of interest rates as a guide for
assessing inflationary pressures in the economy, as is currently under consideration by the U.S.
central bank. Although there is significant information in the term structure about the future
path of inflation for a few of the countries, this is not a result that is true in general.
       The empirical evidence does reveal, however, that for every country studied except the
United Kingdom, there is a great deal of information in the term structure of nominal interest
rates about the term structure of ical interest rates. This finding is an extremely useful one
because it suggests that for most countries researchers can examine observable data on the
nominal term structure to provide them with information about the behavior of the teal term
structure.

       In recent years, central banks of many countries have increasingly focused on the goal of

price stability. In pursuing this goal, central banks need information on the degree of inflationary

pressures in the economy, and one natural place to look for this information is the term structure

of interest rates. Research beginning with Fama (1975) often finds that the level of interest rates

helpsforecast future inflation,' while recent research has focused on the information in the term

structure aboutfuture interest rate movements.'These twolines of research suggest that the term

structu'e of interest rates might contain information about the future path of inflation.

       One reason why the information in the term structure about future inflation requires
careful study is that it bears directly on whether central banks should use the term structure as

a guide for monetary policy, as has recently been advocated by the Vice-Chairman of the Board

of Governors of the Federal Re..rve. A second reason is that empirical evidence on this topic

can tell us whether movements in the term structure of ical interest rates (which is not directly

observable) are revealed by movements in the term structure of nominal interest rates (which is

observable). The term structure of real interest rates has an important role in understanding
asset pricing and in theories of the business cycle and so is of much concern to theorists. Finding

out whether observable data on the nominal term structure provides information about the
behavior of the a1 term structure can thus help guide theoretical research.

      This paper examines empirically what the term structure of interest rates tells us about
future inflation in the United States and in nine other OECD countries using euro market data.




  'For example, Nelson and Schwert (1977), Mishkin (1981, 1984), Fama and Gibbons (1982),
and Huizinga and Mishkin (1986).

  2Forexample, Shiller, Campbell andSchoenholtz (1982) and Mankiwand Summers(1984) have
questioned the value of the term structure in predicting future short-term interest rates, while
recent evidence in Fama (1984), Fama and Bliss (1987), Campbell and Shiller (1987), Hardouvelis
(1988) and Mishkin (1988a) is more positive about the ability of the term structure to forecast
future interest rates.

 Earlier research, Mishkin (1988b), has examined the information in the term structure about

 future inflation in the U.S. using Treasury bill rate data. However, there are several reasons why

 a multi-country empirical analysis of the information in the term structure about future inflation

 is needed. Assessing future inflationary pressures in the economy is a concern of central banks

 in all the countries studied here. Thus learning about the ability of the term structure to forecast

 the future path of inflation in each of these countries is important knowledge for their central

 bankers to have because it will help them decide whether using the term structure as a guide for

monetary policy is a sensible strategy. It is also worth examining what the term structure tells us

about future inflation in other countries besides the U.S. because it will provide us with clues

about bow the information in the term structure might change with different monetary regimes.

Different countries do provide different conclusions on the relationship between inflation and

interest rates,' and so it is plausible that the information in the term structure might differ
substantially across countries. A final reason for examining data in other countries is that it will

provide further information on which results found for the United States are robust across
countries. This is also important because the information in the term structure in the U.S. may

be representative of only one type of monetary regime and a change in the regime may alter the

information in the term structure. Finding that certain results tend to be true for other countries,

should make U.S. policymakers more secure about conclusions derived from U.S. data.



                                   II. The Methodology


      The main focus of the paper is on estimates of a forecasting equation that tell us whether

the term structure helps to predict the future path of inflation. This equation, which will be
referred to as the 'inflation change equation, is a regression of the change in the future-period
inflation rate from the a-period inflation rate (i' -    on   the "slope' of the term structure (i'-



  'For example, see Mishkin (1984).

         Tests of the statistical significance of the fl. coefficient and whether it differs from 1.0

reveal how much information there is in the slope of the term structure about future changes in

inflation. More specifically, as isdescribed in Mishkin (1988bJ, a statistical rejection of ft, = 0

provides evidence that 1) the term structure contains significant information about the future

path of inflation, and 2) the slopes of the term structures of real and nominal interest rates do not

move one-for-one with each other. On the other hand, a statistical rejection of ft.. = 1 provides

evidence that 1) the slope of the real term structure is not constant over time, and 2) the term

structure of nominal interest rates provides information about the termstructure of real interest

rates.

         Note that the phrase 'information in the term structure is being used in this paper quite

narrowly. Information in the term structure about the path of future inflation refers only to the

ability of the slope. 17 . to predict the change in the inflation rate, ir7 -w. This paper focuses
                          17




on the predictive power of the slope term, i7 -          17.   because it is the most natural piece of
information in the term structure to examine. Tests of the statistical significance of the ft,..
coefficient and whether it differs from one reveal how much information there is in the slope of

the term structure about future changes in inflation.

         Before going on to a discussion of the data nod the empirical results, several additional

econometric issues that have important consequencesfor hypothesis testing need to be discussed.

One important econometric consideration is that the error term i7 exhibits serial correlation

which renders OLS standard errors invalid. One source of the serial correlation arises from the

use here of overlapping data in which> 1--i.e., the number of periodsfor the interest rate and

the inflation rate are greater than the observation interval. As is well known, this leads to
                                                 4

 correlation of the error term with up to rn-I of its lagged values. Furthermore, as is explained in

 Mishkin (1988b). additional serial correlation in , can stem from serial correlation of real

 interest rates. Examination of the residual autocorrelations revealed that ,7' often has
 significant correlation with its values lagged more than rn-I periods, especially for countries

other than the United States. Valid standard errors are generated using the method outlined by
 Hansen and Hodrick (1980),with a modification due to Hansen (1982) that allows for conditional

beteroscedasticity' and a modification by Newey and West (1987) that insures the variance-

covariance matrix is positive definite by imposing linearly declining weights on autocovariance

matrices. The standard errors reported in the tables are constructed allowing f or non-zero

autocorrelations going back three years (36 periods) which is enough to capture the serial
correlation revealed in the data.'              -

       Additional information is available in the term structure that is not being used in ordinary

least squares estimation because contemporaneous errors in forecasting inflation for different

horizons may be highly correlated. Therefore, seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) estimates

of a system of equations with different horizons may produce substantial gains in efficiency.' The




   'The Hansen (1982) modification is the same numerically as that proposed by White (1980).
White's results are obtained with unconditional heteroscedasticity rather than conditional
heteroscedasticity, but additional assumptions are required.

   'I also estimated the standard errors for each equation allowing only for non-zero autocor-
relations going back rn-i periods and the results were not appreciably affected.

    'There are two ways to think about the inflation change forecasting equation and hence about
 the consistency of SUR estimated coefficients, If the forecasting equation is just viewed as a
 projection equation in which the error term is by construction orthogonal to the 17 - i regressor.
 then consistency of the SUR estimates requires an additional assumption that the C -i in each
equation is uncorrelatedwith all the error terms. As described in Mishkin (i988b), an alternative
way of viewing the inflation change equation is as a test for $, = 1. With this interpretation,
 the same conditions that produce consistency for OLS estimates of fi.,. = 1 -- the constancy of
the real rate differentials, rr7 - rr -- also produce consistency of the SUR estimates. Constancy
of the real rate differentials implies that the error terms just equal the difference between the
forecast errors of inflation at the and g horizon. Since under rational expectations these
forecast errors are uncorrelated with all information available at time t, which includes 17for all
m, constancy of the real rate differentials implies the condition for consistency of the SUR
estimates, that all of the explanatory variables in the equations are orthogonal to all the error
terms.
                                                    5

SUR standard error estimateswill again be incorrect because of the serial correlation of the error

terms. The Hansen-Hodrick, Newey-West estimate of the variance-covariance matrix allowing

for conditional heteroscedasticity can be generalized to a pply to a seemingly unrelated regression

system of g equations as follows. The SIJR estimation method assumes that the variance.
covariance matrix of the residuals is D2'IT where,



            E          = variance-covariance
                                             matrix of the contemporaneous residuals from the g

                         equations,
                    = TxT identity matrix, where T is the number of observations.




Using the Choleski decomposition S' = P'P, we get the GLS (i.e., the SUR) estimates by

premultiplying the system by POIT and then proceed with OLS estimation. AUowing for
conditionaiheteroscedasticity, theHansen-Hodrick variance-covariance matrixof the parameter
estimates of the transformed system is then,

where,

            q = the order of the MA process for the error terms in the system.




  'Note that the presence of 7717' in the formula for the variance-covariance matrix in (4) takes
account of serial correlation of the error terms both within an equation and across
                                                                                    equations as
well asfor conditional heteroscedasticityin these covariances. Thus even though StiR estimation
only takes account of contemporaneouscorrelation of error termsacross equations. thevariance-
covariance matrix above is corrected for serial correlation both within and across equations as
well as for conditional heteroscedasticity.

        Now that we have completed our discussion of the econometric details, we can go on to
 discuss the data used in the empirical analysis.



                                         III. The Data


        The empirical analysis makes use of monthly data on inflation rates and one, three, six, and

 twelve-month interest rates in the euro deposit market for the following ten OECD countries:

 United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands,

 Switzerland and Japan. For every country except Japan, the sample period extends from the
 beginning of the floating rate period, April 1973, to December 1986.' However, the data for

 Japan is unavailable until October 1975, so the sample period for Japan starts in October 1975.

 The inflation datafor these countries are seasonally unadjusted CPI measures obtained from the

 International Financial StatistAs (IFS) tape maintained by the International Monetary Fund with
 the exception of the U.S. data. Because of the well known problems with the treatment ofhousing

costs in the U.S. CPI before 1983, the U.S. inflation data is calculated from a CPI series which

appropriately treats housing costs on a rental-equivalence basis throughout the sample period.
For more details on this series see Huizinga and Mishkin (1984, 1986). The euromarket data

have been obtained from the Harris Bank tape maintained at the NYU Business School and are

used in this study for several reasons.' High quality data for domestic interest rates are notas

readily available for other countries besides the United States and Canada. In some of the other

countries, domestic Treasury bill rates are not always market clearing, so that these data,
although sometimes nvailable, do not reflect the true cost of credit. Euro rates, however, are



   'Note that with a sample period ending in December 1986, inflation data for the year 1987 is
required.

   'In the few cases where euro rate data were missing, the euro rate was calculated from the
interest parity condition. The rest of the data were checked by verifying that there were no large
deviations from interest parity. Several obvious errors in the tape were found in this manner and
were corrected.
                                                  8

market clearing. In addition, euro deposits denominated in different currencies are issued by
banks that have similar default risks,'0 and they are not subject to capital controls because they

are offshore securities. This makes the term structures of different countries comparable because

they will not have to be adjusted for differing default risks or non-comparability because of
capital controls. Both the interest rates and inflation data are expressed on a continuously
compounded basis at an annual rate in percent.

       The timing of the variables is as follows. A January interest rate observation uses the euro

rate data for the last Friday of December. A January observation for a one-month inflation rate

is calculated from the December and January CPl data; a three-month inflation rate from the

December and March CPl data; and so on.



                                IV. The Empirical Results


       Table! contains the estimates of the inflation-changeforecasting equations which regress

the change in the future rn-period inflation rate from the i-period inflation rate (ir7 -ir) on the

 slope of the term structure (i -i). In contrast to previous research which has found that the

level of interest rates contains a great deal of information about the level of future inflation, there

is less evidence in Table 1 that the slope of the term structure provides information about the

future path of inflation. Thefl_.coefficieutsare statistically significant only one-third of the time

and are not always positive (almost one-quarter of them are negative).

       The United States displays negative as well as positive fl,, coefficients for horizons less
than twelve months and onlyfor m = 12 are thefl_,, coefficients statistically significant. The US.

results thus suggest that the shortest end of the term structure (maturities of six months or less)




   trhe euro deposit rates are collected from quotes by the Harris Bank in the case of euro
dollars and by other banks that specialize in issuing euro deposits in other currencies. The fact
that interest parity holds fairly tightly in the data here indicates that the risk premiums are very
simtlar for the different banks quoting the euro deposit rates.

 provides no information aboutfuture inflation, while around maturities of twelve months, there

 is some information in the term structure about future changes in inflation. These results are

 consistent with those found with U.S. Treasury bill data in Mishkin (19S1b). although Treasury

 bill data indicates stronger forecasting ability for Lhe spread between twelve-month and six-

 month rates than do euro rate data.

       The somewhat stronger ability of Treasury bill rates to forecast future changes in inflation

suggests that the euro rate results in Table I may even understate somewhat the information in

the term structure of domestic interest rates for the future path of inflation." As is pointed out

in Mishkin (1984). euro rates bear a substantial risk premium over Treasury bill rates because,

in contrast to Treasury securities, which are riskiess in nominal terms, euro deposits are subject

to default risk since their issuing bank might (au. indeed, this default risk premium is very

variable and has at times exceeded five percentage points. Fluctuations in this risk premium in

the euro rates are likely to obscure some of the ability of the term structure of euro rates to

forecast the future path of inflation, and this is exactly what we find for U.S. data.

       The United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Japan also display information about

the future path of inflation in the term structure, with the evidence for significant forecasting

ability of the term structure strongest f or France and the United Kingdom. For France and the

United Kingdom, all the$., coefficients are positive, and at least half are statistically significant

at the 1% level.

      Examination of the results on (1 - $_j in Table 1 indicate that the nominal term structure

contains substantial information about the term structure of real interest rates in most countries

is quite strong. With the exception of the United Kingdom and Japan, the (1. fl_J estimates are

always positive, are statistically significant 90% of the time and are significant at the 1% level

80% of the time. For Japan, the evidence is somewhat mixed with two of the (1 -$..,I estimates




  "This might be less true if there are significant capital and exchange controls in the economy
which result in greater time-variability of the risk premiums in domestic interest rates.
                                                    10

 positive and statistically significant, while three of the estimates are negative but statistically
 insignificant. The term structure for the United Kingdom, on the other hand, reveals absolutely

 no information about the term structure of real interest rates. All the (1 - $,J estimates are
 statistically insignificant with t-statistics less than one in absolute value.

        As was discussed in the methodology section, if equation residuals across different time

 horizons are correlated, more efficient estimates can be obtained by exploiting this information

with seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) estimation. Table 2. which contains the SUR
 estimates of the same inflation change equationsfound in Table 1, indicates that SUR estimation

often leads to large increases in efficiency -. coefficient standard errors often decline by more

 than 50% and in one case declines by 80%

       The increased efficiency of the SUR estimates tends to strengthen the conclusions reached

before. All the fl.. coefficients for France and the United Kingdom are now statistically
significant, whilefive out of six are significant I or Germany. Thus the SUIt results provide even

stronger evidence that the term structure in these countries contains substantial information
about the future path of inflation.

       The SUIt estimates of the (1 - $_.] coefficients continue to provide strong evidence that

the nominal term structure contains substantial information about the term structure of real
interest rates for most countries. With the exception of the United Kingdom and Japan, almost

all of the (1 .   fl.j estimates are significantly positive at the 1% level. For Japan, all of the (1
fi_j estimates are positive and half are statistically signiicant at the 5% level. The evidence for

these nine countries is thus quite strong that the term structure of nominal rates reveal a great
deal of information about the term structure of real rates. The results for the United Kingdom

continue to tell a different story. Despite much greater precision in the coefficient estimates




   1tNote, however, that in several cases, the estimated standard errors are higher in Table 2 than
they are in Table 1. Even though the SUR estimates are asymptotically more efficient than OLS
estimates, in small samples estimated SUIt standard errors can turn out to be larger than OLS
standard errors.

 - the standard errors of half the coefficients decline by over 50% as a result of using SUR estima-

 tion -- none of the fi - fi_.j coefficients is statistically significant; indeed, none even has a t-

statistic exceeding one. The evidence is thus even stronger that the U.K. differs from other

countries in an important respect: its term structure of nominal interest rates contains no

information about its term structure of real interest rates.



A. Interpretation

         Under the assumption of rational expectations, the interpretation of the inflation-change,

forecasting equation flu. is quite straightforward. Following Fama (1984) and Hardouvelis
(1988),fi,, can be derived to be:




              ,=
                                     a+
(5)                                  —
                                 +       a + 2pc

where,

             a        = of EØr'7 - iC)I/o(rr . rr = the ratio of the standard deviation of the

                         expected inflation change to the standard deviation of the slope of the real

                         term structure,

             p        = the correlation between the expected inflation change, E,('r . ir), and the

                         slope of the real term structure, rr? -



This expression is derived by writing down the standard formula for the projection equation

coefficient fl_p, and recognizing that the covariance of the inflation forecast error with nT rr

equals zero given rational expectations.




  "Note that a and p are constructed from unconditional variances and covnrinnces.
                                                       12

        The equation above indicates thatfl_ is determined by bow variable the expected inflation

 change is relative to the variability of the slope of the real term structure {represented by a , the

 ratio of the standard deviations of E,fr7 - 'C) and (rr7 - rr)J. as well as by the correlation of the

 expcctedinflation.change with.the real term structure slope (p). Differences in the correlation

and relative variation of expected inflation and the real term structure slope in the Len countries,

 possibly the result of different monetary regimes, will thus produce different /3,,, and hence

different conclusions about the information in ihe term structure about the future path of

 inflation. Figure 1 shows how /3,,. varies with a and p.

        In order to understand why the /3,,,. differ across countries, we calculate estimated values

of; and p using the procedure outlined in Mishkin (1981), in which estimates of the real term

structure spreads, rr - rr, are obtained from fitted values of regressions of the ex-post real rate

differentials on past inflation changes and past interest rate spreads." Then the estimated

expected inflation change is calculated from the following definitional relationship,



(6)          E,(x - 'C) = 17 - i7 - (rr     -
                                                rr7)



Finally estimates of; and p are calculated from the estimated E,(W7 - 'C) and (rr7 - rC).

       With the exception of France, the estimated values of p for the other countries in Table I

were quite negative, averaging around -0.8 and typically ranging from -l).5 to -0.95 These values

of p follow from the fact that with the exception of France, the variability of the slope of the

nominal term structure, 17 - i, is very small relative to the variability of the slope of the real term

structure, rr - rC, and thus, as is evident in equation (6) above, the correlation between E,(r7 -

 'C) and r17 - rr must necessarily be quite negative. As can be seen in Figure 1, with estimates of




   "The estimates described in the text were generated from OLS regressions in which the ex-
post real rate differential, eprr7 - eprr, was regressed on 17 - i, this differential lagged twelve
months, fifteen months and twenty-four months, and on the inflation change (w - 'r') lagged
twelve months and twenty-four months. I also experimented with other choices of lags and the
estimated values of a and p were robust to different specifications of the regression equations.

p around -0.8, if the variability of expectedinflation changes is sufficiently less than the
variability of the real term structure slope so that a is less than 0.8, then $, will not be above

zero.

        Low estimated values of a which are less than 0.8 are exactly what we find for all the

horizons in countries such as Canada, Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland. These low values

of a and very negative values of p thus explain why we do Dot find significant positive m,

coefficients for these countries.

        Research that suggests that term premiums undergo substantial fluctuations over time'

provide a rationale for the low values of a and the resulting inability of the term structure to

provide information about the future path of inflation. Variation in the slope of the real term

structure can be attributed to the variation of teim premiums over time as well as changes in the

average of expected one-period real interest rates over the next rn-periods versus the next a-

periods. High variation in these term premiums will then produce high variation in the slope of

the real term structure and make it more likely that the variation of the real term structure slope

will dominate the variation of expectedfuture inflation changes. The outcome of substantial time

variation of term premiums will then be a low a and a lowfl estimate, so that the term structure

will provide little information aboutfuture inflation changes. The flip side of this argument is
that substantial variation in term premiums, which produceslow _,estimates, lead to the finding

that the term structure of nominal interest rates contains a great deal of information about the
term structure of real interest rates.'




   "Jones and Roley (1983), Mankiw and Summers (1984), Shiller, Campbell and Schoenholtz
(1983), and Startz (1982).

   "The same reasoning in this paragraph provides a more rigorous explanation of why results
using eurorates indicate that there is less information in the term structure about the path of
future inflation than when T-bill data is used as in Miskkin (1988b). As explained in the text,
eurodollar rates embody a default risk premium not found in T-bill rates. The additional risk
premium in euro rates can thus lead to greater variation in the real term structure slope which
leads to smaller a and hence lowerfl,, estimates.

        In the case of Germany, the variability of expected future inflation changes is closeto the

 variability of the real term structure slopes and this explains why the estimated _, coefficients

 are positive and close to 0.5. In the case of the United States and Italy, for the short horizons in
 which mis less than twelve months, a is quite low; but as the rn-horizon lengthens the variability

 of the real term structure slope declines relative to the variability of the expected inflation
 changes so that a rises above 0.9. The result is that the fi_, coefficients get larger at Longer

 maturities, and this is why results for both Italy and the U.S. suggest that there is significant

information in the longer maturity term structure about future inflation changes.

       In Tables and 2 the results for the United Kingdom stand out because it has the highest
values of     and is the only country for which we cannot reject the null hypothesis that fl., = 1.

These findings are readily explained by the fact that the U.K. consistently has the highest
variability of expectedfnture inflation changes relative to the variability of the real term structure

slopes. The estimated a 's which range from LU to 1.1 interact with p's which are around -0.9 to

produce ,, coefficients close to 1.0.
       The estimated values of p for France are quite different than for the other countries. In

contrast to all the other countries studied here, France has greater variation in the slope of the

nominal term structure than in the slope of the real term structure. The result is estimates of p

that are generally around zero. Thus, even though the variability of expected future inflation

changes for France are less than the variability of real term structure slopes, so that a 's are less

than 0.85, Figure 1 shows us that the fl., will be positive but less than 0.5, which is exactly what

we find in Tables 1 and 2. The fact that France displays large variation in the nominal term

structure slope (the explanatory variable) explains the statistical significance for the French fl,,.

estimates because in the regressions itleads tohigh variability of theexplanatory variable relative
to the variability of the dependent variable."




  "This fact also explains why the French regressions have the highest R"s because R1 equals 9
times the ratio of the variance of the explanatory variable to the variance of the dependent
variable.

                                        V. Conclusions


      This paper provides evidence on what the term structure (for maturities of twelve months

or less) tells us about future inflation in ten OECD countries. The empirical results on the

information in the term structure contrast with those in previous research which find that the

level of interest rates helpforecast the future level of inflation. instead they indicate that for the

majority of the countries in the sample, the term structure does not contain a great deal of

information about the future path of inflation. The resultsfor France, the United Kingdom and

Germany tell a different story, however. In these countries the term structure contains a highly

significant amount of information about future changes in inflation.

      The analysis in this paper suggests that central banksfor most of the countries studied here

should exercise some caution in using the term structure of interest rates as a guide for assessing

inflationary pressures in the economy, as is currently under consideration by the U.S. central

bank. There are two reasonsfor this conclusion. First, the empirical evidence here indicates that

although there is significant information in the term structure about the future path of inflation

for a few of the countries, this is not a result that is true in general.

      Second, as the interpretation of the results indicates, the fl-regression coefficients are

sensitive to the relative variability of expected future inflation changes and real term structure

slopes, as well as to the correlation of these two variables. Any change in the method of

conducting monetary policy, such asfocusing on the term structure as a guide to monetary policy,

is likely to change the correlation and relative variability of expectedfuture inflation changes and

real term structure slopes, thus causing the regression coefficients to change in the inflation-

change forecasting equation. Thus the forecasting ability of the term structure for the path of

future inflation could change dramatically, making the term structure a poor guide for monetary

policy. This is, of course, just another example of the Lucas (1976) critique.

       The empirical evidence does reveal, however, that for every country studied except the

United Kingdom, there is a great deal of information in the term structure of nominal interest

rates about the term structure of ml interest rates. This finding is an extremely useful one
because it suggests that for most countries researchers can examine observable data on the

nominal term structure to provide them with information about the behavior of the       term
structure.
