                         EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL
                        PRICE POLICY ON YOUTH

                                  ABSTRACT



         In this paper we summarize research that deals with the effects of
alcoholic beverage prices and excise taxes on a variety of outcomes for youth.
These include alcohol consumption, excessive consumption, motor vehicle
accident mortality, and college completion rates. The research employs six
nationally representative data sets on individuals that span the period from 1974
through 1989 and two state level data sets for the years 1975-1981 and 1982-
1988. The studies fmd that alcohol use and motor vehicle accident mortality
are negatively related to the cost of alcohol. College completion rates are
positively related to this variable. Clearly, these are policy-relevant findings
since price is a policy-manipulable variable.     Frequently, the effects of a
variety of simulated excise tax hikes exceed those of the uniform minimum
legal drinking age of 21 in all states.
