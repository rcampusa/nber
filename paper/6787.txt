     I. Comparative Advantage and Economic Geography Matter for Trade

       In the last two decades, an increasing returns “revolution” has transformed the field of

international trade [Krugman (1990)]. The monopolistic competition models of Dixit and Stiglitz

(1977), Krugman (1979), and Lancaster (1980) provided the foundation. The theory has earned

enormous influence because of its promise to provide a unified account of a broad range of

phenomena — intra-industry trade, the volume of North-North trade, the success of the gravity

model of trade, the theory of multinationals, etc.

       What has been singularly absent is a compelling empirical test that would launch the

increasing returns trade hypothesis over the threshold from appealing theory to established fact.

Of course, the increasing returns framework has inspired a great deal of empirical work. Yet the

results have been, at best, inconclusive. One reason is that even the most interesting contributions

fail to identify empirical features of trade patterns that would distinguish the models, so allow for

hypothesis testing. Underlying this is the problem that the characteristic trade patterns often

associated with the zero-trade-cost increasing returns models are a simple consequence of

specialization. Yet all of the theories in contest — increasing returns or comparative advantage —

can account for such specialization and so the consequent trade patterns [Chipman (1992), Davis

(1995, 1997), Deardorff (1998), Harrigan (1994)].

       All is not hopeless. Inspired by Linder (1961), Krugman (1980) identifies a critical

observation that distinguishes comparative advantage from increasing returns, provided that we

restrict the latter to the class of models with trade costs that have come to be known as




                                                     1
“economic geography.”1 The test he proposes derives from a simple question: Can unusually

strong demand for a good in a country lead that country to export the good? In a comparative

advantage world, the answer is no; in an economic geography world the answer is yes. The

phenomenon of unusually strong demand leading a good to be exported in a world of economic

geography is known as the “home market effect.”2

       This distills the clash between the two paradigms to the existence or absence of these

home market effects, and so provides a sound conceptual basis for hypothesis tests. Moreover

such a relation is quite unexpected within the framework of comparative advantage. Thus the

existence of such home market effects would serve as prima facie evidence of the importance of

economic geography and, by implication, increasing returns.

       Davis and Weinstein (1996) implement Krugman’s (1980) test on OECD data. The data

strongly reject this model of economic geography in favor of a model of comparative advantage

with costs of trade. Few industries conform to the economic geography model’s predictions, and

where these effects are evident their economic significance is scant.

       This rejection of the simple Krugman (1980) model leads us to inquire whether a richer

model of economic geography might yet reveal the characteristic home market effects. Krugman



       1
          Krugman (1991) acknowledges the great difficulty in finding compelling evidence in
favor of the new trade theories in their zero-trade-cost form. In fact, he argues that the main
reason for considering models of economic geography is the “laboratory” they provide for
distinguishing increasing returns and imperfect competition from the competitive constant returns
theories. We agree.

       2
        Alternative links between demand structure and exports have been hypothesized in a
dynamic setting, as e.g. Bhagwati’s (1982) “Biological” model of trade. We do not pursue these
dynamic links in the present paper.

                                                 2
(1991, p. x) assails the traditional economic geographers for their fascination with “a very narrow

set of geometric tricks . . . .” In practice, this means that they investigated complex geographic

relationships while treating the economics loosely, in particular ignoring issues of market structure

[Krugman (1995)]. The decisive breakthrough in the new wave of theoretical work on economic

geography is to reverse the emphasis — enriching the economic framework while greatly

simplifying the geography in the models.

       The decision to simplify the geography in the new theoretical models is strategic — to

develop basic analytic insights on the role of market structure before returning to the intricate

issues of a richer geography. Recent work considers a richer geography, notably in Krugman and

Venables’(1995) elegant model of trade in a “seamless world.” This marks a break from the

treatment of countries as dimensionless points, rather thinking of them as fuzzy-edged

agglomerations on a continuous surface. In important respects, the emphasis on the seamlessness

of economic activity harks back to a traditional concern of economic geographers: the concept of

“market access.” The essential link is that economic distance is continuous rather than discrete.

       This suggests the possibility that the empirical failure of the Krugman (1980) model on

OECD data may well owe to its overly-simple model of geography. In turn, this suggests two

research strategies. The first is to re-examine the problem while restricting the sample to

countries or regions for which differential market access as a result of geography is likely to be

relatively unimportant. Since it is plausible that differential market access is less pronounced for

regions of a single country than for countries flung across the globe (as in our OECD sample) ,

we pursue this strategy in a companion paper that examines the problem for forty regions of Japan

[Davis and Weinstein (1998)].


                                                  3
        In the present paper we choose to address the issue of a richer geography directly on

international data. We caution the reader that no single analytic model contemplates even the

minimal range of issues that the empirical researcher must confront. Hence, whereas our prior

implementation of Krugman (1980) hews quite close to the analytic model, here we must take a

larger step away from the formal framework.

        For comparability, we implement this approach with the same OECD data used in Davis

and Weinstein (1996). In that paper, the key parameter is the effect of idiosyncratic demand on

production. A coefficient estimate above unity would indicate home market effects. That paper

treats the relevant idiosyncratic demand as that of the nation state. The departure in the present

paper is to pursue a two-step procedure. We estimate a gravity model to derive industry-specific

parameters on the dissipation of demand across space. These economic distance parameters are

then used to calculate the idiosyncratic demand, taking into account the derived demand from

geographic neighbors, which then enters into tests for the home market effect as in our prior

work.

        The results we report here provide important evidence of the existence of home market

effects. In turn, this suggests that increasing returns matter for the structure of international

production and trade. The measured effects are significant in economic as well as statistical terms.

Indeed, these results correlate closely with those we report in a companion study of Japanese

regions [Davis and Weinstein (1998)].

        Our results show that a model that draws on Helpman (1981) and Krugman (1980)

provides a good depiction of OECD manufacturing. Comparative advantage does matter, both at

the broad and fine industrial levels. The novel finding in the present study and its companion study


                                                   4
is that whether one is considering the structure of production and trade across regions of a single

country, or countries of the world, increasing returns and economic geography play a vital role.



                           II. Prior Empirics of IRS and Trade

       The empirical trade literature features numerous papers attempting to examine or test

increasing returns theories. Grubel and Lloyd's (1975) book demonstrating the quantitative

importance of intra-industry trade marks the beginning of intense theoretical and empirical interest

in this phenomenon. Following Grubel and Lloyd's path-breaking study, empirical researchers

began investigating the importance of increasing returns both through calibration exercises [cf.

Dixit (1988) and Baldwin and Krugman (1988)] and econometric investigations.

       Within the latter genre, a number of papers stand out. Helpman's (1987) paper was among

the first to derive testable implications of the theory and examine them on international data. The

Helpman paper marks an important first step in establishing that certain observables, including

gravity-type relationships, are consistent with the theory. Although Hummels and Levinsohn

(1995) demonstrated that this consistency criterion might not be as strong as one might have

hoped, the paper nonetheless is a milestone in deriving testable implications from the theory.

       Later researchers sought to investigate other implications of the theory. Many of these

studies are in line with the “estimate, don't test” injunction of Leamer and Levinsohn (1995).

Among the most informative in this area are Harrigan's (1994) study of how the volume of trade

varies with industry characteristics and Kim's (1995) study of the shifts in the geographic

concentration of US manufacturing. As Harrigan notes, the “regression tests are purely

descriptive,” more concerned with uncovering important partial correlations than conducting

                                                 5
specific hypothesis tests. Although Kim did estimate a specification that was designed to capture

both scale effects and endowment effects, he too was quite cautious in the interpretation of the

results, noting that “the Heckscher-Ohlin model is not given a completely fair representation [in

this paper].” In an interesting recent effort, Hanson (1998) uses US regional wage data to

estimate structural parameters of a Krugman model. Hanson finds that the estimated parameters

have the right sign and tend to have magnitudes consistent with the economic geography model.

       Very few papers, however, have attempted to nest an increasing returns model in a

comparative advantage framework.3 One interesting effort in this regard is that of Antweiler and

Trefler (1997). The paper nests increasing returns and comparative advantage into a common

framework, estimating the degree of industry economies of scale. Antweiler and Trefler

acknowledge a difficulty in distinguishing increasing returns from Ricardian technical differences,

but argue that increasing returns is likely to be an important part of a full account.

       The present paper explores a distinct approach to testing comparative advantage and

increasing returns. A critical feature of the economic geography framework is the interaction of

trade costs with increasing returns [cf. Fujita, Krugman and Venables (1997)]. Moreover the

recent empirical literature has emphasized that the costs of trading across borders are far from


       3
            The need for serious empirical work to articulate the relative importance of the various
theories has been repeatedly emphasized by some of the principal developers of the new trade
theory. For example, Grossman (1992, pp. 6, 13) writes that “To date, empirical work in this area
is still in its infancy . . . . The next step surely must be a careful testing of the new theories.
Empirical work has lagged in this area to the point where skeptics question whether the approach
has testable implications.” Similarly, Krugman (1994, pp. 9, 26-27) refers to the new trade theory
as “an enormous theoretical enterprise with very little empirical confirmation,” emphasizing that “
. . . there has not been any dramatic empirical confirmation of the models . . . .” In his survey of
the empirical evidence regarding new trade theory, Krugman fails to cite a single econometric
study in support of the increasing returns hypothesis. We hope that the present paper, in concert
with other recent efforts, will begin to fill this gap.

                                                  6
trivial, underscoring the importance of considering this analytic feature in structuring empirical

work [cf. Engel and Rogers (1996), Helliwell (1996), and McCallum (1995)]. In contrast to

Antweiler and Trefler, we make the sharp differences in the empirical predictions of the increasing

returns and comparative advantage models in the presence of trade costs the centerpiece of our

empirical analysis. Our work, however, differs importantly from that of Davis and Weinstein

(1996) in that we no longer limit ourselves to considering demand deviations arising from purely

national sources, but widen our concept of geography to allow for cross-country effects as well.

        We draw several lessons from this brief survey. Each of these papers provides a structured

way of thinking about the data, and so an interesting window on the determinants of production

and trade structure. Incrementally they help to narrow the range of alternatives that may

reasonably be contemplated. However all of the studies confront a difficult problem, viz. the

limited data available for testing. One consequence is that it is impracticable to nest all potentially

relevant hypotheses for a single critical test — one cannot hope to answer overly subtle questions.

This in turn underscores the importance of the selection of hypotheses that will be considered.

Subject to this, it likewise emphasizes the importance of working with an analytic structure that

truly distinguishes the hypotheses in contest.




                  III. Theoretical Framework for Hypothesis Testing

                                    A. The Home Market Effect

                                                   7
       The broad outlines of our theoretical framework follow Davis and Weinstein (1996). The

objective is to distinguish a world in which trade arises due to increasing returns as opposed to

comparative advantage. This is very difficult if we focus on the class of zero transport cost

increasing returns models deriving from Krugman (1979) and Lancaster (1979). However this is

possible if we focus instead on the class of trade models that have come to be known as

“economic geography,” which interact increasing returns and trade costs in general equilibrium.

       The crucial insight is from Krugman (1980, p. 955):

       In a world characterized both by increasing returns and by transportation costs,
       there will obviously be an incentive to concentrate production of a good near its
       largest market, even if there is some demand for the good elsewhere. The reason is
       simply that by concentrating production in one place, one can realize the scale
       economies, while by locating near the larger market, one minimizes transport
       costs. This point . . . is the basis for the common argument that countries will tend
       to export those kinds of products for which they have relatively large domestic
       demand. Notice that this argument is wholly dependent on increasing returns; in a
       world of diminishing returns, strong domestic demand for a good will tend to
       make it an import rather than an export. [italics added]

       We begin by sketching the model of Krugman (1980). A more detailed discussion of the

analytics is in Davis and Weinstein (1996). The model is one of monopolistic competition. There

are two classes of goods, each with many varieties. All varieties are symmetric in production and

demand. Each variety is produced under increasing returns to scale with a fixed cost and constant

marginal costs in units of labor. Preferences are the iso-elastic Dixit-Stiglitz form. The novelty in

Krugman’s (1980) paper is the introduction to this framework of costs of trade in an iceberg form

(for one unit of a good to arrive, J > 1 units must be shipped). He further assumes that there are

two countries which are mirror images of each other. They have the same labor forces. The

difference lies in their demand structure. For simplicity, he assumes that consumers come in two



                                                  8
types, each specialized to consume all varieties of only one of the two classes of goods. In

addition, he assumes that the sole difference between the countries is that one country is

predominantly populated by those who consume varieties of one of the classes of goods, and vice

versa (in perfect mirror fashion) for the other. The symmetry insures factor price equalization in

spite of the trade costs.

        An important feature of the model is that the combination of constant mark-ups and free

entry implies that in equilibrium output per firm is the same across markets in spite of the trade

costs. This means that a full description of the equilibrium can be given by the number of varieties

of each of the two types produced in each country. Let µ be the number of varieties of good g

produced at Home relative to those produced abroad. Let F < 1 be the ratio of demand for a typical

import relative to a domestically produced variety in the same class. Let 8 represent the ratio of

demanders for good g at Home relative to the number in Foreign. Krugman shows that in the range

of incomplete specialization, the relative production levels µ can be described as:

                                                    8 &F
                                             µ '
                                                   1 &8 F

When 8 = 1, demand patterns are identical and the countries produce the same number of varieties

in each industry, leaving a zero net balance. This will play an important role when we turn to our

empirical implementation as it suggests that predictions of production structure, ceteris paribus,

should be centered around an even distribution of the industries across the countries. Idiosyncratic

demand components will then explain deviations from this neutral production structure.

        Moreover, we need to consider closely the way in which idiosyncratic demand components

will translate into alterations in production structure. From above, and for the range of incomplete

specialization for which these relations are valid,

                                                      9
                                        ∂µ   1− σ 2
                                           =           >1
                                        ∂λ (1 − σλ ) 2

Krugman emphasized that this will imply that countries with a large “home market” for a good will

be net exporters of that good. For our purposes it is convenient to focus on an equivalent statement

of this result that speaks directly to the implications for production. That is, idiosyncratic demand

patterns (indexed by 8) have a magnified impact on production patterns. This will play a crucial

role in our empirical implementation, helping to separate the influences of economic geography

from that of comparative advantage.

       Why does the home market effect arise? In the presence of trade costs, producers will

have an incentive to locate near the larger source of demand. This is counterbalanced by the fact

that as more and more producers leave the smaller market, those who remain experience the trade

costs not only as an inhibition on their deliveries to the larger market, but also as protection

against the many producers who have located in that larger market. Ex ante it may not seem

obvious which of these influences will dominate. However, it is possible to show that if the share

of varieties produced moved exactly one-for-one with the idiosyncratic demand that those

producers located in the large country would have higher demand for their products than those

located in the smaller market for that good. Since equilibrium requires that the derived demand be

the same for all producers, this implies residual incentives for producers to move to the large

market — hence the home market effect.

       It is likewise important to think about why the home market effect does not arise in the

conventional constant returns to scale comparative advantage framework. The logic turns out to

be very simple. Consider a positive shock to the home demand structure for a good. Will this call



                                                  10
forth additional local supply, and if so will supply move more than one-for-one (as required for

the home market effect)? If the production set is strictly convex, additional supply of the good

will be forthcoming only if its relative price rises. But then, provided the foreign export supply

curve has the conventional positive slope, this will also call forth additional net exports from

abroad. In such a case, the idiosyncratic demand will be partly met by additional local supply and

partly by higher imports. Local supply, then, moves less than one-for-one with the idiosyncratic

demand. In this conventional comparative advantage world, there is no home market effect.

       Of course, Krugman (1980) cannot be taken straight to data. Such models of economic

geography contemplate highly abstract worlds in order to provide clear theoretical insights. Even

in such stark models, the inherent complexity of the problems frequently defies analytic solution.

While the robustness of the home market effect has been explored along a variety of dimensions

[e.g. Weder (1995)], there is no single fully-solved model that has simultaneously incorporated

the myriad elements essential for empirical implementation. The approach of Davis and Weinstein

(1996, 1998) is to hew as closely as possible to the theory, and so provide a highly-structured

interpretation of the models. Where it is not possible to provide a full solution, we make what we

consider the most sensible match between theory and specification.




                           B. Economic Geography and Market Access

       Theory abstracts. The strategic choice for the theoretician is which dimensions to simplify

and which to amplify. One could argue that much of the traditional economic geography made


                                                 11
rather dramatic simplifications in the geographic structure analyzed. For example, the central

place theory of industrial location is built on a featureless plain of homogeneous agricultural

density. Losch suggests that this would give rise to hexagonal markets, and Christaller suggests

further that there emerges a hierarchy of central places with interlaced markets [see e.g. the

discussion in Krugman (1995)]. Yet — especially in light of what would follow — the emphasis

on the simplifications of the geography in the early work is misplaced. They examine complex

problems such as industrial location in a world of two dimensions and multiple agglomerations.

Indeed, one could argue to the contrary that the distinctive aspect of their models is precisely the

emphasis on important features of real geography

       Krugman (1991, p. 5; 1995), while applauding the vision of those who pursued the

problems of economic geography even as it was ignored by the mainstream of Anglo-American

economics, nonetheless is critical of the research strategy:

       “Much of the literature on industrial location . . . [has] been obsessed with
       geometry . . . while paying little or no attention to the problem of modeling
       markets. This is, to my mind, doing things in the wrong order, worrying about the
       details of a secondary problem before making progress on the main issue.”

       The decisive break in the new theoretical economic geography is to reverse this hierarchy

— to start with a complete, if simple, economic model, and to be much less ambitious in terms of

the real geography modeled. Thus, a large number of the contributions consider a world with only

two locations, themselves treated as points in space [e.g. Krugman (1980, 1990), Krugman and

Venables (1995)]. Having established a range of initial insights in these highly simplified

geographic structures, the new literature (both open and closed economy) reintroduces at least

some dimensions of geographical complexity. For example, Krugman (1993) considers the



                                                 12
problem of city size and location in a model where potential sites are at discrete and symmetric

points on a circle. More recent analytic work by Krugman and Venables (1995) considers a

continuum of sites again arrayed on a circle — what they term the “seamless world.” Fujita,

Krugman, and Venables (1997) promises to reintroduce other real features of geography (rivers,

etc.). Thus the stark simplifications of geography in the earliest models are now being amended,

but these still fall short of the richness of geography in the earlier models, let alone the world that

we live in.

        This is a wonderfully fruitful strategy for theory. But it poses a dilemma for those who aim

to implement the theory empirically. One would like to stay as close to the analytic models as

possible, so that we may place a structural interpretation on the estimated coefficients. However,

as we seek incrementally to incorporate greater geographic realism in the empirics, we are forced

further from a direct implementation of the analytic models. Thus it is inevitable that tests of the

theories are joint tests of the micro-structure of the models and the manner in which geography is

modeled.

        The geography implicit in Davis and Weinstein (1996, 1998) can be thought of as an effort

to stay close to the analytic model of Krugman (1980). Where Krugman has two countries with

fixed costs of trade between them, Davis and Weinstein have N countries, any pair of which have

the same costs of trade between them. In geometric terms, this can be thought of as a hub and

spoke system. All countries are located at the ends of the spokes, while trade between any pair

must pass through the hub. A heuristic comparison of the models appears in Figure 1.

        In the present paper, we take a step toward incorporating more “real world” geography

into the model. In doing so, we necessarily take a step away from existing analytic models. We


                                                  13
employ a gravity framework to allow the distinctive geographical positions of countries to affect

their degree of market access, especially insofar as this affects the relative incentives for siting

industry. This might be thought of as an asymmetric gravity-based model. A heuristic

representation appears in Figure 2. We describe the details of the implementation below.



               IV. Implementing the Search for Home Market Effects

                                           A. Methodology

        We begin with a sketch of the theoretical framework that Davis and Weinstein (1996)

develop in detail. The specification and data work consider three levels of product aggregation:

Varieties, Goods, and Industries. Varieties play an important theoretical role within the model of

economic geography. In the Dixit-Stiglitz (1977) formulation, they are the locus of increasing

returns in production, as well as the elements across which consumers have a preference for

variety. While they play an important theoretical role, we assume they exist at a greater level of

disaggregation than exists in our data. Goods, in our formulation, can be thought of in two ways.

Under the hypothesis of increasing returns, a good is a collection of a large number of varieties

produced under monopolistic competition. It is at the goods level that differences in the

composition of demand give rise to home market effects. By contrast, under the hypothesis of

comparative advantage, a good is a traditional homogeneous commodity. Industries, in both

frameworks, consist of a collection of goods produced using a common technology. In the

comparative advantage framework, we interpret these as simple Leontief input coefficients. In the

increasing returns framework, we assume that both fixed and marginal costs of all varieties of all




                                                   14
goods within an industry use inputs in a fixed proportion. In our data work, industries and goods

are typically 3- and 4-digit ISIC data respectively.

       The null hypothesis that we consider is that comparative advantage determines production

and trade. The particular model of comparative advantage that we implement is the so-called

“square” Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) model, i.e. with equal numbers of goods and factors [cf. Ethier

(1984)]. All countries share identical Leontief technologies of production, which are linearly

independent, so that the technology matrix is invertible. Let n be an index of industries, g of

goods, and c of countries. Let W stand for the whole world, and ROW stand for the rest of the

world (excluding country c). Let Xgnc and Xgn ROW be total output in good g of industry n for


country c and the rest of the world respectively. Let Vc be the vector of endowments of country c.

Let S be the inverse of the technology matrix, and Sgn be the row corresponding to the g’th good

in industry n. Then our Heckscher-Ohlin model of goods production is given by:

          nc    n
(1)     Xg ' Sg V c


       The alternative that we consider is what we term the Helpman-Krugman specification. It is

inspired by Helpman’s (1981) integration of Heckscher-Ohlin with a zero transport cost model of

monopolistic competition. But in place of the latter we substitute the Krugman (1980) model of

economic geography.

       Accordingly, we assume output structure is determined in two stages. We assume the

Heckscher-Ohlin model determines the broad industrial structure of a country. Let S̄n be the n’th


row of an inverse technology matrix for industry output, where the coefficients indicate average



                                                 15
inputs at the equilibrium scale per variety (which is constant within an industry). Let Gn be the

number of products in industry n. Then output in industry n in country c is given by:

              Gn
                    nc    n
(2)     X nc ' 3 Xg ' S̄ V c
              g'1




       While we assume endowments map perfectly to industry-level output, we also assume they

tell us nothing about the composition of production across the goods within an industry. Since all

varieties of all goods within an industry are assumed to use the same mix of factors, these may be

thought of as a composite factor — an analogue to the single factor “labor” of Krugman (1980).

Because of the Leontief technology assumption, resource constraints become industry-specific

within a country. A heuristic diagram, a counterpart to the Helpman (1981) model, appears as

Figure 3. Given endowments, we know the distribution of output between the X and Y industries.

But this does not yet tell us how output will be distributed across goods within each industry.

       We may think of the determination of the output of the various goods within an industry in

two stages. Absent idiosyncratic elements of demand, each country allocates its resources across

the goods within a particular industry in the same proportion as all other countries. This provides

the country with a base level of production for each good in an industry that we denote SHARE.

The second component arises when there are idiosyncratic elements of demand across the goods

— what we term IDIODEM. These gives rise to home market effects, here a more than one-for-

one movements of production in response to idiosyncratic demand.

       In order to make this precise, we must distinguish between a country’s demand for a good

                                                  nc
produced in many locations, which we denote Dg , from the derived demand facing producers in


                                                 16
a particular locale which forms the basis for the construction of IDIODEM, the latter of which we

           nc                                                                             n ROW
denote D̃g . We may denote the correlate for the rest of the world as D̃g                         . Because output


and demand shares figure prominently in our discussion, it is convenient to define some additional

                  nc       Xg             nc      D̃ g
variables. Let   (g    /            and *˜ g /           . With these definitions in hand, the specification may be

written in a general form as:

        IDIODEM is our measure of the extent of idiosyncratic derived demand. The term in

parentheses measures the extent to which the relative demand for a good within an industry differs

from that in the rest of the world. If all countries demand goods in the same proportion, then

IDIODEM is identically zero. When relative demand for producers of a good in one country is

higher (lower) than that in the rest of the world, IDIODEM is positive (negative). Multiplying

this term by Xnc gives IDIODEM the correct scale and units to include in the regression.

        If instead we believe that endowments may matter for the structure of 4-digit production,

then Davis and Weinstein (1996) show that an appropriate way of nesting the models is as

follows:

                      nc        n         n ROW                nc     n ROW         n        nc

or

                                    nc   n                   nc                 nc    n           nc
(4’)                        Xg ' "g % $1 SHAREg % $2 IDIODEMg % Sg V c % ,g


                                                                  17
        The model allows us to use the estimate of $2 to distinguish three hypotheses. In a

frictionless world (comparative advantage or increasing returns), the location of demand does not

matter for the pattern of production, so we would predict $2 = 0.4 When there are frictions to

trade, demand and production are correlated even in a world of comparative advantage, reaching

exactly one-for-one when the frictions force autarky. However production does not rise in a more

than one-for-one manner. Accordingly, if we find $2 0 (0, 1], we conclude that we are in a world

of comparative advantage with transport costs. Finally, in the world of economic geography, we

do expect the more than one-for-one response, hence $2 > 1. Summarizing, the estimate of $2

allows us to distinguish three hypotheses:


        $2 = 0          Frictionless World (Comparative Advantage or IRS)
        $2 0 (0,1]      Comparative Advantage with Frictions
        $2 > 1          Economic Geography


These form the basis for our hypothesis tests.

        Direct estimation of Equation (4) is not possible because of the simultaneity problem

arising from having industry output on the right-hand side and the output of a good within that

industry on the left. We can eliminate this simultaneity by remembering that, in our framework,

endowments determine industry output. Using endowments as instruments for Xnc eliminates the

simultaneity problem.




        4
          The inability of our framework to distinguish comparative advantage from increasing
returns in the frictionless case is of little practical import. The data here will be seen to strongly
reject the frictionless framework, consistent with work by McCallum (1995) and Engel and
Rogers (1996).

                                                   18
       There are a number of ways in which we can estimate Equation (4) in addition to

estimating the full system. If one believes that endowments do not matter at the goods level, then

one can force S to equal zero for every factor and industry. In the absence of factor endowments,

one should expect the coefficient on ß1 to equal unity. This is due to the fact that ceteris paribus

one expects the share of goods production within an industry to be the same across countries.

While Davis and Weinstein (1996) confirm this, the parameter often has much larger standard

errors and deviates far from unity in specifications including endowments.5 This owes to the high

degree of multicollinearity between SHARE (which is formed in part using endowment

instruments) and the endowments. Since we found that the crucial coefficient on $2 in

specifications with endowments is largely invariant to the inclusion of SHARE, we dropped the

latter from our specifications with endowments.

       The main departure that we contemplate in this paper is the construction of IDIODEM.

In Davis and Weinstein (1996), the demand employed in the construction of IDIODEM is simply

equal to the demand for the good within a given country. However, as we noted earlier, this is



       5
         Davis and Weinstein (1996, 1998) found that in specifications with endowments and
SHARE, $1 is negative and significant. This likely results from an identification problem that
                                                             nc
arises when we include SHARE and endowments. Since X̂ is a linear function of endowments,
                                  nROW
if there were no movement in (g             across countries, SHARE would be perfectly collinear with
endowments and we could not estimate a coefficient. This is what would have occurred if we had
                        nW                                               nROW
calculated SHARE using (g (where W indicates world values) instead of (g      . The linear
                                               nc
relationship between endowments and X̂              means that we would obtain an identical coefficient if
                               nROW          nW    nc
we replaced SHARE with (      (g        !   (g ) X̂ .   Identification here is achieved by examining the
                      nROW         nW
difference between (g        and (g . This is likely to produce a negative coefficient because the
share of four-digit output in the rest of the world is likely to be below the world average precisely
when output in a country is above average.

not the appropriate measure of demand idiosyncracies relevant to local producers in a world in

which real geography is asymmetric. The structure of demand in Germany and France affects the

incentives for producers locating in Belgium more strongly than the demand in Japan and

Australia. We must introduce these aspects of real world geography. They enter in the

                   nc
specification of D̃g .


       The main question for empirics is how to estimate the effect of distance on demand.

Leamer (1997) suggests using a parameter from a gravity equation to indicate the impact of

distance on demand. Here we attempt a slightly more refined approach, one that allows each

industry to have a different level of trade costs. Specifically, we assume that the volume of trade

in industry n between two countries c and cN is described by the following equation:

                             n                                               n
                         ln Tcc ) ' N % 8 ln GNPc GNPc ) % R ln DISTcc ) % 0cc )

           n
where Tcc ) is the volume of trade in industry n between countries c and cN, GNPc is the GNP of


country c, DISTccN is the distance between c and cN. The Greek letters are parameters to be

estimated and 0 is the normally distributed error term.6 Bergstrand (1990) shows that the gravity

model has extremely good predictive power even on an industry level. This no doubt is a result of

the high degree of specialization in international production. For our purposes, however, we want




       6
         One may wonder why we did not include an adjacency term in the specification. At one
point we tried this but for some sectors we obtained negative coefficients on the adjacency term.
Since we have to assume that countries are adjacent to themselves, this resulted in countries
sometimes having negative derived demand. Since this does not make any sense, we decided to
leave the adjacency term out of the specification.


                                                   20
to focus on the distance parameter. This coefficient measures the degree to which distance causes

the demand for a product to decline.

        Once we estimate this parameter we can then calculate the derived demand (domestic plus

                                                                                    nc
international) that a producer in a given location faces. Let this be given as D̃g . Let local


demand in c for this type of good (from all locations) be Dgnc . Then we may represent this


derived demand for local producers as:

                                            nc        n              nc )       R
                                       D̃g ' kg 3 Dg DISTccn)
                                                           c)


World demand is then

                                        nW             n               nc       R
                                      D̃g ' kg 3 Dg DISTccn)
                                                           c, c )


If we require that this redistribution of world demand does not change aggregate world demand,

then this is equivalent to requiring that

                                                                       nc
                                                                3Dg
                                                 n              c
                                            kg '
                                                                nc          R
                                                      3 Dg DISTccn)
                                                     c, c )


        This transformation enables us to redistribute world demand in order to take into account

the fact that demand in one country can spill over into another country. The only remaining

question is how far countries are from themselves. We solve this in a standard way, following

Leamer (1997). Assume all countries are circular in shape. If producers are evenly distributed

across the circles, then the expected distance between any two randomly selected points equals




                                                              21
the radius of the circle. In this case the distance a country is from itself equals the square root of

its area divided by B.7



                                               B. Data

        In order to allow comparability with Davis and Weinstein (1996) we use the same data

set.8 Greater detail on the construction of the data set is available there. There is one small

difference in the data we use in this paper and that used in our original work. For three sectors

(other food products, rubber products, and professional and scientific equipment) Belgium-

Luxembourg and Finland only report one four-digit sector within a three digit sector. The values

Belgium-Luxembourg and Finland report seem exceptionally large in these sectors and lead us to

suspect that data from other four digit sectors is included in these sectors. We therefore delete

these industries from the data set. However, before doing so we re-ran our equations with and

without these sectors and found that the results in Davis and Weinstein (1996) are robust to the

inclusion of these three outliers.


        7
          There is one other methodological difference between our approach and that of Davis
and Weinstein (1996, 1998). In those papers, we postulate the form of the heteroskedasticity as
arising from the following stochastic process:
                                                                     n
                                                       nc    n      2g
                                                var ,g ' <g GNPc
where <g n and 2g n are parameters. In Davis and Weinstein (1996) all of the 2g n’s are positive, as
one would expect. However, Reeve (1997) points out that in some of the most disaggregated
runs the 2g n’s are negative. We therefore follow Trefler (1995) and force all of the 2g n’s to equal
one. None of this qualitatively affects any of the results in either paper.

        8
         The data set includes twenty-two countries. Thirteen countries provide both three- and
four digit data [Australia, Belgium/Luxembourg, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, UK, USA]. Nine countries provide only three-digit data [Austria,
Denmark, Greece, Ireland, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Yugoslavia].

                                                  22
       In addition to the data from the Davis and Weinstein (1996) paper, we also use the

OECD’s COMTAP bilateral import and export numbers as prepared by Harrigan (1993) and

made available by Feenstra (1997). Country distance is measured as the distance between the

major economic centers in two countries, and comes from Wei (1996). Measurements of how far

countries are from themselves are taken from Leamer (1997).



                              C. Estimates of The Gravity Equation

       The results of our gravity equation estimation appear in Table 1. Over all, the fits are

quite reasonable. The gravity equations typically explain around half of the variance in bilateral

OECD trade, and the coefficient on the product of the GNP’s is close to unity as one would

expect. More importantly for our purposes, the coefficient on distance is negative and significant

in all specifications. Typically a 1 per cent increase in distance causes trade to decline by 1 per

cent, although there is substantial variation in this estimate across goods. There seems to be a fair

amount of variation in the magnitudes of the parameters on distance. Interestingly, food products

seem least affected by distance, while sectors like transportation equipment and apparel are most

affected. Most likely this is because the distance parameter is picking up an amalgam of effects.

Traditional transportation costs proportional to weight-to-value ratios are no doubt present. But

one should not forget that non-traditional costs such as informational and marketing costs are also

likely to be significant for many manufactured goods [cf. e.g. Rauch (1996)].

       The distance parameter estimates from these gravity equations permit us to formulate our

new measure of idiosyncratic demand. Table 2 presents some sample statistics. We see that the

typical four-digit sector is approximately one-quarter the size of a three digit sector. The


                                                  23
magnitude of the demand deviation is perhaps the table’s most striking feature. Overall, there is

little variance in our measure of demand deviation. The ratio of four-digit to three-digit output

seems to be within 0.22 of that in the rest of the world. In comparison with our previous measure

in Davis and Weinstein (1996), both the range and the standard deviation of the demand deviation

are approximately one-third the previous values. At first one might suspect that the reduced

variance results simply from our having removed a few outliers. But this is not the case — even if

we include the outliers, the standard deviation falls by half.

       The key is the way in which market access is now allowed to affect the structure of

idiosyncratic demand. Because of Belgium’s proximity to France and Germany, the structure of

the derived demand a Belgian producer faces is strongly affected by demand outside of Belgium.

Hence, large idiosyncracies in Belgium’s own demand are likely to be smoothed out by the

demand in other countries. Such effects reduce the amount of variance in our idiosyncratic

demand variable.

       We would like to know what the relationship is between the idiosyncratic demand variable

derived from the gravity equation and the original variable used in the Davis and Weinstein (1996)

paper. IDIODEM itself is difficult to work with because it varies with industry size. However, if

we divide IDIODEM by Xnc we obtain a new variable, the demand deviation, which is much easier

to handle because it is bounded between negative and positive one. In Figure 4, we plot the two

demand deviation variables against each other. As one might expect, the two variables are

positively and significantly correlated with each other. The major difference is that there is much

more variation in the idiosyncratic country demands than in the gravity equation-based deviation




                                                  24
variable. This is basically what one would expect given that country-level idiosyncratic demands

cannot be perfectly correlated across countries.

       We can provide an additional check that the derived idiosyncratic demands are sensible. It

is quite plausible that large countries have important effects on the derived idiosyncratic demand

of small neighboring countries, and much less plausible that the reverse holds. Hence we should

expect that our new measure of IDIODEM tends to differ from that Davis and Weinstein (1996)

employ more frequently for small than large countries. A rough check of this is to count how

often the gravity equation transformation changes the demand deviation more than one standard

deviation (based on the untransformed data, i.e. 0.11). We plot the number of times a country's

demand deviation changes by more than one standard deviation against the log of the country's

GNP. Figure 5 reveals that accounting for geography causes large changes in the demand

deviation variable for small countries far more frequently than for large countries. The four

smallest economies account for 40 per cent of all of the large changes in demand deviations, while

the four largest economies account for only 13 per cent of these movements. If we focus on the

extremes of the distribution, the picture is yet more stark. The two smallest economies, Finland

and Norway, account for 27 per cent of the large variations and the two largest economies, Japan

and the US, but 2 per cent. Clearly proximity to large economies matters more on average for

small economies than large economies. This strikes us as quite reasonable and well within the

spirit of geography models.



                                         V. Estimation

                                   A. Pooling and Aggregation

                                                   25
       Our discussion makes a clear analytic distinction between various levels of aggregation —

varieties, goods, and industries. No such neat division exists in the data. Thus the level of

aggregation at which to implement our methodology is a matter of judgment and subject to data

availability. If data were not a constraint, our inclination would be to think of goods as being at a

level of disaggregation greater than exists in the currently available data. Accordingly, in

considering only this aspect of the problem, our preference is to work with the most

disaggregated data available. We do, though, consider a case at a higher level of aggregation since

this provides us with more observations and allows comparability with previous work.

       A second important consideration is the extent to which we should pool observations

across goods and industries. There is a clear advantage to pooling — it increases the number of

observations. This is potentially important, since in our most disaggregated runs we will have only

thirteen observations. However there is correlatively an important disadvantage of pooling — it

forces us to impose more structure on the estimates, and so leads us further from the underlying

analytic model. These include assumptions of common input proportions, demand symmetry, and

equilibrium scale economies for all varieties of all goods within an industry. Ex ante it is difficult

to know whether we should be happier with estimates in which the theoretical model is more

appropriate but there are very few observations or the contrary case.

       Our approach is to implement the estimation at a variety of levels of both pooling and

aggregation. If home market effects exist, we would at least like to see some indication of their

presence in the various exercises. However we should likewise be cognizant that since these place

quite distinct constraints on the data, it will be asking too much to expect a perfect mapping

among results from the varied runs.


                                                  26
       We pursue four estimation exercises. In three of these, the dependent variable is four-digit

production, with the runs distinguished by the extent of pooling, while the fourth treats three-digit

output as the dependent variable for individual industry runs. Consider first what we term the

“pooled” run. This exercise pools all four-digit observations for the estimation of a single

coefficient on IDIODEM. The great advantage of this exercise is that there are 650 observations.

The disadvantages lie in that implicitly we must assume that either all industries are comparative

advantage or all are economic geography, and that we must assume there is a common structure

determining the coefficient on IDIODEM for all goods in all industries. We next move to the

opposite extreme, that of individual “four-digit” good runs. The advantages of this exercise are

that it is closest to the analytic structure we posit and that it allows the most detailed comparison

across sectors of the presence or absence of home market effects. The disadvantage is that data

availability implies there are only thirteen observations per four-digit sector. We next report an

intermediate approach which pools all observations for four-digit goods within a three digit

industry. We may term these “industry-pooled” runs. This approach trades off the advantages of

the previous two exercises. It imposes less structure than the fully pooled runs, but typically has

four times as many observations as the individual four-digit industry runs. This also suggests the

downside, namely the fact that it forces us to impose some common structure within industries

that may not be fully suggested by the results in the four-digit runs themselves.

       Our final exercise returns to individual sectoral runs. The departure is that industries are

now defined as two-digit output, and goods are three-digit output, and so are now the dependent

variables. This has two important advantages. The first is that we do gain some observations

relative to the four-digit runs, since twenty-two countries report the three-digit data. The second


                                                 27
is that this structure and level of aggregation can be directly compared with results of Davis and

Weinstein (1998) on Japanese regional data. There are three disadvantages to this exercise. The

first is the loss of observations relative even to the industry-pooled runs. The second is that the

additional observations relative to the four-digit runs come through the addition of countries that

likely have lower quality data. Third, for related reasons, moving from the initial thirteen to

twenty-two countries likely leads to a greater violation in our assumption of a common economic

structure for all countries.

        These four exercises provide different windows on the home market effect. As we have

seen, each exercise has advantages and drawbacks. Hence to judge the results, we should not rely

too heavily on any single exercise, but rather on the conjunction.



                               B. Pooled Tests for the Home Market Effect

        Before running regressions, we feel it is informative to present a picture of what our data

looks like. Equation 3 is specified as a multivariate regression, so is impossible to plot. However,

if we constrain the coefficient on SHARE to equal unity, then simple algebraic manipulation

enables us to rewrite Equation (3) as

                                                         n
                                 nc        n ROW       "g             nc     n ROW     nc
                                (g    &   (g       '          % $2 *˜ g & *˜ g     % ,̃g
                                                       X nc

If we plot the left-hand side of this equation against the term in parentheses, we can obtain an

approximate idea of how production distortions move with demand distortions. What should we

expect to see? In a frictionless comparative advantage world, one would expect the two variables

to be uncorrelated. Frictions in a comparative advantage world would produce a positive


                                                               28
correlation, but the slope of the line would be less than unity. Only in a world of home market

effects should one see a positive correlation with a slope greater than unity.

        We plot these in Figure 6 for the four-digit sectors. The data clearly seems to be arrayed

along a line with a slope that is greater than unity. Indeed, the fitted line has a slope of 1.8,

indicating that demand deviations typically produce more than proportional production deviations.

        A more precise view of this relation comes from estimating Equation (4) under a variety of

specifications. The results from these pooled regressions appear in Table 3. The most striking

fact is that the coefficient on IDIODEM exceeds unity in all specifications. This indicates that on

average there is a strong home market effect. In the typical OECD industry, if the derived

demand deviation rises by 1 per cent, then output rises by 1.6 per cent. What is quite striking is

that we obtain this result on the same data set used by Davis and Weinstein (1996). The crucial

difference is that the relevant idiosyncratic demand now accounts for the real geography of the

OECD economies.

        A final econometric issue that we must address is simultaneity. Is idiosyncratic demand, as

we posit, leading to a strong production response? Alternatively, is a level of production beyond

that our model explains drawing in its wake idiosyncratic demand, creating only the appearance of

home market effects? The ideal solution to this problem would be to find good instruments

correlated with idiosyncratic demand, but not with output. Unfortunately we know of no such

good instruments. Hence we cannot formally rule out the possibility that simultaneity influences

our results. We can, though, take some steps to minimize its potential influence. Moreover we can

give some reasons, based on the conjunction of our studies, to suggest that this is very likely not

an appealing interpretation of our results.


                                                  29
       First, we construct the demand variable based on an average of demands in the countries

ten to fifteen years prior to the estimation period. This removes simultaneity arising from

contemporaneous correlations. Second, while we cannot instrument for IDIODEM, we can

control for some of the potential price effects in the regression. In columns 2 and 4 we include a

variable EXPORTD in our specification. EXPORTD is a dummy variable that equals one if the

country is a net exporter of that commodity times the (instrumented) three digit output in that

sector. EXPORTD controls for the fact that countries that are net exporters tend to have lower

prices than countries that are net importers. As one can see the coefficient on EXPORTD is

positive as one should expect, but it hardly affects the overall magnitude or significance of the

coefficient on IDIODEM. The absence of a strong impact of controlling for whether the country

is a net exporter or not makes it less likely that price movements associated with being a net

exporter or importer of a commodity are driving our results.

       Finally, we need to think more closely about whether it is attractive to interpret our results

as arising from simultaneity. The story would need to go something as follows: While our model

does a good job of predicting the pattern of production, it is surely less than perfect. Indeed, there

could be some systematic influences on the pattern of production left out, as for example

Ricardian technical differences across countries. Hence a country or region may have a high level

of production of a good for reasons outside the model. In turn, this unusually high production

may suggest lower prices for the associated good, so lead idiosyncratic demand to respond to the

production in a less than one-for-one manner. Thus the argument would be that by reversing the

direction of true causality, we find home market effects of production responding more than one-

for one with idiosyncratic demand.


                                                 30
        The issue is whether this interpretation is attractive in light of the various investigations

we have pursued of the home market effect. It is straightforward to show that under the

hypothesis that production patterns are driven by comparative advantage, plausible assumptions

lead one to conclude that the potential upward simultaneity bias in $2 would diminish in the

present paper relative to Davis and Weinstein (1996) because output is likely to have a much

smaller effect on derived demand than on local demand.9 Since the estimated coefficient in that

paper was 0.3, this alone would suggest that simultaneity is not the likely cause of our finding of

home market effects.



                           C. The Home Market Effect in Industry Runs

        Having examined this by pooling all four-digit observations, we now move to the opposite

extreme, considering each four-digit sector on its own. The results appear in Table 4. Because

there are very few degrees of freedom, it is quite difficult to obtain statistical significance in these

equations. Even so, we find that half of the sectors have coefficients on IDIODEM that are larger

than unity and of these eleven are significantly greater than unity. By comparison, Davis and

Weinstein (1996) only found half as many coefficients larger than unity and hardly any that are




        9
          The story would specify an additional relation between idiosyncratic demand and
production as follows: IDIODEM = T Xncg + 0D. For T , (0, 1), it is straightforward to show
that a sufficient condition for the degree of bias to be increasing in T is that $2 < 1, i.e. that we are
in a world of comparative advantage. The final step would be to note that the relevant T is likely
to be lower in the present work than in Davis and Weinstein (1996), since local demand is
plausibly more strongly related to local production than is a weighted average of local and rest-of-
world demand.


                                                   31
significant. This suggests that in our data, some industries are constant and others increasing

returns to scale.10 Home market effects are very much in evidence.

       One way to increase the number of degrees of freedom relative to the four-digit runs is to

conduct industry-pooled estimation. This pools the four-digit observations within each three-digit

industry, but allow the coefficient on IDIODEM to vary across three-digit industries. Relative to

the fully-pooled runs, this allows us to relax the assumption that three-digit industries must either

all be comparative advantage or all exhibit increasing returns. The results are presented in Table

5. In similar runs, Davis and Weinstein (1996) found that less than one-fifth of all sectors had

point estimates above unity. Here, using our new measure of market access, we now find that

over half of the industries exhibit home market effects. Furthermore, while the earlier study found

that none of the point estimates were significantly larger than unity, we now find that four of our

coefficients have this property. Moreover, while Davis and Weinstein (1996) rejected home

market effects in two-thirds of the three-digit sectors, we now reject economic geography only in

two sectors, other chemicals and non-electrical machinery.

       One word of caution is in order. Looking at the sectors, it is somewhat disappointing that

sectors like electrical machinery and transportation equipment do not have point estimates that

exceed unity. A likely explanation is imprecision of the estimates. In both of these sectors, the

standard errors are so large that we cannot reject home market effects. Indeed the four-digit runs

presented in Table 4 indicate that in half the sectors within these industries (radio, television and


       10
         More subtle problems arise if individual industries themselves are composed of both IRS
and CRS goods. In alternative frameworks, Krugman (1980), Krugman and Venables (1995) and
Davis (1998) address this problem. The various contributions stress the potential role of absolute
market size and the cross-good structure of trade costs in determining industrial structure. This
remains an important direction for further empirical study.

                                                  32
communication equipment, electrical appliances and housewares, and motor vehicles), we do

obtain point estimates for IDIODEM that exceed one.

       Hence we conclude that, these problems notwithstanding, relative to previous work these

results do represent a striking degree of support for the economic geography paradigm. Most

sectors exhibit home market effects. Those that don’t have point estimates that are typically

measured imprecisely.

       It is useful to compare these results to those in our companion study on Japanese regional

data. There we also found significant home market effects. Unfortunately, it is difficult to match

our new results with those of Davis and Weinstein (1998) because that paper used Japanese data

at a different level of aggregation. However, if we aggregate the data so that we assume

industries are defined at the two-digit ISIC and goods at the three-digit ISIC, then we have a

roughly comparable level of aggregation.

        There are several issues to bear in mind about increasing the level of aggregation.

Because more countries report three-digit production data than four-digit, we have more degrees

of freedom than on the four-digit runs. But the higher level of aggregation means that we increase

the chance that we are pooling sectors that differ in many respects, including factor intensity.

This may interfere with the operation of home market effects. For example, while it is plausible

that high demand for motor vehicles might cause specialization in motor vehicles as opposed to

motorcycles, it is less plausible that countries with high demand for transport equipment are less

likely to produce precision instruments. On Japanese data, where we had compatible technology

matrices, we could circumvent this problem by aggregating according to technological similarity,

but on international data, this is not possible. Furthermore, we are faced with the problem that the


                                                 33
variance in demand deviations shrinks at higher levels of aggregation. When we move from four-

to three-digit data, the variance in our demand deviation variable falls by a factor of two for the

countries for which we have comparable numbers. By comparison, Japanese regions had a

demand deviation variance that was comparable to international four-digit data. Finally the

inclusion of countries like Turkey and Yugoslavia in the three-digit sample probably exacerbates

problems such as measurement error.

       These reasons may help explain why Davis and Weinstein (1996) found a smaller impact

of demand deviations on production deviations on more aggregated data. Nevertheless, since we

did find evidence of home market effects at a higher level of aggregation on Japanese data (albeit

with more than twice the number of degrees of freedom), it may be useful to compare those

results with our international results at a higher level of aggregation.

       We present the results from goods-level estimation at the three-digit level in Table 6.

Although only one sector, textiles, exhibits a coefficient on IDIODEM that is significantly larger

than unity, 9 out of our 26 sectors have point estimates in excess of unity. By comparison, in

Davis and Weinstein (1998), 9 out of 19 sectors had point estimates larger than unity and 8 out of

these 9 were significant. No doubt many of the reasons that we have highlighted above explain

the relative imprecision of our international results.11 Even so, there is a fair amount of overlap

between the two sets of results. If we restrict attention to the 14 sectors that appear in both the




       11
          It should also be emphasized that the lower trade costs and greater factor mobility
within a country, rather than across countries, is likely to make for stronger home market effects.
This may also help to account for the greater number of significant home market effects in the
regional data.

                                                  34
international and regional data sets,12 we find that seven have $2's that are significantly larger than

unity in the Japanese data and five have point estimates larger than unity in the international data.

Interestingly, four of the five international sectors that come up as having home market effects —

textiles, iron and steel, transportation equipment, and precision instruments — are among the

seven sectors that also have measurable home market effects in the Japanese data. Although the

large standard errors in these industry runs make it difficult to make strong statements, there is a

striking degree of overlap. Furthermore, the fact that these sectors have often been presented as

canonical examples of economic geography by Krugman (1991) and others bolsters the

plausibility of our point estimates.

        Returning to our individual four-digit sector runs, we next examine the issue of economic

significance. Here we consider $-coefficients, which indicate how much a one standard deviation

movement in the independent variable moves the dependent variable. Over all, our estimates for

the pooled specification indicate that a one-standard-deviation movement in idiosyncratic demand

moves production by about 0.15 standard deviations. While quite modest, it is still three times

larger than the estimate in Davis and Weinstein (1996). However, since we are probably dealing

with a mix of sectors, only some of which are monopolistically competitive, it makes sense to

calculate these coefficients on a sector-by-sector basis.




        12
         This entails the removal of sectors Food Products, Beverage Industries, Tobacco,
Leather Products, Footwear, Industrial Chemicals, Other Chemicals, Petroleum Refining, Plastic
products nec, Pottery, China, and Earthenware, Glass and Glass Products, and Other Non-
Metallic Mineral Products (ISIC industries 311, 313, 314, 323, 324, 351, 352, 353, 356, 361,
362, and 369) from the international data and Chemicals, Petroleum and Coal Products, Stone-
Clay-Glass, and Other Manufacturing from the Japanese data.


                                                  35
        We present the $-coefficients for four-digit goods in Table 7. They indicate that in many

sectors the home market effect is extremely important. For example in electrical machinery

sectors, we obtain $-coefficients that are typically in the 0.9 range — indicating that the

absorption linkage to production is very important. Overall, in the sectors where we detect

coefficients on idiosyncratic demand that are larger than unity, $-coefficients are typically around

0.5.

        A second way to obtain a sense of how important economic geography is to OECD

production is to examine the relative sizes of the sectors for which $2 is larger than unity.13 At the

four-digit level, of the 50 sectors for which we have data, the sectors with coefficients on

IDIODEM exceeding unity account for 64 per cent of the total output. Repeating this exercise

for the three-digit sectors, where we have 22 countries and all manufacturing output for each

country, reveals that 50 per cent of all manufacturing production is governed by economic

geography. This indicates that the sectors that appear to have home market effects account for a

majority of manufacturing output.

        We interpret these results as important support for the proposition that economic

geography does matter for international specialization. Our results build on our earlier work by

highlighting a key feature of the economic geography model: market access. It is this new

implementation of the theory that we find to be critical in identifying home market effects.


        13
           One cannot infer from these figures that increasing returns accounts for corresponding
shares of the volume of trade. Our model is of a trading world, and it is designed to identify the
economic forces that determine production and trade. But the direct object of estimation is
production rather than trade. A complete answer to the relative role of increasing returns and
comparative advantage in determining the volume of trade is beyond the scope of this paper. The
role of increasing returns in the latter question could in principle be higher or lower than its role in
affecting production structure.

                                                  36
                                           VI. Conclusion

        The increasing returns revolution in trade is now nearly two decades old. Its appeal and

influence have been great owing to its ability to provide a simple and unified account of a wide

variety of phenomena acknowledged to be important in modern trade relations. Yet the existing

empirical literature offers no compelling test of the theory. For an empirical test to be compelling,

it must identify a feature that starkly separates the theories in contest. Yet existing empirical work

fails in this regard. In large measure this is due to the fact that the trade patterns characteristic of

the zero-trade-cost version of the theory are a consequence of specialization only. And all of the

theories in contest can account for specialization.

        Krugman (1980) proposes a test that can distinguish comparative advantage from

increasing returns, if we restrict the latter to the realistic variant in which there are costs of trading

across borders — a class of models that has come to be termed economic geography. The

distinctive element of the economic geography setting is the existence of home market effects, the

magnified impact of idiosyncratic demand on production.

        In Davis and Weinstein (1996) we test Krugman’s hypothesis on OECD data in a

symmetric hub-and-spoke variant of Krugman’s model. The data reject the hypothesis. Few

sectors exhibit the characteristic home market effects, and where such effects are identified, their

economic significance is scant.

        The present paper re-examines the problem using precisely the same OECD data as in

Davis and Weinstein (1996). The decisive departure in the present paper is the introduction of a

richer geographical structure, which brings to the fore the issue of market access. A gravity model

is used to estimate the effects of distance on demand. Thus the degree of integration is allowed to

                                                   37
differ by country pair and industry. These estimates are used to construct the idiosyncratic

demand that enters our tests for home market effects.

       The results provide support for the economic geography hypothesis of the existence of

home market effects. Hence they also provide important evidence on the role and importance of

increasing returns in determining production structure for the OECD. The fact that home market

effects are so unexpected in the traditional comparative advantage theories makes these results

particularly striking. Moreover, findings of similar home market effects in a companion study of

40 Japanese regions in Davis and Weinstein (1998) bolster these results on the OECD.

       The broad picture that emerges draws on insights from Helpman (1981) and Krugman

(1980). Comparative advantage matters both in affecting the broad and fine industrial structure.

Even at the four-digit level, from one-third to one-half of OECD manufacturing output seem to be

governed by simple comparative advantage. However increasing returns also play a vital role, in

the particular form known as economic geography. These have measurable effects on production

structure for as much as one-half to two-thirds of OECD manufacturing output. Finally, we saw

that the key to identifying these effects is to introduce more geographical realism into our models

of production and trade.
