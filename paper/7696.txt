State-Owned Enterprises, Shirking and Trade Liberalization

                                            ABSTRACT


    We explore the implications of trade liberalization in economies with State Owned enterprises
(SOEs) and shirking. SOEs are modelled as controlled by the members of the enterprise who
determine output and effort levels, while facing output prices and wage rates set by government.
Enterprise members must collectively meet a budget constraint that the value of sales equals the
enterprise wage bill plus an exogenous enterprise commitment to the state budget. Labour can shirk
either through low on the job effort (leisure), or through moonlighting to second jobs in the private
sector. Three alternative formulations of equilibria in SOE economies are explored, and in these
trade liberalization can produce effects opposite from conventional competitive models. In particular,
the output of import competing SOEs increases rather than falls, and negative effects on imports can
also occur. These models when calibrated to 1995 data for Vietnam also suggest quantitatively much
larger impacts from trade liberalization than is the case for comparable conventional competitive
models. This is because departures from Pareto optimality in SOE economies can be large and trade
liberalization acts to discipline shirking associated with these inefficiencies. The implication we
draw from our analysis is that to evaluate policy initiatives, such as trade liberalization, in
developing and transition economies without explicitly recognizing the role that SOE’s can play may
be misleading. This is especially the case where SOEs account for a significant fraction of economic
activity and shirking is involved.

1.     INTRODUCTION

       Even though developing and transition economies have undergone extensive policy reform

over the last 10-15 years, a persistent feature of many of these economies is a significance presence

for state-owned enterprises (SOE’s) (see World Bank (1995), p 29). Depending upon the economy

under consideration, these often provide the dominant mode of organization in large scale and heavy

manufacturing (steel, power, cement), as well as in financial and distribution sectors. In 1995 in

Vietnam, for instance, SOEs were estimated to still account for around 30% of non-agricultural

employment, and 43% of non-agricultural value added2.

       Despite a large SOE presence in such economies, there has been relatively little analytical

work done on them; including what objective function should be specified for them, what their

optimizing behaviour is; and, more specifically, how they change conventional analyses of policy

reform, such as trade liberalization. Much of the available literature either documents their extent

(Jefferson and Singh (1999) provide a recent discussion of the SOE reform in China, largely

providing data on their performance), empirically evaluates the relative performance of public and

private enterprises (Caves and Christensen (1980), Boardman and Vining (1989), Bennett and

Johnson (1979)), or evaluates the impact of incentive structures on SOE performance (Groves, Hong,

McMillian and Naughton (1994)). Little or none of this literature discusses the impact that SOEs

have on the comparative statics of policy reform within an economy wide analytical framework .

       Here we use three related formulations of economies with state owned enterprises to analyze

the implications for trade related policy reform. Our purpose is to show how different the analysis

of the impacts of trade liberalization can become in the presence of SOEs, both quantitatively and

qualitatively, more so than to claim we have a universal SOE formulation to be used everywhere,

       2
           These are estimates from the General Statistical Office of Vietnam (1996).
                                                                                                     2

since SOEs operate in different ways in different economies. In our formulations employees are

assumed to run the enterprise with their collective interest in mind, but to do so within government

set rules. Thus, output prices and wage rates are set by government (a common practice), but

employees determine output levels, effort levels, and can also regulate entry into the enterprise work

force. We thus assume that, given output prices and wage rates, enterprise members jointly meet a

budget constraint which requires that the value of sales cover material costs and state obligations

(including interest), but once they have met this constraint they can shirk. They do this either by

taking part-time jobs outside the enterprise (again common in transition economies), or through

reduced effort3. Shirked labour may either be consumed as leisure, or be deployed (via part-time

jobs) in the private sector. In the open economy case, trade quotas are needed to support a SOE

equilibrium, since the prices set by government will typically depart from world prices.

       Our first formulation assumes as a simplification that in all sectors of the economy there are

only SOE enterprises. The membership of all enterprises is fixed, as are wage rates by sector. The

government sets domestic prices for enterprise products and supports these through a series of trade

quotas since the country involved is assumed to be price taker on world markets. Households

(labourers) in each sector have preferences defined over goods and leisure (shirked labour). In

equilibrium, both output levels by enterprise and the degree of shirking in each sector is

endogenously determined.




       3
         There is wide spread anecdotal evidence to support these characterizations. As the World Bank
(1995) publication “Bureaucrats in Business” puts it, “Government employees operate a casino in Ghana,
bake cookies in Egypt, assemble watches in India, mine salt in Mexico, make matches in Mali, and bottle
cooking oil in Senegal.” (p.1)
                                                                                                        3



        In our second formulation, SOEs and private enterprises coexist in each sector. In contrast

to the first formulation, shirked labour from SOEs can now be used in the private sector which sells

separate and distinctive products and offers part-time jobs. Instead of shirking simply yielding

leisure, shirked labour can now be redeployed in the private sector. Trade liberalization which

disciplines SOEs will thus transfer shirked labour back from the private sector to the SOEs.

        Our third formulation, we use a mobility treatment in which SOE membership is no longer

fixed, but endogenously determined to reflect migration decisions based on comparisons of the wage

in the private sector and the combined return from working (including the monetary value of the

marginal utility of shirking) in the SOE sector. In this formulation, equilibrium conditions link wage

rates across the two sectors via the marginal benefit of shirking in the SOE sector.

        We model trade liberalization in all three formulations as eliminating trade quotas and

lowering domestic prices of previously protected products4. Given both the fixed membership of

enterprises producing such products and the enterprise budget constraint, this implies that in our first

two formulations, shirking will fall and the output in the import competing sector must increase (not

fall as is conventionally the case when protection is removed). Imports can thus fall rather than rise

under trade liberalization due to increased domestic production of import substituting state enterprise

sector products. Trade liberalization may or may not be welfare improving, depending upon whether

the marginal product of labour in any SOE impacted by the change is higher or lower than the

marginal value of leisure (or the marginal product of labour employed in the private sector



        4
          Although, typically, more general SOE reform precedes other policy reforms, such as in the trade
sector. See the discussion of the experience in Vietnam in O’ Connor (1995)
                                                                                                     4

formulation two). Typically, and as our results show, the quantitative effects on welfare (via changes

in shirking) of trade liberalization in such models will swamp those generated by conventional

competitive models.

        We parameterize versions of all these models using data for Vietnam for 1995 and use

counterfactual experiments to analyze the impacts of trade liberalization in the presence of SOEs.

Model results serve to emphasize the themes for the paper set out above; output responses under

liberalization are perverse compared to traditional competitive models; imports can fall;

liberalization can be either welfare worsening or welfare improving; and quantitatively the effects

are typically much larger in models with SOEs than in competitive models. The conclusion we

draw is that when looking at trade and other policy reform in developing and transition economies

in the presence of SOEs, their potential impacts need to be more widely acknowledged and

explicitly incorporated than at present, since the analysis can be quite different from the competitive

case.

2.     MODELS OF STATE OWNED ENTERPRISE BEHAVIOUR WITH SHIRKING

A Basic Model

       We begin with a simple model of a economy with SOEs, into which we incorporate shirking

behaviour by members of the enterprise. We assume each SOE produces a distinct product, that

labour is the sole variable input for each SOE, and there are decreasing returns to scale (reflecting

the presence of fixed capital). Each enterprise has a fixed work force    , but only a portion ,   , of

the labour available to it enters production due to shirking.

       Shirking arises in the model because each SOE has both a fixed membership and faces a

fixed (government determined) wage which is paid independently of the effort of employees. Once

minimum conditions for each worker’s effort level are met, the remaining effort can be shirked.

Shirking, in practice, will be reflected in limited effort being applied when at work, early departure

from and/or late arrival at work, labour supplied to second jobs, and other such phenomena. For

simplicity, we assume that shirking occurs at a similar level across all members of the enterprise.

This could be because members of the enterprise are able to monitor what all other members do, and

any deviation from common behaviour can be penalized by others in some way (social penalties

(displays of disapproval), for instance). Under this treatment,       becomes the variable input in

production for the enterprise.

       We write each enterprise production function as

                                                                                                   (1)
                                                                                                                 6

where         denotes enterprise output;       is a unit term;    is the fraction of the potential labour input

actually applied to production in the enterprise; and                   since we assume decreasing returns to

scale5.

          The budget constraint collectively faced by members of the enterprise is

                                                                                                               (2)

We assume that all workers in the enterprise receive a fixed wage                   independently of their effort;

the government controls the price of the output of the enterprise at                    (a common although not

always uniform practice in developing/transition economies); and                    is the level of contribution to

the state budget required from the enterprise, which we take to be exogenous. In this case, simple

substitution of (1) into (2) determines          , given    and     .

          We assume that the government uses a set of binding quotas on net trades, (import and export

quotas,        ) to support the government controlled output prices,          . These allow domestic prices to
                                           6
differ from given world prices,             . The removal of these quotas under trade liberalization forces

domestic prices to equal world prices.

          On the demand side of the economy, a representative household is assumed to reflect the

preferences of workers employed in each enterprise. This representative household maximizes a

utility function

                                                                   ; (j = 1,...N)                              (3)



          5
          We can also specify (1) as incorporating a sector specific factor          (capital), and write (1) as
                               . In this rewritten form, still remains as the only variable input and decreasing
returns to the variable input still applies, even though the production function might appear to be written as
constant returns to scale.
          6
              There is no rationing on either side of the goods market.
                                                                                                                      7

subject to the budget constraint

                                                         (i = 1,.....N)                                             (4)



where       is to the consumption of good j by labour (enterprise) type i, and                     is the utility of the

representative worker in enterprise i.

        We assume, for simplicity, that (3) is additively separable and can be written as

                                                                                  ; (j = 1,...N)                    (5)

and thus maximizing the subfunction                    subject to the budget constraint (4) yields conventional

commodity demand functions for each group of enterprise workers. In the calculations we report

later, we assume that the                   are CES7

        Trade quotas in this formulation are set such that, at the controlled domestic prices                      , the

commodity demands                     determined from utility maximizing behaviour (i.e., maximizing (3)

subject to (4), and summing across workers in all enterprises), along with the quotas, clear the

domestic markets, i.e,

                                                                                                                    (6)

The     also have to satisfy the trade balance condition that at world prices

                           .                                                                                        (7)



        7
            These yield demands for commodities for workers from enterprise j for good i as
                                 βi j I j

                                                                                                            8

        In this formulation, the cash income of workers in the enterprise,             , is independent of the

amount of shirking. Shirking is limited by the budget constraint of the enterprise, which requires

sufficient labour be deployed to generate sales to cover costs8. Shirking levels will change if the

government changes prices, either directly (with accompanying changes in Ni ) or as an

accompaniment to trade liberalization9.

        (1)-(7) thus yields a well defined equilibrium structure in which the level of shirking in each

SOE,        , is endogenously determined, while workers are guaranteed jobs in their enterprise at a

fixed wage. Product prices are fixed, and enterprises have to satisfy their budget constraint. Trade

quotas which meet a trade balance condition support the equilibrium.

        Trade liberalization in this framework involves a change in or removal of the trade quotas

  . Under a move to free trade,          increase to the point that they are no longer binding, while with

more heavily protected trade             decrease. In the case where the          are no longer binding, the

government must set prices,          , to equal the world prices      . Unrestricted net trades,    , are then

endogenously determined such that

                                                                                                          (8)

and

                        .                                                                                 (9)

        From (1) and (2) a move to free trade will increase           , reduce shirking, and increase output

in industries that were protected against imports i.e. (                 ). This is the opposite production


        8
            This is in the spirit of satisficing behaviour first described by Simon (1959).
        9
        Recent papers by Dong and Dow (1993), and Bai and Wong (1998) also discuss shirking and state
owned enterprise operations; but do not draw the link to trade liberalization we emphasize here. Also see
Mori (1991).
                                                                                                      9

response for protected industries usually associated with an elimination of protection in the

competitive case. Imports may also fall under trade liberalization due to this production response.

In industries where exports are initially restrained by trade quotas, (        ), a move to free trade

will lower     (again from (1) and (2)) increase shirking, and reduce output; also a further perverse

supply response relative to that conventional in the literature. Because of these different effects on

shirking and production in export and import industries, and the lack of marginal conditions linking

shirked effort and SOE effort at the margin, the net effect of trade liberalization on welfare is also

unclear; it can either rise or fall.

A Model with a State Owned and Private Sector

        In our second model formulation, we consider shirked labour from SOEs being used in part

time private sector (second) jobs instead of going into leisure consumption. We can modify the basic

model set out above by adding a private sector to it, recognizing that, typically, state owned

enterprises coexist with those in the private sector, although the products produced in each may

differ. A common observation is of full time employees of SOEs moonlighting, or taking part time

jobs in the private sector (often in services such as tourism, retailing or business services, and light

manufacturing (clothing, footwear, furniture)). In many transition economies, one often hears of

managers and workers departing from their SOE jobs at some point during the day to work on their

own small business in areas such as these10 .

        Under this formulation, the utility function (3) is defined over a vector of SOE products,     ,

and private sector goods,       , as



        10
           This is common in Vietnam. The World Bank (1995) also discusses this phenomenon more
broadly, indicating its presence in many countries. See also footnote 3.
                                                                                                    10

where Ck denotes consumption of the privately provided good k by household (worker) type i (in this


formulation there are K privately provided goods).

        Now shirked labour no longer enters the utility function (3) but the production function for

the state owned enterprise is again given by (1), and the enterprise budget constraint remains as

(2).The household budget constraint for type i workers is instead given by

                                                                                                  (11)

i; (1-8i) is the portion of labour of type i sold on private sector labour markets; and    is the price

of the private sector product of type k.

        Private sector production of good k is given by the production function

                                                 (k = 1,...K)                                     (12)

where there are again decreasing returns to the variable input LPk . In equilibrium, the total labour


used in all private sector enterprises equals shirked labour supplied by members of all SOEs, i.e.,

         N                  K
        ∑ (1 −λ i ) Li = ∑ Lk
                            P
                                                                                                  (13)
        i =1               k =1




        Since labour in each private sector enterprise is paid its value marginal product, it follows

that

                                                         (k = 1,...K)                             (14)
                                                                                                      11

The return to the implicit fixed factor in each private sector production process reflects the difference

between the value of output at private sector market prices,    , and the payment to the variable factor

(shirked labour supplied by SOE members).

        In this formulation, private sector goods and labour markets clear in equilibrium, and the

are endogenously determined as before. Trade quotas,        , are again needed to support prices set by

government for the state owned enterprise sectors. Trade liberalization, represented again by an

elimination of import quotas, will, as before, perversely increase production in protected sectors and

reduce production where export restraints no longer apply. Impacts on imports can again be opposite

to conventional analyses. Whether such a change is welfare worsening or welfare improving are yet

again ambiguous, but now also depend upon the relationship between the value marginal product of

labour in SOEs and the private sector, and the impact on shirking.

Mobility between SOE’s and the Private Sector

        We finally consider a further variant on the basic model above where the membership of

SOEs is variable rather than fixed. In this, workers are mobile between SOEs and the private sector

in the event of a shock to the economy, such as trade liberalization. New entry to SOE’s can occur,

and individual members of SOEs can choose to terminate their membership and instead work in

the private sector. Part time jobs in the private sector are excluded under this formulation.

        In this case, we again specify a private sector production function of the form

                                       (k= 1,...K)                                                  (15)

where      denotes to the labour employed in the kth private sector. We again assume that private

sector labour is paid its value marginal product, i.e.,

                                       (k=1,...K)                                                   (16)
                                                                                                    12

where W is the private sector wage.

        Decisions are made by workers as to whether they should move between SOEs and the

private sector by comparing the SOE wage plus the marginal utility of shirking (in money metric

terms) they received by remaining in the SOE sector to the wage they would receive (without

shirking) in the private sector. Thus, in contrast to the basic variant model, an equilibrium condition

prevails across these employment options for workers which implies that



                                           i= (1...,N)                                            (17)



where                  is the marginal utility of shirking in the SOE i, and          is the marginal

utility of income of workers of type i. Labour market clearing implies that

                                                                                          (18)

where Li is the endowment, LikP is the employment in private sector, and LSi is the employment in


state sector of type i labour.

        In this formulation, trade liberalization again lowers shirking in SOEs (raising output as

before), and labour flows into SOEs and out of the private sector. Here, since the marginal utility

from shirking affects the labour market equilibrium condition, liberalization can again be either be

welfare worsening or improving.

3.     EVALUATING THE IMPACTS OF TRADE LIBERALIZATION IN THE
       PRESENCE OF SOE’S: DATA FOR VIETNAM

        We have used the three models set out above to numerically investigate the impacts of trade

liberalization in the presence of SOE’s. We examine the effects of trade liberalization on output,

effort/shirking, welfare and trade. We also compare model predictions in the presence of SOEs to

those from comparably specified conventional competitive models which do not recognize SOEs as

distinct entities. In analyzing trade liberalization in these ways, we follow the procedures widely used

in the general equilibrium modelling literature of calibration of model parameters to a base case data

set, followed by counterfactual equilibrium calculations and comparisons to a base case equilibrium

(Mansur and Whalley (1984)).

        We use Vietnamese data for this purpose, both because SOEs remain an extensive part of the

economy in Vietnam and we have data on private and SOE employment in Vietnam for 1995.

Because our focus is partly on quantitative differences in results compared to conventional

competitive models, we keep the analysis simple by examining only 2 groups of enterprises in each

of the models; export oriented and import competing. In our basic model we model two distinct types

of SOEs ; in the other two models we model one SOE (the import competing sector) and one private

sector enterprise, which we assume is also the export sector.

        Tables 1 displays the basic data we use to construct model admissible data sets calibrate the

base case model, along with the values for the labour share and elasticity parameters we employ in

calibration. The central components of this data comes from the Vietnamese Input-Output Table for

1995 published in 1996 by the General Statistical Office, Ministry of Finance, Vietnam. In

identifying value added in state owned enterprises, we use estimates of value added shares for
                                                                                                                    14

respective SOE and private sectors obtained from interviews with Vietnamese researchers (see

Footnote to Table 1). This information yields a share of the state sector in total value added which

approximately matches the aggregate shares available published data. Employment data both for

state owned enterprises and the private sector are from the Vietnamese Social Affairs Yearbook.

       In using these data to produce model admissible data used at a higher level of aggregation

to calibrate our model formulations we make a number adjustments, some of which imply small

modifications to the structure set above. The model admissible data used in this way are set out in

Table 2 for the basic model. We accommodate the trade imbalance in the basic data on Table 1

through an exogenous trade imbalance term in equation (7) which is fixed in real terms. We also

calculate the total value added originating in the state owned enterprise sector, which we then

separate into two parts; one representing an import competing and the other an export sector. Sectors

which are net importers are aggregated as the import competing sector, and those that are net

exporters are aggregated and classified as the export oriented sector. Total SOE employment is

divided in the same way.

       We assume a production function coefficient on labour for each state owned enterprise of 0.6.

No estimates for this parameter for Vietnam are available, and we somewhat schematically rely on

estimates by Young (1994) of the labour share parameter for the South Korean manufacturing sector

in the late 1980s of 0.57. Along with the output and employment data we use, this 0.6 value implies

that 33% of labour in the two SOE sectors is shirked in the base case. We subsequently report

sensitivity of results with respect to alternative values of this labour share parameter value.

       Our data on 1995 tariff rates for Vietnam imply differences between domestic and world

prices. We assume that the only trade intervention is the tariff (i.e., no quotas or other instruments

are used), while in reality other instruments are employed; which we model as an equivalent quota.

       Finally, to complete the model specification we need values for substitution elasticities in

preferences. We use 1.2 as the substitution elasticity between goods in the top level utility function

and 1.5 as the elasticity parameter in the leisure sub function since estimates of elasticities of

substitution in preferences for Vietnam are not available. These may appear on the high side, but

mirror parameter values used in nested CES functions elsewhere whose empirical literature is

unavailable (see the values used by Piggott and Whalley (1996), for instance). We use these values

in the base case and perform sensitivity tests around them.

       As is the convention in applied general equilibrium modelling work, we can somewhat

arbitrarily choose units for goods given the value data that we use in calibration. We use units for

goods as that amount which sells for prespecified base period prices (1 million Vietnamese Dong).

Wage rates are then implied by the combination of employment and labour value added data by

sector available to us. We use all the above data and assumed elasticity and other parameter values

to calibrate the model. This yields the values of 8i, and $i (consumption shares) reported in Table

2.

       The data and assumed parameter values we use in calibrating our second model (with both

SOE and private enterprises) are reported in Table 3. For this model, the data on state owned

enterprises from the first model (value added, employment and use of capital) are aggregated into

a single SOE enterprise. Data from Vietnamese government statistical sources give private sector

employment, and value added by labour and capital. We treat the value

Note; a - Capital income in the basic value added data in the private sector in the IO (1995) table is
reduced by a 40 % factor and this is added to the labour component in the same sector to reflect the
undistributed wages of family businesses included in capital income in value added.
b - The no. of workers employed in the private sector is only 6789 (thousands), and shirked labour
from SOE is 931 (thousands) in the base case equilibrium.
c - The implicit trade imbalances in Table 2 and Table 3 are different because Table 2 (model 1) does
not include the private sector, and cross-hauling is present in the trade data in Table 1 which
disappears when SOEs are aggregated in Table3.

 added by capital as fixed capital required in production. The trade data we use are from the

Vietnamese input-output Table for1995 (see Table 1). A similar unit conventions for prices to earlier

is adopted when calibrating the model, and tariff rates (quotas) imply a similar relationship between

world and domestic prices. The elasticity of substitution in preferences between goods is again

assumed to be 1.2. There is no leisure in preferences in this model variant, and so no sublevel

elasticity parameter. Consumption shares ($i), and shirking coefficients (8i ) are again endogenously

determined through calibration.

       The data we use to calibrate the third model (with SOE/private sector mobility) are similar

to above, and are reported in Table 4. We make an adjustment to private sector employment data

in calibrating this model to ensure that the private sector wage exceeds the SOE wage (which it must

if there is any marginal benefit from shirking), since market wage rates for the private sector are

typically underestimated as family workers receive profits. Relative to the second model, the

addition of leisure in the utility function implies the use of a first order condition linking wage

differentials between SOEs and the private sector to the marginal utility of income. In calibrating this

model variant, we use a value for the leisure subutility function elasticity parameter of 1.5, as is in

the basic model. Calibration of this model to the data in Table 4 using with the wage equality

constraint in equation (17) also involves endogenously determining a scale factor R in preferences

which satisfies the wage equality condition between the SOE and the private sector.

       We have used these three model variants calibrated in the ways we indicate above to analyze

the impacts of trade liberalization in the presence of SOEs; contrasting the three sets of results to

those generated from a comparable conventional competitive trade model with homogeneous

products. The data we use for the conventional model is the same as for our first model. All our

models involve small open economy price taking behaviour, and hence no terms of trade effects are

present.

4.        RESULTS FROM MODEL ANALYSES

          Table 5 reports results of the impact of trade liberalization in Vietnam using 1995 data

generated by the basic version of the SOE model described earlier, and compares these with results

from both the two elaborations also described above, and to those from as a comparably specified

competitive model.

          In the basic model there are two SOEs, one involved in import competing and the other in

export production. Table 5 reports results for this model which show an aggregate welfare gain

from a move to free trade, involving the elimination of all trade restrictions, of 4.7% of income11.

This gain stands in contrast to a much smaller gain of 0.5 % from a comparably specified

competitive model12. In these results, the output of the import competing SOE sector from whom

protection is withdrawn increases by 17.5% in contrast to a reduction of 6.7 percent in the

competitive case. Effort increases sharply (shirking falls) by over 30 %. Trade impacts are much

larger in the competitive case compared to the SOE case, with imports rising 16.5% as against 3.2%

in the SOE case and exports rising 42.9 % as against 8.4% in the SOE case. The smaller trade

changes in the SOE case reflect the increase in output of previously protected enterprises, and the

disciplining of shirking under trade liberalization that occurs, as discussed earlier. The asymmetric

percentage trade change for imports and exports reflect the large trade imbalance in the base case

data.

Notes:1 The impacts on the two groups of workers (one from each enterprise type) in this case, for
illustrative purposes, are a welfare loss of 0 .3 percent in equivalent income terms for those from the
import competing sector and a gain of 5 per cent for those from the export sector.
                                                                                                     24

       In the other SOE cases, results from the model with an SOE and a private sector (column 3

of Table 5) are broadly similar to those from the basic SOE model (column 1 of Table 5). However,

results from the model where mobility of labour between SOEs and the private sector enters show

more differences. To ensure marginal conditions hold in the labour market in the base case,

calibration involves the selection of a units term for the subutility function for leisure, which

produces a changed marginal valuation of leisure relative to model 1 and different welfare effects

from liberalization. In this case, liberalization generates a larger export response from SOEs to trade

liberalization, but a smaller change in effort. This is due to a reduction in leisure consumption under

liberalization. In this case, and in contrast to model,1 and 3, imports fall rather than rise on

liberalization reflecting the proportionally larger production response from import competing SOEs

that occurs.

       The overall picture across all these cases, however, is that trade liberalization in the presence

of SOEs produces results which differ sharply, both qualitatively and quantitatively, from the

competitive case. Output responses from trade protected SOEs are positive rather than negative.

Imports fall as well as rise in some cases. Quantitative impacts suggests much larger welfare impacts

for SOE (by factors of 8-10), along with smaller trade impacts.
                                                                                                      25

        Table 6 reports sensitivity analyses for the results from the basic model reported in Table 4

to values of key parameters used. These showing limited sensitivity to elasticity of substitution (F)

parameters, while higher values for the labour share parameter (") yield higher welfare gains from

trade liberalization and lower values small losses.

        The most sensitivity in welfare effects occur under changes in the value of the elasticity

parameter in the leisure subutility function in the model. A higher elasticity yields higher welfare

gains, and for a low value these become losses. The latter occurs where the marginal product of

labour forgone in the SOE when labour shirks exceeds the money metric value of the marginal utility

of leisure. In such cases, labour still shirks, since they receive the wage wi independently of their


effort level, but the level of shirking is lower. We highlight earlier the uncertainty of the sign of the

welfare effects from trade liberalization in the presence of SOEs, and here we can locate critical

regions in the parameter space for which the sign of results change. A critical value of D for which

the welfare effect of trade liberalization is zero can be calculated in this model; this is 1.34. A value

of D lower than 1.34 yields welfare worsening trade liberalization for this model parameterization.

        Sensitivity analyses of results for variations on key parameter values for the other two models

are reported in Table 7. We are able to calibrate the model with mobility such that given the elasticity

values in the leisure subutility function, we can choose units terms for this subfunction such that the

wage equality condition (17) holds. If we change the elasticity parameter values in the leisure

subutility function across different model runs, we must also rescale the utility function in this way

so that equation (17) is satisfied in calibration. Limited sensitivity is again found for both models

with regard to the elasticity of substitution in preferences. Welfare effects show more sensitivity to

alternative values of the labour share parameters ("i) in production compared to the basic model.

5.      CONCLUSION

        In this paper we analyse the impacts of trade liberalization in economies with State Owned

Enterprises (SOEs), motivated by both the lack of literature on this topic, and its importance for

work on developing and transition economies. SOEs are modelled as controlled by the members of

the enterprise who set output levels and shirk while facing fixed output prices and wage rates set by

government. Enterprise members must collectively meet the budget constraint that the value of sales

must equal their wage bill plus an exogenous enterprise commitment to the state budget. Once this

constraint is met, labour can shirk either through reduced on the job effort (leisure), or through

moonlighting to second jobs in the private sector.

        Three alternative formulations of equilibria in SOE economies are explored, including

numerically using data for Vietnam. In these, trade liberalization can produce effects opposite to

those found in conventional competitive models; such as increasing rather than reducing the output

of the import competing SOEs, and potentially changing the sign of the impacts on trade flows and

welfare, even in the small open economy case. Our results point to sharply larger welfare impacts

from trade liberalization in SOE models than is the case in conventional competitive models,

because the initial departures from Pareto optimality in SOE economies can be large. In such cases

our results suggest that trade liberalization can act to discipline the shirking associated with these

inefficiencies.

        The broad implication we draw from our analyses is that to assess policy initiatives, in

developing and transition economies, such as trade liberalization, without explicitly recognizing the

role that SOE’s can play may be misleading. This is especially the case where such enterprises

account for a significant portion of economic activity.
