                      The Accuracy of Individual and Group
                     Forecasts from Business Outlook Surveys


                                    Abstract


     This paper reports on a comprehensive study of the distributions of

summary measures of err1r for a large collection of quarterly multiperiod

predictions of six variables representing inflation, real qrowth, unemployment,

and percentage changes in nominal GNP and two of its more volatile components.

The data come from surveys conducted since 1968 by    the   National Bureau of

Economic Research and the American Statistical Association and cover more than

70 individuals professionally engaged in forecasting the course of the U. S.

economy (mostly economists, analysts, and executives from the world of corporate

business and finance). There is considerable differentiation among these fore-

casts, across the individuals, variables, and predictive horizons covered.

Combining corresponding predictions from different sources can result in

significant gains; thus the group mean forecasts are on the average over time

more accurate than most of the corresponding sets of individual forecasts. But

there is also a moderate deqree of consistency in the relative performance of a

sufficient number of the survey members, as evidenced in positive rank

correlations among ratios of the individual to group root mean square errors.

      Empirical   studies of   forecasts and expectations based on survey data have

 qenerally concentrated on the performance of time series of averaqes of the

 participants' responses. As a rule, these represent means or medians for

 groups whose size and composition vary over time. This raised the possibility

 of serious aggregation errors due to the neqiect of the cross—section and dis-

 tributional aspects of the data: differences among the individuals and sub-

groups; sampling variation; consistency and representativeness of the employed

averages. That such matters can be important is not in doubt, hut they seem to

have attracted relatively little attention in the literature.1

     This paper examines the accuracy of a larqe number of individual forecast

series and of the corresponding average forecast series from a quarterly survey

conducted by the author for the National Bureau of Economic Research in collab-

oration with the American Statistical Association. The survey questionnaire is

mailed by the ASA in the middle month of each quarter to a list of persons who

are professionally enqaqed in forecasting the course of the economy, and

regular reports on the results are released in the third month.2 The respon-

dents are economists,. mainly from corporate business and finance hut also from

independent consulting firms, qovernmemt aqencies, academic and research




     1An early study which dealt with certain characteristics of the relation
between aggregate and individual forecasts is Zarnowitz, 1967, pp. 123—126. A
recent analysis of disaqqreqated data from surveys of inflation forecasts is
Figlewski and Wachtel, 1981.

     2The reports, prepared by the NBER, are now published in the NBER
Reporter, and in AmStat News. They discuss mainly the median predictions of
current interest, For some of the broader historical evaluations, see Moore,

organizations. This study covers 79 individuals (persons or firms) who

participated in at least 12 of the 42 surveys in the period from 1968:4 through

1979:1.

       The forecasts relate to rates of change in four variables:                         gross national
product in current and constant dollars (labeled GNP and RGNP); the GNP impli—

cit price deflator (IPD); and consumer expenditures for durable qoods (CEDG).

The errors of percentage change forecasts are

       Here P is the predicted level and A is the actual level according to

the last national income and product accounts data released prior to the major

benchmark revisions of January 1976 and December 1980.                                 is a .preliminary

estimate which is the most recent 'actual" value available at the time of the

forecast (since At is unknown,                     Pt is a true prediction with a horizon of

about one quarter). The subscripts refer to the suIvey quarter t, which is

the date when the forecast was made, and to the tarqet quarter, t +                            j,   which
is the date to which the forecast refers (since all this applies to any of the

forecasters and to any of the variables covered, other subscripts are omitted).

       It will be noted that (1) contains differences between the successive

levels predicted in a multiperiod forecast made at time t, namely                             p —

future quarters (j                1, ...,   4).    Accordingly, these are errors of the implicit

 marginal or intra—forecast" change predictions whose tarqets are successive

 quarterly intervals (0—1, 1—2, ...), which do not overlap.4

        For two variables, chariqe in business inventories (CBI) and the

unemployment rate (UR), the forecast errors are defined as


 (2)                   Et+. =      — A.       ,   j =   0, 1, ..., 4

that is, as differences, predicted level minus actual level. These series,

unlike the others which have strong upward trends, can be treated as

stationary. Here it is the levels that are of primary interest, not the rates

of change as in the cases of RGNP (real qrowth) and IPD (inflation).

        The questions addressed are the following: How accurate are the individ-

ual forecasts relative to the corresponding group averages? How representative

•are   the latter of the former? What   the distributions across the individ—
                                        are

uals of the summary measures of error for the period covered? How do the
results   compare across the different variables and predictive horizons? The

paper   is a progress report on a comprehensive study of a larqe and diversified

collection of U. S. macroeconomic predictions; other aspects of forecastinq

behavior and performance will be taken up in other papers.5




     41n contrast, forecasts of averaqe changes over increasing spans
(0—1, 1—2, ...) have overlapping tarqet periods, and they are therefore
necessarily intercorrelated. On the definitions, measures, and merits of level
and chanqe errors, see Zarnowitz, 1967, pp. 32—35, now 1979, p. 6, and Mcees,
1973., pp. 7—10.

survey) results, disaqqreqatjon by method, and probabilistic predictions.

                  II. Measures of Relative curacy and Consistency


        The root mean square error (RSME) of the th individual's set of

predictions can be written as

                                                                   1
periods of the th foreasts, while n. is the number of predictions in that

set. The numbers and dates of the surveys covered differ across the individ-

uals, and the error series              in (3) have qaps at times when any of the

forecasters missed any of the surveys, which happened frequently.7

      •Next we construct series of qroup means predictions that match                   the   series

for each individual precisely in terms of the variable, horizon, and periods

covered. Thus for each series of predictions by a particular forecaster

(denoted   by the subscript "i') there is now a corresponding series of qroup
averages ("q') of predictions by all those forecasters in our sample who
responded to the same surveys. In our simplified notation, the RMSE for the
croup   mean   series is

(4)                             M       = (1n.                 2 )1/2

forecasts (the other variables) Et = ext. qain    there is no need here to
corwlicate the formula by adding subscripts for the variable and target period.
       7Recall that, to he included, a forecaster must have participated in at
lea t 12 surveys, hut the surveys need not he consecutive. The mean number of
sr:e'.'s covered is 23, with a standard deviation of 8; the minimum is 12, the:
           37 (out of a total of 42).

        Ratios of root mean square errors, Mj/Mqj provide convenient measures of

relative accuracy of individual forecasts. They are comparable in a way in

which absolute errors for sets of predictions that differ in tarqet dates are

riot.    The qroup averaqes represent an important benchmark of forecasting

performance that is reasonably accessible and, as shown       below,   comparatively

efficient.     Related data on the   median forecasts from the ASA-NBER surveys are

summarized    after each survey and published reqularly, after having been first
communicated to the survey meuers: they reflect the views           of many respected

professional forecasters arid are       among the best known and   most used predictions

for the Ti. S. economy.


The Mj/Mqj Ratios: Individuals vs. Group Averages


        Inspection of qraphs for 30 d-istrihutions of ratios of root mean square

errors,     Mj/Mqj (one for each of the six variables and five target quarters)
shows that every one of them is skewed to the riqht. This is illustrated in
Chart 1, which includes the qraphs for the shortest horizon ( j = 0) and the
same-quarter-year-ahead    target' Ci   =3), those periods heinq labeled QO     and 03,

respectively. It is clear that only minorities of the individuals had ratios

of less than 1, that is, outperformed the qroup averages over time.

        Summing up the evidence from all such qraphs (for 00, ..., Q4), the best

(lowest) iatios fall between 0.7 and 0.9, the worst (hiqhest) between 1.4 and

2.2. The means of the ratios (marked M) are all located to the right of the

unity (broken vertical) lines. The histograms tend to qet tiqhter and also,

often, less skewed for the more distant quarters.8

     Table 1 shows that the mean ratios are remarkably close: when rounded,

all but nine of the 30 statistics are 1.1. The higher mean ratios, ranging

from 1 .2 to 1 .4, refer to the shortest predictions, for QO and, less so, for

Q1, The standard deviations of the Mj/Mqj ratios tend to decreaase stronqly

with the distance to the tarqet quarter, from QO to 39 An exception is CBI,

where the horizon of the expectations apparently does not matter much (all the

means are approximately 1.1 and the decline in the dispersion of the ratios is

very small).

     The proportions of the better—than—average forecasters (Mj/Mqj < 1) vary

strongly with the tarqet quarter for some variables, much less so for others.

Thus for IJR the rariqe is 8 to 42 percent, for CBI it is only. 29 to 38 percent.

Averaqed across Q0—Q4, the figures fall between 20 percent for GNP and 33

percent for CEI (see the last section of Table 1).

     It is known from past studies (and shown again below) that the averaqe

accuracy of forecasts varies considerably across the individuals, variables,.

and target periods. Highly volatile series such as CEDG and CBI are much more

difficult to predict than relatively smooth, trend—dominated series such as

GNP. In general, the uncertainty and difficulty (hence errors) of prediction

tend to increase for the more distant future. . The remarkable degree of

standardization in the         ratios stands in sharp contrast to the diversity

of the avraqe accuracy measures for the individuals, M.




     9The series for QO, QI, 02, and Q3 start in 1968:4, 1969:1, 1969:2, and
1969:3, respectively, and extend throuqh 1979:1. The series for Q4. start in
1969:4 and end in 1979:1 but miss the first three quarters in 1970, 1971:1, and
1975-:3 (because a few surveys did not ask for the Q4 predictions). For these
reasons, the number of the surveys covered is 42 for QO, 41 for Qi, 40 for 02,
39 for Q3, and 33 for Q4. Our comparisons are somewhat impaired by these dis-
parities; in particular, the relatively larqe fiqures for 04 compared to those
for Q3 probably reflect the drop in survey coveraqe.

        The advantage of the group means Mgi is the greatest for the nearest

targets and it becomes less and less important as the predictions reach out

further into the future. One may speculate that the individual forecasts for

QO and Qi contain more independent information than those for Q2-Q4, hence the

qains from averaging are larger for the former than .f or the latter.1° The

abilities to predict CBI are particularly limited, even for the nearest

quarters, so here the means and dispersion of the ratios Mi/Mgi depend little

on the distance to the target quarter (j = 0, 1, .    . •, 4).
        Earlier data, on predictions by members of a larqe group of business

economists organized into the New York Forecasters' Club,    produce   similar

results. The distributions of Mi/Mgi ratios for six—rnonthand twelve—month

forecasts of industrial production in 1947-63 show strong positive skewness,

with most of the values falling between 1 .0 and 1.3, the classes below 0.8

almost empty, and the average values all concentrated in the narrow range, 1.1-

1.211

        These findings indicate that it is difficult for most individuals to

predict consistently better than the group. Contemporaneous expectations for a

given target may be distributed more or less symmetrically about their mean,

but over time the individuals' positions within these distributions are likely



     10Th large means and standard deviations of the ratios for QO may be
associated with the disparities in the quality of the current data available to
different individuals. Although the survey questionnaire provides the most
recent information on the values of the series to he predicted, some respond-
ents choose to use different jump-off levels which may he more or less accur-
ate. It is not quite clear why the figures for the shortest predictions of UR
should be particularly high, as Table 1, column 4, shows them to he, but it is
suqqestive that this is the only variable covered for which utonthly data are
available. Some individuals are likely to laq behind the majority inabsorbinc
these monthly data (and related weekly information on unemployment claims).

     11See Zarnowitz, 1982, p. 22, for a chart showinq these results in
detail. GNP  forecasts made by members of the same group in the period 1956—3
(Zarnowitz, 1967, np. 123—126), tell much the same story.

to   fluctuate. For most people, most of the time, the predictive record is

spotty, with but transitory spells of relatively high accuracy. A series of

group averages has the advantage that it is helped by the cancellation of

individual errors of opposite sign.


Rank   Tests of Predictive Consistency
       Success in   one class of predictions (say, for GNP in Q1) may or may not

coincide with success in another class (say, GNP in Q4, or for IPD). If the

degree of coincidence wre very low (e.g., if very few people managed to "beat"

the group mean in more than one class), then the success, being rather iso-

lated, might be attributable more to chance than to better techniques or

skills.

       -The NBER—ASA survey participants have been ranked accordinq to the Mi/Mgi

ratios for each of the variables and target quarters covered. The correlations

among the resulting ranks could be either close to zero (indicatinq very little

consistency in the relative performance of the forecasters across different

variables or predictive spans) or significantly necative (those who succeed in

one category tend to fail in another) or significantly positive (those who

succeed in one category also tend to succeed in others).

       The rank correlations are presented in Table 2, both across the variables

for each target quarter (part I) and across tarqet quarters for each variable

(part II). All the correlations are positive and in qeneral they appear to be

significantly so (see note in the table)        Thus there is some degree of con-

sistency in the predictive performance of the individuals as revealed by

their Mi/Mgi ranks.

       These measures refer to the sarnple covered in Chart 2: 79 individuals

closely related, the correlations are much lower (e.g.,          p =   0.23 for CEDG and
IPD, and also for CEDG and UR). However, only 15 of the 75 coefficients (P                 1)

in part I of the table are less than 0.2. The overall mean of the p

statistics is 0.36.

       For any of the variables, people who rank high (low) in predicting one

quarter also tend to rank hiqh (low) in predicting the next quarter. The

p's for 90—91 average 0.61, those for 91—92, Q2—Q3, and 93—94 average 0.52—

0.55 (see part II of Table 2). For non—adjoining target periods, the rank

correlations are lower,      p being 0.40 where the distance is two quarters (90—

92, 91—93, and Q2—Q4) and 0.31 where it is three quarters (90—93 and Q1—Q4).

The further apart the target periods, the less correlated are the values to be

predicted, and the above results suggest that the ranking consistency declines

correspondingly. But the reductions in the rank correlations vary consider-

ably in size and regularity, beinq most pronounced for CEDG, least for GNP.

When averaged over the quarters 91—94, the p coefficients are relatively low

for CEDG, GNP, and RGNP (.27—.33) and hiqh for I?D, UR, and CBI (.55-66).


                   III. Distributions of Summary Measures   of   Error


       It is instructive to examine the distributions of the statistics that sum

up the records of the individual forecasters. The discrepancies in time

coverage reduce the comparability of absolute accuracy measures across the

respondents to the surveys. However, in the ASA-NBER data there appears to be

no significant bias due to missed observations. No pattern has been found to

suqqest   that the participants covered selected the times   of their responses in

any   systematic   manner; rather it is random factors (absences, work pressure,

neqljqence) that account for the allocation of the missed surveys among the

individuals. Interest in the overall picture provided by the summary measures
                                          —14—



of each forecaster's performance is also enhanced by the fact that the number

of surveys (42) is relatively large and the coverage of each is adequate (on

the average, 43 participants with a standard deviation of 9)•12

        The distributions of the summary measures of error for the individual

forecasts are further compared with the corresponding measures for the overall

group    forecasts. The latter refer to the series of mean predictions, of which
there are thirty, one for each of the targets covered (6 variables x 5
horizons). These averages comprise all forecasters who predicted the qiven
target at any time    during   the period under study, so that the series are

continuous, each including predictions from all surveys covered. Thus the

RMSE for any of these group mean ("q") series is simply


(5)                     Mq =        2)h1         t =1,   2, ...,


where     n is the total number of consecutive surveys (42         j   for QO—Q3, 33

for 94, see note 9).


Overall Accuracy

        For each of the six variables, the means of the individual RMSE's taken

across the tarqet quarters 90, ...,Q4 exceed the corresponding RMSE's for the

overall qroup mean forecasts. The ratios of the summary statistics of error

(entries in column 2 of Table 3 divided by those in column 5) vary from 1 .04

to 1.16 and averaqe 1.11.

       The performance of the series of group mean forecasts is also superior to

the averaqe performance of the series of individual forecasts in terms of

correlations with the actual values. The averages of the               coefficients

     bThese measures refer to the sample covered in Chart 1 (75 individuals forecast

national product' (GN'P and RGNP), the GNP implicit price deflator (IPD), and normal
consumer expenditures on durable goods (CEDG), the measures refer to percentage
changes; for the unemployment rate (UR) and the change in business inventories
(CBI), they refer to levels. SD = standard deviation (corresponr1in to the rteans in
column 7); RMSV = root mean square value computed as (mean)2 + (SD)'.
                                         —16—




for   the individuals vary between .14 and .28, except for the unemployment rate,

a relatively smooth level series, where the 2 is .66 (column 3). They are

60 to 80 percent lower than their counterparts for the overall group means

(colurnn6), except again for tiR, where the margin in favor of the aggreqate is

much smaller.

      The mean errors have negative signs for all the variables, with the

important exception of RGNP. This reflects the familiar tendency toward under-

estimation of chanqes in most forecasts. The average overestimation of real

qrowth   observed in our data is   larqely   explained by   the   fact that,, after a
decade   of relative stability and an extraordinarily lonq business expansion,

the 1970s gave rise to a novel phenomenon commonly called staqflation and art

unexpectedly serious recession. As would he expected, since the individual

predictions are randomly distributed over the same period as that covered by

the overall group mean series, the two sets of forecasts have much the same

mean errors (cf. columns 1 and 4).

      As a rule, it is some simple average rather than the underlying individual

forecasts from economic outlook that are regularly published and used, arid i.t

is certainly worth knowing that the predictive value of the former tends to be

measurably greater than that of the latter; hut how accurate have the men

predictions been, considering the accessible data and techniques? One approach

to answering this broad question would he through comparisons with benchmark

preditions from time—series models appropriately selected to fit the charact-

eristics of the variables in question and estimated with data available at the

time the ex ante forecasts to he assessed were actually made. This task is

beyond the scope of the present paper. To qath some insight into the order of

the magnitudes involved, however, it is useful to compare the average forecast

errors with the averaqe values of the outcomes for each of the target series,
                                               —17--




and some summary statistics are provided for this purpose in the last section
of Table 3.

       Plainly, the absolute values of the mean errors are at least smaller than

the mean actual values in every case, and they are indeed for most of the

variables quite small in these terms (cf. columns 1 and 4 with column 7). More

telling, the RMSEs are less than the corresponding root mean square values of

the tarqet series, again in most cases by larqe margins (cf. columns 2 and 5

with column 9). The RSME's for the group mean forecasts are also qenerally

less   than the standard deviations of the actual values (columns 5 and 8). The
predictions of tJR        and GNP rank   as the first and second best in all of these
comparisons; IPD and RC,NP        rank lowest when the ME figures are used, RGNP and

CEDG when     the RMSE figures are.

Characteristics of the Distributions
       The medians of the RMSE's for the individual forecasts are with few
exceptions lower than the means, but by relatively small margins (see Table 4,
columns 1 and 4). This indicates a weak                tendency for these distributions to be

skewed to the right, that is, toward the large RMSE1S.

       In virtually all instances, the averages of the individual RMSE's exceed

the RMSE's for the correspondjnq group mean forecasts (compare the entries in

columns land 4 with their counterparts in column 6). The measures for the

group mean tend to be closer to the lower quartile than to the median of the

distribution of the individual RMSE's (cf, columns 3, 4, and 6). This is

roughly consistent with the earlier finding, based on more strictly comparable

measures, that the overall proportion of cases in which M <                Mqj isahout 26
percent      (Table 1).

       Themore distant the tarqet quarter, the larqer tend to he the prediction
errors, as demonstrated by the increases from 00 throuqh 04 of the entries to

columns 1 and 3—6 of Table 4. However, the increases taper off: the fore-
casters on the average predict QO substantially better than Qi, and 01 still

noticeably better than Q2, but their ability to anticipate Q3, is not much less

limited than their ability to anticipate Q2, and the same applies even more to

Q4 vs. Q3. In short, these measures suqqest that the R1SE's tend to approach

asymptotically a hiqh plateau at the more distant target quarters.

        Note that these results apply to the marqinal prediction errors for each

successive quarter (in a shorthand notation used earlier, to changes 0—1, 1—2,

...).    To the extent that such errors are positively correlated, their

cumulation can produce much qreater increases in the average prediction errors

forchanges over increasing, overlapping spans (0—1, 0—2,

        The absolute dispersion measures (standard deviations in column 2 and

interquartile ranges implied by columns 3 and 5) increase from QO to Q4 for tJR,

decrease for CEDG, and behave rather irregularly for other variables such as

GNP and RGNP. In contrast, relative dispersion measures, viz.,      the
coefficients     of variation SD/M (ratios of entries in column 2 to those in

column 1) show strong tendencies to decrease for the more distant target

quarters. They are also on the average similar for most of the variables

(ranging from .23 tá .26, except for CEDG and CBI, where they are .19 and .31,

respectively).




        12The   buildup of average prediction errors with increasing spans is a
general phenomenon to he expected and is well documented in forecast evalu-
ations. However, some evidence for earlier periods has shown marginal errors
varying narrowly and irregularly over the range of several quarters ahead,
without any systematic upward drift (Zarnowitz 1967, pp. 64—72, and 1979, op.
18—19; McNees 1973, pp. 24—25). The present results may differ because of the
nature of the period covered (and Zarnowitz 1979 provides some support for this
hypothesis), hut they also inspire more confidence than those of other stuiies,
ei-iq based on much larqer samples of better controled data.

         The qroup mean forecasts have tracked the actual changes better than the

average individual forecasts: the correlation measures in column 9 of Table 4

are, with but a few exceptions, higher than those in column 7. The listed r2

coefficients decline strongly with the lenqtheninq horizon between 00 and 02,

much less so for Q3 and Q4, for both the individual and group mean forecasts.

Only for UR, where the correlations are high for reasons already noted, do

these declines exteid clearly through the entire target range (Q0-Q4). The

dispersion of the            coefficients across the individuals declines as the

distance to the tarqet quarter increases, except for UR where the opposite

happens (column 8).


                        IV. Summary and Interpretations of Findings


         The results of the study support the following statements:

   1 •      The   group mean forecasts from a series of surveys on the averaqe over
            time more accurate than most of the correspondinq sets of individual
            predictions. This is a strong conclusion, which applies            to all vari-

            ables and predictive horizons covered and is consistent with evidence

            for different periods and from other studies. It is based on an

            intensive analysis of a large collection of authentic macroeconomic

            forecasts, in two forms:       (1) individual-to—qroup PJ4SE ratios Mj/Mgj

            which turn out to be predominantly larqer than 1 .0, and (2) distribu-

            tions of summary measures of accuracy, in which the series of the

            overall mean predictions Mg place better than half or more of the

            individuals.

   2.       The    minorities that did   succeed   in   outperforming   the group   averages

            vary   in size across the variables (from 20% for (ZN? to 33% for CR1)

            and, particularly, across the horizons 00—Q4 (e.g., 11-37% for IPD,
                                               —21—




             8—42% for UR). In each of the thirty cateqories combining specific

             variables and target quarters, most of the forecasters show RMS     errors
             exceedinq those of the strictly comparable group mean forecasts, and in

             most of the categories these majorities are larqe. The Mi/Mgi ratios

             average 1.1 and cluster between 0.9 and 1.4.

3.           Rank correlations amonq the respondents according to the same ratios

         •
             are positive for all variables and target quarters, and they are sta-

             tistically significant in most cases by the conventional tests. For

             this result to obtain, a moderate deqree of consistency must have
     •

             existed in the relative performance of a sufficient number of the
             survey members. It is still true, as earlier reports also indicate,
             that   no sinqle forecaster has been cserved to earn a long record of
             superior overall accuracyi13 and indeed nothing in the   present study

             would   encourage us to expect any individual to reach this elusive qoal.
             But a small number of the more regular participants in the ASA-NI3ER
             surveys did perform better in most respects than the composite fore-
             casts   from the same surveys..

4.           To go beyond the observations in point 3 above, a further study of the

             characteristics, methods, and results of the forecasters      with the best

             records will he needed. To mention just one question of       interest, it

             remains to he   seen whether weighted combinations of selected forecasts
             from this subqroup would yield siqnificantly larqe and persistent gains
             in accuracy, hut our results do not rule out this possibility. It




         13See, e.g., Zarnowitz, 1967, pp. 123—132; and McNees,    1979,    pp. 4—17.
                                           —22—



             seems more doubtful that weighting could be applied with much benefit

             directly to large nuthbers of forecasts from the surveys.14

  5.         Absolute measures of error depend strongly on the characteristics of

             the predicted variables and vary accordingly, in contrast to the

             standardized Mi/Mgi ratios. For example, relatively smooth series

             such as the unemployment rate and growth in nominal GNP are easier to

             predict and are in fact much better predicted than the more volatile

             series such as qrowth in real GNP and the IPD inflation, as indicated

             by comparisons of average size and variability of foreôast errors and

             realizations.

  6.         The overall composite forecasts Mg have RMSE's that are       for   almost

             all categories smaller than the medians, and indeed often close to the

             lower quartiles, of the distributions of the RMSE's for the correspond-

             ing individual forecasts. Also, the correlations of predicted with

             actual values (r2) are typically higher for Mg than fore most of the

             individuals, frequently by substantial margins. These results are

             apparently   unrelated to the differential characteristics of the

             variables covered.

  7.         The location and dispersion statistics for the distributions of •the RMSE

             and r—2   measures display much diversity hut also some apparent reqular—

             ities. The medians tend to he smaller than the means, suqqestinq some

             positive skewness in the RMSE distributions. While the standard devia-

             tions of the individual RMS   errors   and    coefficients vary greatly

             across the different variables, the coefficients of variation do not.

8.   There is a qeneral tendency for the errors to increase in absolute size

     with the time distance to the target cuarter, but by decreasing margins.

     1so, correlations between predictions and realizations typically

     decline as the target, period recedes into the future, but again more so

     for the nearest than for the more distant q.farters. The relative dis-

     persion measures tend to decrease with the predictive horizon for 'the

     RMSE's and rise for the correlation statistics, while the absolute

     dispersion measures show no common patterns of change.
