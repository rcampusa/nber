                    CAPITAL CONTROLS NID C)ERED INTEREST PARITY


                                       ABSTRACT

        This   paper examines covered interest parity between Yen—denominated and

dollar—denominated assets: Euro—yen and Euro—dollar three month deposit rates,

and the representative and comparable three—month interest rates in Japan and

in the U.S.        An objective of this paper is to single out the portion of

deviations from covered interest parity that is caused by capital controls

Imposed by the Japanese authority.           To that end, new measures of one—way

arbitrage gain are defined taking Into account transactions costs associated

with the bid—ask spread of exchange rates and the transactions tax on

repurchase agreements, Gensaki,       in Japan. According to our measure, covered

interest parity has been holding, as theory predicts, in the Euro market since

1977.     The Euro—Yen market must have been thin to have caused violations to

parity in 1975 and 1976.       Capital controls imposed by the Japanese Government

are detected by one—way arbitrage measures between l3ensaki in Japan and Euro-

Dollar deposits between 1975 and 1980.            After a new law was enacted in

December 1980 which lifted most capital controls, covered interest parity has

been holding between Gensaki and dollar—denominated assets.

     Covered interest arbitrage must equaHze net yields of assets denominated

 in different currencies taking inte account the currency appreciation (or

depreciation) expressed in the forward—spot spread.            Since simultaneous

transactions in the spot and forward markets eliminate any risks in the

exchange rate fluctuations, covered interest parity is expected to hold in a

theoretical model with perfect capital mobility all the time.       However, it is

not so straightforward to establish covered interest parity empirically.1

Deviations observed in data can be attributed to one of the following reasons:

(I) transactions costs associated with information gathering and processing,

brokerage fees and commissions, and taxes on transactions;        (ii)   differences
in treatment of income taxes on yields from assets in different currency

denominations; (iii)    capital   controls in place on movement of short—term

investments;   (iv) default risk of an asset and political (country) risk of

future capita) controls; and (v) errors in (observed) variables.

     An objective of this paper is to single out the portion of deviations

from covered interest parity that is caused by capital controls imposed by the

Japanese authority.     To that end, data are carefully selected to avoid the

problem of timing and errors in observat4ons.       Monthly data are cross—checked

with daily data, when possible, in order to make sure that they are on the

 end of months basis.   Transactions costs associated with the bid—ask spread

and the transactions tax on repurchase agreements in Japan are taken into

account.2   Political risks due to the fear of future capital controls are

discussed but not explicitly analyzed in this paper.       This is not a serious

problem, because the capital controls of Japan in the 1970's are being lifted

one by one as explained in the next section.3           Thus, we interpret any
significant deviations from   parity   as evident that capital controls already in

place became binding.


                                  I
     Covered interest parity is examined for various pairs of on—shore and

off—shore assets denominated in Yen and in U.S. dollars:     Euro—Yen and Euro-

Dollar three month deposit rates and the representative and comparable three—

month interest rates In Japan and in the U.S.    In section 3, we define and

examine these measures of arbitrage gains in the traditional way, without

taking into account transactions costs.    Section 4 is devoted to developing

new measures of one—way arbitrage gains net of transactions costs consisting

of the bid—ask spread of exchange rates and the transact ions tax.    Positive

entries of a measure are interpreted as deviations from parity due to capital

controls.   The measure which takes into account transactions costs in one

direction is related to the theoretical concept of TMone—way arbitrage in

Deardorff (1979).

     A few conments on closely related works are in order.    Otani and Tiwarl

(1981) and OtanI (1982) examined capital controls and covered Interest parity

between Yen—denominated and dollar—denominated assets.   Both works used daily

data from 1978 to March 1981.    They examined the difference between three—

month Gensaki, which are repurchase agreements in Japan, and three—month Euro—

Yen deposit rates. They found that the Gensaki rate was higher than the Euro—

Yen rate from the beginning of 1978 to March of 1979, and that the reverse was

true in the first quarter of 1980.   The authors explained these deviations by

episodes of capital controls by the Japanese Government.     There are several

differences between their papers and this one.   First, by using monthly data

we have documented a longer time series by various measures for apparent

arbitrage gains from 1975 to April 1983 (and in the case of TEGATA, the Bill

Discount rate, from 1972 to 1982).    Second, taking into account the bid—ask

spread of exchange rates and transaction taxes on Gensaki arrangements, we

created a measure which picks up the deviation 4rom parity due to capital

controls net of obvious transactions costs.4

 II, A BRIEF HISTORY OF JAPANESE CAPITAL CONTROLS


     Deregulation of Japanese capital controls came in several steps during
the 1970's and was completed by the new Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade

Control Law in December 1980.   Before 1974, most short—term capital flows in

and out of Japan were in general restricted.     No Japanese security companies

could buy foreign bonds, and no foreign companies could buy            Japanese

securities. However, subsequent fluctuations in the Yen were accompanied by

deregulation of capital controls.     When the Yen was depreciating quickly,

deregulation to encourage inflows of capital took place, and when the Yen was

rapidly appreciating, deregulation to encourage outflows of capital         was

introduced.5 For example, in the wak. of Yen depreciation, short—term

government securities became available to non—residents       in August 1974,
although their interest rate was (and still is) fixed at a level     lower than
the market rate.   In an attempt to stop a long process of Yen appreciation in

1977, Japanese security firms and others (with security firms' intermediation)

were allowed acquire foreign securities.     After hitting an all—time high in

late 1978, the Yen depreciated rapidly in 1979.      In that year,   it became

possible for foreign companies to purchase any Japanese securities in February

and to trade repurchase agreements in May.     In December 1980, the new law

became effective. Under the new law, capital flows in and out of Japan are

free with a few exceptions.6 Investing in foreign securities is allowed to

anybody without a security firm's intermediation;    foreign loans need only

prior reporting; non—residents can purchase and sell Japanese securities

without any licensing; non-residents can issue bonds in Japan with prior

reporting; and Japanese residents can open deposit accounts denominated in

foreign currencies with market—determined interest rates.

    The series of important deregulations mentioned above is expected to make

measures 2, 4, and 5, which will be defined in the
convergence toward zero.     Considering the capital controls in place before

1974,    it would not be surprising to find unexploited profit opportunities

before 1974. The band of deviations from parity should diminish between 1974

and 1980, and should be at a minimum after 1980. Since the U.S. did not have

notable capital controls after the 1970's, any arbitrage          GAIN measures

involving the U.S. market should not show much deviation.    The interest parity

in the Euro market (GAIN 1) should provide a benchmark for how much deviation

after December 1980        One can ask the question whether the new law has

actually made any differences.        It may have been the case that deregulation

for the Japanese investors in 1977 and for the non—residents in 1979 was

significant enough so that parity was already holding at the time the new law

was introduced; or perhaps the new law only paid lip service to deregulation

and included sonic unwritten barriers.      The following sections of this paper

will confirm or refute the above conjectures and answer      the above—mentiOned

quest ion.




 III. ARBITRAGE GAINSi A TRADITI0WL.APPRCH

        Several measures of hypothetical arbitrage gains are     defined between

EUROY, the three—month Euro—Yen deposit rate in London;        EUROD, the three-

month Euro—Dollar deposit rate in London;        RJA, the three—month repurchase

 agreement (Gensaki) rate in Tokyo; and RUS, the prime industrial paper rate in

where F is the three—month 4.rward exchange rate measured in Yen per dollar;

S   is the spot exchange rate measured in Yen per dollar; R$ is the interest

rate on the dollar—denominated asset,                i.e., EUROD or RUS; RY is the interest

rate for a Yen—denominated asset, i.e., EUROY or RJA. For

     RY = EUROY, RJA,            EUROY, RJA,

respectively.          Note that all the GAIN measures in this paper are expressed in

simple annual yields.

     Covered interest parity is supposed to hold almost by definition in the

Euro currency market.            The transactions costs are minimal and there is little

time lag in trading and recording.                   The Interbank deposits in different

currencies bear similar and comparable risks.                  As the Euro—Yen market has

become more active, covered interest parity should be confirmed by data

without even minor exceptions.                  One source of deviations may be observation

errors of exchange rates and timing of measurements.                   On the other hand,

covered arbitrage operations from assets in Tokyo to Euro—dollar deposits or

vice versa may be subject to various kinds of capital controls of the Japanese

Government.       Therefore, GAIN2 would measure deviations from parity due to

capital controls.         There is another way of looking at this effect. Taking the

difference between GAIN2 and GAIN1, we have another measure of deviation

associated with capital controls.

     GAINS E      GAIN2 - GAIN!

              =   EUROY - RJA



                                            5
On the one hand, GAINS   is better   than GAIN2 as a measure of   capital   controls

if there are substantial transactions costs with respect to spot and forward

foreign exchange, and also if there are measurement errors in exchange rates.8

On the other hand, GAIN2 would represent deviations due to capital controls
                                                                                  The
more accurately than GAIN5 if the Euro—Yen market is not well developed.

mere fact that the Euro—Yen deposit rate was          not available before 1975

suggests that it might be only recently that GAIN5 has          become a reliable
measure. We will consider both GAIN2 and GAINS      as   candidates for a measure of

capital controls. Similarly, a measure of the U.S.       capital controls is   created

by taking the difference between GAIN3 and GAINI:

     GAIN6 m GAINI - GAIN3

            =   EUROD - RUS

In the existing literature, some of the above measures are used to show or to

refute covered interest parity.          Either positive or negative entries mean

violations to covered interestparitx In the strict sense.         However, parity is

                                                                                    is
said to be holding if the deviation is within a TMband of neutrality.w It

an immediate question of what determines this band. A relationship between

the above measures of qains from arbitrage is            schematically explained in

Figure 1.

 the capital controls in Japan were significantly relaxed in December 1980,

 statistics are calculated for sub—periods before and after December 1980 as

well as for the entire period from 1975 to 1983.


                              INSERT TABLE I ABOUT HERE


 Since transactions costs are minimal and there are no capital controls in the


                                     6
Euro markets, large deviations from par it>' in measure GAIN! are due to a thin

market or observational errors. Variability represented by standard deviations

of GAIN! is reduced after December 1980 to a level less than a half of what it

was between 1975 and December 1980.       This may be due to the increase in

capital flows after the 1980 deregulation and the resulting expansion of the

Euro—Yen market. Compared to the decrease in variability of GAIN1, changes in

standard deviations of GAIN2 and GAIN5 over the two sub—periods are drastic:

they are reduced by 90 '..     For the period after December 1980, standard

deviations of GAIN2 and GAIN! are very close to 0.25, and those of GAIN3 and

OAJN4 are equal at 0.466.     This suggests that deviations from parity were

because of capital controls before the new law came into effect in December

1980.   However, parity has been holding closely since 1981.        The large

standard deviations of GA1N2 and GAIN5 before December 1980 do not tell us

which way the deviations were directed.    Means of GAIN measures 2 through 5

show that investing in Yen—denominated assets were on average more profitable

than otherwise by a slight margin, but standard deviations are too large to

conclude this with confidence. A plot of a gain measure should be examined to

determine whether deviations from parity are Just random or are serially

correlated. Figure 2 shows how GAINS changes over time.


                          INSERT FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE


    Most of the time before the middle of 1979, deviations from parity were

in a direction such that there were potential arbitrage gains toward Yen—

denominated assets.   That was particularly true in the beginning of 1975 and

in all of   1978. As explained in section 2, the purchase of Gensaki was

allowed in May 1979, and other restrictions were lifted in December 1980. It

can be seen from Figure 2 and Table I that these deregulations seems to have

established covered interest parity between Gensaki and dollar—denominated


                               7
assets. However, this remains *               conjecture   until we separate deviations

due to capital controls from those due to transactions costs                     In the next

section, we will propose new measure of 'one—way arbitrage gain which is more

explicit than the idea of a band of neutrality.


IV. ARBITRAGE GAINS DUE TO CAPITAL CONTROLS


     In this section, we define measures for arbitrage gain taking into

account explicitly the bid—ask spread for the exchange rates and the

transactions tax for the Gensaki asset. The exchange rate available to a

seller of Yen is not the same as the one to a buyer.                 Therefore, a measure of

interest arbitrage gain should involve different exchange rates depending on

the direction of a flow      of    funds.       Covered interest parity implies that there

are no gains of arbitrage in either direction, which show up as non—positive

entries for the two one—way gain measures involving the same assets.                      The

transactions tax for Gensaki depends on the instrument and on who is trading.

The loss on the annualized yield of Gensaki arrangements between a security

company and a client with Government bonds as an instrument is estimated to be

0.16 X, as explained in Ito (1983).                Therefore, the yield for RJA should be

reduced by 0.16.

     Let us denote the ask rate of spot and forward exchange rates by GA and

FA, respectively. Then our new measures of arbitrage gains are defined in two

directions.         The arbitrage gain of a dollar—denominated asset over Yen—

denominated asset has a suffix A after the number of the gain measure, and

a gain measure in the reverse direction has a suffix B:


                       FA
GAINNA =   (I   +   R$) — — (1    + RY)
                       S




                                          8
                        BA
GAIN*B(1+RY)—-(I4R$)
                        F



where for N        1,        2,           3,          4

we substitute

               =   EUROD, EUROD,         RUB,         RUS

          RY       EUROY, RJA—0.16, EUROY, RJA-0.16.

For example, GAIN2B measures whether an economic agent in the Euro market

currently holding three—month Euro—dollar deposits would rather invest in

three—month Gensaki in Tokyo.              Since GAINS and GAIN6 are gain measures which

do not involve transactions costs of foreign exchange, they are the same as in

the last section.                 One—way1 covered interest parity implies that any GAIN

measure should be non—positive all the time.9 Summary statistics of one—way

GAIN measures are presented in TABLE 2.                       The asset originally held is

described in each row.             An alternative asset by covered arbitrage operations

is   described in each       column.       In each box are means and standard deviations

for the periods before and after the new law of 1980.                  Theory predicts that a

gain measure is non—positive not only on average but also in each entry.

TABLE 3 lists the number of positive entries for each                    series in each   year

after 1975.


                             INSERT TABLES 2 N'ID 3 ABOUT HERE


     It   is just as theory predicts that two one—way' gain measures in the

Euro—market, GAINIA and GAINIB,                stay   negative after 1977 with few exceptions.

The means of these measures, therefore, are negative. Standard deviations

become smaller, indicating that any factors affecting covered interest parity

have become stable.          For example, transactions costs other than the bid—ask

spread have become uniform for all participants in the Euro—Yen market due to



                                          9
the market's expansion.    Major violations to parity and a large swing In 1976

suggest that the Euro Yen market was thin at that time.

     Gain measures between Euro—Dollars and Gensaki, GIN2A and GAIN2B, show a

different picture.    The number of positive entries and means of GAIN2B before

1979 suggest that there were substantial unexploited profit opportunities from

the Euro market toward the Gensaki asset.        This was due to the capital

controls    in place then in Japan, in particular a barrier to inflows of

capital.    As explained in section 2, purchase of Gensaki by non—residents was

prohibited until May 1979.           Non—residents could only invest in other

securities, such as treasury bills, which had interest rates afixed        lower

than the Gensaki rate before May 1979; the Gensaki market had been the only

open market with a flexible interest rate.1°       Therefore, potential profit

opportunities    shown above reflect both capital controls in terms           of

prohibiting non—residents from purchasing Gensaki and the low interest rate

policy affecting yields on alternative assets.        Positive entries of GAIN2A

persisted until the end of 1980.      This suggests that deregulation of outflows

of capital in 1977 was not enough to •stablish parity, and that it was the new

law of 1980 which made parity hold.      In order to see how lifting the capital

controls affected the measure, GAIN2A and GAIN2B are plotted in Figure 2. The

decline    in standard deviations and non—positive movements of both lIN2A and

IN2B after 1980 are seen in Figure 3.


                           INSERT FIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE


     Unlike the success in measuring deviations from parity associated with

capital controls of Japan, gain measures involving nerican domestic assets do

not behave as theory predicts.        Violations to covered interest parity are

evident in GAIN3B and 1N4B;      U.S. asset holders would have been better off

investing in Euro—Yen or Gensaki, according to these numbers.      There are two


                                10
possible reasons for this anomaly. First, prime industrial paper In the U.S.,

used for the representative short—term interest rate in the Morgan Guarantee

data bank, may not be the appropriate domestic instrument for studying covered

interest arbitrage.       However, the Gensaki rate, which is listed as the

representative short—term rate in the same source, is appropriate for Japan.

Second, additional transactions costs or default risk in connection with

international debt crisis may be responsible for the deviations. See Kreicher

(1982) for discussion of default risk and balance sheet constraints to explain

apparent deviations in the GAIN6 measure using the CD rate as domestic

interest rate.


V.   EXTENSIONS OF THE   LYSIS

     In this section, we extend our analysis from previous sections in two

directions.      First, we would like to confirm that the new measures of one-way

arbitrage gains are useful in daily data, too.         Since the measures developed

in the preceding section predict non—positive entries all the time, covered

interest arbitrage is tested better in finer frequencies.        Second, the sample

period is extended to include the early 70's.          Between 1971 and 1974, Just

after the demise of the Bretton—Woods regime, the Japanese government tried to

avoid a rapid appreciation of Yen and kept strong capital controls.        It is of

great interest to see whether covered interect oroitrage was holding during

these turbulent years.


V.1 Arbitrage Gain Measures with Daily Data

     Daily (weekdays excluding bank holidays) data are available to calculate

GAINIA and GAIN1B after 1978. The number of violations to parity,             i.e.,

positive entries, and means and standard deviations of GAIN1A and GAIN1B are
                                                  11
reported in the first two columns of Table 4.

                                        INSERT TABLE 4


     Examining the table and figures, we realize that although all reported

means. are negative, one of the two GAIN measures has more than one-tenth of

its entries violating parity every year between 1978 and 1982. However,

standard deviations have been decreasing so that in the first half of 1983

there are no violations to parity. Since the Euro market has expanded, the

covered interest parity between the Euro Yen and Dollar markets is now holding

as theory predicts.        This is shown In the non—positive one—way arbitrage gain

measures.      Plots of daily data are available in Ito (1983) for GAIN1A and

GAINIB and in Otani (1982) for Gensaki and EUROY showing GAIN5 as their

differences.

     One may propose to consider a variant of the one—way arbitrage gain.        In


addition to using the bid—ask spread for the exchange rates, the bid—ask

spread for three—month deposit rates could be used.         Consider an arbitrage

operation of borrowing the Euro—Yen at the ask rate and investing in the Euro-

Dollar at the bid rate. The GAINIA measure is modified by replacing the Euro—

yen and Euro—dollar rates when used as the origins of arbitrage by their ask

rates denoted by EIJROYA and EURODA, respectively.         Krelcher (1982) used the

bid—ask spead of Euro—Dollar deposit rates in his calculation of one-way

arbitrage gains between the Euro—Dollar and CD rates in the U.S., which are

similar to GAIN6 of our definition. Our modified gain measures are defined as

follows:


GAIN1 = (1      + EUROD)   — - (1
                           FA
                                       + EUROYA)
                           S


                     SA
GAIN1BB = (1 s EUROY) —         - (I   + EURODA>
                     F



                                       12
The number of violations to parity and means and standard deviations of these

modified GAIN measures are shown in the third and fourth columns of Table 4.

According to the modified measures, covered interest arbitrage has been

holding more than 95 > of the time since 1981, and the accuracy is improving

over time.      One problem with these measures is that since the mean is

significantly different from   zero,   the modified measurE is probably too strong

in the sense that the marginal arbitrageurs in the market are not agents who

issue th. deposit certificates.


V.2 Experience in the Early 1970's

     Th. end—of—month Gensaki series dates back only to 1975.        In order to

investigate covered interest parity during the turbulent years of the early

1970's, a substitute for the Gensaki rate Is sought.       A natural candidate is

the (interbank) Bill Discount ('Tegata') rate with a maturity of two to three

months.12     The Tegata rate differs from the Gensaki rate in three respects

(i) the series is taken as 'average over the month' as opposed to the 'end of

the month';      (ii) the interbank market is closed to nonresident investors

(except foreign banks); (iii) the maturity of the instrument is classified as

'two to three months' (and it is 'two manths since October 1980). With these

changes in mind, let us construct the modified gain measures, GAIN2T and

GAIN4T, replacing RJA (Gensaki) by TEGATA in the definitions of GAIN2 and

GAIN4, respectively. Figure 4 illustrates the fluctuations in GAIN2T between

1972 and 1982;      and GAIN4T which is not shown here looks very similar to

GAIN2T.     How closely the Tegata rate is related to the Gensaki rate can be

understood by comparing movements of GAIN2 and GAIN2T between 1975 and 1982.

The modified series is quite comparable with the original series for that

period in terms of direction of movements and the amplitude of fluctuations.

                                   INSERT FIGURE 4



      Let us focus on the modified measure between 1972 and 1974.      This period

is   characterized     by fluctuations with amplitudes much wider than in later

periods.       For example, in December 1973, GAIN2T became 30X.     In that month

Tegata was 11.192Y. and EUROD was 10.13 X, while the spot rate was Y280/$ and

the forward rate was Y320/$.        This is in contrast to the case in February

1973, when GAIN2T was belv —lOX, The Japanese interest rates were determined

quite independently from the forward premium (expected depreciation of Yen,
I..., S < F) and the Euro—dollar interest rate. Most of thes. fluctuations in

GAIN2T can be attributed to the fluctuations In the forward premium or

discount, with comparable Interest rates. These are sufficient evidence that

in the early 1970's, the Japanese capital market was isolated from the rest of

the world, as conjectured in Section 2. Any unexploited gains from arbitrage

in these periods were due to capital controls which made Japanese instruments

unavailable to non—residents and placed strong restrictions on the acquisition

of   foreign   securities by the Japanese.



VI, CONCLUDING REIiRKS


      This paper examines covered interest parity between Yen—denominated and

dollar—denominated assets.       We propose a measure of one—way arbitrage gain

which singles out the deviations from parity due to capital controls.

According to our measure, covered interest parity has been holding, as theory

predicts, in the Euro market since 1977.        The Euro—Yen market must have been

thin to have caused violations to parity in 1975 and 1976.         SInce 1977, the

standard deviations of the measure have been reduced gradually.           This is



                                   14
confirmed in daily data as well as monthly data.

     In order to consider capital controls imposed by the Japanese Government,

measures of one—way arbitrage gains between the Gensaki and Euro—dollar assets

are examined from 1975 to 1983.        The measure shows apparent unexploited

arbitrag. gains between 1975 and 1978.      In particular, strong arbitrage gains

existed in 1978 in the direction from Euro—Dollars to Sensaki. This is caused

both by capital controls, in that non—residents were not allowed to purchase

Gensaki, and by the low interest rate policy, in that assets available to non—

residents had interest rates lower than the market (Gensaki) rate.         After

Gensaki became available to non—residents in May 1979 and the new Foreign

Exchange Law became effective in December 1980, one—way arbitrage gains have

almost disappeared, showing that these institutional changes were successful

in establishing smooth short—term capital flows in and out of Japan.

     Using the Tegata rate, a measure of arbitrage gain is extended back to

1972. The large fluctuations of the measure from 1973 to 1974 are due to very

strict capital controls before 1974.

     To sum up, we found in this paper that Japanese capital controls in place

caused deviations from covered interest parity during 1972 to 1979.      Gradual

deregulation of capital controls from 1975 to 1980 contributed to smaller

standard deviations in measures of arbitrage gains. Allowing non—residents to

purchase Gensaki in May 1979 and the across—the—board deregulation of capital

flows in December 1980 made significant changes in the behavior of measures of

one—way arbitrage gains. Since January 1981, we have seldom observed positive

unexploited arbitrage left in the market.

1.    See Aliber (1973) for classifying different reasons for deviations from

covered interest rate parity; these are reproduced below with modifications.

Frenkel and Levich (1975,         1977, 1981) measured transactions costs by

triangular arbitrage between different currencies. Frank.'l (1982) and Claasen

and Wyplosz (1982) focused on the Franc with an emphasis on political risks

and Otani and Tiwari (1981) and Otani (1982) demonstrated deviations from

parity involving the Yen caused by capital controls for 1978—1982. Dooley and

Isard (1980) explained deviations in foreign and domestic Mark—based interest

rates by variables associated with political risks.


2.   This paper ignores deviations due to differences in taxation of corporate

Income from different sources.         Makin (1983) discusses the issue in a

theoretical model but he considers purchasing power parity rather than covered

interest parity.


3.    The Japanese deregulation of capital controls is in contrast to that in

France which is described in Frankel (1982).     Strictly speaking, we cannot

reject an alternative interpretation that the deviations result 4rom the

combination of capital controls already in place with a fear of the imposition

of additional capital controls.


4.    Otani and Tiwari (1981) use a definition of transactions costs which Is

broader than ours. Their transactions costs Include 'not only brokerage fees

but also costs in terms of taxes, search time, political risks, and ways in

which market participants need to maneuver around any capital controls.'


5.    However, there were a few occasions when controls were tightend, only to

be deregulated shortly. See Otani (1981; Appendix) for details.



                                  FOOTNOTES-i
6.    The law specifies various conditions under which controls can be

reimposed: a dangerously unstable Yen; a threat to domestic capital markets,

monetary policy, or balance of payments; a substantial threat to a domestic

industry; or the inability of Japan to meet international agreements.


7.    See appendices for the reasons we select these data and sources and

definitions of data.


8.    Most of the studies of interest rate parity use the difference between

the on—shore and off—shore interest rates.        Otani and Tiwari (1981) compared

Euro—Yen and Gensaki rates            Claassen and Wyplosz (1982) studied the

difference between the domestic Franc and Euro—Franc rates. It was the German

Mark in   Frankfurt   and Zurich on which Dooley and Isard (1980) focused.



9.    Although the name of 'one—way arbitrage is adopted from Deardorff, our

definition is slightly different from      his.   We mean by one—way arbitrage a

one—directional arbitrage between three—month assets denominated in home

currency and an a set of operations consisting of selling home currency in the

spot market, investing in foreign assets, and buying home currency in the

forward market.       Deardorff considered an arbitrage between buying       foreign

currency in the spot market and a set of operations consisting of investing

(lending) In an asset denominated in home currency, selling home currency in

the forward market, and selling short (borrowing) a foreign asset. Since both

usages express the same phenomenon, cov•red interest arbitrage, our modified

usage is appropriate.

The    follwng data are   provided by courtesy of Data Resources Inc. (DRI) and

Morgan Guarantee Trust (MG).



EURO?. EURODI RUS

       Daily series by DRI: Monthly series by MG, World Financial Markets, with

       with additional observations of EURO? from      its   data bank.



       Monthly series by MG, data bank.            <Note that the series published in

       World Financial Markets has a discontinuity over the data source, which

       has to be corrected. See   Ito   (1983) for details.)

S. F

       Daily series by DRI:     Monthly series between 71:8 and 76:12 from        IMF

       (aeC158 and bC158), and between 77:1 and 83:4 constructed from             DRI

       daily series by picking the last business day of each month.

SA FA

       Daily series by DRI: Monthly series between 77:1 and 83:4 from DRI daily

       series by picking the last business day of each month, and between 75:1

       to 76:12 by regressing SA (FA) on constant, time and S (F) and then

       estimating SA (FA) by extrapolation.



Further notes on the data are in    order.       First, it    is difficult to find an

alternative source for the Gensaki rate with a maturity of three months.            A
series for Oensaki in OECD, Main Economic Indicators, is unfortunately not an

send of month series, contrary to Its caption.           The end—of—month series for

three—month Gensaki     Is available from Bank of Japan,              Annual Economic
Statistics, only after 1977.       The    monthly data we used were cross—checked

                                APPENDIX     1
against daily series published in newspapers in Japan for 1980—82 without

detecting any major deviations.

     Second, an alternative interest rate in Japan is not            available.     The

Tegata rate as explained in section .)I is an interbank      rate.      However, the

series for a two—month instrument is available only as daily averages and has

been regulated in a sense until 1979.            The CD rate, which is free from

regulation, Is available only since May 1979.        The treasury bill rate with a

maturity of 60 days is heavily regulated.           It is well below the official

discount rate and the rate Ii changed only when the official discount rate is

changed.     Most of the treasury bills are simply bought out by the Bank of

Japan and do not circulate in the open market.        Since the treasury bill rate

in Japan does not represent th. short—term money market rate, it is

inappropriate to use it in a study of covered interest rate parity such as one

by Frenkel and Levich <1981). For a detailed description of interest rates in

Japan, see   Ito   (1983).

     Third, we decided not to use the IMF monthly series of exchange rates

                   because cross—checking with daily data     available     from DRI
after 1977,
                                                                                  of the
revealed that the IMF series failed to picK up the last business day

month.     The     IMF series deviates from ours by about 2 Yen per dollar for the

spot exchange       rates in April 1979 and January 1982, partly because of high

                                                              Using IMF data would
volatility in the rate toward the ends of those months.
                                                                        between
 not establish diminishing standard deviations of the gain measure even

 the Euro—Yen and Euro—dollar rates.

      Fourth,      the Euro deposit rates provided by MG are cross—checked against

 daily series available from DRI.       Th. discrepancx is minimal and th. problem

 mentioned above about the spot exchange rates does not happen for the deposit

 rates.
