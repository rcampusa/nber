Recent Manufacturing Employment Growth: The Exception That Proves the Rule.

                                          ABSTRACT

This Paper challenges two widely held views: first that trade performance has been the primary
reason for the declining share of manufacturing employment in the United States and other
industrial economies, and second that recent productivity growth in manufacturing has actually
been quite rapid but is not accurately measured. The paper shows that for many decades,
relatively faster productivity growth interacting with unresponsive demand has been the dominant
force behind the declining share of employment in manufacturing in the United States and other
industrial economies. It also shows that since 2010, however, the relationship has been reversed
and slower productivity growth in manufacturing has been associated with more robust
performance in manufacturing employment. These contrasting experiences suggest a tradeoff
between the ability of the manufacturing sector to contribute to productivity growth and its ability
to provide employment opportunities.

While some blame measurement errors for the recently recorded slowdown in manufacturing
productivity growth, spending patterns in the United States and elsewhere suggest that the
productivity slowdown is real and that thus far fears about robots and other technological
advances in manufacturing displacing large numbers of jobs appear misplaced.

        Manufacturing has played an important role in helping the United States achieve more
inclusive income growth. Economic growth depends ultimately on improvements in productivity,
and output per worker in manufacturing has historically grown more rapidly than output per
worker in the rest of the economy. This has meant that manufacturing has made a
disproportionate contribution to income growth.1 In addition, manufacturing helped make growth
more inclusive because it has provided opportunities for men without a college degree to earn
relatively high wages and enter the middle class. In 1970, for example, CPS data indicate that
fully 35.6 percent of men without a college degree who held a full-time job worked in US
manufacturing, and even in 2015, 17.4 percent of men without a college degree were employed
full-time worked in manufacturing.2
        We like to believe that good things come together, but unfortunately, when it comes to
manufacturing, there appears to be a tradeoff between employment and productivity growth.
Many see globalization as the most important reason for the erosion in US manufacturing
employment, but I will show that for many decades relatively faster productivity growth
interacting with unresponsive demand for goods has actually been the dominant force behind the
declining share of employment in manufacturing in the United States and other industrial
economies. Since 2010, however, the relationship has been reversed and much slower
productivity growth in manufacturing has been associated with more robust performance in
manufacturing employment and nominal spending on goods.
        Price changes tend to reflect total factor productivity changes (Nordhaus 2005). Faster
productivity growth in manufacturing will therefore generally lead to lower relative prices for
manufactured goods. Figure 1 plots the ratio of (total factor) productivity growth in
manufacturing to total factor productivity growth in GDP (TFPMAN/TFPGDP) from 1970 to
2010. It also plots the ratio of the prices for GDP to prices for gross manufacturing value-added
(PGDP/PMAN). When (PGDP/PMAN) increases it means that manufacturing goods are
becoming relatively cheap, and the figure shows vividly the close association between relative

  Between 1998 and 2010, manufacturing contributed 29.3 percent of the increase in output due to labor productivity
growth but averaged only 11.7 percent of all full-time employment (Bureau of Economic Analysis,

increases in productivity in manufacturing and relative declines in prices of manufactured
goods.3
          In principle, the tradeoff between employment and productivity growth is not inevitable.
Faster productivity growth means that fewer workers (and other inputs) are needed to produce a
given volume of output, but if the quantity demanded is very responsive to lower prices, the
volume of goods sold could so increase that more rather than fewer workers would ultimately be
employed. While there may be some manufacturing products for which demand is responsive to
relative price, for the manufacturing sector as a whole this is not the case. Thus relatively faster
productivity growth in manufacturing has led to smaller shares of spending on goods.4
          In addition, economic growth due to faster productivity raises incomes. Whether this
income growth increases employment in goods production depends on how people spend their
income gains. As they become richer, people could in theory devote increasing or decreasing
shares of their spending to goods. But in practice, as incomes rise, the share spent on goods
declines (Boppart 2014). Poor people spend more of their money on goods. They tend to buy
more food, clothing, and motorcycles.5 Rich people, by contrast, spend more of their money on
services. They eat in restaurants, have personal trainers, hire accountants and lawyers, and see
psychiatrists. Taken together, therefore, faster productivity growth in the production of goods
and more rapid income growth both reduce the share of spending on goods and thus the share of
workers required to produce them.6
          Figure 2 provides estimates of ratios of relative prices, quantities, and values of US final
spending on goods versus services and structures.7 The data are for final spending on goods and

3
  Of course if prices are overstated, productivity growth will be understated, both nonetheless both would still move
together.
4
  The inelastic nature of the demand for manufactured goods as a whole is not really surprising, since we are
considering the demand for an entire sector. We expect elasticities to be higher at low levels of aggregation. For
example, Toyotas might be close substitutes for Hondas, but automobiles as a group will be less substitutable for
other transportation vehicles such as motorcycles, trains, and buses, and in turn all manufactured goods less
substitutable for all services or agricultural products.
5
  Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016) show that because the poor tend to spend higher shares of their incomes on
goods and goods are more traded than services, this also means that they enjoy disproportionate gains from trade.
6
  Boppart (2014, 2190) estimates the elasticity of substitution between goods and services as 0.596 and the
expenditure elasticity in consumption at .78. He finds that between 1946 and 2011 changes in incomes and relative
prices each accounted for about half of the decline in the share of spending on goods.
7
  Since GDP is defined as Consumption (C) plus Investment (I) plus Government Spending (G) plus Exports (X)
minus Imports (M), I can obtain total US spending (i.e., C + I + G) by subtracting the trade balance (X – M) from
GDP. Since separate data for goods GDP and merchandise trade are also available I can obtain similar estimates of
spending on goods. By subtracting spending on goods from total spending I obtain nominal spending on services
and structures. Similarly using the data expressed in 2009 prices I can obtain estimates of the quantities of goods and

4
thus reflect not only the value-added in manufacturing but also the value-added in the raw
materials used to produce the goods and the additional costs required to distribute them to final
consumers. Thus they only reflect the demand for manufacturing value-added under the
assumption that the margins for inputs and distribution remain constant. Nonetheless, they are
revealing.
         The data are expressed in logarithms and can thus be interpreted as percentages. The top
line shows the decline in the prices of goods relative to services over the 69-year period—by 136
log points or just less than 2 percent per year. By contrast the bottom line shows the increase in
quantities of goods purchased relative to services—by 66 log points or just less than 1 percent
per year. The result is that the value of spending on goods has fallen relative to the value of
spending on services and structures by roughly 1 percent annually (the middle line). The figure
shows that Americans have responded to declining relative prices of goods and higher incomes
by spending more of their money on services.
         The decline in relative prices of goods and the rise in incomes do not boost demand for
goods enough to offset the decline in the demand for labor and other inputs due to relatively
faster productivity growth in the production of goods.8 Therefore the share of goods in spending
and the share of inputs used in the production (and consumption) of goods both decline. This
impact can be seen vividly in US consumption spending, which on average accounted for 62
percent of all national spending between 1947 and 2017. Over this period the share of
consumption spending on goods declined from 62 to 33 percent.9
         This account relating the effects of US spending to US output of goods has abstracted
from the impact of trade. If the United States were a closed economy, this would be all that
matters. In reality, given domestic spending, a trade surplus in manufactured goods would add to
manufacturing employment and a deficit would subtract from it.10 But the account of the United
States as a basically closed economy fits the facts closely until the 1970s.The US manufacturing
employment share began declining in the 1950s—long before the economy was exposed to trade.


services plus structures that have been purchased. I use the separately reported price indexes for goods and services
to obtain relative goods prices.

10
   As emphasized by Matsuyama (2009), for example, in a small price-taking open economy, demand could be
infinitely elastic and faster productivity growth could then increase employment.

5
        Moreover, the rate at which the US manufacturing employment share has fallen over the
past three decades as the economy globalized further—about 0.4 percentage points per year—is
remarkably similar to the rate at which it fell in the 1960s and 1970s. This similarity suggests
that the forces that operated in the early years continue to dominate. As shown in figure 3, when
a trend line fitted to manufacturing employment data from 1960 to 1980 is projected out to 30
years, it precisely predicts the share of manufacturing employment in 2010. Without knowing
about China’s rise, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), or the formation of the
World Trade Organization (WTO), a forecaster in 1980 would have been able to accurately
predict the number of workers employed in manufacturing in 2010 without almost any error!11
        Donald Trump has blamed “offshoring and trade” for declines in manufacturing
employment, singling out what he considers are flawed trade agreements as the major driver of
these developments. While there is evidence that the US trade deficit has contributed to some of
the losses of manufacturing jobs since 2000, far more powerful even during this period has been
the impact of faster productivity growth interacting with unresponsive demand for goods. For
example, 985,000 US manufacturing jobs estimated to have been lost due to Chinese imports
between 1999 and 2011 (Acemoglu et al. 2016) represent less than a fifth of the total loss of over
5 million US manufacturing jobs over the same period.12 In Edwards and Lawrence (2013, 83),
we estimate that because of rapid productivity growth in manufacturing, the manufacturing
employment content of the US trade deficit in 2010 (2.7 million jobs) was actually lower than
that estimated for 2000 (3.3 million jobs). In other words, rapid productivity growth in
manufacturing implies that over time any given trade deficit translates into fewer jobs.




11
   Manufacturing employment performance was unusual after 2000 however because in addition to a declining
share, absolute employment also fell. However, as shown in Lawrence and Edwards (2013; pp3-4) this decline was
predictable given the historic relationship between changes in manufacturing employment and changes in total
employment. Nager (2017) has objected to the fitting of a linear rather an exponential trend on the grounds that a
linear curve implies eventually manufacturing employment would disappear. However, the linear trend has a much
better R-squared fit than the exponential trend and as noted the specification using percentage changes in
manufacturing and in the rest of the economy also fits the data out of sample between 2000 and 2010 almost
perfectly.
12
   “Applying this direct plus full input-output measure of exposure increases our estimates of trade-induced job
losses for 1999–2011 to 985,000 workers in manufacturing alone and to 1.98 million workers in the entire economy”
(Acemoglu et al. 2016, S145). A very similar job loss estimate of 0.8 million manufacturing jobs is obtained by
Caliendo, Dvorkin, and Paro (2017, abstract). Hicks and Devaraj (2017, 6) estimate that that between 2000 and
2010, 13.4 percent of manufacturing jobs (750,000) lost were due to trade.

RECENT US EXPERIENCE


As can be seen in figure 3, since about 2010, the long-run trend line no longer fits the data.
While still declining, manufacturing’s share in US employment since 2010 has fallen much less
than its long-run trend. Indeed, the small drop in the share of just 0.29 percentage points over the
six-year period between 2010 and 2016 is less than the 0.40 percentage point annual average that
was typical over the prior five decades. Recent manufacturing employment behavior has also
been radically different than it was in the early 2000s. In the economic recovery after the 2001
recession, manufacturing employment did not increase at all, but, after reaching a trough in 2010,
it had increased by 1.6 million jobs by 2016.
        One might speculate that this recent jobs performance indicates that US manufacturing is
becoming more internationally competitive and that jobs are returning (“on-shoring”) as a result
of lower US energy prices, higher Chinese wages, and innovations such as 3-D printing. But
recent US trade performance does not support this interpretation. Between 2010 and 2016, the
US trade deficit in manufactured goods actually increased from $412 billion to $639 billion—by
about 0.7 percent of GDP.13 While care should be taken when providing causal interpretations to
trade deficits after the fact,14 this increase in the trade deficit suggests that trade, if anything, was
probably a drag on manufacturing employment.
        Another possibility could be that demand and employment represent an unsual temporary
snap back from the deep US recession, but by 2016 this effect should have dissipated. Instead,
slow productivity growth appears to be the source of the relative strength in manufacturing
employment growth over the full period. As is illustrated in figure 4, since 2010 the rapid
productivity growth in manufacturing has ground to a halt: Between 2010 and 2016, output per
full-time employee in manufacturing declined by 2.2 percent. This pace is far below the
manufacturing labor productivity growth of 4.3 percent achieved annually between 2000 and
2010.15 Moreover, according to the more comprehensive measure of productivity growth—


13
   Since value-added per full-time equivalent employed in manufacturing has increased from $162,993 to $180,577
per worker over the same period, the employment equivalence of the manufacturing trade deficit has increased by a
million, up from 2.5 million to 3.5 million jobs.
14
   For a discussion of the pitfalls of assuming trade deficits necessarily lead to employment loss, see Edwards and
Lawrence (2013, 33–42).
15
   The computer industry was a major driver of manufacturing productivity, and as emphasized by Baily and
Bosworth (2014), a major part of that industry has moved abroad, inevitably reducing average output and

7
multifactor productivity growth (MFP)—manufacturing’s productivity growth increased at an
annual average rate of 1.3 percent between 1987 and 2008 and by just 8/10ths of a percent
between 2008 and 2010, then declined by 5.8 percent between 2010 and 2015, falling by 2.8
percent in 2015 alone.16
        The relative prices of manufactured goods are consistent with the productivity data.
Information technology products led the surge in productivity growth in manufacturing that
began in 1995 (Jorgenson 2001). But that surge peaked in 2005 and lasted through about 2010
and more recently the rate at which producer prices of semi-conductors and computers have been
falling has decelerated.17
        A similar story is reflected by broader price measures of manufactured goods. As shown
in figure 5, the deflator for the manufacturing industry relative to the GDP deflator declined at an
annual rate of 2.1 percent between 1997 and 2010, but between 2010 and 2016 it actually
increased by 2.8 percent. Similarly the GDP deflators for finished goods prices compared with
services declined at an annual rate of 3 percent between 2000 and 2010 but by just 1.7 percent
per year between 2010 and 2016.
        The recent behavior of spending on goods has also been unusually strong. Over the long
run (1947 to 2015), nominal (final) spending on goods has fallen by about 1 percent per year
relative to nominal spending on services (figure 2). But the ratio of consumer spending on non-
energy goods to spending on services was quite similar in 2010 and 2016 (figure 6).
        In sum, in recent years we have seen (1) slower declines in the share of manufacturing
employment; (2) slower productivity growth in manufacturing; (c) higher relative prices for
manufacturing value-added rather than lower prices; and (d) relative prices for goods at the
consumer level falling more slowly. In response, spending on goods compared with services is
also falling much less rapidly than before. These outcomes are all predictable if there is a relative
slowdown in productivity growth in manufacturing and demand for goods is price inelastic.


productivity growth, both because measuring productivity growth in computers is difficult and because its share in
output is declining.

INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE
Similar negative trends in the share of workers in manufacturing are evident in all industrialized
countries (table 1). Between 1973 and 2010 the average decline of the US employment share in
manufacturing of 0.40 percentage points is just about the same as the average decline of 0.39
percentage points for all the countries in the sample, and the 2.4 percent annual decline in the
share is close to the 2.0 percent decline in the average share.
       Moreover, it is noteworthy that the sample showing downward trends in manufacturing
employment includes countries such as Germany, Japan, and Italy, which have had trade
surpluses in manufacturing trade that between 1973 and 2010 averaged 7.6, 6.2, and 4.2 percent
of their GDPs, respectively (Lawrence and Edwards 2013). The experience of these countries
shows that an increased trade surplus in manufactured goods can lead to an increase in the level
of manufacturing employment—Germany, Italy, and Japan, for example, clearly have higher
shares of manufacturing employment than the other countries—but as productivity growth
increases over time, the employment content of a given surplus (or deficit) will decline and
eventually the long-run trends that reflect the interaction between productivity growth and
demand will tend to dominate the outcomes.
       It is also noteworthy that the United States is not unique in having had a slower decline in
the share of manufacturing employment between 2010 and 2016 than it experienced earlier. As
shown in table 1, on average the percentage point decline in manufacturing in all nine of the
industrialized countries in the sample has been just 35 percent of the average annual decline
between 1973 and 2010, and the average annual percentage decline in the manufacturing
employment share in the nine countries has been about half that recorded between 1973 and
2010. Indeed, only in Australia has the annual percentage decline between slightly faster.
       The international evidence also shows that the United States is not unique in having a
declining share of consumer spending on goods over long run. As shown in table 2, in a sample
of nine OECD countries—data on Australia are not available—between 1995 and 2010, for
example, the average annual rate of decline in the share of consumer spending on goods was 0.56
percent per year. By contrast, between 2010 and 2014 (the latest OECD data currently available)
the share of consumer spending on goods in the sample actually increased by an average of 0.15
percent and in five of the nine countries the share increased by an average of .50 percent.

WHAT ARE THEY DOING WITH THE ROBOTS?


The changed spending responses can also help shed light on another controversy that relates to
productivity growth (Feldstein 2017; Fernald 2012; Baily, Manyika, and Gupta 2013; Branstetter
and Sichel 2017). On the one hand, many productivity experts claim we are living in period of
very slow productivity growth. Robert Gordon (2012), a leading techno-pessimist, has vividly
described how the information technology revolution that stimulated productivity growth
between 1995 and 2005 has run its course and that our ability to sustain strong economic growth
has run into significant headwinds. Tyler Cowen (2011) agrees that we have already picked the
low-hanging fruit that can improve living standards. These views are consistent with data and the
consensus of professional forecasters. For example, as noted by Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (2017,
24), a survey of professional forecasters shows that while in 2007 they had projected that the
United States would achieve long-run growth in labor productivity of 2.3 percent, by 2012–13,
their projections had declined to an average of 1.9 percent.
           On the other hand are claims that we are going through a new era in which the pace of
change is so rapid that it deserves a new name such as “the fourth industrial revolution” (Schwab
2016) or “the second machine age” (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014). These techno-optimists see
a world that is awash in new technologies that will bring about fundamental economic and social
changes. They point to improvements in information processing that are revolutionizing areas
such as artificial intelligence, big-data analytics, precision medicine, machine learning, robotics,
3-D printing, cloud computing, the internet of things, and autonomous vehicles that are capable
of unleashing a surge in productivity and accelerate economic growth.18 Indeed, many now view
the luddites more favorably and are concerned that the ability to digitize technology will displace
both skilled and unskilled workers and make it increasingly difficult to earn a living wage. This
has prompted proposals to deal with these prospective inequities either by having the workers
own the machines (Freeman 2016) or by slowing their progress through the taxation of capital
(Piketty 2013).
           The productivity facts, thus far, are on the side of the techno-pessimists, but some techno-
optimists claim that the official data understate the quality of recent innovations and the

10
improvements they have enabled. But it has always been difficult to measure productivity
growth, especially when it involves radically new products and technologies, so that to make the
case for mismeasurement, it is necessary to claim not simply that there is mismeasurement but
also that mismeasurement has become increasingly worse.19
           One response to mismeasurement is developing better methodologies for measuring
prices.20 But another is to examine the data on spending. Ultimately the buyers are the best
judges of quality. Buyers will respond to true prices rather than nominal prices. If true prices are
actually lower than official prices, and demand is inelastic, nominal spending should fall in
response to productivity improvements. Many advances such as robotics, 3-D printing, the
internet of things, big data, and the cloud should be improving productivity in the production and
distribution of goods. If, in reality, these have accelerated the relative productivity growth in
goods production, the share of nominal spending on goods should fall even faster than before.
The share of total US nominal spending on goods (C + I + G) declined from 36.5 percent in 2000
to 32.8 percent in 2008. However, in 2016 the share was 32.9 percent, almost exactly what it was
in 2008. Similarly, in 2016 the share of nominal spending on goods in total consumption
spending was 32.1 percent compared with 33.7 percent in 2008 and 36.1 percent in 2000.21 This
suggests that the recent relative slowdown in manufacturing productivity is real.


CONCLUDING COMMENT


Manufacturing has played a special role in economic growth and it is not surprising that many
governments currently have major initiatives that aim at promoting advanced manufacturing
technology. Ultimately economic progress rests upon technological innovation, and if they prove


19
   Feldstein (2017, 153–56) emphasizes the problems that result from understating productivity growth when new
goods or services are introduced. This could mean that productivity growth will be measured as slowing down
especially during innovative periods when more new products are being introduced.
20
   Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (2017) argue that the official producer price index has understated recent improvements
in information technology and develop new hedonic price measures that take account of improvements in the
performance of a given set of tasks valued by users based on tests undertaken by the Standard Performance
Evaluation Corporation. Between 2009 and 2013, for example, while the producer price index for microprocessors
declined annually by just 6 percent, the authors estimate annual declines (i.e., improvements in performance) of 42
percent using their measures based on performance. Byrne and Corrado (2017) estimate that between 2004 and 2014
similar improvements took place in computer servers and storage (26.1 percent annual price declines), PCs (23.7
percent annual price declines), and data networking (12.1 percent annual price declines).

successful these initiatives could provide a much needed boost to economic growth. But these
initiatives are also often motivated by the claim that they will increase blue collar employment
and the evidence in this paper suggests a painful tradeoff. Faster productivity growth generated
by advanced manufacturing technology may lead to more rapid growth, but it is unlikely to be
inclusive.
