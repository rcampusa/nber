                                             ABSTRACT

Some gasoline markets exhibit remarkable price cycles, where price spikes are followed by a string
of small price declines until the next price spike. This pattern is predicted from a model of competition
driven by Edgeworth cycles, as described by Maskin and Tirole. We extend the Maskin and Tirole
model and empirically test its predictions with a new dataset of daily station-level prices in 115 US
cities. One innovation is that we also examine cycling within cities, which allows controls for city
fixed effects. Consistent with the theory, and often in contrast with previous empirical work, we find
that the least and most concentrated markets are much less likely to exhibit cycling behavior; and the
areas with more independent retailers that have convenience stores are more likely to cycle. We also
find that the average gasoline prices are relatively unrelated to cycling behavior.

I. Introduction

       Tremendous variation exists in the pricing strategies chosen by different

businesses and how market prices dynamically evolve in different industries. Although a

long literature in industrial organization identifies different equilibrium pricing strategies,

in many cases the models do not make clear predictions as to why firms might choose

one set of strategies in one competitive environment and choose a different set of

strategies in another competitive environment.

       In this paper, we revisit the study of Edgeworth cycles in retail gasoline markets:

a remarkable pattern in prices over time when price spikes are followed by slow

reductions until the next spike. We extend the theory proposed by Maskin and Tirole

(1988) in two novel ways. First, we allow for loyal consumers who, due to geographic

differentiation, brand loyalty or unobservable preference, do not switch to competitors

offering marginally lower prices. Second, we allow firms to earn profits from goods

complementary to the primary good upon which firms compete. These two additions

provide conditions under which competitors may find it more profitable to adopt cycling

strategies rather than cost-based pricing strategies. We then empirically test the

predictions of the model using a significantly larger dataset than previous studies: daily,

station-level prices for 115 US metropolitan areas. One innovation in the paper is that we

also examine cycling within cycling and non-cycling metropolitan areas, which allows us

to control for fixed characteristics in models estimated at the ZIP code level.

       Maskin and Tirole first specified a dynamic game in which firms played

Edgeworth cycle strategies in equilibrium. The model considers a dynamic Bertrand

game in which two identical competitors sequentially choose from a finite grid of prices.




                                                                                              2
Maskin and Tirole prove that if the discount rate is sufficiently high, an equilibrium

exists in which firms play strategies which generate Edgeworth cycles. In these

equilibria, if the opponent's price is greater than marginal cost, the firm selects the price

that just undercuts her opponent's price. If the opponent was pricing at marginal cost,

with some probability the firm relents, choosing a much higher price and allowing the

cycle of undercutting to begin again. In such an equilibrium, the market clearing price

slowly falls to marginal cost until one firm stochastically relents, which results in a price

spike.

         Several papers empirically document Edgeworth cycles in retail gasoline markets.

Eckert (2003) extends the model proposed by Maskin and Tirole by introducing

heterogeneity in the market participants. Unlike the Maskin and Tirole model in which

firms split the market if they chose identical prices, Eckert considers the case in which

one firm obtains greater than half of the market when both firms choose identical prices.

Although cycle equilibria exist for all splits of the market, Eckert proves that as one

firm's proportion of demand when identical prices are chosen rises, the firm has a greater

incentive to match rather than undercut her competitor's prices. As a result, the speed at

which prices fall, and the length of the undercutting phase, are negatively related to the

asymmetry between the two participants.4 Eckert analyzes city-level prices for 19

Canadian cities and finds that market penetration of independent gasoline retailers is

negatively correlated with price rigidity, consistent with the results from his theoretical

model.




4
 Eckert also shows that constant price equilibrium, which we do not consider in this paper, only exists
when firms are of relatively similar sizes.


                                                                                                          3
       Drawing on the theoretical results of Eckert, Noel (2007a) applies a Markov

switching regression to estimate the length of the undercutting and relenting phases as

well as the transition probabilities. Using ten years of weekly, city-level data for 19

Canadian cities, Noel finds that as independent retail station market share increases, more

markets exhibit cycling behavior, a result that supports the predictions of Eckert's model.

Lewis (2008) finds that prices fell more quickly in Edgeworth cycle markets than in non-

cycling markets following the Hurricane Rita price spike. In addition, he finds a similar

relationship between independent retailer penetration and price cycling as Noel (2007a),

using city-level data for 83 US cities.

       A second set of papers examine the characteristics of Edgeworth cycles using

station-level data within particular markets. For example, Noel (2007b) estimates cycle

attributes using semi-daily data on 22 retail gasoline stations in Toronto, Canada and

Atkinson (2008) examines hourly data for 27 retail gasoline stations in Guelph, Canada.

Both Noel and Atkinson study the behavior of participants in price cycles and examine

which firms in each market are most likely to relent at the bottom of the cycle. They tend

to find that larger firms are more likely to initiate the relenting phase, whereas smaller

firms are more likely to undercut.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 offers the

extensions to the Maskin and Tirole model of Edgeworth cycles; section 3 describes the

data; section 4 reports the empirical models and results; and section 5 concludes.



II. Model




                                                                                             4
          Consider a dynamic game in which N firms sequentially choose from a discrete

set of possible prices. We define pit as firm i's choice of price at time t, p-it as the vector of

prices of firm i's competitors, and pt as the vector of all firm prices at time t. Following

Maskin and Tirole, we focus on Markov perfect equilibria to the game, given by a set of

N reaction functions, {Ri(p-it)}. For each vector of opponent's prices, Ri(p-it) maximizes

firm i's expected current and future profits assuming all firms continue to play

their reaction functions. We specify firm i's profits in period t as

          Π it = ( pit − ci )[α i + β i ( pt )]q( p it ) + γ i [α i + β i ( pt )]   (1)

          The first term in the profit function corresponds to sales of the primary good for

which firm i sets price pit. The second term corresponds to additional profits accrued

from the proportion of consumers who purchase from firm i through sales of secondary

goods. In the context of retail gasoline stations, the first term corresponds to purchases of

gasoline, and the second term corresponds to purchases of other goods and services

offered by an affiliated convenience store or service station. Implicitly, we assume that

firms attract customers on the basis of the posted price of the primary good (gasoline),

and in some cases, may accrued additional profits from the secondary good (c-store

sales).

          In our model, we distinguish two types of consumers. We let αi denote the

proportion of consumers “loyal” to firm i, who always purchase from firm i regardless of

the price firm i chooses to set. We do not distinguish whether a consumer is “loyal” as a

result of brand loyalty, geographic proximity or some unobservable preference. We treat

each source of loyalty as equivalent in our model, although in the empirical section, we

distinguish between loyalty arising from a preference for branded gasoline and loyalty



                                                                                                5
arising from geographic differentiation. βi(pt) denotes the proportion of consumers who

will switch firms in response to the relative prices offered by the firms. We assume,

without loss of generality, that all consumers are either loyal to a single firm or switch

firms depending on the relative prices – that is, for all vectors pt,         ∑αi
                                                                                    i   + β i ( pt ) = 1 . By


definition, we assume that if firm i has the highest price of the N firms, βi(pt)=0.

Furthermore, we define β i as the value when firm i has the lowest price of the N firms:

the highest value βi(pt) can take. Finally, we let pi* denote the price that maximizes

profits from loyal consumers. This framework is a significant generalization of that used

in the previous literature. Maskin and Tirole consider a duopoly in which αi =0, γi =0,

βi(pi,pj) is equal to either zero, one-half or one depending on whether pi is greater than,

equal to or less than pj. Eckert allows an asymmetric split of the market when firms

choose identical prices. Following Maskin and Tirole, we use Vit(p-it) to denote firm i 's

expected profits when it is about to choose prices and firms play Markov perfect

equilibrium strategies {R1(p-1t), R2(p-2t),…, RN(p-Nt)} thereafter.5 For notational

convenience, let Vitα ( p −it ) and Vitβ ( p −it ) denote the expected profits from gasoline sold to

loyal customers and to firm-switching customers when the firm i plays Ri(p-it). Let

Witα ( p −it ) and Witβ ( p −it ) denote the expected c-store or service station profits when the

firm i plays Ri(p-it).

           We begin by characterizing the relationship between parameters αi, βi, and γi, and

the expected profits earned by cycling and non-cycling firms. We prove that as the share

of “loyal” customers rises, the expected profits from playing a constant price strategy rise


5
    Multiple Markov perfect equilibria (MPE) may exist - the value function depends on the particular MPE.


                                                                                                                6
more quickly than the expected profits from playing a cycling strategy. Furthermore, if

αi is sufficiently high relative to β i , we prove that playing pi* strictly dominates all

strategies exhibiting cycling behavior. Second, we show that as γi increases, a firm will

be more willing to play a strategy exhibiting cycling behavior. For brevity, we include

proposition proofs in the appendix.



Proposition 1: Let {R1(p-1t), R2(p-2t),…, RN(p-Nt)} be a set of reaction functions

exhibiting cycling behavior. As αi increases, the expected profits earned by firm i by

playing strategy Ri(p-it) increase less quickly than the expected profits associated with

always playing pi*.



Corollary 2: There exist values of αi and β i such that firm i would prefer to always

play pi* rather than play Ri(p-it).



        As the share of “loyal” customers rises, the profits associated with playing the

constant price strategy, pi*, rise more quickly than the profits associated with playing any

cycling strategy. Corollary 2 proves that if a firm has a sufficiently high proportion of

loyal customers, choosing the optimal static price for the loyal customers will dominate

any cycling strategy. Thus, if a dominant firm in a market enjoys a sufficiently great

geographic or brand advantage over a smaller rival, the larger firm may find that pricing

to maximize profits from “loyal” customers strictly dominates any strategy involving

cycling, and the smaller firm would then capture the majority of the firm-switching

customers. Our finding, that a dominant firm with a substantial number of “loyal”


                                                                                             7
customers may be reluctant to participate in cycles, contrasts with the theoretical results

in Eckert (2003). He finds that if the dominant firm earns a sufficiently large split of the

market when firm prices are identical, but does not enjoy any customer loyalty, the only

MPE is one exhibiting cycling behavior. .



Proposition 3: Let {R1(p-1t), R2(p-2t),…, RN(p-Nt)} be a set of reaction functions

exhibiting cycling behavior. As γi increases, the expected profits associated with playing

a strategy exhibiting cycling behavior increase more quickly than the expected profits

associated with always playing pi*.



         Firm willingness to play a cycling strategy rather than pi* depends on whether the

profits gained by attracting firm-switching customers exceed the profits lost from

suboptimally pricing to loyal customers.

         The Propositions provide several predictions about the characteristics of cycling

and non-cycling firms.6 Although Propositions 1 and 3 do not necessarily imply a

monotonic relationships between cycling propensity, the proportion of “loyal” customers

(αi), and profits accrued through the sales of the secondary good (γi), the results do

suggest that potential benefits to cycling are less pronounced for firms enjoying

geographic differentiation or brand loyalty or for firms deriving little profit from the

secondary good. In addition, Proposition 1 suggests that firms for which loyal customers

are a large proportion of demand are more likely to prefer a constant price to a strategy




6
 Although, in this paper we focus on cycling behavior, the proposition holds for any alternative reaction
function chosen by firm i.


                                                                                                            8
involving cycling.7 In the context of retail gasoline stations, we would expect that retail

stations with substantial brand loyalty or substantial geographic advantage would be less

likely to choose a strategy involving cycling. If brand loyalty is greater for branded

stations than independents, independents with substantial market presence may be more

willing to choose strategies exhibiting cycling behavior than comparably-sized branded

firms. Moreover, if branded stations compete for a subset of consumers, we expect that

markets with more than one branded station are more likely to participate in cycling

behavior. Finally, if proximity to other retail stations erodes a station’s ability to extract

a geographic rent from “loyal” customers, retailers in high station-density locations may

be more likely to participate in cycles than retailers in locations with relatively few

stations.8

         Proposition 3 predicts that retailers deriving profits from goods other than the

good whose price attracts customers to a particular location would be more likely to use a

strategy involving cycling. In particular, in the context of retail gasoline, we would

expect that retail stations with convenience stores would be more likely to participate in

cycling behavior than retail stations without c-stores.

         The previous propositions also suggest how the characteristics of the cycles might

be related to observable firm characteristics. Specifically, a firm might be willing to play

some but not all strategies exhibiting cycling behavior. Conditional on playing a

cycling strategy, we would expect firms with a greater proportion of loyal customers to



7
  In a two firm market, a competitor of a non-cycling firm would undercut the price of the non-cycling firm.
With more than two firms, though, the proposition does not rule out cycling behavior on the part of a subset
of market participants. With N>2, equilibria may exist in which firms with few loyal customers choose
cycling strategies while firms with more loyal customers choose strategies in which they play pi*.
8
  Noel (2007) intuits this relationship and finds evidence consistent with station density increasing the
likelihood of behavior consistent with Edgeworth cycles.


                                                                                                          9
be less likely to play higher-amplitude cycling strategies, in which a firm cuts price

significantly below pi* during the undercutting phase and sets substantially above pi*

when relenting. Higher amplitude strategies price less optimally for the loyal customers.

– thus, as the proportion of loyal customers increases, the lost-profit associated with

suboptimal pricing to loyal customers is more likely to outweigh the profit gained

through competing for the firm-switching customers. Furthermore, if a firm with a large

proportion of loyal customers participates in a cycling equilibrium with a firm that has a

smaller proportion of loyal customers, the former may be more likely to relent when

prices are low.

       Our model’s predictions of cycle characteristics such as its amplitude are

consistent with empirical observations in Noel (2007a), which were unpredicted by

Eckert (2003). In markets with a large independent presence (markets in which βi tends

to be larger relative to αi), Noel finds that market cycles have greater amplitude. In

addition, he finds evidence that brand-name firms, which plausibly have a higher

proportion of loyal customers, are more likely to relent at the bottom of a price cycle.



Empirical Predictions

       Since we examine average prices at the MSA and ZIP code levels, we translate

our predictions about station-level behavior up to what we expect to see at higher levels

of aggregation. Based on our model predictions, we first predict that areas with

independent stations and, especially independent stations with convenience stores, would

be most likely to exhibit cycling behavior. If customers have a preference for branded

gasoline, we also expect that cycling behavior would be more prominent in areas with



                                                                                           10
more than one branded station. A branded station may be less likely to suboptimally

price to consumers idiosyncratically preferring branded gasoline, absent a nearby branded

competitor.

         Cycles at the city level would reflect coordination over a large number of stations.

We anticipate that this will be more likely in concentrated markets. In addition, as

concentration rises, branded firms may have less incentive to participate in cycles with

small market share independents. This suggests a relationship between concentration and

observable cycling behavior where the least and most concentrated markets are less likely

to cycle.



III. Data Description

         The empirical analysis uses a dataset of daily gasoline prices across 115

metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the Midwest and Northeast U.S. from April 1,

2000 to March 31, 2001.9 These data were collected at the station level by the Wright

Express Financial Services Corporation, a leading provider of payment processing and

financial services to commercial and government car, van and truck fleets in the United

States. Their Oil Price Information Service (OPIS) provides pricing information to the

industry and transportation companies.

         In addition to the retail price, OPIS data include a measure of each station’s

wholesale price. This is a rack price—the price at the terminal—from the nearest



9
 Metropolitan areas include an urban core with a population of at least 50,000, as well as surrounding
counties tied economically through driving patterns—a definition well suited to studying gasoline markets.
The data include stations in the Midwest, where there was a large price spike in the Spring of 2000, as well
as eastern states as a comparison, including Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,
Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Washington, DC.


                                                                                                         11
refinery that produces the regulatory formulation of gasoline used by the station. These

regional prices also vary by brand of gasoline, and the data include these brand-specific

wholesale prices. This wholesale price may differ from the internal transfer price paid by

refiner-owned stations. It may also differ from the station’s actual wholesale price in that

it does not include volume discounts or delivery charges.10

         The OPIS data also include the street address of the station. US Census of

Population data at the ZIP code level in 2000 were matched to the stations, including

median household income, population, and commuting behavior. Race and educational

attainment measures were also collected. In addition, the 2000 US Census ZIP Code

Business Patterns database records the number of gasoline stations in each ZIP code.

         One advantage of the OPIS data is that measurement error should be minimized,

as the prices are recorded electronically from their clients’ charge cards.11 A cost of

using credit card transactions is that they are only available for stations visited by a card

holder, which results in missing data especially on weekends. Over 33,000 stations are

found at least once over the year in our data, and theses stations provide a fairly accurate

measure of brand coverage in a city. When comparing stations in the pricing survey and

those in the Census Business Patterns data at the MSA level, then average number of

stations is 262 and 274, respectively. At a smaller scale, the median ZIP code had three

quarters of the stations surveyed.12


10
   Volume discounts are common for branded gasoline at the wholesale level. Estimates with and without
controls for wholesale price are discussed below.
11
   Further information on the methodology is available in Doyle and Samphantharak (2008) and at
http://opisnet.com/methodology.asp
12
   To explore the types of ZIP codes that have better coverage in the pricing sample, the ZIP code count of
the number of stations in the sample was regressed on the observable characteristics in Table 1. The main
result is that more populous ZIP codes are associated with more station surveyed, controlling for the
number of stations in the Census data.


                                                                                                         12
        Edgeworth cycles are characterized by gradual downward price movements, as

firms marginally undercut competitors’ prices, followed by a price spike. To empirically

categorize geographic areas as cycling versus non-cycling, the median daily change in the

retail price is considered, as in Lewis (2007). In particular, the daily change in retail

price was calculated for each station with at least two consecutive days of data, and then

the median of this daily price change at the MSA or ZIP code level was calculated. In

cycling markets, we would expect the median price change to be negative, reflecting the

greater number of days of falling prices as opposed to the sudden jump in price in the

relenting phase. To ensure that the changes represent movements of a common set of

stations, only stations that were present for at least 200 days over the year were included

in these calculations, although the results were similar when all of the information was

used.

        In practice, we found that OPIS data can characterize cycling behavior at the

MSA and ZIP code levels, but they are not precise enough to characterize cycling at the

station level. Furthermore, even in locations where cycling exists, it is difficult to

observe which station relents at the bottom of the cycle, as the change likely happens at a

higher frequency than our daily data can capture. Rather than estimate cycling behavior

at the station-level, we aggregate up to the MSA and ZIP code levels.

        The two main measures of market structure are the fraction of stations that are

independent and measures of the brand concentration in the market. Independent stations

are not affiliated with a particular oil refiner, and they were identified in our sample by

investigating the brand name. The Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of

America (SIGMA) publishes its member list, which provides one measure of whether the




                                                                                              13
brand was independent, and the remaining brands were investigated individually. We

further categorized independents based on the proportion of their retail outlets with an

attached convenience store, as reported in trade press, websites and regulatory filings. Of

the 45 independent brands observed in our data, twenty-six brands operate convenience

stores at more than half of their retail outlets.

        In terms of the brands, one feature of gasoline markets is that some stations may

be owned by the refiner, while others are franchises. Unfortunately, the data do not allow

us to separate these two groups. Further, when we characterize brand shares, no quantity

data are available at the daily level. Instead, the fraction of stations in our sample of a

particular brand is used in calculating the 3-brand concentration ratio and the brand HHI.

Again, the station concentration of each brand appears fairly accurately measured, as the

number of stations ever surveyed in each area is similar to Census measures.



IV. Empirical Models and Results

A. Edgeworth Cycles across Cities

        As mentioned, we calculate the median daily price change for each of our

geographic areas following Lewis (2008) and for ease of interpretation, we apply a cutoff

below which an area is classified as exhibiting cycling behavior. As a first look, we

ranked the MSAs in our sample by their median daily changes of average retail price.

Figure 1 shows the average retail and wholesale price over time in 4 cities: the city with

the smallest (i.e. largest negative) median change in retail price (Toledo, OH: median

change equal to $-0.0124), a city near the median of the daily price change distribution

(Detroit, MI: $-0.0014), and two cities city near the top of the ranking (Lincoln, NE, and




                                                                                              14
Johnstown, PA). In the top 3 graphs, a large price spike in the Spring of 2001 common to

stations in the Midwest dominates the first few months of the series. This spike was

partially due to a mandated reformulation and subsequent shortages (for more detail, see

Doyle and Samphantharak, 2008). Later in the summer and the rest of the year, some of

the cities in the Midwest reveal small decreases in price followed by sudden increases.

For Toledo, Detroit, and Lincoln, the wholesale price movements are nearly identical, but

the Toledo market has what appear to be Edgeworth cycles and the other two do not.

Johnstown does not have the spike in April 2000, nor does it exhibit cycling behavior. It

appears that the median price change measure reveals which cities tend to cycle. In

particular, cities with a median price decline of -0.005 or more appear to exhibit cycling

behavior, and this cutoff will be used in the analysis to compare cycling and non-cycling

cities.13

        Table 1 compares the characteristics of the 20 cycling MSAs with the 95 non-

cycling MSAs in our sample The first row shows that this price change in the cycling

MSAs is negative—a median decline of 0.8 cents per day—whereas non-cycling MSAs

show median price change close to zero. The average retail and wholesale prices are

similar across the two groups, with retail prices during this time period close to $1.50 per

gallon. Much of the difference between retail and wholesale price is comprised of the

state and federal taxes on gasoline.

        In terms of the fraction independent and brand HHI, the cycling and non-cycling

cities feature similar measures. This similarity masks a nonlinearity in the data that the

most (and least) concentrated markets are less likely to feature cycling. The fraction of

                                                                                                     15
stations that are independent with convenience store operations does appear positively

related to cycling in the raw means, with these types of stations making up 15% of

cycling-city stations and only 9% of stations in non-cycling cities.

       When US Census characteristics are considered, non-cycling MSAs include the

largest cities and have higher average population density levels (1600 per square mile vs.

1400). Cycling cities also have more stations on average (271 vs. 255). The median

household income is slightly higher in the average cycling city as well ($41,400 vs.

$40,600).

       Among the employed population, commuting patterns are similar across the two

groups. Most workers drive to work alone, with slightly higher rates in cycling cities (83

vs. 80%). Meanwhile, the cities are similar in terms of racial composition. Among

adults over the age of 25, the high school dropout rates are the same on average across

the two groups. The percent with college education is higher in the non-cycling MSAs

(23% vs. 21%). Overall, the cycling and non-cycling MSAs appear similar, with the non-

cycling MSAs including the largest cities.



Cycling & Brand Concentration

       In the model, the price elasticity of customers varies by firm, with some firms

enjoying more brand loyalty or geographic advantage than others. One way that we

characterize the potential for brand loyalty is by comparing independent stations with the

refiner-affiliated brands such as Exxon or Citgo that invest more heavily in brand

identification. Further, the model suggests that in markets that are highly concentrated

the top firms will have less incentive to enter the cycle, and in highly competitive




                                                                                           16
markets, the tacit collusion necessary to support cycling may break down. As a first look

at these implications, Table 2 compares the cycling behavior across MSAs that vary by

their fraction of stations that are independent or their brand concentration levels.

       Panel A groups MSAs into quartiles based on the fraction of independent stations.

The bottom quartile has 4% of stations that are independent on average, whereas the top

quartile averages 35% of stations that are not affiliated with an oil refiner. The

relationship between the fraction independent and cycling behavior has a marked invese-

U shape: 31% of cities in the middle two quartiles exhibiting cycling, whereas few cities

in the bottom or top quartile are found to cycle. This result is in contrast with the

previous evidence that compared 19 cities in Canada and found that more independent

stations were associated with a higher likelihood of cycling behavior (Noel, 2007a).

       Panel B shows that a greater proportion of stations that are independent does

appear to be related to cycling when those independents are also convenience store

operators. The bottom two quartiles of cities here do not exhibit cycling at all. For the

top two quartiles of cities based on the fraction of independent stations with convenience

store operations, 41% and 29% are found to cycle, respectively.

       As the fraction of independent stations grows, this may represent a more

competitive market. To investigate the relationship between concentration and cycling

directly, Figure 2 considers the 1-brand concentration ratio and the 3-brand concentration

ratio. Local-linear regression estimates of the cycling indicator on these concentration

measures are reported. As the largest brand gets larger, the likelihood of cycling in the

city decreases. This is consistent with a reduced incentive by a dominant firm to engage

in an Edgeworth cycle. 3-brand concentration ratio shows a distinctive inverse-U shape




                                                                                            17
with regard to cycling. It appears that cycling is much less likely in cities with either a

high or low level of concentration.

         Panel C of Table 2 further explores this relationship between concentration levels

and cycling in terms of HHI measured using the share of stations in the area (similar

results are found when the 3-brand concentration ratio is used instead). 14% of the

markets in the least concentrated MSAs and 11% of the most concentrated MSAs can be

categorized as cycling, compared to 31% in the 3rd quartile.14 These measures could be

related to the fraction of independent stations to the extent that large independent brands

are driving both measures. In practice, more independent stations are associated with less

concentrated markets.15

         These raw comparisons do not take into account differences between the MSAs.

Table 1 showed that cycling and non-cycling MSAs are similar, but the relationship

between cycling and concentration may be affected by the demand characteristics in the

area. To test the relationship between cycling behavior and the fraction of independent

stations or brand concentration, controlling for the demographic characteristics of the

MSAs, the following model is estimated for MSA m:

                Ym = γ 0 + γ 1 I m + γ 2 H m + γ 3 X m + ε m                            (2)

where Ym is a measure of the cycling behavior of the MSA, either the cycling indicator or

the median daily change in the retail price; Im measures the fraction of independent

stations in the MSA; Hm is a vector of indicator variables equal to one if the MSA is in a

particular quartile of the HHI distribution and zero otherwise; Xm is a vector of the


14
   Similarly, the 3 brand concentration ratio (not shown) increases from 0.27, 0.49, 0.57, and 0.70 from the
bottom to the top quartile, and the fraction of cities that cycle in each quartile is 13%, 18%, 29%, and 11%.
15
   Pair-wise correlations between the fraction of independent stations vs. HHI and between the fraction of
independent stations vs. the top 3 brand concentration are -0.14 and -0.27, respectively.


                                                                                                          18
MSA’s characteristics described in Table 1, including the demographic controls and the

median change in the wholesale price. The model is estimated with OLS to compare

conditional means, although the results for are similar when probit models are used to

estimate the model when the dependent variable is the cycle indicator.

        Panel A of Table 3 reports the results when the indicator for cycling is the

dependent variable, and Panel B reports the results for the median change in daily

prices—the measure used to define the cycling indicator. This measure allows all of the

information in the daily change to be used in estimating the relationships, although the

relationships are similar in both Tables.

        Column (1) shows a lack of a linear relationship between the fraction of stations

that are independent in a city and cycling behavior, whereas Column (2) shows that the

greater the proportion of stations that are independent with significant convenience store

operations increases, so does the likelihood of cycling. To consider the nonlinearity

shown in Table 2, Column (3) reports estimates from a model that includes indicators for

the quartiles of the fraction of stations that are independent. Here, the bottom quartile is

less likely to cycle compared to the top quartile, although the difference is not statistically

significant. As in Table 2, the middle two quartiles are where cycling behavior is found

most likely to occur. Column (4) shows that across cities that vary by their fraction of

stations that are independent with significant convenience store operations, the top two

quartiles are much more likely to cycle.16

        Columns (5) shows that the areas most likely to cycle are those where the

concentration measure is in the 3rd quartile, confirming the unconditional results shown in


16
  These results were robust to categorizing stations as independent if they were SIGMA members, as
opposed to the measure in the main results which involved investigating each brand name.


                                                                                                     19
Table 2. Columns (6) and (7) include both the fraction independent measures and the

HHI quartile indicators, and both results are robust. In particular, the 3rd quartile in terms

of brand HHI is associated with a 22-25 percentage-point higher likelihood of cycling

compared to the most concentrated MSAs (s.e. = 0.11). With 17% of cities found to

cycle, this is a large difference.

        In terms of the control variables, the demographic characteristics of the cities are

largely unrelated to cycling behavior (see Appendix). In particular, median daily changes

in our wholesale price measure are unrelated to cycling. The greater proportion of

workers who drive to work alone is (weakly) positively related to cycling behavior.

        These results suggest that cycling behavior is less likely to occur in the most

competitive markets with the most independent stations—a situation when coordination

may be infeasible. Further, in the most concentrated markets, it may not be in the interest

of the dominant firms to enter the cycle. Rather, it is in the markets where the top 3

brands represent 50-60% of the market where we are seeing the cycling behavior most

pronounced.



Price Effects

        One question that arises is whether cycles result in lower or higher average prices.

A complication is that cycling is related to the competitive nature of the market, which is

predicted to affect prices as well. To consider the relationship between cycling and

prices, controlling for market concentration, the following model is estimated for market

m:

          Pm = γ 0 + γ 1C m + γ 2 I m + γ 3 H m + γ 4 X m + ε m                  (3)



                                                                                           20
where Pm is the average retail price in the city, Cm is a cycling indicator, I and H are

measures of the market structure as above, and X is a vector of controls including the

average wholesale price in the market.

       The results are reported in Table 4, and cycling is weakly related to lower prices.

A cycling city is found to have lower prices by 1 to 2 cents per gallon on average

(s.e.=0.01). It appears that the cycling cities have cycles that spend roughly equal time

above and below the price levels in non-cycling cities.

       Controlling for cycling behavior, the fraction of independent stations is associated

with higher prices in the area, whereas the fraction of independent stations with c-store

operations is associated with lower prices. Meanwhile, HHI in the area is associated with

higher prices: cities in top quartile in terms of brand concentration have prices that

average approximately 5 cents per gallon. This result is robust to controls, with income

level and wholesale price positively related to the retail price (see Appendix). With

markups generally on the order of 5 cents per gallon in the Midwest (Brannon, 2003),

such a difference appears economically significant.



B. Edgeworth Cycles Within Cities

       The “rockets and feathers” pattern of prices at the city-level suggests that

competition is at the city level as well. Otherwise, if stations competed in this way across

the street from one another and had different cycle frequencies, it would be difficult to

detect the cycles at the city level. Instead, we find the jump in prices occurs on the same

dates across cities. Given that MSAs are defined by commuting patterns, pricing

pressure is likely transmitted across the MSA. The original Maskin and Tirole model




                                                                                            21
evokes images of gasoline stations competing on a street corner, however, and we

investigate whether cycling can be characterized at a smaller unit of analysis: the ZIP

code level.

         An advantage of investigating cycling behavior within cities is that we can control

for fixed characteristics of MSAs that are difficult to control but may be related to both

cycling behavior and market concentration, such as the regulatory environment. The

fixed effects also control for regional factors, as cycling is found in the Midwest and not

in the Northeast of the U.S. That said, store locations are chosen with future competition

in mind, and convenience store operators, for example, may select areas within cities that

are more prone to cycling behavior for reasons other than their pricing strategies.

         To consider the source of Edgeworth cycles within and across cities, we

compared 5900 ZIP codes to describe the determinants of cycling at a smaller unit of

analysis. To identify ZIP codes that cycle there are two data issues. First, the ZIP code

data are more likely to suffer from missing data problems compared to measures of prices

at the city level. The main results include all of the ZIP codes in the data, but results are

similar when the data are restricted to ZIP codes with observations in at least 200 days

out of the year. Second, it is useful for ease of interpretation to categorize ZIP codes as

cycling or non-cycling, and we visually inspected the data to arrive at a median change in

retail price cutoff of -0.002.17 Again, the results are similar when we use the median

change in retail price itself rather than the dichotomous indicator for cycling, as well as

when the cutoff remained -0.005.

         The empirical models for ZIP code z in MSA m take the following form:

17
  The city analysis used a cutoff of -0.005. Appendix Figures A2A and A2B show the time series of retail
and wholesale prices for all ZIP codes that are categorized as cycling vs. those that are categorized as not
cycling using the -0.002 cutoff.


                                                                                                         22
                  Y z = γ 0 + γ 1W z + γ 2 X z + δ m ( z ) + ε z                 (4)

where Y is an indicator for cycling behavior or average price in the ZIP code and W is a

characteristic of the ZIP code of interest from the theoretical model, such as the presence

of an independent station with a convenience store or the presence of dominant firm. The

results are shown with and without controls for ZIP Code characteristics taken from the

US Census of Population in 2000, X, and with and without MSA fixed effects. The

models reported are estimated using OLS, although nearly identical results are found with

probit models. For comparability with the earlier results and the dependence of pricing

within a larger MSA market, the standard errors are clustered at the MSA level.

       Table 5 reports the results for cycling behavior at the ZIP code level. Panel A

considers the presence of an independent station (either with or without major

convenience store operations), with the excluded category ZIP codes with no independent

stations. 38% of ZIP codes have an independent gasoline station, and 21% have a

convenience-store independent. Column (1) includes no control variables and the

presence of an independent gasoline station with significant convenience store operations

is a large predictor of cycling in the ZIP code. Compared to a mean of 13%, the presence

of at least one such station is associated with a 31 percentage point increase in the

likelihood of cycling (38% of ZIP codes with a convenience-store independent are found

to cycle compared to 6.5% of ZIP codes with no such station), and the result is robust to

the addition of controls. The presence of an independent without convenience store

operations is negatively related to cycling, although this result is less robust to the

inclusion of MSA fixed effects. Columns (3) and (4) report models with MSA fixed

effects, and the estimates are identified from differences in the independent store



                                                                                          23
locations within an MSA. The convenience-store results are generally similar when we

compare ZIP code cycling within cities.

        Column (4) restricts the analysis to within city comparisons of ZIP code cycling,

conditional on the MSA cycling as defined earlier. We find that 42% of the stations in

our cycling cities are in ZIP codes that are also found to cycle. Again, having an

independent with convenience-store operations in the ZIP code is positively related to

ZIP code cycling within the city, with a similar coefficient of 0.31, but compared to a

different baseline of 43%. Independent stations without a convenience store are also

positively related to ZIP code cycling (coefficient of 0.12). In terms of covariates, the

median change in wholesale prices is not related to cycling, consistent with cycling being

a retail market phenomenon (see Appendix). Taken together, it appears that

convenience-store independents are associated with an increased likelihood that a city

cycles, and once a city cycles any independent station is associated with aggressive

pricing strategies.

        Section 2 suggested that there should be a nonlinear relationship between brand

concentration and cycling, and this was found for the cross-city comparisons in Table 3.

Panel B of Table 5 further investigates this relationship by considering whether having

only one “top brand” in the ZIP code reduces the likelihood of cycling compared to

having two top brands. “Top brands” are defined as the two brands with the highest

station shares in the city. If only one top player is in the ZIP code, it may have a higher

fraction of loyal consumers who live or work nearby and they may eschew the costs of

engaging in Bertrand-style price movements. The results in Panel B report estimates

from models similar to Panel A, but with indicators that one or both of the top 2 brands in




                                                                                            24
the city are in the ZIP code, with the excluded category ZIP codes with neither of the top

2 brands. The results show that having both of the top 2 brands is a much stronger

positive relationship with cycling than having just one, consistent with the notion that it

takes at least two to play the game. This result is robust to controls, including MSA fixed

effects.18 These results provide compelling evidence that the observed cycles are indeed

a product of competitive forces among large players, as opposed to some (unobserved)

mechanical process that leads to price spikes.

         The last set of results replicates the retail price results and are shown in Table 6.19

As in Table 4, cycling is associated with modest reductions in price (between 1 and 3

cents on average, compared to an average gas price at the time of $1.52). It appears that

cycling results in prices that are more volatile, but are similar to non-cycling cities on

average. Meanwhile, the presence of an independent gasoline station in the ZIP code, or

a top brand, is relatively unrelated to the average price in the ZIP code.



Limitations

         The MSA results are cross-sectional relationships with the usual caveats that areas

with cycling behavior may simply differ compared to areas without cycling behavior.

The observable characteristics look similar across the groups, however, with the

exception that the largest cities do not appear to cycle. Results are similar when cities of




18
   Other measures of brand overlap in a city were considered. Similar results are found when more than the
top 2 brands are considered, with the presence of only one of the top 3 or 5 brands being associated with
significantly less cycling behavior. Cycling by brand was also considered, although missing data
limitations make this type of comparison less compelling.
19
   The number of observations is slightly different in Table 6 compared to Table 5 due to missing data for
the change in wholesale price in the set of controls used in Table 5. Results are nearly identical when this
variable is excluded and the same sample is used for both Tables.


                                                                                                         25
greater than 2 million populations are excluded. Also, the results are similar when MSA

fixed effects are included.

        Second, the data are limited by the frequency of missing observations, especially

for weekends. Aggregate city level data should categorize cities that cycle versus those

that do not. In addition, the results are similar when the sample is limited to stations that

are frequently seen in the data. In addition, it appears that our sample has sufficient

coverage over the course of the year to characterize brand concentration.

        Another limitation is the lack of quantity data results in measures of concentration

at the station-share level rather than the usual market share for each brand. To the extent

that station shares reflect some minimum quantity before a franchise is allowed to open,

it seems likely that such station shares are sufficiently highly correlated with quantity

shares to serve as a reliable proxy for HHI. In any event, the station shares provide

slightly different measure of concentration, but one that reflects geographic coverage of

the brands.

        Last, the cycling behavior is found in the Midwest, largely in Ohio, Michigan,

Indiana, and Illinois. The shape of the relationships described in the larger sample is

robust to limiting the sample to stations only in the Midwest, and we find that the cities in

the eastern U.S. provide a useful comparison group.20



V. Conclusion

        Retail gasoline markets are unique in that the price for the product is broadcast for

all to see, including competitors. This facilitates price competition, and a striking feature


20
 In our sample, Midwest states are Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,
Nebraska, Ohio, and Wisconsin.


                                                                                                     26
of these markets is that some exhibit what appear to be Edgeworth cycles. A refinement

to the Maskin-Tirole model that allows firms to retain some customers even when they

are underbid suggests that markets with dominant firms may not have the incentive to

enter such a cycle. Further, a necessary condition for such tacit collusion is that the firms

have some market power, and the least concentrated markets may not be able to support

such cycles either.

       The empirical results use a dataset of daily prices across 115 cities to describe the

types of cities that exhibit cycling behavior. 17% of cities in our sample have price

cycles. In contrast to previous evidence, cities with more independent stations are found

less likely to cycle. When independent stations with significant convenience store

operations are considered, however, a greater proportion of such stations is related to

cycling. This relationship with convenience-store independents and cycling behavior is

found within cities as well, with ZIP codes with such stores much more likely to have

cycling. Given the complementary goods and the price salience of the gasoline price,

these stations may have an incentive to engage in price reductions that can lead to the

cycling behavior.

       It appears that the main observable characteristics that characterize which

Midwestern cities exhibit Edgeworth cycles is the extent to which the market is

concentrated: the least and most concentrated cities are less likely to cycle. Meanwhile,

cycling behavior is not found to result in higher or lower retail prices. These results are

found controlling for city characteristics such as income levels, commuting patterns,

changes in wholesale prices, as well as models that included MSA fixed effects and

identified the relationships across ZIP codes in the same city.

               ⎡∞                              ⎤
            ∂E ⎢∑ δ t ( pi* − ci )α i q ( pi* )⎥      α
               ⎣t =0                           ⎦ > ∂Vit ( p− it ) .                                       (2)
                         ∂α i                         ∂α i

Thus, a change in the share of loyal customers increases the profits associated with

playing pi* more than the profits associated with playing Ri(p-it).



Corollary 2 Proof: Let Ri(p-it) be a reaction function exhibiting cycling behavior and

consider a deviation from Ri(p-it) to a strategy in which the firm always plays pi*. Let

Vitα ( p − it ) and Vitβ ( p −it ) denote the expected profits from loyal customers and firm-

switchers when firm i plays Ri(p-it).21 Define p̂i as the constant price which provides the

firm the same expected profits from loyal customers as the cycling equilibrium22. By

definition, p̂i solves

              ⎡∞                               ⎤
            E ⎢∑ δ t ( pˆ i − ci )α i q( pˆ i )⎥ = Vitα ( p −it )                                         (3)
              ⎣ t =0                           ⎦

A firm will prefer to play pi* to Ri(p-it) if and only if

              ⎡∞                                                    ⎤
            E ⎢∑ δ t ( pi* − ci )[α i + β i ( pi* , p −it )]q( pi* )⎥ ≥ Vitα ( p −it ) + Vitβ ( p −it )   (4)
              ⎣ t =0                                                ⎦


21
     For expositional purposes, we assume that γi=0 – we find an identical result allowing γi>0.
22
     Note that p̂i is a function of both the vector of reaction functions as well as the vector of starting prices.


                                                                                                                29
Consider αi, β i ∈ (0,1) satisfying

         β i ( pi* − ci )q( pi* ) − ( pˆ i − ci )q( pˆ i )
            =                                                                                                   (5)
         αi              ( pˆ i − ci )q( pˆ i )

Rearranging (4), we have

          ∞                                     ∞                              ∞

         ∑ δ t ( pi* − ci )α i q( pi* ) = ∑ δ t ( pˆ i − ci )α i q( pˆ i ) + ∑ δ t ( pˆ i − ci )β i q( pˆ i )
         t =0                                  t =0                           t =0
                                                                                                                (6)


         The left hand side of (6) is the expected profits earned from loyal consumers by a

firm playing pi* in all periods. The first term on the right hand side is equal to Vitα ( p −it )

and the second term in the right hand side is strictly greater than Vitβ ( p −it ) by definition

of β i . Thus, values of αi, β i satisfy condition (5) implying that firm i prefers to play pi*

to Ri(p-it).



Proposition 3 Proof: Consider a firm choosing between Ri(p-it) and pi*. By definition,

the derivative of profits associated with playing pi* and Ri(p-it) with respect to γi are

respectively,

           ⎡∞                                    ⎤
         E ⎢ ∑ δ t (α i + β i ( p i* , p − it )) ⎥                                           (7)
           ⎣ t =0                                ⎦

         ∂Witα ( p −it ) ∂Witβ ( p −it )
                        +                                                                    (8)
            ∂γ i            ∂γ i

            ∂Witα ( p −it )     ⎡∞           ⎤
Noting that                 = E ⎢∑ δ t (α i )⎥ , the difference in the derivative of profits is
               ∂γ i             ⎣ t =0       ⎦

given by the relative proportion of firm switching consumers obtained by pi* and Ri(p-it).

Since playing cycling strategy Ri(p-it) allows a firm to obtain a greater proportion of firm-

switching customers than playing pi* , for which firm i receives βi(pi* , R-it(pi*)), an


                                                                                                                      30
increase in γi has a greater effect of firm profits when the firm plays a cycling strategy

than when the firm plays a non-cycling strategy.
