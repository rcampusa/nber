                                               ABSTRACT

The Medicare Modernization Act was recently established, to provide limited drug coverage to the
elderly. However, there is limited evidence on how drug coverage might affect health. The goal of
this paper is to obtain causal effects of prescription drug coverage on drug use, use of other medical
services and health of the elderly. We use fixed-effects analysis to control for unmeasured person-specific
effects that may confound the relationships of interest. Results show prescription drug coverage, particularly
public coverage, significantly increased the utilization of prescription drugs, but had no discernable
effect on hospital admissions or health.

       In 2005, elderly (65 years of age or above) people in the United States spent $120.6

billion on prescription drugs or an annual out-of-pocket expenditure of $1,113 per person, which

is approximately 5% of the average income of an elderly person (KFF, 2005). These figures

become more worrying when one considers that a substantial portion of the elderly lack

insurance coverage for prescription drugs. For example in 2002, only 55% of the elderly had

uninterrupted prescription drug coverage (KFF, 2005). Advocates for the elderly worry that the

combination of rising costs of drugs, limited incomes, and limited insurance coverage creates

circumstances for many elderly to go without essential medication, which may have adverse

health outcomes. Indeed, studies have indicated that the elderly often skip doses, and that some

do not fill prescriptions due to cost (Steinman, Sands & Covinsky, 2001; Kitchman, et al. 2002;

Saver, Doescher & Jackson, 2004).

       Until recently, Medicare did not cover outpatient prescription drugs. Elderly people had

to pay out-of-pocket or obtain coverage from other sources such as Public (Medicaid, Veterans

Affair and State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs), employer-sponsored retiree benefits,

Medicare Advantage plans (HMO), and privately purchased Medigap policies. In 2003, the

Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Drug Act (MMA) established a

drug benefit for the Medicare population. The program, which started in January 2006, provides

prescription drug coverage through private firms with varying levels of cost sharing based on a

patient’s expenditures for prescription drugs (CCH, 2003).

       While political objectives were an important part of the explanation of the timing and

design of the MMA, creation of the MMA was also motivated by a desire to improve the health

of the elderly by lowering the cost of prescription drugs, which in turn would stimulate their use

and improve health. Although plausible, there is relatively little evidence to support the




                                                                                                     1
presumed causal relationships underlying the MMA. Few studies have examined the effect of

prescription drug coverage on prescription drug use among the elderly and even fewer have

examined its effect on health. This study examines the relationship between prescription drug

coverage, prescription drug utilization, hospitalization, and the health of the elderly population.

Analyses are based on a nationally representative sample from the Medicare Current Beneficiary

Survey (MCBS) from the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) for years 1992-

2000. The study paid particular attention to the non-random nature of prescription drug coverage

and the selection bias caused by it. The goal of the study was to obtain estimates of the effect of

prescription drug coverage on prescription drug utilization and health that can plausibly be given

a causal interpretation.



Conceptual Framework--Demand for Prescription Drug Coverage

       Economic theory assumes that people are risk averse—they prefer a certain outcome to

an uncertain one even if the actuarial value of both is the same. Therefore, people will be willing

to pay to reduce the financial risk associated with illness by buying insurance. The willingness

to buy insurance increases with financial risk, which is a function of both the probability of

illness and the size of the expected loss associated with illness. Willingness to pay also depends

on the degree of risk aversion, as some people’s dislike for risk is stronger than others (Cutler &

Zeckhauser, 2000).

       This model of the demand for insurance is consistent with recent trends in prescription

drug use. Technological advances in both pharmaceutical and medical treatments have increased

the importance of prescription drugs for maintaining good health, particularly for the elderly.

Costs of prescription drugs have also increased significantly over time. Thus there is




                                                                                                      2
considerable uncertainty about the financial risk of illness as it relates to prescription drugs and

this uncertainty has increased over time. As a result, the demand for prescription drug coverage

among the elderly has been growing in recent years (see Figure 1). The greater desire for

prescription drug coverage among the elderly led, in part, to the MMA.

       This model of insurance also has important implications for empirical analyses of the

effect of prescription drug coverage. It suggests that those with insurance will differ from those

without insurance. Those with insurance are likely to be at greater risk illness (need of

prescription drugs) and/or be more risk averse. This may be exacerbated by imperfect risk

adjustment. So prescription drug use would likely differ between those with and without

insurance even if there was no insurance. Most empirical studies have not adequately accounted

for this selection effect (Davis, Poisal, Chulis, Zarabozo, & Cooper, 1999; Lillard, Rogowski, &

Kington, 1999; Blustein, 2000; Adams, Soumerai, & Ross- Degnan, 2001). Thus, it is unclear

how to interpret estimates of the effect of prescription drug coverage reported in earlier studies,

as they might be seriously biased estimates of the causal effect of prescription drug coverage on

prescription drug utilization and health.

       A second principle of the simple insurance model is that insurance-induced utilization of

prescription drugs could have relatively few health benefits. Most elderly people use

prescription drugs, even if they do not have insurance. So the increased use of prescription drugs

associated with insurance, what we will refer to as marginal use, may have fewer health benefits

than average use of prescription drugs. Moreover, lower prices are likely to result in some over-

utilization—for which the marginal costs are greater than the marginal benefits (Zweifel &

Manning, 2000).




                                                                                                       3
       The argument in support of the MMA is that providing prescription drug insurance would

make prescription drugs more affordable, thereby increasing their use. In turn, this increased use

would lead to better health. While the first part is likely true, the magnitude of the response to

insurance remains uncertain, as previous studies have not adequately addressed the selection

issue and, therefore, have not credibly identified the causal effect of prescription drug coverage

on utilization. More importantly, there is little evidence as to the effect of prescription drug

coverage on health. So even if utilization of prescription drugs increases with insurance

coverage, it is unknown whether such an increase would significantly improve health in a

general population.



Prior Literature
       Our review of the literature is limited to studies of elderly populations that have been

controlled in some way for confounding factors. We begin with studies that use cross-sectional

data. Typically, these studies report that insurance coverage, or more generous insurance

coverage, results in relatively large increases in utilization of prescription drugs (DHHS, 2000).

Stuart and Zacker (1999) reported 15.5% lower annual prescription use for dual eligible

Medicare enrollees living in states that imposed Medicaid co-payments compared to those living

in states with no co-payments. Blustein (2000) found that drug coverage was associated with a

40% increase in antihypertensive drug purchases by hypertensive patients. Federman, Adams,

Ross-Degnan, Soumerai & Ayanian (2001) reported 84% lower odds of HMG-CoA reductase

inhibitors (statins) use among elderly with high cholesterol without drug coverage as compared

to those with employer-sponsored coverage. Lillard et al. (1999) found that insurance coverage

significantly increased the probability of any drug use by 12.2% for those with private insurance.




                                                                                                     4
       Several studies have used quasi-experimental research designs. The typical approach is

to compare use of prescription drugs pre and post a change in prescription drug coverage or

policy (e.g., an increase in co-payment, limit on number of prescriptions). For example,

Soumerai et al., (1991) analyzed the impact of a three prescriptions per month limit in the New

Hampshire Medicaid program on prescription drug use and hospitalization rates. New Jersey

was used as a comparison state. Their analysis was limited to non-institutionalized, white, dual-

eligible people who had an average of three prescriptions per month at baseline, including use of

at least one prescription drug for a chronic condition. Their results indicated a 35% decline in

drug use after the cap was imposed and no significant changes in hospitalization rates.

       Johnson et al. (1997) and Chandra et al. (2007) examined the effect of increased

prescription drug cost sharing in Medicare managed care plans. Johnson et al. (1997) reported

that a 2$ (66%) increase in co-payment resulted in a significant decrease in prescription use of

approximately 8% and that it had no effect on hospitalization rates. Chandra et al. (2007)

calculated a price elasticity of demand of between -0.46 and -0.2 for Medicare PPOs and -1.4 for

Medicare HMO. These elasticities imply reductions in prescriptions filled from the pre-policy

mean of 2 to 6% in the PPO and 14.2% in the HMO. In addition, although they found a

significant increase in hospitalization rates in the HMO plan (which had increases in co-

payments for both prescription and office visits), there was no effect in the PPO plan (which only

had an increase in prescription co-payments).

       Gawrisankaran and Town (2004) examined the effect of Medicare Managed Care

Organization (MCO) penetration with and without prescription drug coverage on elderly

mortality using payments to MCO’s as instruments. Their preferred (instrumental variables)

estimates indicated that a 10-percentage point increase in non-drug MCO penetration increased




                                                                                                    5
mortality by 2.8%. Yang, Gilleskie and Norton (2004) analyzed the effect of supplemental

insurance, with and without prescription drug coverage, on prescription drug expenditure,

hospital services, and health using MCBS data. They used a dynamic panel model that modeled

health as a function of current and lagged utilization. Their results indicated drug coverage

increased drug expenditure by 20-35% over a 5-year period and decreased mortality slightly.

       The results from these studies consistently show that prescription drug coverage, and the

lower cost sharing associated with it, increased utilization of prescription drugs by elderly

patients. However, there is a wide range of estimates, which likely reflects the different

populations examined. In addition, the observational studies lacked a credible strategy to

address selection (Stuart & Zacker, 1999; Lillard et al. 1999; Blustein, 2000; Federman et al.

2001). The quasi experimental studies, while better on this point, have either focused on low-

income (Medicaid) population (Soumeari et al. 1991) or on a specific managed care population

(Johnson et al. 1997; Gawrisankaran & Town, 2004; Chandra et al. 2007). Therefore, there is

little in these studies that can be used to draw inferences for a broader population of elderly.

With respect to health, there is almost no evidence of the effect of prescription drug coverage. It

is clear that additional studies are warranted. Specifically, studies that examine a representative

sample of elderly people, that pay special attention to issues of selection, and which include

prescription utilization and health as outcomes.



Empirical Strategy

       The fundamental identification problem in estimating the effect of prescription drug

coverage on utilization and health is that the same person is never simultaneously observed with

and without prescription drug coverage. It is unlikely that the self-selection into coverage is




                                                                                                      6
random. To address this issue, we use a multivariate regression model with controls for person-

specific fixed-effects.1 Longitudinal data provides a potential solution to the selection problem

because over time people move into and out of prescription drug coverage. Thus, we can

observe the same person with and without coverage, although at two different points in time. If

this movement is random (conditional on measured covariates) then we can identify the causal

effect of prescription drug coverage. The time aspect of this approach, however, introduces the

possibility that unmeasured temporal influences (e.g., health status) might change, and bias the

estimates of the causal effect of prescription drug coverage.

       There are two conditions that determine the efficacy of the fixed-effect analysis. First,

there should be sufficient variation in prescription drug coverage within individuals over time.

Stuart et al. (2001) reported that 10.6% of non-institutionalized elderly who did not have

coverage in 1995 found coverage in 1996, while 7.4% of those who had coverage in 1995 lost it

in 1996. Our analysis indicated that, on average, 14% of the sample either gained or lost

coverage each year (see Table 2). So there is evidence of significant within-person variation in

prescription drug insurance. The second condition is that movement into or out of prescription

drug insurance should be random, conditional on controlling for measured characteristics and

unmeasured person-specific fixed-effects.    To assess the plausibility of this assumption, we

conducted a variety of analyses. All of these analyses provided evidence consistent with the

assumption underlying the fixed-effect approach. The most compelling of these is a comparison

of changes over time in prescription drug use and health status between those who would

eventually obtain insurance (“treatment group”) and those who either always had insurance or

never had insurance (“comparison group”). The fixed-effect approach assumes that, changes in

prescription drug use and health over time would be the same for the “treatment” and




                                                                                                    7
“comparison” groups conditional on covariates. We present the details of this analysis later, but

note here that there was no evidence, that trends in prescription drug use or health differed

between the “treatment” and “comparison” groups. Similar results were reported by Briesacher

et al. (2005) who examined medical care spending before and after gaining prescription

insurance coverage of Medicare beneficiaries. While we cannot definitively test the assumption

of the fixed effects approach, we believe the evidence supports the plausibility of this approach.

         The fixed-effects approach is implemented using the following regression model:

Yist = α i + γ s + δ t + β PC ist + X ist Γ + eist
i = 1,..., N (persons)
                                                     (1)
s = 1,...,51 (states)
t = 1992,...2000 (years)

where the dependent variable (Y), prescription drug use for example, of a person (i) in state (s)

and at time (t) is a linear function of person-specific fixed-effects (αi), state ( γ ), and year ( δ )

effects. State and year dummy variables control for unobserved state or time invariant factors

that might be related to utilization. These could include differences in prescribing patterns across

geography or technological advances in medicine over time. The vector X represents time

varying individual characteristics that might affect drug use such as demographic and

socioeconomic factors. PC represents prescription drug coverage of person (i) in state (s) and at

time (t). Γ and β are the parameter estimates for individual level variable and prescription drug

coverage, respectively, and e is the error term and represents unmeasured aspect of utilization.

         Estimates of equation (1) are obtained using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) for binary

dependent variables and Poisson regression for discrete outcomes. We recognize that OLS might

not be the most efficient estimator for binary dependent variables, but in the fixed-effect context,

common methods used in these circumstances (e.g. Logistic regression) have limitations that




                                                                                                          8
make OLS preferred. For example, the fixed-effect Logistic model assumes that the person-

specific fixed-effect has an infinite distribution and as a result drops observations for which the

dependent variable does not change over time even though there may be significant variation in

the right hand side variables. The Poisson model also has an advantage over other methods (e.g.,

Negative Binomial) in the fixed-effect context (Cameron & Trivedi, 1998; Allison & Waterman,

2000).2 In both cases (OLS and Poisson), standard errors need to be constructed to account for

likely biases.3 Therefore, we construct what are commonly referred to as robust standard errors

(Wooldridge, 2002). Despite the preference for OLS and Poisson, use of Logistic and Negative

Binomial regression yielded qualitatively similar results to those reported.


Data

         The primary data source used in the analyses is the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey

(MCBS)—Cost and Use file from CMS. MCBS is a national representative, continuous, survey

of aged, disabled and institutionalized Medicare beneficiaries (CMS, 2000). The MCBS sample

is drawn from the Medicare enrollment file. When the survey started in 1991, there was no limit

on duration of follow-up. In 1994, it was decided that a panel will retire after 4 years. So for

some individuals there are more than 4 years of data. In addition, approximately 6,000 new

people are added to the survey each year to account for non-response and death, to maintain a

target sample size of 12,000 individuals. Each respondent is interviewed three times per year

over a 4-year period. However, the bulk of the information is recorded on an annual basis. The

response rate for the first round is 83% and for the 12th round is approximately 70% (ResDAC,

2003).

         The first round of interviews starts in the fall of a given year. In the first round,

information regarding health and prescription insurance, insurance premiums, demographics,



                                                                                                      9
health status, and information on access to care is collected. After the first round, subjects are

advised to retain receipts, bills, prescription vials, and any related paperwork to document their

prescription use. In the following rounds, information is obtained on prescriptions purchased,

charges incurred, and sources of payment for the prescriptions obtained since the previous

interview. Respondents are also asked about utilization of other medical services since last

interviewed. Aggregated information on the use of medical services from Medicare claims files

is also included in the data.

       For the purpose of this analysis, data from 1992 to 2000 were used. The sample was

restricted to non-institutionalized elderly without end-stage renal disease. Individuals with partial

year information were removed from the analysis.4 We also excluded individuals from four US

territories and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Finally, states with fewer than 100

observations were removed from the analysis due to estimation concerns with small cell size.

The final sample size was 73,490 person-years observation representing an average of 8,166

people per year and a total of 29,120 unique individuals. Of these 29,120 people, 17% had only 1

year of data5, 20% had 2 years of data available data, 51% 3 years, 9% 4 years, and 4% had 5

years of data.

       MCBS respondents report multiple sources of prescription drug coverage and some have

coverage for only a few months in the year. Multiple coverage was due to elderly switching from

one source of coverage to another or having more than one source of coverage at the same time.

To account for this, insurance coverage was calculated for each month. Individual who reported

multiple coverage in a month were assigned to the more generous source in the following

hierarchical order: public, employer-sponsored, HMO, Medigap, and no drug coverage.6 A

similar hierarchy was used by Laschober et al. (2002). Finally, the proportion of months in each




                                                                                                     10
category was calculated. These categories were then used as independent variable in the

regression analysis. In addition, any drug coverage was also defined as the proportion of months

with coverage (all sources combined).7

       Several measures of utilization were constructed from self-reported data. Any

prescription use was a dichotomous variable equal to 1 if any prescription was reported and 0

otherwise. However, 86% of Medicare beneficiaries use at least one prescription drug in a year

(Davis, et al., 1999). As a result, measuring use in this way is limited. Therefore, utilization is

also measured using the reported annual number of prescriptions used.

       We also examined the effect of prescription drug coverage on hospitalizations. Assuming

a beneficial effect of prescription insurance coverage on health, one would expect lower

hospitalizations rate for covered individuals, compared to those without prescription coverage.

Here prescription coverage would act as a substitute for hospitalization, which is desirable from

both consumer and provider perspectives because prescription drugs are less invasive, have

fewer complications and have lower cost.

       We used a variety of measures of health. A dichotomous variable representing poor

health was constructed in which poor health was coded if self-reported health was fair or poor,

and good health represent if self–reported health was excellent, very good or good.

       A detailed measure of health that is more directly related to prescription use might be

more appropriate. Several studies have indicated that prescription drugs improve functional

disability. Antiarthritic drugs have been shown to improve gait and walking ability (Hamilton et

al., 2001; Genovese et al., 2005; Canete et al., 2006). Similarly, studies have indicated that

antidiabetic treatment is associated with improved health status and quality of life (Reza, Taylor,

Towse, Ward & Hendra, 2002; Bech, Moses & Gomis, 2003). Prescription drugs used for




                                                                                                  11
mental, cardiovascular and respiratory disorders have also been shown to improve quality of life

(Croog et al., 1986; Testa, Anderson, Nackley & Hollenberg, 1993; Israel, Cohn, Dube &

Drazen, 1996; Feldman et al., 2003; Hjalmarson et al., 2000; Roman et al., 2005) . Given this

evidence, we used activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living

(IADL) as measures of health. These measures have been used extensively in prior studies of

elderly health (Blustein, 2000; Federman et al., 2001).

       Activities of daily living include eating, dressing, bathing, walking, transferring into and

out of a chair, and using the toilet. Instrumental activities of daily living include making meals,

using the phone, going shopping, managing money, and doing light or heavy housework. The

minimum and maximum scores that an elderly person can have on the ADL and IADL are 0 and

6. Finally, a composite measure of functional disability was constructed that sums ADL and

IADL. The composite score values would; therefore range from 0 to12. Furthermore, as

prescription drugs can impact some measures of functional disability more than others, the effect

of prescription drug coverage on each item of the ADL and IADL was also assessed. Prior

studies have used each item separately and have shown that each individual item is a sensitive

measure of functional disability (Cook, Richardson, Pietroban, Silva & Turner, 2006).

       The analysis controls for age, sex, race, education, urban residence, income, marital

status, and smoking status. All analyses include state and year fixed effects.

$25,546 (2000 dollars).

          It was evident that there was significant use of prescription drugs by this population.

Almost every individual in the sample reported having at least one prescription use. The average

number of annual prescriptions was approximately 20. This figure included refills and

represented approximately 6 prescriptions per person among those with at least one prescription.

Sixty-two percent of the sample had prescription drug coverage with the majority of the coverage

provided by employers. In terms of health, 22% of the elderly respondents reported poor or fair

health.

          Table 1 also shows descriptive information by prescription drug insurance coverage.

Elderly people with low incomes and who were living in rural areas were significantly less likely

to have any prescription drug coverage. Notably, the demographic and socio-economic

differences between those with and without coverage, while often statistically significant were

not very large. There was, however, significant heterogeneity among those who had coverage—

individuals covered by public programs were quite different than individuals covered by other

programs. People with public insurance coverage were similar to those without insurance in

terms of demographic and socio-economic characteristics. Therefore, when individuals with

different categories of drug coverage were combined, the socio-economic differences between

those with and without drug coverage were smaller.




                                                                                                    13
       Is there a relationship between prescription drug coverage, and prescription drug use and

health evident in Table 1? In the case of use of prescription drugs, those with insurance have

greater use and there is a gradient in terms of use according to the generosity of insurance.

Those with public insurance, who pay nothing out-of-pocket, have the greatest use and those

with Medigap, which is least generous, have the least use. Part of the greater use of prescription

drugs may be due to differences in health. Those with public insurance coverage were least

healthy. Generally, elderly without insurance coverage reported worse health than individuals

with employer, HMO or Medigap insurance coverage. Those in public programs had

significantly worse health compared to all others, even those without drug coverage.

       Figure 1 shows trends in drug coverage from 1992 to 2000. In 1992, 52% of the elderly

reported no prescription drug insurance coverage. This dropped to 31% in 2000. Coverage from

public programs remained more or less stable. The gain in coverage came mostly from employer

sponsored and HMO coverage.9

       Figure 2, shows number of prescriptions per person. Elderly in public coverage had the

highest prescription drug utilization. The graph also indicates that utilization increased over time.

The average number of prescriptions increased by 47% for public programs, 59% for employer-

sponsored, 42% in HMO plans, and, 46% with Medigap coverage. For those without any drug,

coverage the number of prescriptions increased by 50%.

       Was the increase in drug coverage and prescription use associated with improved health?

There does not seem to be any trend toward better health, except for those in public programs.

There was a slight improvement in functional disability (ADL plus IADL) for elderly in public

coverage (Figure 3). For the other groups, it remained stable. The proportion of elderly with poor

health also remained stable (Figure 4).




                                                                                                  14
       One issue critical to our research design was whether there was sufficient within-person

variation in prescription drug coverage. Table 2 shows this variation between year t and year t+1.

A series of 2-year constant sample panels were created for 92-93, 93-94, 95-96, 97-98, 98-99,

and 99-00. The first year of each panel was denoted by year t and the second year by year t+1,

and then the panels were aggregated. Individuals with only 1 year of data were not included in

this table. In each panel there were approximately 5,000 individuals. The data in Table 2 are

consistent with the trend shown in Figure 1 and indicate that individuals gained coverage over

the years. On average, 14% of the sample changed coverage in each year. The majority of gain

was through employer-sponsored coverage, but an equal number of individuals lost employer

sponsored coverage. The most stable coverage was public. Overall, the data in Table 2 suggest

that there was sufficient variation in prescription drug coverage to implement the fixed-effect

approach.



Regression Analysis

       Tables 3 to 5 display estimates of the effects of prescription drug coverage on use of

prescriptions drugs and hospitalizations. Column 2 presents the estimates of the effect of

prescription drug coverage from models that do not include person-specific fixed-effects or

controls for individual health. In column 3, estimates are from a model that includes measures of

health, as determined by an indicator of poor health and the number of chronic diseases.

Including measures of health is intended to control for unmeasured time-varying determinants of

prescription drug coverage that are not accounted for by fixed-effects and that might confound

estimates. However, we recognize that this approach could be problematic because health could




                                                                                                  15
be affected by drug coverage. Finally, results from the fixed-effect models are presented in

columns 4 and 5, corresponding to models in columns 2 and 3.

        Estimates of the effect of prescription drug insurance coverage on any drug use are

displayed in Table 3 and show that drug coverage had a positive effect on any drug use. Elderly

people with public coverage were 8.7 percentage points more likely to have at least one

prescription than those with no coverage. Those with employer-sponsored and HMO coverage

had a 4.5 percentage point greater probability of having a prescription filled than those without

insurance. Finally, for those with Medigap, the probability of at least one prescription was 1.9

percentage points greater than those with no coverage. Adding health indicators to the model

(column 3) had little effect on estimates for HMO and Medigap coverage, but significantly

reduced estimates of public and employer coverage. This finding suggests that cross-sectional

estimates are likely to be biased.

        Columns 4 and 5 present the fixed-effects estimates. Coefficients on the drug coverage

variables decreased significantly relative to estimates in columns 1 and 2. Estimates in column 4

are small (close to zero) and are no longer statistically significant. Further, we did not see any

difference in coefficients between column 4 and 5, when measures of health were added to the

fixed-effect models. This suggests that much of the selection into insurance status is accounted

for by including controls for person-specific fixed-effects and lends support to the credibility of

our fixed-effects results.

        Table 4 displays estimates of the effect of drug coverage on annual number of

prescriptions. Estimates in column 2 indicate that public coverage increased prescription drugs

use by 46.7%, employer-sponsored coverage increased it by 19.7%, HMO coverage by 14.7%

and Medigap increased utilization by 17% relative to the uninsured. Adding measures of health




                                                                                                     16
(column 3) had little effect on estimates, except for public coverage. In general, the results

indicated very high utilization among those insured and are similar to previous cross-sectional

findings (Bluestein, 2000; Federman et al., 2001). Controlling for individual fixed-effects

revealed a different story. Here, at best, prescription drug coverage has only a moderate effect on

utilization. Public coverage increased annual number of prescriptions by 13.7%. Having

employer sponsored or HMO coverage increased the annual number of prescriptions by 6%.

Medigap coverage had no significant impact on prescription use. Adding measures of health had

no effect on fixed-effect estimates bolstering the plausibility for our research approach.

       Table 5 presents estimates of the effect of drug coverage on hospitalization. Estimates in

column 2 indicate that elderly with public insurance coverage are 6.3 percentage points more

likely to have a hospitalization than those without insurance. This is a large effect and, as we

will see, primarily a selection effect. Those with Medigap and employer-sponsored insurance

also have higher rates of hospitalization than the uninsured, but for these people the coefficients

are small—1 to 1.4 percentage points. Adding health status to the model (column 3) reduced the

effect of public insurance coverage on hospitalization significantly, and fixed-effect estimates

indicated that prescription drug coverage had no statistically significant effect on hospitalization.

Most fixed-effect estimates are small relative to the mean; public insurance coverage is

associated with the largest effect, 2.3 percentage point, which is approximately 9% of the mean

of the uninsured. Overall, estimates in Table 5 suggest that prescription drugs and

hospitalization, if related, are complementary treatments.

       The next set of tables (Tables 6-8), display estimates of the effect of drug coverage on

health, as measured by: poor health status, functional disability (ADL plus IADL), individual

measures of ADL and IADL. Table 6 shows the effect of prescription drug insurance coverage




                                                                                                   17
on probability of being in poor health. Estimates from models without person specific fixed-

effect suggest that public prescription drug coverage was associated with a higher probability of

poor health and that HMO coverage was associated with a lower probability of being in poor

health. Adding the number of chronic conditions reduced the magnitude of the estimate for

public coverage. Controlling for person-specific fixed-effects, however, reduced these estimates

greatly and they were no longer statistically significant. Notably, adding the number of chronic

conditions to the fixed-effect model had no effect on the estimates of drug coverage. There is

little evidence that prescription drug coverage is related to self-reported poor health.

       Tables 7 and 8 present estimates of the effect of drug coverage on functional disability

(ADL plus IADL score in Table 7) and individual IADL and ADL items (Table 8). Here, we just

discuss the fixed-effect estimates and only fixed-effect estimates are reported in Table 8.

Estimates in Tables 7 and 8 provide little evidence that prescription drug coverage is associated

with an improvement in ADL or IADL conditions except for those in the HMO group.

Prescription drug coverage through a Medicare HMO is associated with approximately 8% fewer

functional disabilities. The average score (ADL plus IADL) for uninsured people was 1.53;

therefore, drug coverage through a Medicare HMO would be expected to decrease it by 0.13. A

similar positive, yet small, impact of HMO coverage was observed for individual ADL and

IADL items (Table 8). Those with HMO coverage experienced reduced disability in bathing,

dressing, getting out of chair, and heavy housework. Estimates remain similar when we added

measures of health to the model (results not shown).




                                                                                                  18
Low Education Group Analysis (Results not Presented)

       It is of interest to investigate whether prescription drug coverage has a different effect for

economically disadvantaged individuals. Economically disadvantaged individuals are more

likely to be in poor health and in greatest need of medical care. Prescription drug coverage might

be more beneficial to them compared to other groups who can still purchase prescription drugs in

the absence of insurance. For example, the RAND Health Insurance Experiment did not find any

effect of health insurance on the health of the general population, but the study indicated

reduction in blood pressure for low-income population with poor health status (Brook, Lynch, &

Riley, 1983). Hence, the effect of prescription drug coverage was assessed for a sample of

elderly with no high school education—the group most likely to be in poor health and with

limited incomes. In general, the results for this group (not shown) were similar to the analysis

using the entire sample. Drug coverage had a positive impact on utilization, and controlling for

person-specific fixed-effects reduced the magnitudes of the estimates but they remain

statistically significant. Estimates for the low-educated sample suggested a slightly larger effect

for public coverage and smaller effect for employer-sponsored coverage. For example, results

from fixed-effect analyses indicated that public coverage among the low-educated was

associated with 15% increase in annual number of prescriptions; compared with 13.7% for the

entire sample. There was no significant impact of drug coverage on health for this sample.


Specification Tests for Fixed-Effect Analysis

       The fixed-effect analysis assumes that, in the absence of any change in prescription drug

coverage, changes in prescription drug use and health would be the same for those who switch

coverage as those who do not switch coverage. To assess the validity of this assumption, we

examined the trend in prescription drug use pre- and post-switching insurance status for people



                                                                                                   19
who gain coverage (True Switchers), people who never have coverage (Nevers), and people who

always have coverage (Always). For those who did not switch insurance (Always and Nevers),

we randomly assign them a (pseudo) switch year. Figure 5 displays these trends. The X-axis

indexes time prior to and after the switch of insurance; zero represents the switch year and years

pre- and post-switch are labeled accordingly. The Y-axis is the average annual number of

prescriptions filled. One year prior to switch (-2 to -1), prescription drug use was rising in a

similar way for all groups. In the year of the switch (-1 to 0), prescription drug use increased

more rapidly for switchers than non-switchers. In the year subsequent to switching (0-1), the

trend in prescription drug use is again about the same for switchers and non-switchers. This

pattern supports the fixed-effect approach because it shows that in the absence of a change in

insurance status, trends in prescription drug use are the same for those who switch and do not

switch insurance status. We show a similar figure (Figure 6) for the number of chronic

conditions. In this case, there is some evidence that the trend in chronic conditions differs

slightly for those who gain insurance after the switch. In the year of the switch, the number of

chronic conditions increased more for those who switched than for those who did not switch.

       To further assess whether the fixed-effect approach is valid, we estimated models

identical to those in Tables 3 through 8, using all observations for non-switchers and only

observations on switchers in years prior to switching. We randomly assign those who were true

switchers a pseudo-switch year—a year in which they supposedly gained prescription drug

coverage. If switchers and non-switchers have similar trends in outcomes, we would expect the

coefficient on this pseudo insurance coverage variable to be zero, which is exactly what was

found for all outcomes (prescription drug use, hospitalization, poor health, and number of




                                                                                                   20
chronic conditions). In summary, a variety of specification tests provide strong evidence that the

fixed-effect design is valid and that estimates could plausibly be interpreted as causal.

       Given that statistical analyses indicated that changes in prescription drug insurance

coverage appeared to be exogenous (random), conditional on measured covariates and controls

for time-invariant person-specific effects, a natural question to ask is why? What are the

exogenous factors that caused people to switch insurance coverage? There are a few possible

explanations. One factor is the expansion of Medicaid eligibility thresholds (Bruen et al., 1999,

2003; Stone and Yacker, 2002; Schneider et al., 1999). There was also a significant expansion of

Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs (PAP) across states. In 1992, only 19 states had some form

of PAP program by 2000 almost all states had included some form of drug coverage to their low

income elderly who did not qualify for Medicaid. These changes might account for switches into

public coverage observed in Table 2.

       Expansion of Medicare managed care might account for some of the changes in coverage.

Between 1996 and 1999, enrollment in Medicare risk plan (e.g., HMO) increased by 5.1

percentage points (Laschober, et al., 2002). However, the 1997 Balanced Budget Act decreased

payments to MCOs and, as a result, many MCOs either terminated or reduced the benefits

provided (Pizer and Frakt, 2002; Booske et al. 2002). Those disenrolled and living in areas of

low managed care penetration were more likely to enroll in Medigap plans (Laschober et al.

1999; Booske et al. 2002).

       For those who gained employer coverage, data from the MCBS indicated that some did

so through their spouses or by starting employment. Many picked up drug coverage subsequent

to retirement. A Kaiser/Hewitt 2002 Retiree Health Survey reported that 16% of the employers

in the survey provided options for stand-alone drug plans or discount cards (KFF, 2002). Hence,




                                                                                                 21
some employees could be expected to pick-up prescription drug benefits at a later time. Results

from the same survey indicated that many employers had increased drug co-payments, which

could results in employee’s withdrawing from those plans. Overall, there appeared to be

plausible explanations for the statistical finding that switches in prescription drug coverage

appear to be exogenous, conditional on measured covariates and controls for time-invariant

person-specific effects.



Conclusions

       January 1, 2006 was a historical day for the elderly in the United States. For the first

time, a drug benefit became part of the Medicare program. The program is estimated to have a

net cost of $593 billion over a 10-year period (CBO, 2005). However, very little is known as to

what can be expected from this expansion as there is little research examining the effects of

prescription drug coverage on prescription drug use, medical care use, and health of the elderly

that can be considered “causal”. In this study, we have tried to address this shortfall.

       Several studies have indicated that the elderly skip doses or do not fill prescriptions due

to cost (Steinman et al., 2001; Kitchman et al., 2002; Saver et al., 2004). For these elderly,

insurance can help because it decreases the price of the drugs, making them accessible. The

results of this study indicated that drug coverage increased drug use and thereby improved

access. However, the magnitude of the effect of drug coverage on utilization was smaller than

that found in most previous studies. Public insurance coverage increased prescription drug

utilization by 14%, and employer-sponsored and Medicare HMO coverage increased utilization

by 6%. These estimates were statistically significant. Medigap prescription drug coverage did not

have any significant effect on prescription drug use. These results are consistent with the




                                                                                                  22
generosity of these different insurance plans. Medicaid is the most generous and Medigap the

least generous.

       Did the greater use of prescription drugs associated with insurance improved health and

lower rates of hospitalization? Generally, we found the answer to this question to be “no.” We

did not find consistent evidence that prescription drugs are a substitute for hospitalization. Nor

did we find much evidence that prescription drug coverage improved health and functional

disability. The lone exception was prescription drug coverage obtained through a Medicare

HMO. In this case, prescription drug coverage was associated with improved functional

disability. Similar results were obtained for a sample of low-educated people.

       Perhaps it is to be expected that prescription drug insurance would have few health

benefits given that prescription drug coverage had relatively small effects on prescription drug

use. Alternatively, absence of effect could be due to inappropriate pharmacotherapy either

because of excess unnecessary utilization that could even be harmful or non-adherence to

therapy on the part of consumers (Budnitz et al., 2006; Zhan et al. 2001; Lazarou, Pomeranz &

Corey, 1998). We also acknowledge the limitations of our data in estimating the effect of drug

coverage on health. Perhaps, more appropriate measures of health would be intermediate and

disease specific health outcomes such as reduction in HbA1c for diabetic patients or blood

pressure for hypertensive patients.

       So what do these results imply about the benefits of Medicare Part D? It is difficult to

estimate the actual impact of Medicare Part D from this study because the program has co-

payments and an expenditure range during which coverage is not provided. Based on the results

of fixed-effect analysis, one would expect to observe a relatively small increase in utilization,

particularly because Part D is not very generous. For example, a 6% increase, which is what we




                                                                                                    23
found for employer-sponsored insurance would result in an increase of 6 to 9 million

prescriptions annually, provided all uninsured avail of the new benefit.

       The analysis also has implications for medication therapy management programs

(MTMP) introduced as a part of MMA (CCH, 2003). It is believed that efficacy of prescription

drugs depends on proper prescribing and compliance to medication. Under MMA, the providers

of drug coverage are required to establish an MTMP for seriously ill beneficiaries. The basic

premise is to improve therapeutic outcomes and reduce adverse event by monitoring medication

use, coordinating therapy, and providing education and training on drug use. Indeed, prior

research supports that intervention by health care providers improves clinical, economic and

humanistic outcomes (Buntig & Cranor 2006). Our finding of no effect of drug coverage on

health suggests simply providing drug coverage might not be sufficient to improve health and

that other interventions such as MTMP might be necessary.

  We also experimented with instrumental variables approach. However, the instruments (Medicaid eligibility
thresholds, managed care payment rates, employer characteristics) while statistically significant in first stage, were
weak and second stage estimates were too imprecise to be informative.

  The negative binomial model is not a true fixed effect model. It does not fully eliminate the influence of
unmeasured personal characteristics (Allison & Waterman, 2000).

  To adjust Poisson standard errors, Allison and Waterman (2000) and Wooldridge (2002) suggest adjusting
standard errors using deviance statistics. Specifically, the method multiplies the standard error from the Poisson
regression by the square root of the ratio of Pearson chi-square goodness of fit statistics to its degrees of freedom.

  These are 5,250 individuals whom MCBS label as “ghosts”. Ghosts are individuals who enter the survey in the fall;
these individuals are reassigned identification numbers next year. However as these ghosts identification numbers
were reused in the initials years of surveys, it becomes difficult to follow these individuals. Moreover, as ghosts
enter the survey in the fall they only have part year information available, therefore it was decided to remove this
part year information from the analysis. In addition, elderly who died during the interview year, their information
was not used for that year (4,842 observations).

  These people will drop out of fixed effects analyses. However, dropping them from all analyses does not alter the
results.

  In defining drug coverage from public sources, if the individual reports coverage from either Medicaid or any other
public source besides Medicare, it was assumed that the supplemental coverage provides drug coverage. This was
done because specific drug coverage was not asked when persons reported Medicaid coverage. The vast majority of
those on Medicaid have drug coverage (DHHS 2000).
7
  We also constructed alternative measures of drug coverage using five mutually exclusive categories that were
created based on the proportion of coverage in a year. For instance, if the person reported Medicaid coverage for
five months but had no coverage for the other seven months this person was assigned to “no drug coverage”
category. All analyses were done with this alternative set of variables and results were virtually the same as those
presented in the text.

  The standard errors, presented were calculated using the balanced repeated replication weights provided with the
data. Replicated weights are sampling weights produced by creating several small samples. MCBS contains 100
replication weights. Estimates were calculated using both the full sample weight and each of the replicate weights
and then the difference in the estimate was used to calculate the standard error. The mean statistics produced with
unweighted and weighted sample were similar.
9
  In the period from 1999-2000 a slight drop in employer sponsored coverage can be observed, which is consistent
with reports in prior studies (William Mercer Inc. 2001; Stuart, Singhal et al. 2003). However, a more recent study
by Kaiser Family Foundation (2005) reported only 18% uninsured in 2002. Hence, it appears that the overall trend
in drug coverage continued to increase even after year 2000.
