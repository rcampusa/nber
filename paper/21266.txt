                                              ABSTRACT

We study the relationship between the political connections of Chinese firms and workplace fatalities.
In our preferred specification we find that the worker death rate for connected companies is two to
three times that of unconnected firms (depending on the sample employed), a pattern that holds for
within-firm estimations. The connections-mortality relationship is attenuated in provinces where safety
regulators' promotion is contingent on meeting safety targets. In the absence of fatalities, connected
firms receive fewer reports of major violations for safety compliance, whereas in years of fatal accidents
the rate of reported violations is identical. Moreover, fatal accidents produce negative returns at connected
companies and are associated with the subsequent departure of well-connected executives. These results
provide suggestive evidence that connections enable firms to avoid (potentially costly) compliance
measures, rather than using connections to avoid regulatory response after accidents occur. Our findings
emphasize the social costs of political connections, and suggest that appropriate regulatory incentives
may be useful in mitigating these costs.

   There exists a longstanding debate on the social impact of rent-seeking by politically

connected rms. The overall eect hinges to a large extent on whether political ties allow

businesses to circumvent needlessly onerous bureaucratic constraints or to get around regu-

lations that are socially benecial but result in lower rm prots. Yet there is little empirical

evidence to inform our views on this tradeo. In this paper, we examine the link between

rms' political ties and workplace fatalities in China, thus highlighting the cost side of this

tradeo; we also examine the eect of regulator incentives in mitigating these costs.

   There have been many anecdotal accounts of substandard working conditions across a

range of industries in China. As some indication of the scale of the problem, China's worker

death rate is over 20 times that of the United Kingdom (Wang, 2011).           This poor safety

record is generally attributed to weak enforcement rather than the absence of adequate laws

and regulations (Phillips, 2010).    For example, a scathing assessment by the International

Labour Organization in 2012 stated that rms in China's construction industry do not meet

international standards, national laws and regulations due to a lack of prevention, illegal

operations, poor preventive and protective measures, lack of provision of personal protection

equipment and eective and regular safety inspections, audits and training.
                                                                                     1   Bribery is

often implicated in cases of poor safety compliance:      following an explosion at a Nanjing

chemical factory that killed 12 workers, the   Wall Street Journal   suggested that corruption

and collusion between...factory owners and local inspectors limit the likelihood that laws

protecting workers will be enforced.   This view is echoed by statements from the national

ministry charged with production safety, whose spokesman stated as recently as 2013 that

protection from local government and corruption...are behind many major deadly accidents.

Others have taken the contrary view - politicians plausibly put more weight on worker welfare

relative to prots than businessmen, so that political ties could lead to   better   treatment of

workers at politically connected rms (see Dong et.al. (2014) for recent evidence from China).

   We use data from publicly traded Chinese rms during 2008 - 2013 to examine the em-

pirical relationship between rms' political connections and workplace safety. We begin by

documenting a robust positive correlation between the political ties of executives and worker

deaths.   We dene a company to be politically connected if its CEO or another C-suite

executive previously held a high-level government post; the number of workplace deaths per

employee at connected rms is two to three times higher than at unconnected rms (depend-

ing on the sample we employ). This pattern holds in regression specications, both in the

cross-section and also in a rm-year panel with rm xed-eects, where the connection-fatality

relationship is identied from executive turnover. Political connections are not exogenously

assigned, so our main results need be interpreted with some caution. We consider some of

                                               2
the most prominent mechanisms through which this might bias our estimates, including dif-

ferential rates of death underreporting for connected versus unconnected rms, dierences in

management talent, and the dierential selection of connected executives, and nd limited

support for any of these possibilities.

   We go on to examine workplace enforcement actions as a function of political ties. Con-

sistent with our thesis that connections insulate rms from regulatory compliance, we nd

that despite their relatively poor safety records there has never been a public report of a

major workplace safety audit at a connected company (the rate is just under 5 percent at

comparable unconnected rms). We also show that connected rms are ned for pollution

less often, providing further suggestive evidience that that connections help rms circumvent

costly regulations more broadly.

   Such insulation from oversight may account, at least in part, for the relatively high prof-

itability that we document among connected rms in our sample.            We delve more deeply

into the link between connections, lax safety compliance, and protability by examining the

eect of fatal accidents on future prots. Share prices of connected rms fall by as much as 9

percent (relative to unconnected rms) in the 30 trading days following a fatal accident. In

the year following such accidents, the prot premium of connected rms disappears, indicat-

ing that investors' expectations are validated by subsequent accounting prots. Further, we

show that in the year following worker fatalities, rms are signicantly less likely to employ

connected executives, indicating one direct channel through which fatal accidents may reduce

or eliminate connected rms' prot premium.

   Overall, while no single piece of evidence is dispositive, we argue that our full set of ndings

are most easily reconciled with the use of political relationships to (protably) circumvent

safety oversight and regulation, and that this protection is lost in the wake of accidents that

result in worker deaths.

   Finally, we explore the eect of strengthened incentives for regulators on worker safety at

connected rms by examining the passage of laws which made ocials' promotion contingent

on meeting safety targets. Exploiting the dierent timing of passage of so-called No safety,

no promotion (NSNP) laws across provinces, we show that stronger regulator incentives

are associated with lower worker death rates, primarily among connected companies. This

relationship holds when we include rm xed eects, province-year xed eects, and province-

specic time trends to control for unobserved trends or shocks to rms or provinces.           We

also nd a drop in pollution nes for connected rms following the passage of NSNP laws,

consistent with substitution amongst forms of rent-seeking by connected rms. (Given the

lack of random assignment of NSNP laws, these results should be seen as suggestive.)

   We present a Becker-style audit model that is useful for organizing and interpreting our

full set of results. In our model, regulators trade o the costs of safety monitoring against the




                                                3
career costs of workplace fatalities, while rms weigh the cost of safety compliance versus the

nes (and future oversight) that come with accidents and/or the detection of workplace safety

violations. We add the following assumptions to the standard model: the cost to the regulator

of monitoring connected rms is higher, and connected rms lose their ability to shirk on safety

compliance after fatalities occur. Our simple model yields a set of predictions that are useful

in organizing our empirical results: (a) well-connected rms have more accidents; (b) in the

absence of workplace fatalities, connected rms have fewer audits; (c) connected rms are

more protable; (d) the eect of raising the regulator's (career) cost from workplace fatalities

may have a much greater impact on safety compliance at well-connected rms (owing to a

'bang-bang' shift in enforcement equilibrium); (e) expected prots at connected rms decline

following accidents.

    Our work contributes most directly to the literature on the consequences of government

regulation. Many of the empirical contributions in this area have emphasized the negative

impact of onerous regulations on economic growth (see, for example, Djankov et al (2002)

on entry regulation, and BourlÃ¨s et al (2010) for product market regulation). An exception

is Bertrand et al (2007), which nds that driver's license applicants in India obtain their

licenses more quickly when given a nancial incentive to do so (and hence are likely to get

licenses through bribery). Furthermore, drivers that likely obtained licenses through bribery

subsequently performed poorly on driving tests. By focusing on worker deaths, we look more

directly at the welfare consequences of regulation; further, we focus on high-level connections

rather than petty corruption.

    Our study also contributes to the literature on the social costs and benets of political

rent-seeking by rms, and corruption more broadly. The theoretical foundations of this eld

were laid by Le (1964), Becker and Stigler (1974), and Shleifer and Vishny (1993), which

consider the circumstances where bribery and corruption will be most costly (Olken and

Pande (2012) provide a recent survey). Mauro's (1995) cross-country analysis of corruption

and growth was the rst of many studies over the past couple of decades to explore the

correlates of corruption empirically (see Fisman and Svensson (2007) and Bai et al (2013) for

within-country analyses). This literature has often used the political connections of businesses

- the measure we employ in this paper - as a marker for favorable treatment by government

ocials.
           2
    While prior research has established the implications of political ties for rm prots,

our study is one of a small number that illustrates the social costs.                  Earlier research on

   2 For   examples of event study analyses on the value of personal connections, see Fisman (2001), Faccio
(2006), and Goldman et al (2009); for event study evidence from China, see Fan et al (2008). Khwaja and
Mian (2005) study the value of connections in Pakistan with a focus on credit access, while both Olken (2007)
and Goldman et al (forthcoming) emphasize the procurement channel. Borisov et al (2013) provides evidence
on lobbying expenditures as an alternative to personal ties as a source of political connections; Dinc (2005)
emphasizes the critical role of politicians' incentives in governing the behavior of connected rms.




                                                      4
the social costs has generally emphasized the welfare consequences of directing government

resources to politically favored rms, either through under-production or the eciency loss of

channeling business to less productive enterprises (see Cingano and Pinotti (2013) and Amore

and Bennedsen (2013) for two recent examples). Ours is the rst to focus on a particularly

tangible form of social cost - worker deaths - and to emphasize the costs of regulatory non-

compliance rather than resource misallocation.       While we focus on worker deaths as one

particularly evocative example of social cost, it is likely representative of connected rms'

ability to evade regulation - at society's expense - in other realms.     In China, the head of

the Food and Drug Administration was executed in 2007 for certifying that products were

safe in exchange for bribes, while bribery was also implicated in the infant formula scandal

the following year (Huang, 2012).       Collusion between rms and the local bureaucracy is

similarly blamed for the country's pollution problems, allowing businesses to evade emissions

regulations across a range of industries (Morgan, 2013).

      Our paper relates to the concurrent work of Jia and Nie (2013), who investigate the impact

of government decentralization on worker deaths in Chinese coal mines. We view our study

as complementary to theirs: whereas Jia and Nie focus on shifts in political structure and

the resultant eect on collusion between state-owned enterprises and local governments, we

study the rm-level impact of political connections of private businesses (indeed, we nd that

our results are unaected by controlling for state ownership of the enterprises in our sample,

highlighting the fact that the two papers focus on independent channels). We also emphasize

that our work exploits rm-level data, and examines a wider array of industries.

      Finally, our work also contributes to the related eld that examines the propensity of

companies to act in a socially responsible manner and the nancial implications of doing

so.   Much of this research has focused on the abnormal returns earned by rms with high

or low measures of social responsibility (see Elfenbein, Margolis and Walsh (2007) for a

survey, Harrison and Kacperczyk (2009) for a recent analysis of social responsibility and

long-run returns, and Hamilton (1995) for an event study of environmental responsibility and

market returns). A separate stream of research focuses on social responsibility as an outcome

variable. Papers in this area have examined correlates of corporate goodness such as nancing

constraints (Hong et.al. (2011)), product market competition (Baron, 2001), and information

asymmetries (Elfenbein et al, 2012). In this paper, we relate political connections both to the

level of company responsibility in the form of worker safety, and also to nancial performance

following worker deaths.

      The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 1 describes the institutional back-

ground and the data, including discussions of workplace safety oversight in China and the

channels through which political ties are thought to inuence safety practices. Section 2 pro-

vides a simple theoretical framework for organizing our subsequent empirical results; Section




                                                 5

1      Data and institutional background
1.1 Workplace safety oversight in China
Chinese worker safety is overseen by a patchwork of governmental authorities and regulations.
                                                                                                                 3
The earliest signicant nationwide rules governing worker safety focused on mining, with

the enactment of the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safety in Mines by the

National People's Congress in 1993. As with much legislation in China, the Mining Safety

Law explicitly recognized that worker welfare had to be balanced with the needs of economic

development:  [The law] is formulated for the purpose of ensuring safety in production in

mines, preventing accidents and protecting personal safety of workers and sta at mines and

promoting the development of the mining industry. However, the details of how such high-

level directives were to be put into practice were left to lower-level administrative bodies.

     Subsequent national regulation, enacted in 1996, targeted coal mining in particular and

specied conditions for implementation - such as the training of foremen in eective safety

practices - which had to be satised for a mine to obtain an operating license.                         In 2002,

nationwide rules that covered all industries were put into eect.                   This came with the Law

of the People's Republic of China on Work Safety, which codied worker safety as a set of

statutory rights.         The law was comprised of 97 provisions covering - among other things

- safety measurement, supervision and management of production safety, rescue work and

investigations following accidents, and also laid out the resultant legal liabilities. This law

was supplemented by the Administrative Penalties for the Violation of Production Safety

Laws, passed in 2003 and revised in 2007.                It specied the administrative punishments for

safety violations, including modest nes (up to 100,000 RMB for an individual and 300,000

RMB for a rm; throughout our sample, the renminbi traded in the range of 6.2 to 7.2 RMB

to a US dollar), and, more substantively, license suspensions and mine closures.

     Since 2001, the enforcement of workplace safety regulation has been overseen by the

State Administration of Work Safety (SAWS). This was intended to decouple safety oversight

from industrial and mining production ministries. Previously, for example, the Ministry of

Coal Industry had the potentially conicting responsibilities of increasing output as well as

maintaining safety standards.             Since 2005, SAWS has had full ministry status, reporting

directly to the State Council, the highest political body in China. In addition to sanctions

for non-compliant rms, the central government has also mandated since 2006 (2004 for coal)

    3 See   Homer (2009) for a detailed history of safety regulation in China focused on - but not limited to - the
mining industry.




                                                          6
that rms put aside annual reserves to cover safety costs. For the industries we study, these

funds amount to a substantial fraction of rm revenues. For construction, the requisite safety

fund is 2 percent of costs. In other industries, mandated safety funds are a non-linear function

of revenues or output. For chemical rms, which make up the largest industry in our sample,

safety funds averaged about 0.7 percent of revenues, while for coal mining the average was

just over 1 percent of revenues.

    Despite the many regulations on the books and the signicant power vested in SAWS,

China's workplace safety record remains poor by international standards due to ineective

enforcement.       According to SAWS, there were more than 83,000 deaths in workplace acci-

dents in 2009, or roughly one out of every 10,000 workers (China Safe Production Yearbook,

2009). One reason is that, despite the increased ability to set regulations that came with the

2002 Work Safety Law, enforcement is largely left to local safety boards.                  These may lack

independence from local ocials, who are evaluated and rewarded on their ability to attract

investment and maintain economic growth.
                                                    4   The eectiveness of safety compliance may be

further weakened by corruption at the local level, as suggested by Wang (2006), Johnson

(2006), Epstein (2009) and Sebag-Monteore Clarissa (2012) among others. In this spirit, we

assess the extent to which political ties may have attenuated safety compliance.



1.2 No safety, no promotion laws
We analyze the eects of one signicant shift in the incentives of local regulatory authorities.

Prior to 2004, provincial ocials were evaluated and promoted based on economic growth

(Li and Zhou, 2005). Since 2004, China has followed a safety production targeting system,

whereby the central government assigns a `death ceiling' to each province, and the provincial

government is responsible for allocating the `quota' among municipalities (Peng, 2004). In

response, provinces began adopting No safety, no promotion (NSNP) policies that made

promotion of safety regulators and other local government ocials contingent on meeting the

safety target set for their region by the provincial government. Guodong was the rst province

to adopt this policy in 2005, while others followed suit only much later. As of mid-2014, 11

provincial authorities, out of a total of 31, still had not adopted this approach to providing

incentives to safety regulators.
                                     5   In Appendix Table A1, we list for each province the dates

of the passage and implementation of NSNP policies. We will exploit this dierence across

provinces in ocials' safety incentives to assess whether well-connected rms are less likely to

   4 See   Homer (2009), Li and Zhou (2005), Wang (2006), People's Daily (2005), and editorial comments in
the Journal of New Safety (2005) for further details on the administration and enforcement of safety codes.
   5 Note   that some provinces had enacted earlier policies on production safety.   However, no punishments
were specied for ocials that failed to meet safety quotas.   For example, Qinghai Province passed Rules
on monitoring production safety in Qinghai Province on Aug 27, 2005 (eective Nov 1, 2005), but without
specifying punishment for failing to meet quotas. We view provinces under such regimes as equivalent to those
without safety interventions.




                                                        7
have worker fatalities in locations where local government ocials are evaluated in part based

on worker safety. Further, as Table A1 makes clear, a number of laws were passed during

our sample period of 2008-2013, making it possible to use within-rm changes in                             NSNP     laws

to identify the eect of the regulatory environment. Table A1 additionally provides, for each

province, the number of rm-year observations and number of worker deaths, along with

population and income per capita for 2005.

      Passage of NSNP laws is, of course, non-random. In unreported analyses, we nd that the

fraction of provincial GDP from coal mining is a strong positive predictor of NSNP laws, but

after this is accounted for, no other province-level attribute (including construction output,

log income per capita, population, worker deaths per capita, or corruption cases per capita)

is correlated with the passage of such laws. When we control for provincial coal output in our

analysis below, our results are unaected. We will also exploit the timing of passage of NSNP

laws to identify their eect, which further mitigates concerns over non-random assignment of

regulator incentives. Nonetheless, given the lack of exogenous variation in local enforcement,

our results on the eects of NSNP should be treated with caution.



1.3 Safety compliance and political connections
Our reference to the use of political connections as a cause of worker deaths in the introduction

can be traced to a number of widely discussed mechanisms. Many of these are outlined in a

research report published by the China Labor Bulletin in 2006, and begin at the point of entry

into industry and also for expansion to new locales.
                                                                6    To operate in hazardous industries such

as coal mining and chemicals, a rm must obtain a license which requires dozens of approvals

from individual government oces.               Higher-level connections can facilitate rapid approval,

potentially without the requisite safeguards in place. In construction, rms may subcontract

to low-cost (and unqualied) providers, or employ relatively low-cost unqualied workers.

These are cost-cutting measures that have been tied to bribery of safety regulators, most

notably in the arrest of the chief safety ocer of Bangbu City in 2013.
                                                                                               7
      While we do not observe individual share ownership in the companies we study, connected

rms often are thought to provide ownership stakes to local ocials, who are then motivated

to promote prots over safety. Further, once operation begins, connected rms are less likely

to be shut down in response to observed safety violations - a fact we further verify in our

own data.      Finally, as emphasized by Sun (2005) in his assessment of the coal industry in

Chenzhou, powerfully connected mining companies may deter local ocials from monitoring

them at all.

   This deference to well-connected rms may not continue in the aftermath of fatal accidents,

which generally demand a response.           Indeed, as Kato and Long (2006a and 2006b) note,

management turnover is common following poor nancial performance and as a result of

serious operating or nancial problems of any kind.                This is consistent with our ndings

in Section 3.1.3 on the post-accident protability and high management turnover following

worker fatalities.    Whether this dierentially aects connected rms is ambiguous.               Cao et

al (2011) suggest that well-connected individuals may be insulated from the consequences of

poor performance, implying a muted impact of worker deaths on connected rms. One the

other hand, Wang and Qian (2011) and others have argued that, since rms run by former

public ocials have greater public exposure, extreme events like worker deaths may demand a

greater   response for connected rms. We will examine this question empirically in the results

that follow.



1.4 Data
Our sample includes all publicly traded Chinese rms from the following industries (China

industry classications in parentheses): Coal mining (industry code B01, 25 rms); Petroleum

and Natural Gas Extraction (B03, 2 rms); Ferrous Metals Mining and Dressing (B05, 2

rms); Nonferrous Metals Mining and Dressing (B07, 8 rms); Petroleum Rening and Coking

(C41, 5 rms); Raw Chemical Materials and Chemical Products (C43, 124 rms); Smelting

and Pressing of Ferrous Metals (C65, 34 rms); Smelting and Pressing of Nonferrous Metals

(C67, 41 rms); and Construction (E01, 35 rms).
                                                               8   These industries are the regulatory

focus of the State Administration of Work Safety, which is both an indication of the relative

importance of workplace safety and also facilitates the collection of reliable rm-level worker

mortality data, as discussed in greater detail below.

   To collect worker death statistics, we began by examining rms' Corporate Social Respon-

sibility (CSR) reports, which large publicly traded rms started to provide beginning in 2008.

These reports often disclose any accidents involving worker fatalities. We also reviewed rms'

annual reports, semi-annual reports, quarterly reports and other announcements: while some

rms failed to provide CSR reports, all publicly traded rms are required by the Chinese SEC

to disclose workplace accidents that result in fatalities in some manner. To cross-check the

gures obtained from companies' own disclosures, we utilized data from the ocial website of

the State Administration of Work Safety (SAWS) in China
                                                                    9   and websites of its local branches,

which provide an accident searching function. According to the Notice on improving acci-

sales in two of the sample years, and went bankrupt in 2012.

dent information report from the State Administration of Workplace Safety, beginning in

2008, all rms in China were required to report workplace deaths to the local branches of

SAWS in a timely manner, which in turn were meant to be publicly disclosed. Prior to 2008,

rms were also required to report such information; however, due to the modest penalties for

non-reporting prior to 2008, these earlier data are very incomplete and thought to be of poor

quality. The lack of signicant penalties similarly aected the disclosure of safety information

in company reports. Owing to these shifts in reporting that took place in 2008, we focus on

the sample period 2008-2013; In our Data Appendix, we provide further details comparing

company and government data sources. (As an indication of the enormous shift in reporting,

the fraction of rms reporting at least one workplace fatality increased eight-fold between

2007 and 2008, as more stringent disclosure rules went into eect.)

   For the construction industry, rms are not required to report workplace fatalities to

the public in their CSR or other corporate reports, since construction workers are typically

contract rather than formal employees. We obtain data for this industry through a proprietary

accident-level dataset from the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of China

(MHUDC). Construction rms are required to report any accident involving fatalities to the

MHUDC and have been required to do so since 2008. These accident-level data were matched

by name to our sample of listed rms. 35 Construction companies contribute a total of 123

rm-year observations to our panel dataset and a total of 243 deaths.

   For 57 rm-year observations from 16 rms, death information was not found in govern-

ment websites or company reports. In these cases, we supplement our data using a media

search based on the WiseSearch (www.wisers.com) database. WiseSearch, located in Hong

Kong, has broad coverage of newspaper reporting in China, including stories from more than

2,000 newspapers, covering over 80 percent of province-level newspapers, city newspapers and

all national nancial newspapers.   These 57 rm-year observations contribute 11 deaths to

our full-sample total of 1332, a reported death rate that is far lower than that of rm-year

observations from ocial or company sources.

   Finally, we note that for accidents involving three or more worker deaths - dened by

SAWS as severe - there is a high level of consistency between CSR and corporate reports

and those provided by SAWS, and in no case was a severe accident reported in the media but

not in ocial sources.

   Our nal dataset is comprised of 1475 rm-year observations, with a total of 1332 worker

fatalities. This represents an annual worker death rate for the overall sample of about 0.65

workers per ten thousand, somewhat below the national average of 0.93. While this may seem

puzzling given our focus on safety-regulated industries, it is a natural result of sampling only

from publicly traded companies.

   We dene four measures of worker mortality:     Deathscy , total worker fatalities at company


                                              10
c   during calendar year       y ; DeathRatecy = 1, 000 â Deathscy /Employmentcy ,                   our favored

measure, gives worker mortality scaled by employment;              I(Deathscy > 0), an indicator variable
denoting whether there was at least one fatality at rm             c   in year   y ; and an indicator for rm-
years when at least one severe accident (three or more fatalities) occurs,                  Severecy .   Owing to

several extreme observations for         DeathRate     we winsorize this variable at the 1 percent level.

      For the full sample, at least one fatality occurs in 13.5 percent of rm-year observations.

In Figure 1, we show the frequency distribution of           Deaths     for these 199 non-zero observations.

While there are some very high fatality rm-year observations concentrated in mining and

construction (all but one 15+ fatality observations are in these industries), most observations

are clustered in the single digits.

      In 284 accidents that led to a total of 1146 deaths (out of the total of 1332 in our rm-year

panel data), we were able to pinpoint the precise date of the accident. The discrepancy owes

to the fact that in some cases CSR or other corporate reports provided only annual aggregates

or failed to provide exact dates; in a subset of these cases where only aggregate information

was provided, we were unable to determine the precise date of an accident through media

accounts.      We focus on the 284 accidents with precise event dates in our market reaction

analysis below.

      Our measure of political connections is based on the previous employment histories of top

executives at each rm. We dene a company to be connected if a senior manager held a high-

level government post prior to joining the rm. Information on top executive teams is provided

by companies' annual reports, based on year-end employment. To construct this measure, we

collected the resumes of senior managers for our sample of rms from Wind Information, the

largest vendor of raw nancial data in China. We focus on the backgrounds of the Chairman,

                           ,
Vice-Chairman, CEO and Vice-CEOs at each company, positions roughly equivalent to C-

suite executives at an American rm. These resumes provide employment histories, including

past positions in government. We dene a rm-year indicator variable,                       Connectedcy ,    to be

equal to one if a senior executive on December 31 of year                y-1   at rm   c   previously served as

mayor or vice-mayor (Tingju Ji in Chinese) in the city where the company is located, or

as a provincial or central government ocial of the same or higher rank.
                                                                                            10   In practice, over

90 percent of our connected executives came from the municipal bureaucracy, so we lack the

statistical power to examine the heterogeneous eects of connections based on the level of

government.

      We make a couple of observations about the timing of data on connections and accidents.

First, we measure connections at the beginning of each calendar year; the possibility of mid-

year executive turnover introduces classical measurement error in                  Connected, most plausibly
    10 Lower-level bureaucrats that run smaller sectors or departments within a municipality (Ke Ji    in Chinese)
would not necessarily outrank workplace safety authorities.

biasing our results downward. Second, the fact that we use beginning-of-year observations

on political connections - that necessarily precede accidents - will be particularly important

in the specications that include rm xed-eects, since it ensures that a new executive will

have been in place for at least a short period of time prior to the occurrence of fatal accidents

that we may attribute to his employment at the rm.

    Firms are not required to disclose workplace safety violations uncovered by regulators.

As a measure of safety enforcement - albeit an imperfect one - we collected safety violation

information using a media search of the WiseSearch (www.wisers.com) database.
                                                                                             11   We dene

Saf etyV iolcy       as an indicator variable denoting whether company      c   was reported for a major

safety violation in year        y.   This skews our list of violations toward relatively severe ones,

and also toward large and visible rms. As a second proxy of regulatory enforcement (which

simultaneously captures the extent of compliance), we collected a list of nes for environmental

violations for our sample rms from the Institute of Public & Environmental Aairs, a non-

prot organization located in Beijing.
                                             12   We dene an indicator variable   P ollutecy   to denote a

year   y   where rm    c was ned for environmental non-compliance.      For 87 rm-year observations

(5.6 percent of the sample) during 2008-2011, the Institute of Public and Environmental

Aairs listed no information in violations, so for regressions involving           Pollute   our sample is

comprised of 1388 observations. (Our results are insensitive to coding these as zeros.)

    During our sample period, the government held signicant ownership stakes in a number

of publicly traded rms, including many in our sample.                 Plausibly, the composition of a

company's top executive team is correlated with ownership status, so it is important to

control for government holdings. We dene            StateOwnership to be the fraction of equity held
by government entities of all levels (municipal, state, and central) either directly or through

state owned enterprises.         These data are taken from CSMAR at GTA, a Shenzhen-based

nancial data vendor.

    To examine the eects of regulator incentives, we dene the variable               N SN Ppy    to be a

province-year variable denoting whether province            p   had passed a No safety, no promotion

law in year     y.   We dene   N SN Ppy   as beginning in the rst full year that a law was in eect.

(Our results are insensitive to dening        NSNP    instead on the basis of the fraction of days that

a law was in eect during its year of passage.)

    Finally, we collected data to construct control variables, including stock price, return on as-

 11 We     rst use a combination of company name (including both the abbreviated name and the full name)
and some key Chinese words that refer to safety violations, specically: Anquan Shengchan, Xingzheng Chufa,
Fakuan, Tingchan, Zhengdun, Tingye, Zhenggai, Jinggao) to download all possible newspaper reports. This
produced 6265 stories which were then processed by research assistants at Nanjing University to manually
code information on safety violations, since some downloaded documents turned out to be false positives.

from a range of sources,      mainly media reports and from its cooperation with dierent branches of

sets (ROA), total assets, and investment (dened as the ratio of capital expenditure to total as-

sets) from CSMAR at GTA. We obtain total employment gures from Resset, a Beijing-based

nancial data vendor. For total assets, sales, and employment, we use gures from the begin-

ning of year   y, while we employ lagged values for the ow variables ROA and investment.   The

asset and employment gures are used to construct       CapIntcy = log(Assetscy /Employeescy ),
a measure of rm    c 's capital intensity in year y.
   Table 1A presents summary statistics for the rm-year panel data.          We further show

these summary statistics for the full sample split into politically connected and unconnected

rm-year observations in Table 1B. Of particular note, politically connected rms have, on

average, .084 worker deaths per 1,000 employees each year, whereas the comparable gure for

unconnected rms is 0.024 deaths per 1,000 employees. Politically connected rms are also

larger, as measured by employees or sales, an issue that we will take up in detail below. State

ownership is also correlated with political connections - the mean level of state ownership is

nearly 80 percent higher for    Connected = 1    rms. Connected rms are more protable, as

measured by return on assets, consistent with the prior literature on the value of political

ties. Finally, connected rms have signicantly higher rates of major safety violations, but as

we will see shortly this is simply due to the fact that fatalities - which are far higher among

connected rms - tend to trigger reports of safety violations.

   In Table 1C, we limit the sample to rms where there is variation in     Connected   over the

sample period 2008-2013, due either to the arrival or departure of a connected executive. For

this set of rms, which we dene as the       V ar(Connected) > 0   sample, dierences between

connected and unconnected rms are generated by executive turnover. Here we nd the two

groups are much more balanced on observables - connected and unconnected rms are of

similar size (based on employment or sales) and have comparable rates of investment (though

state-controlled rms employ connected executives a higher fraction of the time).       We still

nd, however, that connected rms are more protable, though the (unconditional) dierence

is signicant only at the 10 percent level. Further, the dierences in death rates remain large

and highly signicant in this subsample, a pattern that will be reected in our within-rm

regression results below. There is no signicant dierence in workplace violations between

connected and unconnected rms, though we show below that this gap is considerably wider

for rm-year observations where no fatalities occur.

   Before proceeding to the model that we will use to organize our results, we provide a

graphical overview of the main patterns in our data in Figures 2A and 2B, using the full sample

and the subsample of companies that have within-rm variation in        Connected   respectively.

For ease of exposition, we group together industries with fewer than 50 rm-year observations

in the category    Other.   The patterns are fairly similar across the two gures.     With the

exception of smelting non-ferrous materials, where fatalities are virtually non-existent, worker




                                                 13
mortality is higher in connected versus unconnected rms. This dierence is smallest for coal

mining. One possible reason for this is that given the relative isolation of coal mines, under-

reporting of fatalities is a more of a concern. This explanation is borne out in media reports

of rms - particularly those with ties to local governments - attempting to coerce victims'

families into maintaining silence (see, for example, Graft in China Covers Up Toll of Coal

Mines,    New York Times, April 10, 2009).


2      Theoretical framework
To provide a basic framework for our analysis, we present a simple Becker-style audit model

that captures many of the stylized facts that we document in our empirical analysis.             The

reader focused exclusively on our empirics may wish to proceed directly to Section 3.

     We employ a two period model of rm      i 's   production with xed (non-safety) costs (Ci )

and revenues (Ri ). At the beginning of period 1, rms make the decision of whether to hire

a connected executive and whether to shirk on safety expenditures, which are set at a level

si   mandated by regulators (and known to all parties). Production then takes place for two

periods.

     To begin, we make the extreme assumption that safety regulators' incentives are such

that unconnected rms     always   comply with requisite safety expenditures, while connected

rms never do. We will turn to the question of regulator incentives below, and endogenize

the compliance decision. The pay of unconnected executives is normalized to zero, and we

model connected executives as taking a share         Î±   of prots, which they earn as a result of the

cost savings they generate. We further simplify the analysis by modeling the probability of a

fatal accident as occuring with probability   p   for rms that fail to make safety expenditures

and zero for those that do. The cost of a fatal accident is a ne          F,   and we further assume

that following worker fatalities connected individuals lose their inuence (and hence are also

of no value to rms).     We presume that period 1 operations are unaected by fatalities,

eectively assuming that the accident occurs at the end of the period (or alternatively that

the repercussions only accrue at that point).

     We allow for rms to have diering costs of safety compliance, but drop subscripts for         R
and C to focus on heterogeneity based on safety costs.            This set of assumptions yields the

following two-period prots for connected versus unconnected rms:



           ï£±
           ï£²                       2(R â C â si ), if Connectedi = 0
E(Ïi ) =
           ï£³ (1 â Î±)(R â C) + p(R â C â s â F ) + (1 â p) [(1 â Î±)(R â C) â pF ] , if Connected = 1
                                         i                                                     i
                                                                                                   (1)




                                                  14
For unconnected rms, this expression is straightforward to interpret: prots are revenues

less total costs (non-safety and safety) in each period. For connected rms, the rst term is

operating prots in period 1.              If an accident occurs (with probability           p ),   the rm loses its

connection, earning           R â C â si   in the second period, and also paying a ne              F. If no accident
occurs, the rm maintains its connection, again earning                    (1 â Î±)(R â C),   and with probability

p   must pay a ne       F    if an accident occurs in period 2.

     A rm will hire a connected executive if            E(Ïi |Connected = 1)âE(Ïi |Connected = 0) â¥ 0,
i.e.,



                                               si â¥ (R â C)Î± + pF                                                     (2)


     This reductionist description of political connections has a number of properties  both

assumptions and predictions of the model  that we can evaluate in our empirical analyses:


    1. Based on the assumption that it is more costly to monitor connected rms, it follows

        immediately that connected rms shirk on safety at higher rates than unconnected

        rms.


    2. Also by assumption, connected rms are more protable, given that the value created

        by avoiding safety expenditures is split between the rm and the connected executive

        himself.


    3. Connections are more prevalent among rms that face higher safety costs since condition

        (1) is satised for a larger set of parameter values               {C, R, Î±}.

    4. An accident at a connected rm leads to a decline in expected prots, as a result of the

        ne incurred and loss of savings on safety costs in the second period.


We now incorporate regulator incentives into our model that will allow for partial auditing of

both connected and unconnected rms. This will help to provide an intuition for dierences

in the death rates and audit outcomes of connected versus unconnected rms, and how this

dierence is aected by increased costs (to the regulator) of non-compliance. Our approach

is in the spirit of a standard Becker (1974) deterrence model (and also related to public

nance models of tax auditing; see Andreoni et al (1998) for an overview), where an interior

solution requires mixed strategies by both auditors and rms.                      In our model, we represent

the probability that a rm of type             i   chooses to shirk on safety expenditures by                ri   and the

probability of an audit by          qi .
     We assume that a regulator faces an audit cost                   ai for auditing rm i. We       will denote the

audit cost as      anc   if   Connectedi = 0       and   ac   if   Connectedi = 1, and assume         that    anc < ac .
This dierence may be driven by the greater inuence costs to a regulator from auditing a




                                                              15
company run by a politically powerful individual.            Alternatively, well-connected businesses

may face lower transactions costs in bribing public ocials, as existing relationships (           Guanxi )
between connected CEOs and regulators will facilitate illicit transactions owing to a higher

level of trust (See Li (2011)) for an in-depth discussion ).

     This audit cost must be weighed against the career consequences of worker deaths that

may occur in the absence of safety compliance. We assume that both the decision by the rm

to shirk and the decision by the regulator to conduct an audit are made at the beginning

of period 1 (and apply to both periods), and denote the career cost to the regulator of a

fatal accident in any period by      Di .   We further assume that if a fatality occurs in period

1, the rm faces sucient scrutiny that in period 2, safety costs                si   are incurred and no

accidents take place.     Thus, retaining      p    as the probability of accident given shirking, in

a mixed strategy equilibrium the regulator's decision to audit is dictated by the equality

ri [pDi + (1 â p)pDi ] = ai ,   since the probability of a fatal accident occuring in period 1 is          p
while the probability in period 2 (conditional on no accident in period 1) is                (1 â p)p.   This

yields the following condition on the probability that rm         i   shirks:


                                                        ai
                                             ri â¤                                                         (3)
                                                    p(2 â p)Di
                                                                       a suciently high (or
     The expression holds with strict equality for mixed strategies. With

D suciently low), we obtain a corner solution where all rms of type i shirk and regulators
audit with probability zero.

     For an unconnected rm, the mixed strategy equilibrium requires that the audit rate                   qi
satisfy the condition that expected prots from shirking and compliance are equal, that is:




qi [2(R â C â si ) â F ]+(1âqi ) [(R â C) + p(R â C â si â F ) + (1 â p) [(R â C) â pF ]] = 2(RâCâsi )

     The rst bracketed term shows expected prots in the event that the rm is audited (iden-

tical to the prots under compliance, as an audited rm must pay a ne                   F   in addition to

incurring safety cost   si ) while the second term shows expected prots if no audit occurs (sim-
ilar to the expression for   Connected      rms in (1) above). This yields the following condition

on   qi :

                                      1             F
                                         =1+                                                              (4)
                                      qi     (si â pF )(2 â p)
     Since qi â (0, 1) a mixed strategy equilibrium may hold only with suciently high safety
costs such that si > pF . Assuming that this condition holds, expression (4) has a number

of intuitive properties: the audit rate qi is decreasing in the ne F, as rms will require less




                                                      16
frequent auditing if the consequences of getting caught are more severe; higher safety cost             si
results in a higher audit rate, as rms will be more tempted to shirk to avoid this cost; and

a higher accident probability reduces the probability of audit as rms will be more likely to

face penalties even in the absence of an audit.

   For connected rms, we rst consider the case where the audit cost              ac   for connected rms

is such that   ac â¥ p(2 â p)D   : this leads to a corner solution where connected rms shirk and

unconnected rms are in a mixed strategy equilibrium with audit probability and shirking

rate dened by (3) and (4).

   If the cost of fatalities to the auditor   D   increase such that connected rms are no longer at a

corner solution, then the model is no longer consistent with dierent audit rates for connected

versus unconnected rms, nor is it consistent with the higher protability of connected rms

(or higher pay for connected executives).           To see why this is the case, observe that for a

mixed strategy to be supported, a rm must be indierent between shirking and compliance.

But a connection generates value only when a rm decides to shirk (since its audit rate will

be lower).     Hence, in this second case we expect to see a convergence in audit rates               and
in protability of connected and unconnected rms. Further, once prots of connected and

unconnected rms converge, connected executives can no longer extract a higher share of

prots.

   Our model makes thus the following additional predictions that we may examine in the

data:


  1. If the cost of auditing connected rms,         ac ,   is initially very high (sucient to generate a

        zero audit corner solution), connected rms will receive very few nes, despite having

        higher accident probabilities.


  2. If the implementation of NSNP laws led to a large increase in             D, we may observe a large
        drop in worker deaths at connected rms and a convergence with the worker death rate

        at unconnected rms. This is the result of a shift among connected rms from corner

        solution to mixed strategy equilibrium.


  3. Following implementation of NSNP laws, prots at connected rms will converge with

        the prots of unconnected rms.


  4. Following implementation of NSNP laws, fewer rms will employ connected executives

        (and the pay of connected executives will decline), since connections no longer generate

        higher rm prots.


As we will show in our empirical results, the latter two predictions are not borne out in our

data: rms continue to hire connected executives after the implementation of NSNP laws,

and connected rms continue to earn a premium relative to unconnected rms in provinces



                                                     17
that institute stronger safety incentives. These patterns can be reconciled, however, with a

richer model that allows for substitution eects in how rms deploy their connections. We

present evidence in favor of such substitution eects in our empirical analysis below, as nes

for environmental violations go down      just among connected rms      following the passage of

NSNP laws. That is, instead of using connections to shirk on safety, rms use connections to

shirk on pollution abatement.




3    Empirical Results
3.1 Political connections, worker deaths, and rm prots
3.1.1 Connections and worker deaths
We begin by extending our analysis of the patterns revealed in Figure 2, relating         Connected
to worker fatalities, in a regression framework. Our baseline specication is as follows:




        Deathscy     = Î²0 + Î²1 Ã Connectedcy + Î²2 Ã StateOwnershipcy
                          +Î²3 Ã CapIntcy + Î²4 Ã ROAcyâ1 + Î²5 Ã log(Sales)cy                        (5)

                          +Î²6 Ã Investmentcyâ1 + Îµcy

    We include xed eects for year, industry, and province in most specications, and will

further augment these controls with rm xed-eects in some cases. In most of our specica-

tions, we will assume a normally distributed disturbance term. While we begin by showing

results with various monotonic transformations of      Deaths   as the outcome variable, for most

of our analyses we will focus on     DeathRatecy     (workplace deaths per 1,000 employees) as

our measure of workplace fatalities. Finally, to deal with concerns of unobserved dierences

between connected and unconnected rms, we also present results using the sample of compa-

nies that have within-rm variation in    Connected, where the eect of connections is identied
from executive turnover; we denote this set of rms as the      V ar(Connected) > 0      sample.

    Before turning to standard OLS specications, we rst show our main results in Table

2 using a count model for      Deaths,   assuming a negative binomial distribution (a Poisson

distribution is a poor t for the death distribution in the data). In all specications in all

tables, we cluster standard errors by rm. We begin with a specication with no covariates.

The coecient on   Connected   is very large in magnitude - its coecient of 1.953 implies a death
                                                                            1.953
incidence rate for connected companies that is just over 700 percent (e             ) of the baseline,

signicant at the 1 percent level.    Adding controls in column 2 reduces the coecient on

Connected   to 1.7754 (a 578 percent increase relative to baseline, signicant at the 1 percent

level), while the further addition of province, year, and industry xed eects has little impact




                                                18
on the coecient (column 3).            In column 4 we include rm xed-eects.               This demanding

specication limits our sample to those rms with at least one non-zero value of                        Deaths
(otherwise, the xed eect in our negative binomial estimation is undened). This yields a

smaller eect, albeit one that is still statistically signicant and large in magnitude, implying

that the death incidence rate for connected rms is 216 percent of the baseline. When we

employ the      V ar(Connected) > 0 sample, the coecient falls marginally to 1.52 (a 458 percent
increase relative to baseline), signicant at the 1 percent level, while adding rm xed eects

to this specication reduces the coecient on             Connected     to 0.855. It is noteworthy that no

other coecient, apart from our size proxy of           log(Sales), is consistently a signicant predictor
of   Deaths.
     We next present a set of OLS specications in Table 3, rst using                    log(1 + Deaths)    as

the dependent variable.          In column 1 we present results using the full set of controls in

Equation (5), as well as industry, year, and province xed eects. The coecient of 0.282 is

signcant at the 1 percent level; the coecient is virtually identical when we limit the sample

to   V ar(Connected) > 0 rms (column 2) and increases to 0.37 with the inclusion of rm xed
eects (column 3). In columns 4-6 we show results based on our preferred outcome variable

of   DeathRate    (deaths per 1,000 employees). The coecient on                Connected     is approximately

0.05 across all specications. Given the average             DeathRate     among     Connected = 0     rms of

0.024, this implies a worker death rate that is three times higher at connected rms. For the

V ar(Connected) > 0         sample, the mean      DeathRate    among unconnected rms is 0.039, so the

coecient on      Connected    implies a more than two-fold dierence in worker death rate. Finally,

in columns 7-9 we use         I(Deathscy > 0),     an indicator variable denoting at least one fatality

at rm    c   in year   y, as the dependent variable.    The coecient on       Connected     is in the range of

0.1 across all specications, though not signicant at conventional levels for the specication

using the     V ar(Connected) > 0 sample without rm xed eects (p =0.12).                In Appendix Table

A2, we provide an alternative approach to dealing with the diering attributes of connected

versus unconnected rms based on propensity score matching.                      This yields a dierence in

death rate that is comparable to what we nd in our OLS regressions. Finally, in Appendix

Table A3 we add industry-specic time trends to each of our specications; the coecient on

Connected      is virtually unchanged across all specications, indicating that dierential industry

trends are not responsible for our results.
                                                   13


3.1.2 Connections and regulatory enforcement
In our simple audit model, it is regulators' high cost of monitoring connected rms that

leads to more fatalities. As we explain in Section 1, rms are not required to disclose safety

violations, so we use cases of major government safety investigations reported in the media

 13 Our   results are also unchanged if we include controls for leverage or stock price volatility.




                                                        19
as our measure of enforcement actions.             We are interested, in particular, in dierences in

reported violations in years when no fatalities occur, since workplace deaths themselves may

trigger an audit.      In Table 4, we provide the crosstab of          Connected      andI(Deathscy > 0),
showing the average safety violation rate,           SafetyViol,    for the    V ar(Connected) > 0 sample
(violation rates are uniformly lower in the full sample, since                 SafetyViol   is correlated with

rm size). There are two striking patterns. First, in the absence of worker fatalities, there

is no public report of a safety violation when a rm employs a connected executive. In the

absence of a connection, the rate is 4.6 percent.              Owing to the small number of non-zero

observations, standard regression techniques are inappropriate for assessing this dierence.

We use Fisher's exact test to assess the dierence, which generates a p-value of 0.11.                      We

observe a very dierent pattern in rm-years when fatalities occur, when the rates of reported

safety violation are virtually identical for connected and unconnected rms (16 versus 15.8

percent).

   We also consider a second measure of the extent of monitoring based on whether a rm

was ned in year      y   for environmental noncompliance,          P ollutecy .   As with safety violations,

we focus on the      V ar(Connected) > 0        sample because the strong correlation between nes

and size raises particular concerns of balance in the connected and unconnected samples.

The raw dierence in         P ollute   between connected and unconnected rms is -0.099 (0.170

versus 0.071, p-value for the dierence in means is 0.02).
                                                                       14     In Table 5, we show that this

relationship remains signicant across various regression specications. Column 1 shows the

simple bivariate correlation between          Connected      and   Pollute.    The relationship is virtually

unchanged with the addition of controls for size, capital intensity, and so forth in column

2, while the further addition of year, industry, and province xed eects (column 3) reduces

the magnitude of the coecient on            Connected      to -0.071, signcant only at the 10 percent

level. But this, in a sense, may over-control for rm attributes - connections may be clustered

in industries (or provinces) where environmental or safety violations are common, and the

inclusion of xed eects absorbs this relevant between-industry or province variation.



3.1.3 Connections and rm prots
A nal prediction of our model is that connected rms enjoy higher protability as a result

of protection from regulatory oversight.            (It is important to note that, given the breadth

of benets that rms potentially extract from connections, shirking on safety regulation is

unlikely to be the only reason for greater protability.) In the rst two columns of Table 6,

we show that this pattern holds for both the full and              V ar(Connected) > 0       samples. For the

full sample, we nd that connections are associated with a 1.7 percentage point increase in

 14 There   is no dierence between the two groups for the full sample, resulting from the fact that unconnected
rms are much smaller on average than connected rms.




                                                       20
ROA (signicant at the 1 percent level),        while for the   V ar(Connected) > 0    sample the eect

is a 1.1 percentage point increase (about 20 percent), signicant at the 10 percent level..

   In columns 3-4, we more directly tie rm protability to our model of safety monitoring

by looking at prots in    y+1     as a function of both connections and its interaction with the

occurrence of worker fatalities in year    y.   The eect is     ex ante   ambiguous. In the organizing

framework we present above, if connected individuals lose their ability to circumvent costly

safety compliance after fatalities occur, then an accident should lead to a relatively large

prot decline among connected rms (and potentially the departure of connected executives,

whose connections are no longer valuable). A plausible alternative is that connections serve

to insulate rms from regulatory backlash following worker deaths, in which case one would

expect the value of well-connected rms to fare relatively well after an accident. (Similarly,

given the high accident rates at connected rms, a fatality represents a lesser surprise to the

market, and its eect should thus have been largely incorporated into market prices.)

   The data favor the 'loss of privilege' view of connections. For the full sample, the coecient

on the interaction term,   Connected â I(Deaths > 0),           is negative (signicant at the 1 percent

level) and of approximately the same magnitude as the direct eect of              Connected.   For the

V ar(Connected) > 0      sample, the interaction term is negative and nearly twice the size of

the direct eect of   Connected,   indicating that if an accident occurs at a connected company

in year   y,   in expectation prots will be lower in       y+1      than if it had been unconnected

in year   y.   (Our results in the previous section further argue against connections serving

to protect rms from regulatory backlash following worker deaths: while we observed zero

reports of workplace safety investigations (     SafetyViol ) at connected rms in the absence
of worker deaths, in years where fatal      accidents occur SafetyViol is identical for connected

and unconnected rms, suggesting that connections do not insulate rms from post-accident

regulatory responses.)

   As an alternative approach to studying the impact of accidents on protability, we also

look at market reaction to news of fatal accidents (which are, by denition, unexpected).

We dene the accident date as       t=1    and examine the subsequent change in share price as

this information is incorporated by investors.           In most cases the formal announcement of

worker deaths comes much later than the accident itself, so it is critical in our analyses to

allow for a fairly long event window. Further, for a number of cases, multiple fatal accidents

occur within a single month of one another for a single rm. These instances are clustered

in the construction industry, which has a very high accident rate: the 37 construction rms

in the sample generated 143 of the 284 identiable accidents in the dataset.                To prevent

double-counting of returns that follow multiple temporally adjacent accidents, we proceed

as follows: proceeding forward from each company's rst accident in the sample, we drop

accidents that occurred within 30 trading days of the initial accident. We then proceed to the




                                                    21
next accident (that has not been dropped) - by denition more than 30 trading days following

the rst - and repeat the process.    There are 41 instances of accidents clustered within 30

trading days, 33 in construction, and leads to the deletion of 64 observations (sometimes

more than two fatal accidents occurred within 30 trading days). We also dene a variable to

account for the full set of fatalities taking place at company    c   within a month following each

initial accident   a, M onthlyDeathsca .   Finally, we omit the 10 observations where trading

was suspended following the accident or insucient pre-event data were available to calculate

abnormal returns.

     In Figure 3, we present cumulative abnormal returns (CARs), estimated using a standard

four-factor model, i.e., Fama-French three factors and also the Carhart momentum factor,

over event windows of up to 30 trading days following each accident date.            Since the rate

of fatal accidents is much higher for connected rms, the event study sample has a higher

fraction of   Connected = 1   observations (24.8 percent of the total) relative to our rm-year

sample.

     We show CARs for the full sample and also for the sample divided based on         Connected.
For the full sample, there is only a very small negative market response following an accident.

For the subsample of    Connected = 0   rms, the average CARS from [1,1] to [1,30] are slightly

positive, though in no case signicantly dierent from zero. By contrast, for the     Connected =
1   subsample we observe a steady decline in rm value from the date of an accident. There is

good reason to expect this delay in investor response: in most cases, the fatalities were not

disclosed by the company at the time the accidents occurred, nor were they reported in the

media outlets covered by WiseSearch, so news may be slow to reach the market.

     The regression results in Table 7 echo the patterns observed in Figure 3 - politically con-

nected rms suer relatively large declines in market value following worker deaths, with the

decline increasing over the 30 trading days following each accident. Over a three day window

following an accident, connected rms decline by about 1.4 percent more than unconnected

rms do.      This dierence widens to more than 8 percent after 30 trading days.        The coef-

cient on   Connected   is signicant at least at the 10 percent level across all windows.     We

note additionally that total deaths in the 30 trading days after the accident is also negatively

correlated with returns, though the coecient on     log(M onthlyDeathsca )      does not approach

statistical signicance in any event window.

     In our model, we assume that connections lose their value after fatal accidents, and rms

no longer benet from employing them. More generally, it is very common in China for high-

level rings to take place following negative company news of any kind (see Yan (2004) among

many other media reports for a reference), further reinforcing the prediction that connected

executives (and any residual value they generate) will depart following a fatal accident.

     For a company that is politically connected in year   yâ1, we nd that the likelihood that the


                                                22
company is still connected in year         y   is 19 percentage points lower if a fatal accident occurred

during    yâ1     (64.0 percent versus 44.7 percent).          In Table 8, we examine the relationship

between worker deaths and the loss of political connections in a regression framework using

the following specication, which captures the relationship between fatalities in year                y -1 and
political connections at the beginning of year          y:


           Connectedcy         = Î²0 + Î²1 Ã I(Deathscyâ1 > 0) + Î²2 Ã Connectedcyâ1
                                    +Î²3 Ã CapIntcyâ1 + Î²4 Ã ROAcyâ1                                         (6)

                                    +Î²5 Ã log(Sales)cyâ1 + Î²6 Ã Investmentcyâ1 + Îµcy

    For the full sample, the coecient on          I(Deathscyâ1 > 0) in column 1 is -0.073 (signicant
at the 1 percent level) indicating that a rm is 7 percentage points less likely to be connected in

the year following a fatal accident. This sample includes many rms that are never connected

during 2008-2013; in column 2 we focus on the                  V ar(Connected > 0)       sample, where the

coecient on      I(Deathscyâ1 > 0)       is -0.248, and is virtually identical when we add rm xed

eects in column 3.
                          15
    In closing this section, it is important to note that while fatal accidents often trigger the

departure of connected individuals, executives themselves tend to fare well in the managerial

labor market after accidents occur. In the 26 instances in our sample where political connec-

tions are lost in the year following a fatal accident, we nd that in 19 cases the connected

individuals went on to take other high-level positions at other rms (in two cases at the parent

company to the listed rm). In four cases the connected manager retired completely (though

these executives were already in their late 50s) and in three cases the connected managers

went on to work at semi-governmental agencies.
                                                          16   The fact that connected executives do well

in the managerial labor market after presiding over workplace disasters can help to reconcile

the relative lack of concern for safety by connected managers with the fact that it often leads

to their dismissal.

    In summary, our analysis of the link between worker safety and rm prots indicates that,

while connected rms are more protable overall, this prot premium is lost following fatal

accidents.     These patterns are broadly consistent with the framework presented in Section

2, where connections are prot-enhancing in expectation, but lead to relatively low prots

  15 We   nd, in results not reported, that worker deaths are also correlated with the departure of other
(unconnected) executives. However, this relationship is statistically very weak (p-value=0.29), and controlling
for turnover of unconnected executives has no eect on the results we report in Table 8.
  16 These   patterns are consistent with other accounts of the careers of connected executives forced to depart
from companies in the wake of scandals: they often reappear a short while later in high-level positions at other
rms. One extreme example is that of Zhixing Gao, a former politician who, in 2001, served as vice-CEO of
Chenjiashan Coal when an accident at one of the company's mines killed 38 workers. He went on to serve
as CEO of Huangling Coal, where an explosion killed 24 miners in 2004. A number of such cases have been
documented by Chu (2008).

3.2 Main results - discussion
The fact that our results in Table 3 survive the inclusion of rm xed-eects raises the issue of

whether executives can reasonably produce such rapid changes in operational outcomes. We

begin by noting that the relatively rapid impact of top executives on rm-level outcomes is in

line with the earlier literature on CEO turnover. Bertrand and Schoar (2003), for example,

show that individual CEOs bring idiosyncratic nancial and operational styles to how they

run a company, a result that has been rearmed in subsequent work. Morten Bennedsen,

PÃ©rez-GonzÃ¡lez, Nielsen and Wolfenzon (2007) further nd large performance changes in a

dierence-in-dierences analysis of CEO transitions, consistent with the view that the impact

of leadership changes may be felt very quickly. Bloom et al (2013) provide an indication of

how such rapid change is possible: in their study, Indian textile rms randomly assigned to

be taught `better management' by consultants improved their total factor productivity by

over 20 percent, as a result of higher output and more ecient use of inventories.

   The scale of government-mandated safety funds provide some indication of the level of

savings that rms might (relatively quickly) achieve by shirking on compliance. As noted in

Section 1.1, construction rms are mandated to hold 2 percent of construction project costs for

safety compliance, coal mining rms an average of over 1 percent of revenues, and an average

of 0.7 percent of revenues in chemicals, the largest industry in our sample. If connections allow

rms to reduce these expenditures substantially, it may allow for a relatively rapid increase in

protability, albeit at a greater risk to workers. (While, as we observed earlier, rms maintain

political ties for multiple reasons, it is nonetheless noteworthy that construction and coal are

also the two sectors with the highest proportion of rms employing connected executives,

employing connected executives in 20 and 11 percent of rm-year observations respectively.)

   These gures also give some indication of whether the prot premium enjoyed by connected

rms could plausibly be accounted for in signicant part by savings on safety expenditures.

Recall that return on assets is approximately 1 percentage point higher for connected rms

in our   V ar(Connected) > 0   sample (the dierence in return on sales is marginally higher,

about 1.5 percentage points).    If connections allow rms to shirk on a sizable fraction of

their mandated safety funds, this alone may account for a reasonably large fraction of this

Connected   prot premium.     And this is only on the basis of reduced costs, whereas lower

compliance may also allow for increased output. (When we consider the relationship between

log(OperatingCosts)    and connections, controlling for sales, we nd that the cost margin

dominates, though our estimates of the revenue eect of connections are extremely noisy, so

we cannot rule out an impact on that margin as well.)




                                               24
   The higher protability of connected rms is also helpful in at least partially refuting one of

the most obvious alternative explanations for their poor safety records, namely that connected

executives are simply incompetent. If this were the case, one might expect connected rms to

earn lower prots as well. While this does not fully rule out the 'incompetence hypothesis',

the prot premium of connected rms does contradict the most straightforward form of it.

We return to this question below in our robustness section, where we will also look at the

educational qualications of connected executives.

   Finally, before proceeding to an analysis of the impact of regulator incentives on worker

deaths, we comment on the limits imposed by our focus on publicly traded rms, and our

emphasis on worker deaths rather than worker safety more broadly.           Both limitations are

imposed by data availability - we have been unable to obtain data on connections at private

rms, and rm-level data on injuries are unavailable even for publicly traded rms. As we

note in the Data section, worker deaths are likely much higher at private companies overall.

We do not, however, have a clear prediction as to whether the correlation between connections

and worker deaths is likely to be stronger or weaker among private rms. To the extent that

all publicly traded rms are more carefully scrutinized - regardless of their political ties - we

would expect that our results here underestimate the eect of political connections in the

broader sample of all Chinese rms. On the other hand, the high-level connections among

executives in our sample rms are likely to be very rare among (smaller) private rms. This

may bias upward our assessment of the positive link between connections and worker deaths.

   Apart from questions of data availability, we choose to study worker deaths rather than

injuries because it is a less gameable outcome - we will return to the issue of under-reporting

of deaths (which does occur) in the robustness section below, but note at this point that it is

generally more dicult to avoid disclosing deaths relative to injuries. There is reason to expect

that the two would be positively correlated, and indeed they are at the province-level. Using

province-year data on worker deaths and workplace injury claims from the China Labour

Statistical Yearbooks, we look at the death-injury 'elasticity' over the years 2006-2011.
                                                                                          17   In a

log-log specication including both province and year xed eects, the coecient on province-

level deaths is 0.20 (signcant at the 10 percent level) in predicting worker injuries, indicating

a positive relationship between the two, even after accounting for country-wide changes in

safety and province-level dierences in mix of industry and so forth (of course, if we omit

these controls the relationship is much, much stronger). Thus, while our focus in this paper

is on the extreme outcome of fatalities, deaths may plausibly be related to the broader social

cost of worker harm.

3.3 The eect of No Safety, No Promotion laws
We now examine whether the relationship between political connections and worker deaths

is aected by the existence of No safety, no promotion (NSNP) reforms that limited the

promotion opportunities of regulators who failed to meet safety targets. Plausibly, this made

it costlier for regulators to turn a blind eye to unsafe working conditions at a rm. As we

observed in our discussion of a standard audit model in Section 2, this may have a dispropor-

tionate impact on worker safety at connected rms if, prior to the passage of NSNP legislation,

they were largely unmonitored. For previously unmonitored rms, strengthened regulator in-

centives can cause a relatively large change in rm behavior as auditor and (connected) rm

switch from a corner (no-audit) solution to mixed strategies.

     As a preliminary overview of the data, in Table 9 we show the average of       DeathRate   for

company-year observations in provinces that, at some point during 2008-2013, pass a NSNP

law, disaggregated by   NSNP   status and   Connected.   In the rst column, we begin by simply

looking at whether worker deaths are lower after the passage of   NSNP. Overall, the death rate
is nearly 50 percent lower post-NSNP. This pattern is hard to distinguish from the secular

decline in worker deaths across the sample period: death rates dropped from 0.037 per 1,000

employees in 2008 to 0.011 in 2013.      In columns 2 and 3, we disaggregate these gures by

Connected    status (again for the sample of provinces that pass NSNP laws during our sample

period). Here, we nd that connected rms experience a decline in       DeathRate   of 86 percent,

as compared to just 30 percent for unconnected rms.

     In Table 10 we show that this disproportionate impact of NSNP laws on connected rms

holds in a regression framework. In column 1, we show results using the full sample and our

standard controls (including industry, year, and province xed eects).         The coecient on

Connected    is 0.079, about 65 percent higher than in the comparable specication in Table 3,

Column 4 which provides the average eect of connections on worker deaths for both NSNP

and non-NSNP rm-year observations. The coecient on          Connected*NSNP      is negative, sig-

nicant at the 1 percent level, and its value, -0.087, implies an eect of connections on worker

deaths for  N SN P = 1 observations of very close to     zero. In column 2 we limit the sample

to   V ar(Connected) > 0 rms and in column 3 we         add rm xed eects.      The pattern is

very similar across all specications - a large, positive direct eect of connections, and an

approximately osetting eect from the interaction       Connected*NSNP.      In Appendix Table

A4, we add a number of further robustness checks: we limit to sample to only provinces that

pass NSNP laws during 2008-2013; include province-specic time-trends, province-year xed

eects, and interaction controls for   Connected â log(GDP percapita)   and   log(Sales) â N SN P .
In all of these additional specications, the main results are virtually unchanged.

     If the value of connected executives is realized through their ability to circumvent safety

regulation, it follows that the prot premium of connected rms should decline after the



                                                26
passage of NSNP laws. To examine this possibility, we use       ROA    as the dependent variable

in columns 4-6 of Table 10.       The results are inconclusive:    while the coecient on   Con-
nected*NSNP       is insignicant in all specications, the standard error is large so we can say

little about the impact of NSNP on prots.        One reason that the impact of safety-focused

incentives on prots might be muted is because rms shift to deploying their connections to

other forms of rent-seeking. In columns 7-9, we use      Pollute   as the outcome variable. The

patterns in this set of regressions indicate that connected rms' lower rate of nes for envi-

ronmental violations documented in Table 5 comes entirely from       NSNP= 1   observations: the

direct eect of   Connected   in these specications is close to zero, while the coecient on the

interaction term indicates that for rms in     N SN P = 1   provinces, the rate of environmen-

tal nes at connected rms is about 15 percentage points lower than for unconnected rms

(though the dierence is no longer statistically signicant with the inclusion of rm xed

eects in column 9 (p-value of 0.12)).

   Overall, our results in this section indicate a large reduction in worker fatalities for con-

nected rms in provinces that pass NSNP laws; by contrast, there is virtually no eect of the

laws on unconnected rms.       Our analysis of the eect of NSNP laws on rm prots is too

noisy to draw any conclusions; however, we also argue that there is evidence that the prot

eects could be limited as rms shift to deploying their connections in other ways, notably

in evading enforcement of environmental regulations.



3.4 Identication concerns
One can rarely nd a source of essentially random variation in political ties across rms, so

we are limited to using observational data in this paper. This naturally limits the strength

of claims we may make around causation. In this section, we attempt to confront what we

view as the primary alternative explanations for the patterns we observe in the data. First,

the dierence in measured death rates between connected and unconnected rms may result

from dierential rates of under-reporting. Second, prior political experience may be correlated

with unobserved dierences in managerial attributes. Third, the selection of executives into

rms with high probability of worker deaths may result in an upward bias in our results if

companies hire former politicians in anticipation of future worker deaths.       We argue that,

while our ndings cannot rule out these alternatives, they are hard to reconcile with our full

set of results.

   Given that fatal accidents may lead to nes and invite greater scrutiny, rms may attempt

to cover up or otherwise under-report worker deaths. For example, a      New York Times   article

in 2009 describes the near-successful attempt by a mine owner in Hebei province to hide an

accident that killed 35 miners in 2008. (Since the mining company involved was not publicly




                                                27
traded, it is not in our dataset. This is a critical distinction, since publicly listed rms are

generally held to a higher degree of oversight and disclosure.)     Concerns of underreporting

may bias our results downward since, as the   Times   article suggests, it may be easier for well-

connected companies to avoid disclosing worker deaths. Our results are only biased upward

if well-connected companies face greater media or regulatory scrutiny.

   Our main approach to assessing whether our ndings are the result of dierences in dis-

closure for politically connected rms is to focus on severe (Deaths    â¥ 3)   accidents that are

more dicult - though not impossible - to hide from authorities and hence less subject to

underreporting.     We present these results in Table 11, which indicates - across a range of

specications - a robust, positive, and statistically signicant correlation between   Connected
and severe accidents.    Given the base rate of severe accidents for unconnected rms of 2.7

percent (4.9 percent in the   V ar(Connected) > 0    sample), the coecient on    Connected   im-

plies a rate of severe accidents that is more than three times higher for connected rms for

both the full and   V ar(Connected) > 0   samples. (It is also worth observing that the gap in

worker death rates between connected and unconnected rms is lower in mining industries

where, based on media reports, underreporting is of greater concern. This suggests that, if

anything, underreporting biases our results toward zero.)

   We next consider whether our results can plausibly be explained by dierences between

connected and unconnected executives in their competence or interest in dealing with worker

safety. It is unlikely that such unobserved dierences are driven by a general lack of managerial

acumen among connected managers. If this were the case, we would expect their rms to be

poorly run more broadly and hence less protable, whereas as previously noted we observe

higher prots at connected companies in the data.       Rather, we are concerned specically

with managers' ability to implement worker safety measures, and incentives aecting prot-

safety tradeos.    To explore the possible eect of the executives' competence in executing

worker safety, we included age and industry experience of executives as additional controls

in our regressions.   We argue that age proxies for seniority and experience, while industry

background captures an executive's familiarity with the industry's safety practices.       These

additional controls have little eect on our ndings.     Further, if connected executives are

chosen for risk-taking or are otherwise aggressive in their management style, we would not

expect rms under their control to be targeted with fewer nes or investigations for regulatory

infractions, as we document in Section 3.1.2.

   Connected executives could face additional incentives to shirk on regulations as a result

of future political career concerns, to the extent that connected managers are more likely to

seek public oce in the future. Jia and Nie (2012), for example, emphasize the incentives of

provincial governors to promote economic growth, even at the expense of worker safety. It is

important to note that the existence of such career concerns still leads to a positive eect of




                                                28
Connected   on worker mortality rates, which is broadly consistent with our thesis. In practice,

though, we believe the data are more easily reconciled with political ties making it easier for

rms to elude safety regulations, rather than generating direct incentives to reduce safety. A

standard career concerns model, as described in Jia and Nie (2012), would lead managers with

political aspirations to increase employment or output in the interests of economic growth,

rather than boosting prots, as we nd in our data.       We nd no evidence consistent with

the career concerns hypothesis in the data: neither employment nor sales is correlated with

connections in our   V ar(Connected) > 0   sample.

    A nal class of identication concerns relates to the selection of executives into rms

with diering worker safety risk proles. Firms may choose to hire connected executives to

manage the fallout if they anticipate workplace deaths in the future, perhaps as a result of

new projects or changes in safety policies; this would create an upward bias in our estimate

of the eect of connections on worker deaths. However, this selection story would also predict

a more muted impact of accidents on share price for connected rms, since this is exactly the

scenario for which connected executives have been hired. This contradicts the evidence we

report in Section 3.1.3.




4    Conclusion
In this paper, we document a robust positive correlation between the political ties of executives

and worker fatalities at publicly traded Chinese companies. This pattern holds in the cross

section and also for within-rm changes in political connections. Despite poor safety records,

connected rms are targeted less often for safety investigations or ned for environmental non-

compliance, and they are more protable than their unconnected counterparts. The impact of

No safety, no promotion laws indicate that strengthening regulators' incentives for oversight

may help to weaken the ability of connected rms to avoid costly safety compliance.

    Overall, we argue that our results are best explained by a simple audit model framework

where well-connected companies using their political relationships to circumvent safety over-

sight and regulation. By documenting the impact of business-politics ties on a high-stakes

social outcome - employee deaths - our results provide an important contribution to our

understanding of the impact of political connections on social welfare, and may serve as a

counterweight to the benign ecient grease view of corruption.

    We recognize that our empirical approach - based purely on observational data - has its

shortcomings, and we reiterate that one must take care in making any causal statements

based on our ndings.      The scarcity of available evidence is, however, some indication of

the diculty in studying the questions we confront in this paper.        Our ndings represent

only one small step in our eorts to better understand the welfare consequences of closer




                                               29
business-government relations.   Throughout the paper, we deliberately avoid making any

claims about overall welfare, as that would involve a much larger cost-benet assessment of

the role of political connections in Chinese commerce.    While we highlight the social costs

of this aspect of China's economic system, the country is by many measures one of history's

great development success stories.

   Yet we also do not see our paper as narrowly about the tragic consequences of workplace

fatalities for aected workers and their families. The stark dierence in safety outcomes at

connected rms may be, we suggest, representative of such rms' broader ability to circumvent

welfare-enhancing regulations, not simply skirt red tape. Similar opportunities may exist in

the many other domains where prot motives conict with social welfare - everything from

environmental oversight to food safety to predatory lending laws. The exploitation of political

ties by businesses may have rst-order negative welfare consequences. We hope that more

research, in China and elsewhere, can help to better understand the extent to which this is

in fact the case.

Data Appendix
Our nal dataset is comprised of 1475 rm-year observations (where we have 276 rms for

the period of 2008 to 2013), with a total of 1332 worker fatalities.   For the 193 rm-year

observations for construction rms, we obtain detailed accident level information from a

proprietary accident-level dataset obtained from the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural

Development of China (MHUDC). Construction rms are required to report any accident

involving fatalities to the MHUDC and have been required to do so since 2008. These accident-

level data were matched by name to our sample of listed rms. 35 Construction companies

contribute a total of 292 deaths (out of a total of 1332 deaths).

   For the remaining 1282 (non-construction) rm-year observations , worker fatality in-

formation was available via company reports or the State Administration of Worker Safety

(SAWS) website (http://media.chinasafety.gov.cn:8090/iSystem/shigumain.jsp) in 1225 cases.

In 14 instances, the SAWS website failed to provide full accident-level information, while in

25 cases the company failed to provide details on worker fatalities.

   Among the 1186 observations where data were available from both sources, the two lined

up very closely, with slightly higher fatality gures based on company reports. Where dis-

crepancies exist, we rely on the (higher) rm-reported gures. The total discrepancy between

the two sources is 38 deaths across 14 rm-year observations. The 14 observations with no

data from government sources contributed 18 deaths to our sample, while the 25 rm-year

observations with no company data contributed 57 deaths.

   For the remaining 57 rm-year observations (57 = 1475  193  1225), across 16 rms,

death information was not found in government websites or company reports. In these cases,

we supplement our data using a media search based on the WiseSearch (www.wisers.com)

database. These 57 rm-year observations contribute 11 deaths to our full-sample total of

1332, a reported death rate that is far lower than that of rm-year observations from ocial

or company sources.

Notes: All variables are at the rm-year level, and includes the sample of rms where there is variation in        Connected during our
sample period (the Var(Connected)>0 sample), a total of 325 observations.     Deaths is rm-level worker fatalities per year; I(Deaths>0)
is an indicator variable denoting at least one fatality in a rm-year observation; DeathRate is equal to 1000*(Deaths/Employment );
Severe is an indicator variable denoting at least three fatalities from one accident in a rm-year observation; Connected is a rm-year
indicator variable, equal to one if a senior executive at the rm previously served as mayor or vice-mayor in the city (Tingju Ji
in Chinese) where the rm is located or as a provincial or central government ocial of the same or higher rank;               StateOwnership is
the ratio of state shares to total outstanding shares;    CapInt   is log value of the ratio of total assets to total employees;       NSNP is a
province-year variable denoting whether a province had passed a no safety, no promotion law in a previous                 year; SafetyViol is an
indicator variable denoting whether a rm was reported in the media for safety violations;          Pollute   indicates rm-year observations
where the rm was ned for environmental violations.

Notes: All variables are at the rm-year level.            Deaths   is rm-level worker fatalities per year;       Connected    is a rm-year indicator
variable, equal to one if a senior executive at the rm previously served as mayor or vice-mayor in the city (Tingju Ji in Chinese)
where the rm is located or as a provincial or central government ocial of the same or higher rank;                  CapInt is log value of the ratio
of total assets to total employees;    Investment       is the ratio of capital expenditure to total assets;     StateOwnership is the ratio of state
shares to total outstanding shares.         Var(Ct'd)>0 denotes that we limit the sample to rms               where there is variation in Connected
over the sample period 2008-2013, due either to the arrival or departure of a connected executive. Robust standard errors are in
parentheses; with the exception of columns 4 and 6 standard errors are clustered at the rm-level.

Notes: A standard OLS model is used to estimate the impact of political connections on CARs. CARs[1,K] is the cumulative abnormal
event return, estimated using a standard Fama-French-Carhart four-factor model, over the window of [1,K] where the accident day
is set as 1;   Connected   is a rm-year indicator variable, equal to one if a senior executive at the rm previously served as mayor or
vice-mayor in the city (Tingju Ji in Chinese) where the rm is located or as a provincial or central government ocial of the same
or higher rank; log(  MonthlyDeaths ) is the log value of the total deaths that take place within a month of each initial accident.   Robust
standard errors, clustered at the rm-level, are in parentheses.

indicator variable, equal to one if a senior executive at the rm previously served as mayor or vice-mayor in the city (Tingju Ji in Chinese) where the rm is located or
as a provincial or central government ocial of the same or higher rank;              CapInt   is log value of the ratio of total assets to total employees;      Investment     is the ratio of capital
expenditure to total assets;   StateOwnership      is the ratio of state shares to total outstanding shares;         NSNP   is a province-year variable denoting whether a province had passed
a no safety, no promotion law in a previous year;        Pollute indicates rm-year observations where the rm was ned for environmental violations; Var(Ct'd)>0 denotes that
we limit the sample to rms where there is variation in        Connected over the sample period 2008-2013, due either to the arrival or departure of a connected executive. Robust

Notes: Since 2004, China has followed a safety production quota system, whereby the central government assigns a death quota
to each province, and the provincial government allocates the quota among municipalities. In response, provinces began adopting no
safety, no promotion policies that made promotion of safety regulators and other local government ocials contingent on meeting
the safety production target set for their region by the provincial government. Guodoing was the rst province to adopt this policy
in 2005, while others followed suit only in recent years. Deaths is the number of worker deaths among rms in our sample. Firm-year
obs is the number of observations that rms based in each province contribute to our sample. Population is province population in
2005. GDP P.C. is income per capita in 2005. Both population and income gures are obtained from CSMAR Regioual Economy
Database.

Notes: Stata codes come from Sascha Becker and Andrea Ichino (2002). ATT stands for Average Treatment Eect on the Treated.
Bootstrap replication number is set at 100 in each case. A logit model is used in the propensity score test, where rms are matched
on these dimensions: log(Sales), ROA, log(Employment), Investment and SIC-1 digit industry. The Epanechinikov kernel is used in
the kernel matching where the bandwidth is set at 0.04, smaller than the default value of 0.06.

Notes: All variables are at the rm-year level. All specications include industry-specic time trends.                   Deaths      is rm-level worker fatalities per year;     DeathRate     is equal to
1000*(Deaths/Employment ); Connected            is a rm-year indicator variable, equal to one if a senior executive at the rm previously served as mayor or vice-mayor in the city
(Tingju Ji in Chinese) where the rm is located or as a provincial or central government ocial of the same or higher rank;                       CapInt     is log value of the ratio of total assets to
total employees;   Investment   is the ratio of capital expenditure to total assets;    StateOwnership       is the ratio of state shares to total outstanding shares.
                                                                                                                                                                     NSNP is a province-year
variable denoting whether a province had passed a no safety, no promotion law in a previous year;                       Pollute indicates rm-year observations where the rm was ned for
environmental violations. Var(Ct'd)>0 denotes that we limit the sample to rms where there is                       variation in Connected over the sample period 2008-2013, due either to the
arrival or departure of a connected executive. Robust standard errors, clustered at the rm-level, are in parentheses.

served as mayor or vice-mayor in the city (Tingju Ji in Chinese) where the rm is located or as a provincial or central government
ocial of the same or higher rank;        CapInt   is log value of the ratio of total assets to total employees Robust standard errors, clustered
at the rm-level, are in parentheses.
