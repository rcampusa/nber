     This paper uses new statistical estimates to compare two views of inter-

national capital mobility.   With perfect world capital mobility, there would

be little or no relation between the amount of saving generated in a country

and the domestic investment in that country.       In contrast, if portfolio

preferences and institutional rigidities impede the flow of long-term capital

among countries, increases in domestic saving would be reflected primarily in

additional domestic investment.     The statistical evidence presented here on

the relation between domestic investment and saving implies that the truth lies

closer to the second view than to the first.       International differences in

domestic savings rates among major industrial countries have resulted in almost

equal corresponding differences in domestic investment rates.

     The paper discusses the compatability of this evidence with the obvious

international mobility of short-term liquid capital and with the existence of

substantial international flows of long-term portfolio and direct investments.

There is a brief discussion of the relevance of the new evidence for the

optimal national saving policy and for the analysis of tax incidence.

     How internationally mobile is the world's supply of capital?       Does

capital flow among industrial countries to equalize the yield to investors?

Alternatively, does the saving that originates in a country remain to be

invested there?     Or does the truth lie somewhere between these two extremes?

The answers to these questions are not only important for understanding the

international capital market but are also critical for analyzing a wide range

of issues including the nation's optimal rate of saving and the incidence of

tax changes.



1.   International Capital Mobility:     Significance and Limitations


     Before turning to our empirical analysis, it is useful to consider in

more detail the implication of international capital mobility for these major

questions of policy and analysis.      Consider first the problem of determining

an optimal savings policy.     In a closed economy, the national return on addi-

tional saving is the domestic marginal product of capital.      The question of

whether the government should pursue policies to increase the saving rate is

therefore equivalent to deciding whether this domestic marginal product of
                                                                          1
capital offers a high enough reward to justify postponing consumption.

Although the net yield that individual investors receive is lowered by taxes

on capital income, the nation as a whole receives both the after-tax yield

and the tax revenue; it is this pretax marginal product of capital that

should influence national saving policy in a closed economy.

    In contrast, if capital is perfectly mobile between countries, most of

any incremental saving will leave the home country (if it is already a capital

exporter) or will replace other foreign source capital that would otherwise

be invested in the home country (if it is already a capital importer).        In

this case, the yield to the home country on the additional saving is only the

net-of-tax return received by the investor and not the pretax marginal

product of capital.    If the additional saving is invested abroad, the foreign

governments collect the additional tax revenue.      If the additional saving

reduces capital imports into the home country, the tax revenue of the domestic

government remains unchanged and national income rises only by the after-tax

return to investors.   Since after-tax real yields are only about 50 percent

of the pretax yield, the optimal savings policy is likely to depend critically

on whether the "closed economy" or the "perfect world capital market" is a
                                   2
better approximation to reality.       For the United States, a pre-tax yield of

10 to 12 percent may be a convincing reason for more saving while a post-tax

yield of 5 to 6 percent may be much less compelling.



    lThis argument is discussed in Feldstein (1977); Feldstein and Summers
(1977) estimate that the domestic marginal product of corporate capital is
between 10 percent and 12 percent.
    2
     The issue is more complex if there are no capital flows but trade flows
respond to changes in domestic factor proportions.

         The extent of capital mobility is also crucial for the analysis of tax

     incidence.    In the modern literature on public finance, the theoretical and
                                                                            1
     empirical studies of tax incidence have assumed a closed economy.          It is

     easy to see, however, that the results obtained in such an analysis would be

     radically altered by replacing this assumption with a model of perfect capital

    mobility.     For example, in the familiar model of a closed economy with a

     fixed capital stock, a tax on the income of all capital used in production

     is borne completely by the owners of capital.       But if capital is free to

     leave the country, a very large part of the burden could be shifted to domestic

\. 1 a b or an d to f oreign capl.ta
                                . 1 owners. 2     Similarly, a corporate income tax
i
    would tend to be borne less by capital and more by domestic labor to the

    extent that capital is freely mobile across national boundaries.        Moreover,

, labor's ability to shift a tax on labor income to domestic owners of capital

    \by a reduction in labor supply would be less if capital is free to escape
     \
    abroad.     Statistical evidence in favor of the complete world capital mobility

    assumption would thus require a major revision of our theories of tax

    .incidence.

         The view that capital flows among countries to equate net-of-tax rates of

    return seems at first to be the most reasonable.         It is clear from the yields

    on short-term securities in the Eurocurrency market and the forward prices of

     those currencies that liquid financial capital moves very rapidly to arbitrage

     such short-term international yield differentials.       Unfortunately, similar

    measures of expected real net-of-tax yields on long-term portfolio capital



        lThis is true of both static and dynamic analyses. See, among others,
    Harberger (1962), Shoven and Whalley (1972), Feldstein (1974) and Miezkowski
    (1969) â€¢

                                              l
 or direct investments cannot be observed.        It nevertheless may seem plausible

 that long-term capital movements would also equalize net-of-tax yields since

 the failure to do so would leave unexploited opportunities for profit.         There

 are however reasons to be skeptical about the extent of such long-term arbi-

 trage. .First, the assumption that investment will flow to the highest

 yielding opportunity is only one extreme form of the portfolio theory of

 investment.     More generally, since the risks of investing in different coun-

 tries and currencies are not perfectly correlated, individual and corporate

 investors will tend to choose a portfolio in which expected yields are.not

 equal.   For most investors, the uncertainties and risks associated with

 foreign investment are perceived as so great that investment is restricted

 to the domestic economy.     These risk aversion considerations become increas-

 ingly important for longer-term and less liquid investments, implying that

 short-term liquid asset arbitrage is consistent with much less mobile long-
                 2
 term capital.       If the aggregate portfolio demand functions are not very

 sensitive to yield differentials, major changes in national saving rates or



      lHarberger (1978) has estimated rates of return on the total capital
  stock for a number of countries, including underdeveloped as well as indus-
  trial countries. There is only moderate variation among these estimated
  rates; the range among developed countries is between 4.4%
  8.5%.     Unfortunately, these estimated returns include the return on the
  housing capital stock which is largely imputation rather than market evidence;
  since housing accounts for roughly half of fixed capital, the overall return
  will be quite sensitive to the return that local national income accountants
 (impute on housing. Harberger provides no evidence on the relative importance
(of capital flows, trade flows and domestic savings responses in any movement
 '~oward an equalizing of rates of return.

     2Even if long-term capital is not internationally mobile, the yields on
 long-term assets could be equalized indirectly if short-term assets are arbi-
 traged internationally and assets of all maturities are arbitraged domestically.
 But even within domestic markets, such arbitraging is far from perfect because
 of portfolio considerations. An inflow of short-term capital is thus likely
 to widen the differential between short and long domestic interest rates and
 to limit itself by depressing the forward discount on the domestic currency.

in tax rates can occur without inducing substantial international capital
         1
flows.

    Second, even if all investors were well informed and eager to seek the

highest yield without regard to risk, the full mobility of capital would be

impeded by official restrictions on the export of capital.   Moreover, the

fear of future capital export controls by potential host countries or adverse

changes in their taxation of foreign investment may deter investors from

putting capital there.

    Third, important institutional rigidities   also tend to keep a large

segment of domestic saving at home.   The most obvious of these in the United

States is the saving institutions that are required by law to be invested in

mortgages on local real estate.   American insurance companies and some other

financial institutions have large liabilities that are denominated in dollars

and therefore seek to limit their risk by investing in dollar assets.   Pension

funds and other fiduciaries that are legally governed by the "prudent man"
                                          2
rule may be unwilling to invest abroad.

   'Vinally, there is indirect evidence in the pattern of investment flows

that capital does not move to maximize each investor's net-of-tax return.

Because of international differences in tax rules and the interaction of



    IEliminating international yield differentials would not, of course,
require all investors to be willing to invest wherever the expected yield is
highest. Yields could be arbitraged if sufficient capital were invested on a
yield maximizing basis. But the existence of some risk neutral investors is
obviously not sufficient for arbitrage; they could specialize their investment
while yield differentials persist.

    2If these restrictions prevent households from taking advantage of very
much higher yields abroad, thrift institutions and other restricted inter-
mediaries would lose deposits in favor of higher yielding alternatives. More-
over, these restricted funds are irrelevant if there are enough mobile funds
"at the margin"; see preceding footnote.

foreign and domestic taxation, net return maximization implies a very

different pattern of investment flows from what it would imply if there were

no taxes.    Without taxes, the gross returns would be equal in all countries

and each individual investor would be indifferent about where he places his

funds.    But with existing tax rules, investors should specialize their

investment in a particular country that is often different from the investor's
                1
home country.       The absence of such specialization is an indication that

portfolio considerations or restrictions on capital movement prevent capital

from flowing to maximize each investor's net return.

    Much of the direct investment in foreign markets appears to be associated

with implementing marketing strategies, exploiting production knowledge, or

overcoming trade restrictions rather than with an undifferentiated pursuit of
                         2
profit opportunities.        This is probably the major reason why individual
                                                           3
countries are both importers and exporters of capital.          It implies that

substantial flows of direct investment may exist even if they are not respon-

sive to changes in domestic taxation or relative capital supplies.

    In the end, the issue must be settled empirically.         The current paper

provides direct evidence on the relationship between domestic savings and



    lFor example, a u.s. individual who wishes to invest in bonds and believes
that purchasing power parity will prevail in the long-run and that Germany
will have a lower rate of inflation should invest in German bonds but not in
U.S. bonds because the return that comes in the form of the appreciation of
the dollar value of the principal of the bond will be taxed as capital gains
rather than ordinary income; equal pre-tax yields imply different post-tax
yields. If market forces make pre-tax yields unequal, some u.s. investors
would maximize total net yield by specializing in German bonds while others
would maximize total net yield by specializing in U.S. bonds.

        See Caves (1971) for a discussion of these reasons for foreign investment.

    3Hartman (1978) provides striking evidence that the U.S. both exports
capital to and receives comparable amounts of investment from a number of
major countries.

international capital flows.   The statistical estimates indicate that nearly

all of incremental saving remains in the country of origin.     These results are

quite incompatible with the assumption of complete arbitrage in a perfect

world capital market.   Large flows of liquid capital may arbitrage short-term

interest rates while direct investment flows may exploit profitable sales

opportunities, but additions to the domestic supply of capital do not appear

to move abroad in search of the maximum return.     The next section of this

paper discusses the method of statistical measurement that we have used to

analyze this question and describes the data.     The basic results and a number

of extensions are presented in section 3.     The fourth section disaggregates

both saving and investment into household, corporate and government sectors.

Separate time series results for individual countries are discussed in section

5.   The implications of the results are considered in a brief concluding

section.

2.   Specification and Data


     This paper uses data on the major industrial countries to measure the

extent to which a higher domestic saving rate in a country is associated

with a higher rate of domestic investment.       With perfect world capital

mobility, there should be no relation between domestic saving and domestic

investment:   saving in each country responds to the worldwide opportunities

for investment while investment in that country is financed by the worldwide

pool of capital.    Conversely, if incremental saving tends to be invested in

the country of origin, differences among countries in investment rates should

correspond closely to differences in saving rates.

     There is in fact substantial variation in domestic saving rates among the

DECD countries that are the focus of the study.       For the period 1960 to 1974

as a whole, the ratio of gross domestic saving to gross domestic product
                                                                              1
averaged 0.250 for the 21 DECD countries for which data are available.            This

saving rate varied from a high of 0.372 in Japan to a low of 0.184 in the

United Kingdom.    The standard deviation was 0.045.

     The pattern of high and low savings rate countries has remained quite

stable over this period.      To measure this stability, we divided the sample

into three five-year periods and calculated the correlation of saving rates

between pairs of sample periods.      Between 1960-64 and 1965-69, the saving

rate correlation is 0.974.      For 1965-69 and 1970-74, the correlation is 0.931.

Finally between 1960-64 and 1970-74, the correlation is 0.895.




    lThe four DECD countries for which data      for the full 15 year period are
not available are Iceland, Portugal, Turkey      and Yugoslavia. The year 1974
was the most recent one for which data were      available when this study began.
The data used in the study are published in      DECD (1976).

    The corresponding ratios of gross domestic investment to gross domestic

product also show substantial variation among countries and a stable pattern

over time.       Among the 21 DEeD countries, the l5-year average gross investment

ratio had a mean of 0.254 and a standard deviation of 0.041.       The correlations

among the investment ratios in the three 5-year periods are: 0.937 between

1960-64 and 1965-69, 0.884 between 1965-69 and 1970-74, and 0.864 between

1960-64 and 1970-74.

    The mean savings and investment ratios from the full 15 year period are

presented in the first two columns of Table 1.

    To assess the relation between savings rates and investment rates we

estimated equations of the form:




where (I/Y). is the ratio of gross domestic investment to gross domestic
             ~


product in country i and (S/Y)i is the corresponding ratio of gross domestic

saving to gross domestic product.       Results are presented in the next section

using average ratios for the entire period as well as for subperiods.       Other

specifications with additional variables are also discussed.       Before turning

to these more general specifications, it is useful to discuss the interpre-

tation of this basic equation.

   With perfect world capital mobility, an increase in the saving rate in

country i would cause an increase in investment in all countries; the distri-

bution of    thQ~cremental    capital among countries would vary positively with

each country's initial capital stock and inversely with the elas-

ticity of the country's marginal product of capital schedule.       In the extreme

case in which country i is infinitesimally small relative to the world

economy, the value of S implied by perfect world capital mobility would be

zero.   But even for a relatively large country, the value of S would only be

of the order of magnitude of its share of total world capital.     The true value

of S would thus vary among the DEeD countries but would average less than 0.10.

    In contrast, estimates of S close to one would indicate that most of the

incremental saving in each country has remained there.     Note that a finding

that S is close to one might reflect the fact that domestic saving and

domestic investment are both stimulated by a high rate of return but that

this interpretation is inconsistent with the hypothesis of perfect world

capital mobility; with perfect capital mobility, the domestic saving rate

does not depend on the domestic investment opportunities.     Note also that the

assumption of perfect capital mobility is inconsistent with the traditional

Keynesian interpretation that exogenous changes in the level of investment

cause income to vary until the resulting savings level equals investment;

whatever the validity of this argument for a closed economy, it is inappro-

priate if domestic saving is added to the worldwide pool of capital.     It is

of course possible that a high observed value of S could reflect other common

causes of the variation in both saving and investment.     The findings of a

high value of S would however be strong evidence against the hypothesis of

perfect world capital mobility and would place on the defenders of that

hypothesis the burden of identifying such common causal factors.

    Although equation 1 measures the extent of world-wide capital mobility by

analyzing domestic saving and investment, the equation can also be interpreted

in terms of foreign investment flows.     Since the excess of gross domestic

investment over gross domestic saving is equal to the net inflow of foreign
                                       - 12 -



investment,l a regression of the ratio of net foreign investment inflow to

GDP on the domestic savings ratio would have a coefficient of 8-1.         Testing

the hypothesis that B equals one is therefore equivalent to testing the hypo-

thesis that the international capital flows do not depend on domestic savings

rates.

       It is important to stress that the identity of national saving and invest-

ment does not imply equality of    domesti~   saving and. investment.   Because of

international capital flows, domestic saving and investment can differ for

very long periods of time.     For example, during much of the nineteenth century,

British domestic saving exceeded domestic investment while Britain invested

abroad.     The third column of Table 1 shows the average difference between

domestic saving and domestic investment as a fraction of GDP in each country

over the 15 year sample period.     The average absolute value of these differ-

ences was 1.3 percent of GDP and their standard deviation was 1.5 percent of

GDP.     The fourth column of Table 1 presents the 15 year averages of the

differences between saving and investment expressed as a percentage of saving.

The absolute differences averaged 5.2 percent of gross saving with a standard

deviation of 6.1 percent.

       Our analysis focuses on gross saving and investment rather than savings

and investment net of depreciation for two basic reasons.        First, it is the

gross flow of savings that is, in principle, free to move from country to

country in response to yield differentials.       Second, the accounting defini-

tions of depreciation are very imperfect, especially when there is significant

inflation; errors of measurement in the depreciation estimates would cause a


       1Exce~t
            for the official statistical discrepency. It also follows from
the national income identities that the net inflow of foreign investment is
equal to the current account deficit.

spurious correlation between net saving and investment.    Net investment is

nevertheless of interest because it is equivalent to the growth of the capital

stock.   Although the results presented in the following sections generally

deal with gross saving and investment, all of the coefficients have also been

estimated for net flows as well.    The parameter estimates are quite similar.

The coefficients based on net flows are generally slightly higher, reflecting

the common measurement error noted above.

    From the basic sample of 21 OEeD countries for which data are available

for all years between 1960 and 1974, five have been deleted because they
                                                                      l
switched their method of national income accounting during the period.     When

some of the regressions were estimated using the entire 21 country sample,

the coefficients were very similar to the sample of 16 countries that had an

un~hanged   accounting method.   The analysis of the disaggregated components

of saving and investment by sectors in section 4 requires a further reduction

in the sample because of the limited data provided by some countries.

 3.   Basic Results


      The basic estimates of equation 1 are presented in Table 2.     The estimate

 of S for the entire 15 year sample is 0.89 (s.e.=0.07) when gross saving and

 investment are used and 0.94 (s.e.=0.09) when net saving and investment are

 used.   Neither coefficient is significantly different from one while both are

 obviously incompatible with the hypothesis that the true value of        B is zero.
 The coefficients for each of the five-year subperiods is similar to the

 overall coefficient.     In short, the evidence strongly contradicts the hypo-

 thesis of perfect world capital mobility and indicates that most of any

 incremental saving tends to remain in the country in which the saving is done.

i/The substantial international capital flows that exist thus do not appear to

"""respond to international differences in saving rates.

      The savings rate coefficients based on the net flows are higher than the

 corresponding coefficients based on gross flows.      As we indicated in the

 previous section, errors in measuring depreciation are likely to cause a

 spurious correlation that causes an upward bias in the net flow coefficients.

 A consistent estimate can nevertheless be obtained with instrumental variable

 estimation by using as an instrument a variable that is correlated with net

 saving but uncorre1ated with the measurement error in depreciation.         The

 obvious candidate for this variable is the gross saving rate since it involves

 no estimate of depreciation but is likely to be highly      corre1~ted   with true

 net saving.     The instrumental variable estimates of   B are all lower than the
 ordinary least squares estimates of Table 2 but the difference is never as

 large as 0.1.     For the overall 15 year period, the coefficient falls from

 0.938 (s.e.=0.091) to 0.867 (s.e.=0.102).       Thus using instrumental variable

 estimation does not alter the conclusion that domestic investment absorbs

nearly all of the international differences in saving rates.

    The linear approximation of equation 1 is clearly a simplification.      It is

of course possible that the link between domestic saving and domestic invest-

ment becomes weaker as the saving rate increases.     To assess this, we esti-

mated a quadratic generalization of equation 1.     The coefficient of the

squared value of sly is always statistically insignificant and positive.     For

the entire 15 year period, the coefficient of this variable is 0.432 with a

standard error of 1.146.   There is clearly no indication of nonlinearity.

    As we noted above, the high coefficient in the relation between domestic

investment and domestic saving may reflect the impact of some third variable.

According to the life cycle theory of saving, the most important exogenous
                                                                              1
determinant of the aggregate saving rate is the rate of population growth.

A higher rate of population growth might also increase the rate of investment.

However, adding the mean annual growth rate of population as an additional

variable in equation 1 had almost no effect on the estimated value of S; the

coefficient of the growth variable was itself very small and statistically

quite insignificant.   There may of course be other variables that independently

influence both saving and investment; although we do not pursue this question

here, further analysis would clearly be desirable.

    We have also examined the possibility that the link between domestic

investment and domestic saving varies with the degree of openness of the

economy.   It seems plausible that small economies that engage in substantial

international trade will have a much weaker link between domestic saving and

domestic investment than large and nearly autarchic   economies~   We therefore


    1
     The rate of per capita income growth should also have an important
impact on saving and possibly investment but this cannot be regarded as
exogenous in the current context.

estimated an extension of equation 1 in which the value of 6 is permitted to

vary with a measure of the openness of the economy:




where Xi represents a measure of the openness or closedness of the economy.

Our first measure of openness is the share of trade in GDP as measured by the

sum of exports and imports per dollar of GDP.      The estimates of 6 are
                                                                     1
negative as expected but very small and not significantly different from

zero.   For the 15 year period as a whole, 61 = -0.033 with a standard error

of 0.071.   The results for the individual subperiods are similar.         As an

alternate measure we used the size of the economy based on the reasoning that

a large economy is more likely to be self-contained and therefore to invest a

higher share of its savings domestically.      We used the logarithm of GDP to

~easure   size so that the variance of the variable would not be dominated by

the few largest observations.   With Xi defined in this way, 6 was expected
                                                              1
to be positive.   All of the estimates of 6 were however negative; although
                                           1
they differed from zero in a statistically significant way, the coefficient

estimates are very small.   For the 15 year period, 6
                                                        o
                                                            = 0.999   with a   standar~


error of 0.075.    In short, while the link between domestic saving and invest-

ment may vary among countries, we found no evidence that it varied in relation

to either the size of the economy or the importance of international trade.

    This completes the description of our analysis of the aggregate cross-

country estimates.   They provide evidence that is clearly incompatible with

the hypothesis of a perfectly mobile world capital stock that flows among

countries to equalize yields.   Although there may be perfect arbitrage of

short-term yields and substantial flows of long-term direct and portfolio
                                    - 18 -



investment, there appear to be sufficient rigidities and locational prefer-

ences to keep most of any incremental saving invested in the country of

origin.

4.    Components of Saving and Investment


      For 9 of the countries, the OECD disaggregates total saving into th,ree
                                                                            1
components: household saving, corporate saving and government saving.

This disaggregation is important because it makes it possible to see whether

domestic investment is equally responsive to all types of saving.        To the

extent that this is so, it is less likely that the high value of S represents

some unobserved factor that increases both saving and investment.        The

sensitivity of total investment to the different types of saving is also

relevant for assessing policies that are designed to increase investment by

stimulating forms of saving.    The data for these countries also permit separ-

ating public and private investment and, within private investment, distin-

guishing household and corporate investment.

      In place of equation 1 we have therefore estimated

where SH is household saving, Â·SC is corporate saving        and SG is government

saving.    This equation is also estimated with total investment replaced by

private investment or corporate investment.

      The results are presented in Table 3; the corresponding estimates based

on aggregate saving for these countries are presented for comparison.           The

general picture that emerges from these estimates is that there is not a

major difference among the three types of saving in their conttÂ·ibu tion to

total investment or total private investment.       However at the more disaggregate

institutions serving households; corporate saving includes saving by corporate
and quasi-corporate enterprises (including public).

level of corporate investment, there may be intranational barriers or portfolio

preferences that make corporate investment more responsive to corporate

saving than to other sources of funds.

    Consider first the response of total gross investment.    The coefficient

of the aggregate rate is 0.957; the coefficients of household and government

saving are slightly higher than this (1.17 and 1.12) while the coefficient of

corporate saving is substantially lower (0.55).   However, with the small

sample of only 9 countries, these differences are not statistically signifi-

cant.   The F-statistic for the hypothesis that the three coefficients are

equal is only 4.5 and therefore less than the 5 percent critical value of 5.8.

The coefficients for total net investment are even closer to each other and

clearly do not differ in a statistically significant way.    The results for

private saving are quite similar to the results for total saving: although

there is some variation among the coefficients, the differences are not

statistically significant.

    Gross corporate investment appears to be most sensitive to gross corporate

saving and substantially less sensitive to household and government saving.

With the net concepts of investment and saving, the pattern is the same but

the differences among the coefficients are smaller and not statistically

significant.   The apparently greater sensitivity of corporate investment to

corporate saving may reflect institutional rigidities or portfolio preferences

within national economies.   Alternatively, the large coefficient may indicate

that corporations choose to save more in countries where corporate investment

is greater.    In either case, the evidence is inconsistent with the hypothesis

of perfect world capital mobility.

5.    Some Time Series Evidence


      The evidence based on the cross-section of countries reflects the long-

term adjustment of domestic investment rates to the relatively stable differ-

ences in savings rates among countries.           Domestic investment may be much less

responsive to short-run variations in saving and a larger share of such

temporary changes in saving amy be reflected in international capital flows.

Because of the national income identities, this is equivalent to stating that

a larger share of the short-run fluctuations in the saving rate is reflected

in changes in imports and exports that alter the current account balance of

payments.
   ,

      We have examined this question in two different ways: by relating changes

in investment to changes in saving, and by estimating individual time series

equations for each country.       Equation 4 shows the result of the first

approach:                          I

where (1/Y)70,i is the average ratio of investment to income in country i

during the period 1970 through 1974, (1/Y)60,i is the corresponding average

for the period 1960.through 1969, and the savings ratios are defined in

similar ways.      Although the coefficient of 0.724 is somewhat lower than

estimated long-run value discussed in section 3, the difference is not very

substantial.       This evidence implies that domestic investment rates adjust

    Time series equations t based on annual observations for 1960 through 1974,

were estimated for 21 countries.    In addition to the basic specification of

equation 1, we estimated an equation in which the investment rate was related

to both the savings rate and the current cyclical condition of the economy as
                                                     1
measured by the ratio of actual GNP to trend GNP.        Table 4 presents the

estimated coefficients of the savings rate variable for both specifications.

    The individual savings coefficients average 0.64, quite similar to the

estimate in equation 4 based on changes in savings.       There is, however,

substantial variation among the individual countries.       In 6 of the 21 coun-
                                          2
tries, a two-thirds confidence interva1       contains zero while in 9 other coun-

tries it includes unity.   The coefficients for the United States, Germany and

France are all close to one and do not differ from one in a statistically

significant way.    Beyond that, it is difficult to discern any particular

patterns in the coefficients.   Further analysis of these differences would

clearly be desirable but would take us beyond the current paper's aim of

assessing the general validity of the perfect capital mobility hypothesis.

    In concluding this section, it is important to emphasize that these time-

series coefficients reflect short-run responses and are not comparable to the

long-run equilibrium responses indicated by the cross-section coefficients

of previous sections.   The difference between the short-run and long-run

responses may reflect both lags in the response of physical investment and

the desire of financial institutions to keep transitory changes in saving

in a liquid form.   More research on the transition between the short-run

6.   Conclusion


     This paper has compared two views of the relation between domestic saving

and world capital mobility.    With perfect world capital mobility, there is

little or no relation between the domestic investment in a country and the

amount of savings generated in that country.     In contrast, if portfolio

preferences and institutional rigidities impede the flow of long-term capital       ~


among countries, increases in domestic saving will be reflected primarily in

additional domestic investment.     The statistical evidence presented here on

the relation between domestic investment and saving implies that the truth

lies closer to the second view than to the first.     International differences

in domestic savings rates among major industrial countries have resulted in

almost equal corresponding differences in domestic investment rates.

     It is important to emphasize that this conclusion is compatible with the

obvious international mobility of short-term liquid capital.     While a small

part of the total world capital stock is held in liquid form and is available

to eliminate short-term interest rate differentials, most capital is appar-

ently not available for such arbitrage-type activity among long-term invest-

ments.   Similarly, our finding of the very close link between domestic saving

and investment does not conflict with the existence of substantial interna-

tional flows of long-term portfolio and direct investments.    Much of the

direct investment is     made in foreign countries to enhance trade positions

or to take advantage of special knowledge; such investment will not be

sensitive to differences in savings rates or relative capital intensities.

While some direct and portfolio investments are made in pursuit of higher

yields per   ~,   the extent of such investment is apparently limited by   insti~


tutional barriers and portfolio preferences.

              As the introductory section of this paper indicated, the evidence against

     world capital mobility and in favor of a close relation between domestic

     investment and saving is important in a number of ways.       First and most

     directly, it sheds light on the true nature of the world capital market and

     the character of existing long-term capital movements.       Second, it confirms

     that it is appropriate, at least as an approximation, to study income distri-

     bution in general and tax incidence in particular with models that ignore

     international capital mobility.       Finally, the evidence implies that the

\ national return on domestic saving is approximately equal to the pretax
 \

     \~omestic marginal product of capital since such saving does increase the
      \
          ~
     domestic capital stock rather than either flowing abroad or replacing foreign

     investment at home.
