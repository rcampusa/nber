We construct a new quarterly data set of international capital flows broken down by sector:
banks, corporates and sovereigns. Using our novel data set, we establish several key facts that
demonstrate the importance of distinguishing in- and outflows by the domestic sectoral identity.
We find that public sector flows may serve as a countervailing force to private sector flows,
especially in emerging markets (EMs), as these flows respond differently not only to country-
specific fundamentals but also to global shocks. The high inflow-outflow correlation observed in
total capital flow data is driven by within-sector flows, especially those of AE banks. In general,
inflows and outflows of AEs and inflows to EMs are primarily AE banks’ transactions, and, as a
consequence, respond similarly to capital flow drivers. By contrast, EM outflows respond
differently to global shocks and changes in fundamentals, leading to lower inflow-outflows
correlations for EMs.

1     Introduction

The history of financial crises has taught us that the vulnerability to external shocks can vary
greatly depending on which economic sector(s) are on the receiving side of capital inflows.
Sovereign debt proved to be the Achilles’ heel in the Latin American crises, while private
sector debt financed by capital inflows was the key source of fragility in the Asian financial
crises. During the global financial crisis of 2008 (GFC), in the US, the culprit was the domestic
household debt held by global banks. By contrast, in the European debt crisis of 2010-12,
sovereigns’ and banks’ external borrowing took the center stage.
    In spite of this anecdotal evidence, breakdowns of gross capital flows by sector have re-
ceived little attention in the empirical literature due to lack of data for a large set of countries
and a long time period at the business cycle frequency. Our paper fills this gap by constructing
a new comprehensive dataset based on residency principle for gross capital inflows and out-
flows at the quarterly frequency. We include a much larger set of countries than all the other
publicly available datasets for quarterly capital flows, featuring a balanced panel of 85 coun-
tries for inflows and 31 countries for outflows, starting in 1996 and decomposing both inflows
and outflows by the borrowing and lending domestic sector, (e.g. inflows into the corporate
sector of a country, outflows from the banking sector of the country, etc.).1 We focus on debt
flows, rather than equity, as debt flows constitute the lion share of aggregate capital flows
during the period we study, as we document.
    Our approach is fundamentally different than standard decomposition of capital flows by
instruments and asset classes, such as portfolio equity and debt flows or other investment
flows. Corporates can borrow using all these instruments (equity, bonds and loans), whereas
sovereigns most typically issue bonds. For our purposes, what matters is the identity of the
borrower and the lender, rather than instruments through which the borrowing and lending
is done. Our dataset on capital flows by sector provides new insights into the dynamic deter-
minants of capital flows, sheds light on the ultimate risk bearing agents, and highlights stark
differences between private and public borrowers and domestic and foreign lenders by sector.
    Using our dataset, we document several important stylized facts. We find that public sector
    1 Asin the standard residency principle based balance of payments data (BOP data), in our data, inflows and
outflows are on net basis, where inflows refer to the (changes in) positions of non-residents and outflows refer to
the (changes in) positions of residents. Thus, negative inflows mean foreign investors are ”leaving” the country
by divesting and negative outflows mean domestic residents are reducing their external assets.



                                                        1
flows may serve as a countervailing force to private sector flows, especially in EMs. This is be-
cause, in EMs, public sector flows are countercylical whereas bank and corporate sectors flows
are procyclical.2 In addition, EM public sector flows respond to global shocks in the opposite
direction to private flows.3 In AEs, public sector flows are procyclical and they do not respond
to global shocks. Furthermore, we find that global shocks and country-specific GDP growth
explain less of the variation in capital flows after the 2008 crisis, due to lower flows by AE
banks and EM corporates. However, EM banks’ flows still correlate strongly with both global
shocks and GDP after GFC.4 Lastly, we show that the correlation between capital inflows and
outflows is driven by within sector flows, particularly those of AE banks. To establish our styl-
ized facts about the drivers of flows, we run separate quarterly panel regressions of flows on
countries’ own lagged GDP growth (pull factor) and global shocks/financial conditions using
the VIX index (push factor) with country fixed effects, identifying from the within variation.5
    In terms of capital outflows, flows from banks and corporates in AEs respond negatively
to global shocks. In EMs, however, it is bank and public outflows that respond significantly.
For domestic cycles, only AE banks’ outflows are procyclical. Outflows from EM investors do
not systematically respond to the domestic cycle for any sector, with the possible exception of
the public sector. This is an important result, since it implies that during a downturn/crisis
in a given emerging market, domestic private agents do not bring their investment back (re-
trench) to their own country. During stress periods, when foreigners flee from EMs, it is the
sovereigns who may provide much needed risk sharing. However, during a downturn in ad-
vanced economies, it is their banks that bring funds back to the country, helping to offset the
shock.
   2 Aguiar    and Amador (2011), Gourinchas and Jeanne (2013), and Alfaro, Kalemli-Özcan, and Volosovych
(2014) separate public and private flows at annual frequency and show that they move in opposite direction
as a function of country-specific growth. They focus on net flows and show that a country may run a current
account surplus during episodes of high growth, but private sector might be borrowing on net at the same time.
Focusing on asset class only, Ju and Wei (2010), who show that FDI can flow in on net and reserves can flow out
on net.
    3 Horn, Reinhart, and Trebesch (2020) show a similar result in 200 years of data where when private inflows

leave during wars, natural disasters and financial crises, official flows to sovereign borrowers come in.
    4 This is consistent with Amiti, McGuire, and Weinstein (2018), who find that the common factor in interna-

tional bank lending strongly diminished after the 2008 crisis, indicating that global push factors now have less
influence. We show that this is due to diminished role of AE banks in international capital flows.
    5 Several papers document that gross flows respond systematically to changes in global conditions. See Forbes

and Warnock (2012), Milesi-Ferretti and Tille (2011), Cerutti, Claessens, and Puy (2015), Broner, Didier, Erce,
and Schmukler (2013), J. Caballero (2016), Obstfeld (2012), Catão and Milesi-Ferretti (2014), Borio and Disyatat
(2011), Lane (2013), Cerutti, Claessens, and Rose (2018), and Barrot and Servén (2018), Rey (2013), Nier, Sedik,
and Mondino (2014). Our contribution to this literature is that we show the patterns found by this literature are
driven by flows in and out of banks and corporates.

    The recent COVID-19 crisis clearly illustrates the importance of separating capital flows by
sector. It will take some time before the official balance of payments (BOP) data for this period
is available. Nevertheless, commercial data sources with real-time data provide some insight.
Such sources with only portfolio flow data have shown stark outflows from emerging markets
since late February 2020, largely in equities.6 Most of these sources have limited coverage of
countries and instruments (not capturing the massive amounts of loan flows, important for
EMs), can have differing definitions from BOP flows, and do not provide a split of the flows
by sector.
    For 34 emerging markets, Figure 1 plots capital flows by non-residents to corporate, bank,
and sovereign sectors during the GFC and Taper Tantrum on the left and mid panels and dur-
ing COVID-19 on the right panel. We use our data (constructed in this paper) for the previous
crises. For COVID-19 crisis, we utilize recently released BIS international debt securities (IDS)
statistics in conjunction with syndicated loan data from Dealogic to capture both bond and
loan flows for a large set of countries, defined comparably to BOP and split the flows by sec-
tor. Each bar denotes the change in non-resident inflows between the plotted quarter and the
average of the previous two quarters.
    All of those crises teach the same lesson: during external shocks, capital flows out of EMs
vary significantly by the borrowing sector. There are differences, however, in the ranking of
sectors. During the GFC and Taper Tantrum, foreign investors pulled out of domestic bank-
ing sectors most, as well as the corporate sectors to a certain extent. However, adjustments
to debt flows were limited during the COVID-19 shock. If anything, they were mostly out of
the sovereign sector, as flows to the banking sector held stable. Since this data is mainly for
the first quarter of 2020, it also includes large inflows into EMs (especially to corporates) in
January and February before the crisis fully took hold. Updated data for the second quarter of
2020 may reveal larger declines in inflows, including to banks, as experienced during previous
crises. Since COVID is mainly a health shock affecting first the real economy, it might propa-
   6 Data   from EPFR and IIF suggest a retrenchment of approximately $100 billion in emerging market
portfolio equity and roughly $20 billion in emerging market portfolio bonds since February 2020. See
https://www.ft.com/content/8562417c-63c4-11ea-b3f3-fe4680ea68b5 and IMF (2020). IIF data is for a very lim-
ited set of countries. IIF collects real time data either through central banks who report real time portfolio flows or
use fund level data from Bloomberg. For example, for bond flows, IIF only includes India, Indonesia, Thailand,
South Africa, Hungary, Turkey, Mexico, Poland, and Ukraine. For countries whose data is not available, IIF does
a valuation adjustment to stocks to nowcast the portfolio flows. EPFR data solely relies on investment funds and
hence does not coincide with the residency based capital flows (outflows from a fund can be both by domestic
and foreign investors and may not correspond to outflows by non-residents from a country).

gate differently then previous episodes that were financial shocks. Foreign investors may also
expect higher sovereign defaults given the limited fiscal space of many EM governments, and
hence leaving sovereign bond market first. The bottom line is that capital flows show different
patterns across borrowing sectors depending on the shock, which is an important factor for
detecting vulnerabilities related to capital flows.7

    the given quarter from the average of the previous two quarters for 34 EMs, expressed in billions USD.
Figures 1a and 1b use our constructed data on net inflows by sector. Figure 1c plots net international bond and
   syndicated loan issuance by sector for the same set of countries from BIS IDS and Dealogic, respectively.


    The standard data on capital inflows and outflow are from the BOP Statistics of the IMF.
This data are organized by instrument (portfolio debt and equity flows, other investment flows
and FDI) rather than by borrowing and lending sector (banks, corporates and sovereigns). Our
dataset takes the IMF/BOP data as the base and combines this with several publicly available
sources from other institutions (BIS and World Bank) in order to create the new dataset on
inflows and outflows by sector instead of by instrument. Although IMF/BOP reports some
data by sector during recent years, this breakdown is largely missing before 2005, especially
for EMs. Our dataset has much broader coverage of developing countries and emerging mar-
kets at the quarterly frequency. The set of countries in our balanced 85 country panel of capital
inflows data includes 25 advanced, 34 emerging, and 26 developing economies from 1996q1
   7 Appendix   Figure C1 shows the flows in each quarter instead of looking at changes in flows relative to previ-
ous quarters. The message is the same where capital outflows during previous crises were out of banks, whereas
for COVID, foreign investors reduced their investment in sovereign debt first (together with equities). We also
plot portfolio debt flows from IIF and EPFR data in appendix Figure C2. This data shows a much larger change
in net portfolio debt inflows in 2020q1 compared to the previous 2 quarters (around -30 billion). This discrepancy
compared to Figure 1c is due to several possible reasons: we include loans in addition to portfolio debt; we have
a more comprehensive set of emerging markets (34) compared to IIF (9) and EPFR (19); and EPFR data captures
flows of EM debt in and out of investment funds by any investor, which may not reflect cross-border residency
based flows that we plot (e.g. one fund sells the security to another cross-border investor).

to 2014q4. At the annual frequency, we have 89 countries for inflows, adding 4 more devel-
oping economies. For capital outflows data we have a balanced panel of 16 advanced and 15
emerging economies for 2004q1–2014q4. This data is less populated because foreign assets of
residents are poorly recorded.8
   We focus on debt flows by sector as we document that this is the largest asset class in
international capital flows, in spite of all the advances made in increasing portfolio equity and
FDI flows in the last decade. We also include flows of official reserves and FDI debt inflows.
The literature focuses on analyzing flows of portfolio debt (e.g., bonds) and other investment
debt (e.g. loans, deposits, trade credit, etc.), whereas we separate these asset classes by sectors,
adding bonds and loans as both instruments used to borrow by banks and corporates.
   There are number of interesting features of the allocation of capital flows and stocks by
sector. Banks owe the lion’s share of the external debt for advanced countries, but in emerging
markets the outstanding external debt stocks are split roughly equally between banks, corpo-
rates and sovereigns. Additionally, while most of the portfolio debt in advanced economies
is due to corporate borrowing and most of the non-portfolio debt is due to bank borrowers,
this pattern changes when examining emerging markets. There, sovereigns account for most
of the portfolio debt owed, while banks and corporates roughly split the other investment
debt. These new findings underlie the importance of loans rather than bonds for the external
borrowing of the private sector in emerging markets.
   On the asset side, we find that sovereigns are the main lending sector for emerging mar-
kets, mainly due to their accumulation of reserve assets, while corporates in all countries typ-
ically lend externally via portfolio debt. Advanced economy banks do most of the lending
in other investment debt, but in emerging markets the total is split again between banks and
corporates. These data patterns, and others we discuss throughout the paper, highlight the im-
portance of separating external debt liabilities and debt assets by sector for a more complete
understanding of the drivers of capital flows and lead us to a re-evaluation of conventional
stylized facts on capital flows.9
   In terms of our contribution to the literature, most of the literature focuses on net capital
   8 For total outflows one can have of course more countries but our aim here is to decompose outflows by banks,

corporates and sovereigns as we do inflows. We combine the general government and central bank sectors into a
single public sector in order to increase data coverage for outflows.
   9 There is also a literature that studies the long-term movements in gross capital flows that culminates into

long-term external asset and liability positions such as Gourinchas and Rey (2007); Lane and Milesi-Ferretti
(2001); Obstfeld (2012). We focus on capital flow dynamics at the quarterly business cycle frequency.


                                                       5
flows defined as purchases of domestic assets by foreign agents minus purchases of foreign
assets by domestic agents. There have been recent papers, such as Forbes and Warnock (2012),
Broner et al. (2013), and Davis and van Wincoop (2017), that focus on gross inflows and out-
flows separately—that is capital inflows by foreign agents and capital outflows by domestic
agents—but no paper separated these gross inflows by foreigners and gross outflows by do-
mestics into borrowing and lending by sectors, that is by banks, corporates and sovereigns
before our paper. The existing literature on gross capital flows has found a high degree of
correlation between capital inflows and outflows and an increase in this correlation over time.
Some of these papers show that both capital inflows and outflows are procyclical. We docu-
ment that the positive correlation between aggregate capital inflows and outflows is driven by
within sector flows, especially the borrowing and lending patterns of AE banks. We note also
that AE banks were the only sector to be procyclical in both its inflows and outflows. While
the behavior of cross border activities of banks has been extensively studied, to our knowledge
we are the first to show that the sectoral correlations of capital flows and document the impor-
tance of AE banks for this result.10 In general, inflows and outflows of AEs and inflows to EMs
are primarily driven by AE investors and so respond similarly to various capital flow drivers.
However, EM outflows are determined by EM investors, and so respond differently to vari-
ous drivers of capital flows. This difference in the inflow and outflow behavior from different
investors leads to lower inflow-outflow correlations in EM, especially for private flows.
   Overall, our results provide important insights into the nature of capital flows. We show
that our findings cannot be documented using only raw BOP data. The facts and relationships
we document stand in contrast to standard international macroeconomic models, which treat
domestic and foreign investors symmetrically and ignore the sectoral identities of the flow
recipient/lender. As we discuss in the conclusion, our findings are consistent with models not
only including financial frictions and financial shocks, but also deviate from a representative
agent framework that allows accounting for the different behavior investors and borrowers.
   The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the construction and
coverage of our data; Section 3 illustrates descriptive patterns; Section 4 presents the results
from our empirical analysis; Section 5 discusses the theoretical implications and concludes.
  10 A few papers have documented how the internal capital markets of global banks can lead to a correlation of
cross-border inflows and outflows for banks (e.g. Cetorelli and Goldberg (2012)), but these have been limited to
the banking sector, while ignoring other types of capital flows.

2      A New Dataset for Capital Flows Research

We construct a new dataset for capital flows research that disaggregates inflows to and out-
flows from a country by sector in the domestic economy. We focus mainly on debt flows,
which account for a substantial portion of international capital flows as we document below.
We construct the dataset by taking the existing BOP data and performing internal and exter-
nal data filling exercises. This enables us to keep the residency principle and to expand the
coverage of our dataset at the same time. Our dataset’s coverage surpasses all the other pub-
licly available statistics, dramatically, in terms of both countries and time. Our methodology
is similar to that of the capital flight literature, that also uses techniques of internal filling with
the BOP and external filling with other datasets in order to identify unreported private capital
outflows from a country (Chang, Claessens, & Cumby, 1997; Claessens & Naudé, 1993).
     As a preview of our dataset and to illustrate the importance of our analysis, Figure 2 il-
lustrates the size of debt in total external liabilities, as well as the breakdown of outstanding
stocks by sector. The figure shows time series of the composition of external liability stocks
to illustrate the relative importance of the different components.11 Panel (a) shows the share
of total debt in total external liabilities.    12   Debt represents the majority of external liabilities
globally. In AEs, debt liabilities are 62 percent of external liabilities, whereas this number is
51 percent in EMs on average during our sample period. Panel (b) highlights that other in-
vestment debt (usually bank loans) accounts for the bulk of external debt stocks. Portfolio
debt (bonds) in panel (c) represents nearly half of AE external debt and around a third of EM
external debt. Thus, it is important to consider both types of external debt.
     Employing our new dataset, panels (d)-(i) highlight the sectoral share of external debt
stocks for each flow type and country group. In AE, banks account for the lion’s share of
external debt liabilities, whereas in EM, corporates, banks and sovereigns have more or less
equal shares. This is interesting since in general it is thought that firms and governments
would directly access international capital markets more in AE than in EM. One interpreta-
tion is that banks do most of the intermediation of external funds in AE, while corporates and
sovereigns might be borrowing more domestically. Perhaps more surprising, the conventional
    11 The
        flow version of this figure delivers a similar picture, though more noisy, and is shown in Figure C3 in
Appendix C.
  12 Due to missing data for equity, we restrict our sample to 46 countries and a shorter time period in order to

show trends from a balanced sample for panel (a).

wisdom that other investment debt is primarily owed by banks and portfolio debt is primarily
owed by corporates holds for AE but not for EM. In the latter, most of the portfolio debt is
attributable to sovereigns, while banks and corporates have equal shares in other investment
debt.
    The composition of external debt is remarkably stable over time, with few exceptions.13
  13 In these figures we use a balanced sample over time (where every country has data for all sectors for every
period) to prevent entry/exit of countries into the sample from distorting the time series patterns of the compo-
sition of debt.

The share of other investment debt in total external liabilities is decreasing and the share of
portfolio debt is increasing in AE over time. This seems to be partly driven by the global
financial crisis: in these countries, the share of bank-held debt (mostly other investment debt)
declines and that of sovereign debt (mostly portfolio debt) increases following the crisis. For
EM, sector shares are more stable over time, although during the pre-crisis period there is a
small decline in the share of debt in total inflows.
   Figure 3 shows the counterpart of Figure 2 for the composition of external asset stocks
in debt instruments, including reserves.14 Panel (a) shows the share of debt in total external
assets. Debt assets represents the majority of external assets; 70 percent in EM and 60 percent
in AE on average during 2000s, though the share of debt assets in total external assets is on
a declining trend for both set of countries. Panel (b) highlights that other investment debt
accounts for the bulk of debt asset stocks in AE, whereas portfolio debt assets in panel (c)
represents only 40 percent of the AE economies external debt assets. For EM, other investment
debt assets represent half of the external debt assets, portfolio debt assets are not important,
and the remainder consists of reserves.
   Panels (d)-(i) highlight the sectoral share of external debt asset stocks for each flow type and
country group. In EM the public sector is overwhelmingly the main lender to other countries.
This is primarily driven by their accumulation of reserve assets, which are included in the total
debt figure. In AE, as is the case for borrowing, banks do the lion’s share of external lending
in loans, while corporates also have a big share of AE lending in portfolio debt assets. For
EM, banks and corporates do about an equal share of lending in other investment debt, while
corporates lead in terms of portfolio debt. The composition of external debt assets is also very
stable over time, as in the case of debt liabilities.
   To the best of our knowledge, there are no other papers and datasets examining capital
flows by sector for all the sectors with an extensive coverage of countries and a long time pe-
riod since 1996 at the quarterly frequency. Milesi-Ferretti and Tille (2011) and Cerutti et al.
(2015) separate out the banking sector within the other investment debt category of the BOP
to analyze it on its own, but not in tandem with the other sectors and other capital flow asset
classes. Other studies examining gross capital inflows using only BOP data sometimes exclude
official reserves and IMF credit (and sometimes central bank loans) in order to focus on pri-

the advanced and emerging groups (exclusive of countries in the developing group) are included.

vate inflows (see Forbes and Warnock (2012), Bluedorn, Duttagupta, Guajardo, and Topalova
(2013), and Milesi-Ferretti and Tille (2011), Bluedorn et al. (2013), for example). Given the
substantial amount of public sector debt under portfolio securities, the above studies will still
have public flows as they do not separate portfolio debt into private and public sectors.
    The closest papers to our paper are Arslanalp and Tsuda (2014b) and Arslanalp and Tsuda
(2014a). These papers decompose sovereign/government loan and bond debt by creditor.
They employ the IMF and World Bank’s Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) data to

                                                        10
distinguish between foreign and domestic creditors. They also use BIS data to identify exter-
nal bank lenders, similar to our approach (described below and in Appendix B). Their exer-
cise is only for the sovereign sector and starts in 2005, whereas we consider all three sectors;
sovereigns, banks, corporates and start in 1996.
   We do not break down portfolio (non-FDI) equity flows by sector, due to the lack of avail-
able external datasets with which to fill in the missing data. We do however consider FDI
debt inflows in our sector decomposition. Galstyan, Lane, Mehigan, and Mercado (2016) use
data starting only after 2013 from the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS)
to examine portfolio debt and portfolio equity stocks by the sectoral identity of the issuer and
holder of the security. While this data has a more granular breakdown, it is only available for
recent years, only for portfolio instruments, and only at a semi-annual frequency. In contrast,
we focus on all the components of debt, that is the flow of portfolio debt and other investment
debt by sector, over a much longer time horizon in quarterly data.
   Due to its large coverage of countries, long time series, coverage of multiple instruments
(asset classes), and quarterly frequency, our dataset is an important contribution to capital
flows research. We next detail our methodology.


2.1   Data Construction

What is commonly called “gross flows” in the literature is actually more accurately described
as “net inflows” and “net outflows”, which are broadly defined as follows:


                      NetIn f lows = GrossLiabilityFlows − Repayments                         (1)


                      NetOut f lows = GrossAssetFlows − Disinvestment                         (2)

Thus, although these measures are often called “gross”, they can be positive or negative. The
separation of flows into asset and liability flows allows interpreting liability flows as inflows
from foreign agents, and asset flows as outflows by domestic agents. This is the primary
working definition of capital flows in the BOP and elsewhere, which we use across all data
sources for consistency.
   The focus of this paper is on the differentiation of capital flows by source or destination
sector in the domestic economy. The domestic economy refers to entities that are resident


                                               11
in that economy, a rule known as the “Residence Principle” , regardless of the nationality of
the entity. This is the basis upon which the BOP data is compiled, which we match when
performing our filling exercise. The term “sector” is used here to refer to institutional sectors:
general government, central banks, depository corporations except the central bank (“banks”),
and other sectors (“corporates”).15
    To build our dataset, we combine and harmonize several publicly available sources: Bal-
ance of Payments (BOP) and International Investment Position (IIP) statistics of the Interna-
tional Monetary Fund (IMF), Locational Bank Statistics (LBS) and Consolidated Bank Statistics
(CBS) from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), International Debt Securities (IDS)
Statistics from the BIS, Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) of the IMF and World Bank
(WB), and Debt Reporting System (DRS) data of the WB.16
    The cornerstone of our dataset is the Balance of Payments (BOP) data produced by the IMF,
which is the most comprehensive source of international capital flow data across countries.
The BOP data, which is reported to the IMF by country statistical offices, captures capital
flows into and out of a given country. The accompanying stock measures of external assets
and liabilities are captured in the IMF’s International Investment Position (IIP) data. Capital
flows are measured as asset flows (outflows), liability flows (inflows), and net flows (inflows
- outflows). We focus on the financial account portion of the data and the latest (6th) version
of the balance of payments manual (BPM6). More details on the BOP data, along with its
different presentations and versions, are given in Appendix A.2.17
    Figure 4 illustrates the structure of the BOP data. In simple terms, capital flows in the
BOP are split into three main categories: direct investment, portfolio investment, and other
investment; and an important public sector outflow category, official reserves.18 Each of these
categories, except reserves, can be split into debt and equity components, though other invest-
  15 It  should be noted that the BOP category “other sectors” is broader than what is captured by the term “cor-
porates”. Nevertheless, in most cases, there is fairly broad overlap between the two categories. That is why, in
the rest of this paper, we use the two terms interchangeably for presentational convenience.
   16 It should be noted that, even though combining different data sources to complement BOP/IIP statistics is

rarely done at the global level, this is exactly what many country-level BOP/IIP compilers do on a regular basis
(e.g. many country BOP/IIP compilers use the BIS IBS data series on banks’ cross-border deposit liabilities to the
residents of their respective countries in order to enhance their BOP/IIP compilation).
   17 See the 6th Edition Balance of Payments Manual (BPM6) Appendix 8 for more details on the differences

between the previous edition (BPM5) and BPM6.
   18 The remaining category is financial derivatives, which is small and sparsely reported, previously included as

a part of portfolio investment.

                          This structure is the same for inflows and outflows. Reserves are only classified as outflows.
        b   The breakdowns of these variables by sector exist in the BOP data but the coverage is sparse for many countries and quarters.
    where DIE is direct investment equity, DID is direct investment debt, PE is portfolio eq-
uity, PD is portfolio debt, OID is other investment debt, and Res is reserves. For portfolio
investment debt and equity and other investment debt, the flows can be further subdivided
by domestic sector. Other investment debt can also be decomposed by instrument and then
by sector. While in theory each type of capital flow can be disaggregated by the domestic sec-
tor, in practice, however, the coverage of such disaggregated information in the BOP tends to
be sparse, especially for EM/developing countries and earlier years. To be absolutely clear,
capital flow types (asset classes) are generally very well reported in aggregate terms in the BOP
data, and the reporting of the sectoral breakdowns has improved in recent years. Neverthe-
less, for most EMDE and years before 2005 the reporting of the data by sector is much less
exhaustive.
    Given the extent of missing observations19 in the BOP data, we proceed with a “filling” ex-
ercise to replace these missing values. We focus on debt inflows, consisting primarily of other
investment debt and portfolio debt. Other investment debt flows are important since the vast
majority of external bank flows are in this category. Crucially, this category also includes some
cross-border loans to corporates and loans to sovereigns, such as IMF credit. In most countries,
sovereigns tend to borrow externally primarily via bonds, which appear under the portfolio
debt category. When bond financing to emerging market borrowers, including governments,
dries up, emerging market sovereigns rely more on loans.20,21
    In order to get a larger, longer, and balanced panel of countries with debt flows split by
sector, we proceed with the following methodology for our data filling exercise. When the
BOP data contains the total for the category and for three out of the four sectors, we take the
total and subtract the 3 reported sectors in order to obtain the fourth sector. This assumes that
  19 Assuming      missing data is zero may or may not be accurate depending on the country under consideration,
as it is difficult to tell a true zero from a missing observation in the BOP data.
  20 Figure C3 in Appendix C shows that this is the case during the global financial crisis.
  21 Identifying the appropriate variables from the BOP data is not as easy as it sounds. Unfortunately, in the

public download of the BOP data, available on the IMF’s website, the variables for other investment debt by
sector are mislabeled as “other equity”, and so may be difficult to find. They are labeled as “...Other Invest-
ment, Other Equity..., Debt Instruments, ...”. For example, the full label for other investment debt for Other
Sectors (which we refer to as “Corporates”) is “Financial Account, Other Investment, Other Equity, Net In-
currence of Liabilities, Debt Instruments, Other Sectors, US Dollars”. The letter codes (EDD2 Codes) for these
variables are BFOLOO BP6 USD, BFOLOGFR BP6 USD, BFOLODC BP6 USD, and BFOLOCBFR BP6 USD. On
the asset flow side, these variables are BFOADO BP6 USD, BFOADG BP6 USD, BFOADDC BP6 USD, and
BFOADCB BP6 USD. In reality, other investment equity (which is usually very small) is the only category within
other investment that is not split by borrowing sector. We thank Gian-Maria Milesi-Ferretti and IMF Statistics for
helping us uncover this.



                                                       15
the reported BOP data is fully accurate, but our results are robust to eliminating this step and
relying solely on external sources.
    For the remaining observations where the sector data is still missing, we construct mea-
sures of portfolio debt and other investment debt inflows by sector from several alternative
datasets. The data that fills in the most observations in our dataset is from the BIS. We use
the BIS International Debt Secutiries dataset (IDS), which captures securities issued in inter-
national markets, to fill in the portfolio debt flows series.22 The other important BIS dataset
is the International Banking Statistics (IBS), capturing cross-border bank flows, which we use
to fill the missing data under other investment debt.23 Here, we only use loan lending by BIS
reporting banks, so as not to capture direct investment flows or debt securities holdings.24,25
We then complement these loans with any other non-missing data from the BOP for particular
instruments within other investment debt (trade credit, IMF credit, etc.) to get a more com-
plete and accurate measure of other investment debt flows for each sector.26 While there may
be reasons why the sectoral break down of debt inflows was not reported by particular coun-
tries in particular years, the BIS data has the benefit of being collected from the main lending
countries instead of the borrower country (or in the case of debt securities, directly from the
issued security itself). Thus, it avoids whatever underlying problems with data construction
and reporting that may have generated the missing observation in the first place.27
  22 The   IMF’s Coordinated Investment Portfolio Survey (CPIS) database also reports data on sectoral break-
downs for portfolio equity and portfolio debt flows. However, these breakdowns are available only since 2013
and only at a semiannual frequency; more importantly, the CPIS does not have data on other investment debt
flows.
   23 The BIS bank data captures the overwhelming majority of cross-border banking activity (BIS, 2015), but some

banking flows between non-BIS reporting EM may not be captured (e.g. Polish banks lending to Nigeria, etc.).
   24 Debt security flows would already be captured in portfolio debt (or the equivalent filling series). In principle,

there could be an overlap between “direct investment debt” series and the “BIS loans” series if the loan is from
a BIS reporting bank to an offshore non-financial entity in which the bank has at least a 10% ownership stake. In
practice, we expect this to be small.
   25 A small number AEs exhibit some discrepancies between the BOP data and the BIS Bank data (e.g. Japan,

Switzerland, and the US). These are isolated cases that have already been well documented. As a rule, we use
BOP data, which is generally well reported for these cases, and other data sources first to avoid these issues.
   26 In some cases, the flows of other investment debt, by sector or in total, are reported as coming from just one

instrument (usually loans) even though in reality they reflect flows from other instruments as well (e.g. trade
credit). So, summing the subcomponents of other investment can capture the proper total in such cases, but this
is almost always not necessary as other investment debt itself is reported when the underlying instruments have
non-missing data (in some cases, an exception is the reporting of IMF credit, which may be known even if the
total other investment debt is not known). We thank Gian-Maria Milesi-Ferretti for bringing these issues to our
attention.
   27 We remove exceptional financing flows to banks and corporates, within portfolio debt and other investment

debt, and reassign them to the central bank. Exceptional financing captures financial flows made or fostered by
the authorities for balance of payments needs. Thus, they can be seen as a substitute for reserves or IMF Credit.
See the 6th Edition BOP Manual, paragraph A1.1.


                                                          16
   While the BIS data has extensive coverage and captures a vast amount of capital flows,
in some cases it may not match well with the BOP data. An important example is that of
advanced economy (AE) government bonds, which are issued domestically and then traded
abroad. These flows would not be captured by the BIS debt securities data, which captures
exclusively bonds that are issued in international markets. Thus for public sector debt gen-
erally, and for corporate sector portfolio debt in AEs, we rely first on measures derived from
IIP, compiled concurrently with the BOP data by the IMF, and the QEDS data produced jointly
by the IMF and World Bank. These data have the same sectoral and capital flow definitions
and breakdowns, making them comparable to the BOP data. These are stock measures, which
we first difference with a simple currency adjustment to approximate flows. While imperfect,
these stock-derived measures often line up very well with reported BOP flow data.
   We deflate GDP and all capital flows to 1996 USD and express them in billions.28 Addi-
tionally, we construct accompanying stock measures of external debt by sector, which were
previewed earlier. To do so, we rely first on the IIP data as the main source. When this is
missing after the internal fill within the IIP dataset, we rely on QEDS data on external debt by
sector. We fill any remaining observations with our BIS estimates.
   A detailed description of the datasets and our construction of the data to fill missing obser-
vations can be found in Appendix A.3. Here, we briefly illustrate the validity of our approach.
To gauge how well our estimates capture the true inflows, we undertake a counterfactual
exercise. We take a sample of countries where BOP data by sector is non-missing over 2006q1-
2013q4. Then we compare this data to our estimates done for this period as if the BOP data
were missing. Then, for each country group, we plot the aggregate flows for each sector and
capital flow type using non-missing BOP data, and our constructed estimates. Figures A3 and
A4 in Appendix A.3 report these plots for both other investment debt flows and portfolio debt
flows for each sector. The match is close, with a correlation for total debt inflows over 0.86,
even though the period includes the volatile capital flows around the 2008 crisis. It thus speaks
to the quality of our constructed estimates to fill missing data over the entire sample. On the
whole, our filled series capture most of the volume and variation of inflows for most countries
and allow us to extend substantially the coverage of our dataset.
   The last debt category in the BOP is Direct Investment Debt (DID). Direct investment con-
tains both debt and equity flows and is split by debt and equity components in the BOP data.
 28 Quarterly   GDP data is from Datastream and national sources. We deflate all series using US CPI from FRED.

                                                       17
However, it is not disaggregated by sector in the BOP data. Yet, with a mild assumption, DID
inflows can be attributed almost entirely to the corporate sector.29 We include direct invest-
ment debt in total debt and corporate debt inflows in our regression analysis. More details on
the contribution of direct investment debt are given in Appendix C.2.
    To complement our extensive dataset on capital inflows, we also construct a dataset of cap-
ital outflows. Due to a comparative lack of complementary external datasets, we do very little
external filling of data for capital outflows, and hence describe them in less detail. As with
inflows, we start from the BOP data and first do an internal filling exercise. We combine the
general government and central bank sectors into a single (public) sector, so we can fill the
missing sector if two sectors and the total are non-missing.30 The one external fill that we do
for outflows is for the banking sector. We fill in portfolio debt asset flows and other invest-
ment debt asset flows using the BIS banking data (Locational Banking Statistics by Residency,
LBS/R), which has information on bank cross-border claims in each instrument.31


2.2    Coverage of the New Dataset

We divide the countries into three groups by level of development: advanced, emerging, and
developing.32 In our sample of annual capital inflows, we have 89 countries (25 advanced, 34
emerging, 30 developing).33 We exclude financial centers (e.g. Panama, Hong Kong, Bermuda)
to avoid distorting the patterns in the data for the typical country, but capital flows between
  29 Debt  flows between related enterprises are recorded as direct investment debt only when at least one coun-
terparty is a non-financial firm. Direct investment debt flows between two financial firms (including banks) are
instead classified as either portfolio investment debt or other investment debt (depending on the instrument
type). If direct investment debt flows from non-financial firms to financial firms are negligible, then we can
attribute all direct investment debt as flows either from financial firms to non-financial firms or flows from non-
financial firms to non-financial firms. In either case, the borrowing sector is the non-financial sector and hence
direct investment debt inflows can be assigned in full to the corporate sector.
   30 Note that combining government and central banks into a single sector makes the internal filling exercise

more fruitful, as only banks and corporates need to be non-missing in order to fill missing data for the public
sector.
   31 This data only covers banks resident in BIS reporting countries, and so is more limited in terms of coverage

than the BIS data used for inflows. Additionally, most BIS reporting countries have decent reporting of the
sectoral breakdown in the BOP data. Hence, this filling exercise complements a few gaps in the BOP data, but
largely the outflows dataset is derived solely from the BOP.
   32 We rely on the 2000 IMF WEO classification to define the group of advanced economies. Generally, the

WEO does not divide emerging and developing countries into separate groups. We use the MSCI and IEO-IMF
classifications to guide the definition of our EM group.
   33 We are unable to make the outflow sample as large as the inflow sample because data on liabilities owed is

more widely reported than data on assets owned, so we do not have many comparable filling series to replace
missing outflows values in the BOP. Thus, while our efforts do improve our coverage of outflows, we focus on
the contribution to inflow coverage in this section.


                                                        18
financial centers and the economies in our sample are still captured by the respective coun-
terparty country’s flows. At the quarterly frequency, our inflow sample drops to 85 countries,
leaving off El Salvador, Mongolia, Montenegro, and Serbia.
   Table A5 in the appendix illustrates the impact of our data filling exercise on sample cov-
erage for inflows. For each capital flow type, sector, and country group, the table shows the
percentage of observations in our balanced panel that come from the raw BOP data, from our
internal filling procedure, and from our filling from external data sources. Generally speak-
ing, developing countries, central banks, and portfolio debt tend to have less data available
in the original BOP. Our internal filling procedure makes a large difference for the coverage
of central banks, but otherwise does not provide many more observations for portfolio debt
and/or developing countries. Our external filling procedure, on the other hand, makes a large
difference, especially for the quarterly data, where it fills 25-40 percent of observations for EM
and 75-90 percent of observations for developing countries that were missing under portfolio
debt. In the case of other investment debt, only 11 percent of observations are filled for EM,
but for developing countries 40-50 percent of observations are filled. A sizable number of ob-
servations are filled by external data also for advanced economies: 20-30 percent for portfolio
debt observations, and 15-18 percent of other investment debt.
   Our filling exercise has a dramatic impact on the time and country coverage of the inflow
data. A balanced sample requires that portfolio debt and other investment debt not be missing
for any of the 4 sectors in any period for each country. With 8 components required to be non-
missing in each period, the probability that at least one is missing is high. With no adjustments
to the BOP data, we have 0 countries in our sample (12 in the annual data). After our internal
BOP fill, our sample of countries increases to 10 (16 in the annual data). After incorporating
the BIS, IIP, and QEDS datasets, our balanced sample increases to 85 countries (89 in the an-
nual data). Given the advantages of a balanced country sample for cross-section and panel
regression analysis, the impact of our data filling on sample size can be very consequential.34
   Figure A1 in the appendix compares aggregate inflows as measured by our filled data and
from the BOP alone, for total external debt of banks and corporates in our samples of AE and
EM. We plot annual flows here for clarity. These graphs show that generally both series tell the
same story, but there are periods in which accounting for the missing data makes a significant
difference. For advanced economy corporates, a significant expansion leading up to the 2008
 34 Note   that our inflow sample and outflow sample are not the same, but both samples are balanced panels.

crisis and a the subsequent contraction are missed. This is due primarily to filling in portfolio
debt data for the US and Spain for the 2008 surge, as well as a few other AE for the earlier 2001
peak. For EM, both banks and corporates had much larger flows relative to the BOP measure
following the 2008 collapse, driven primarily by filling data for other investment debt inflows
for China.
    Figure A2 in the appendix plots total external debt inflows for government and central
bank sectors. Missing U.S. government portfolio debt drives the difference for the AE in panel
(a). EM governments and AE central banks are fairly well represented in terms of volume.
Note that net inflows can be negative as well as positive, which is the case for EM central
banks, where some missing data consists of negative net inflows, which brings our filled data
below the raw BOP total. The surge at the end of the sample for EM central banks is driven by
China.
    In summary, our dataset captures a large volume of capital inflows by sector that would
otherwise be missed. Additionally, our data increases the number of both large and small
countries with debt inflow data by sector over a long time horizon at the quarterly frequency.



3    Descriptive Patterns

In this section, we present patterns and trends observed in our data over time. We use the
annual version of the dataset for clarity in the figures.
    Figure 5 (a)-(c) plots the aggregate debt inflows by sector for each country group. The
buildup and collapse surrounding the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC) is the most striking
feature in all of these figures. An interesting distinction between AE and EM is the response
following the crisis. While flows to advanced economies collapse and remain fairly low, flows
to emerging and developing countries rebound and increase across all sectors. An important
difference in flows by sector is in the evolution of debt inflows to governments. Across all
country groups, governments see an increase in debt inflows precisely when private flows
collapse, with an especially large and sustained increase for developing nations relative to
their private flows. Advanced-country central banks also see a small increase as private flows
collapse.
    Panels (d)-(i) plot portfolio debt and other investment debt flows. They reveal that the in-
crease in inflows for governments comes primarily in the form of bonds, with the exception of

developing country governments, which also see an increase in other investment debt fund-
ing (i.e. loans). Advanced economy corporates also have a significant share of their inflows
coming in the form of portfolio debt. Although emerging market banks and corporates see an
increase in bond flows in the wake of the GFC, the aggregate pattern of their flows is driven
primarily by other investment debt. Advanced country banks get the lion’s share of capital in-
flows prior to 2008, the majority of which is in the form of other investment. However, they see
consistent negative net inflows for several years following the GFC, reflecting the deleverag-
ing of these institutions. Developing country banks and corporates are also primarily receiving
inflows in the form of other investment debt.

    Much of the increase in emerging-market private debt after 2008 is attributable to a few
large EM. Foremost among these is China, whose debt inflows are shown in Figure 6. China
has poor sector coverage in the BOP data, so much of the measured effect is derived from our
data filling series. Both bank and corporate inflows increase substantially, but bank inflows to
China have been much larger. In India, the corporate sector has been the dominant recipient
of debt flows, though bank flows increased considerably after 2010. Brazil saw a sustained
increase in corporate debt inflows, and volatile increases in bank and government flows.
    The result that public sector gross inflows increase when private gross inflows are falling,
at the business cycle frequency, is an important finding that complements existing work on
long-term movements in public vs private net flows (Aguiar & Amador, 2011; Alfaro, Kalemli-
Özcan, & Volosovych, 2014; Gourinchas & Jeanne, 2013). The public sector is often able to
borrow from abroad even as such funding dries up for the private sector. Thus, the public
sector acts as a countervailing force to the private sector, smoothing the total debt inflows into
the country.35
    Turning to outflows, Figure 7 plots the debt asset flows for our sample of 31 countries over
2002-2014. The public sector is the sum of central banks and general government sectors, and
total debt asset flows for the public sector include the flow of reserves.
    For advanced countries, we see the same pattern for total and other investment debt as
  35 Thus far our figures have plotted aggregate flows, but figures showing the dynamic patterns of average flows

to GDP are shown in Appendix C. Figure C5 illustrates the impact of the public sector for an average country
using the average of flows to GDP. It plots the cross-country average of total debt flows (portfolio debt + other
investment debt) to GDP as compared to flows from just the private sectors (Banks and Corporates) for advanced
and emerging countries, with the VIX shown in red (right axis), for reference. For both sets of countries, but
especially for EM, the drops in private inflows are larger than the corresponding drops in total inflows, reflecting
the potential role of the sovereign to smooth out sudden stops.

we see with inflows. More concretely, the landscape of flows is dominated by the buildup of
private flows in the mid-2000s, led by the banking sector, followed by a sharp contraction at
the time of the global financial crisis. The public sector plays a relatively small role for AE
outflows. Portfolio debt outflows for AEs show a sharp contraction for banks at the time of
the crisis. Nevertheless, there is actually an increase in external portfolio debt investment by
the corporate sector, followed by a brief contraction coinciding more closely to the Eurozone
crisis.
    Emerging market banks and corporates show a contraction in their other investment debt
outflows, followed by a much stronger rebound than that seen in AEs. However, the de-
cline in corporate other investment debt is offset by an increase in corporate portfolio debt
outflows. EM public sector sees a drop in both portfolio and other investment outward invest-
ment around the crisis, but portfolio debt recovers robustly in the following years. However,
public sector outflows, and total EM debt outflows, are clearly dominated by reserves, as seen
in panel (d), with a large buildup and collapse mirroring the private sector inflow and outflows
pattern.

4     Empirical Analysis

4.1   Methodology

We examine the response of sectoral capital inflows to representative push and pull factors to
highlight the important differences in response by sector. Our push factor is a proxy for the
global financial cycle/global risk appetite (the VIX), and our pull factor is the domestic busi-
ness cycle (GDP growth). We do this analysis in a panel regression setup with our quarterly
data. We focus on the following simple specification:

                 I NFLOWits
                            = αis + βs log(V IXt−1 ) + γs GDPGrowthit−1 + eits                  (5)
                    GDPit
    Our dependent variable is capital flows as a percent of GDP. We run each regression sepa-
rately for each sector and capital flow type. I NFLOWits is a measure of capital inflows (in total
or by instrument) to sector s ∈ { Public, Banks, Corp., All } for country i in quarter t. The re-
gressions are run separately by sector, so that for each sector, αi is effectively a country-sector
fixed effect. V IXt−1 is the option-implied volatility of the S&P 500 index, which enters into the
regression in logged values. The VIX is often used as a measure of global risk aversion or a
proxy for the global financial cycle and global financial conditions, and represents a standard
push factor for capital inflows, particularly to EM. GDPGrowthit−1 is real year-on-year GDP
growth for country i in the previous period, which is a standard pull factor driving foreign
capital to a particular country. Our standard errors are clustered at the country level.
    There are several ways in which we could produce our estimated results. Our preferred
method, described previously, we label as AHKS. One alternative is to skip the internal fill and
rely soley on external data to replace missing BOP values. One may prefer this since the fact
that the missing sector was not filled in may indicate that the BOP data is less trustworthy (eg
the total for that instrument in the BOP may not be accurate). We label this ”AHKS noIntFill”.
Another alternative is to take our AHKS estimation and force the sum of the sectors to match
the reported total in the BOP. Thus, this version fully respects the BOP data, and only allocates
the total reported there into the different sectors. We label this version ”AHKS match”. Lastly,
direct investment debt (DID) may be an important component of debt inflows. Thus, we can
also add DID to the all sectors total, as well as to the corporate sector. We show that our main
results are robust to these alternative constructions.


                                                24
    We present our results using a sample which is balanced across sectors, but not across
countries. That is to say, we keep country-year observations that have data for all sectors
available. Thus across regressions for different sectors, we have the same set of country-year
observations represented. We show robustness to different samples (fully unbalanced, which
uses any available data in each regression; fully balanced across both sectors and countries,
where we only keep observations for countries with data for all sectors over the entire time
period) in the appendix. Our main sample covers 63 countries: 23 advanced, 31 emerging, and
9 developing over 1997q1-2014q4.36


4.2    Capital Inflows by Sector

Table 1 presents the results for inflows to all sectors (that is, the sum of the four sectors). We
present the results using the raw Balance of Payments (BOP) in column 1 for comparison with
our constructed data in column 2. Due to the missing data, column 1 has few observations and
thus lacks statistical significance. While the topline items in BOP are well reported (i.e. total
portfolio debt inflows, etc.), this illustrates the important gap in coverage that arises when
using the data split by sector.
    Column 2 shows the baseline relationship between our representative push and pull fac-
tors. Inflows respond negatively to increases in the VIX, while they respond positively to
greater GDP growth in the domestic economy.
    Importantly, our results are robust and consistent across alternative ways of constructing
our dataset. Column 3 shows the outcome if we do not use an internal fill of the BOP data. Col-
umn 4 presents the results when we force our data to add up to the BOP total (i.e. the topline
items by instrument). And column 5 shows results adding direct investment debt (DID) to the
AHKS data. Significance and size of coefficients are all similar across specifications, including
for both advance economies (panel B) and emerging markets (panel C).
    Table 2 focuses in on the sector splits, still showing the different constructions of the data
and comparison with the raw BOP results. Again, we see that the raw BOP results are largely
insignificant or otherwise inconsistent with results from our primary sample (columns (2), (6),
and (10)).37 Also, results are largely similar across the different dataset constructions.
  36 Using quarterly GDP data significantly restricts our sample along both country and time dimensions.   Table 3
relaxes this by using annual data. The samples of countries used are detailed in Appendix A.4.
  37 The coefficient on the VIX, when using the raw BOP sample, is significant for inflows to the public sector for

    Capital inflows respond to these factors differently across sectors. Inflows to banks and
corporates are quite similar, but inflows to AE corporates don’t respond to domestic GDP
growth like inflows to AE banks. The most notable difference is between these private sectors
and the public sector. There is no response to the VIX for total inflows to the public sector.38
In response to higher domestic GDP growth, inflows to sovereigns react differently between
advanced and emerging countries. The response is positive (procyclical) in advanced coun-
tries, similar to their banks, but negative in emerging markets (countercyclical), opposite of
the private sector.
    These differences by sector are robust across a number of alternative specifications. Ta-
ble C1 shows that the results are not driven by the 2008-9 period of the great financial crisis.
Interestingly, it also reveals that the VIX is a stronger factor pre-crisis than post crisis, in line
with Amiti et al. (2018). Inflows to advanced economy banks appear to become more procycli-
cal after the crisis.
    Table C2 shows that these results are robust to different ways of balancing the sample: fully
unbalanced, fully balanced over 1997q1-2014q4, and fully balanced over 2002q4-2014q4.39
This last sample includes more countries than the previous fully balanced sample, and shows
EME public inflows moving positively with the VIX and corporate inflows including direct
investment debt responding positively to GDP and negatively to the VIX. The results are also
robust to normalizing by trend GDP instead of contemporaneous GDP (Table C4).




all countries and especially emerging markets. We find this result in a few other specifications as well, which we
note in our analysis below.
   38 Table C1 finds a positive coefficient in the period following the great financial crisis. Table C2 shows a positive

response for inflows to emerging market sovereigns for a fully balanced panel over 2002q4-2014q4. Table C5
shows that other investment debt inflows to the public sector responds positively. These responses move opposite
that of private inflows. Portfolio debt inflows to emerging market sovereigns responds negatively to the VIX, so
emerging market sovereign bonds appear to be treated the same as their private sector borrowers when it comes
to a tightening of international financial conditions.
   39 Fully balanced means that every country in the sample as data for all sectors and both instruments over the

whole time frame.

   We construct capital inflows by sector for a large number of countries, many of which do
not have quarterly GDP data. This results in many emerging and developing economies being
dropped from our primary regressions. In order to include these countries and analyze their
inflows, we utilize the annual version of our dataset and perform the same regression. This
adds 4 EMEs and 20 developing countries back into our sample, enough that we can present
results for developing countries on their own (where previously they were only in the ”All
countries” regressions). These are shown in Table 3.
   For EMEs, the results in the slower moving annual panel are consistent with our previous
results at the quarterly frequency. Additionally, the positive coefficient on the VIX for inflows
to sovereigns is significant, perhaps because these flows respond to larger global shocks rather
than more frequent fluctuations. This movement opposite the private sector further highlights
how different capital inflows to the public sector are, especially for emerging markets.
   For developing countries, inflows are largely not reactive to either our selected push or pull
factors. Nevertheless, inflows to banks in developing economies do appear to be negatively
linked to the VIX, as they are for other country groups. This result highlights the importance
of banks for connecting developing economies to the international financial system.
   Regressions of capital flows on push and pull factors tend to have low R2 when using quar-
terly data. When using annual data, however, R2 ’s tend to be closer to 0.2-0.3, considerably
larger than those seen in Table 3. This is actually an artifact of the time period, as illustrated
in Table 4. Regressions that are largely using data points from before the GFC, as would nat-
urally be the case with most of the existing literature, have R2 ’s of the expected magnitude.
This holds for the topline flows from the BOP, as well as for the sector breakdowns in our
data, particularly for AE and EM banks and EM corporates. As documented by Amiti et al.
(2018),the post-GFC capital flow environment is quite different. Nevertheless, the two factors
we examine still explain a considerable fraction of the variation in inflows to EM banks during
the post-GFC period. Interestingly, the variation explained by them is quite low across the
board for public inflows as well as flows to advanced economy corporates.
   The above results once again underscore the importance of analyzing capital flows sepa-
rately by sector, as different factors explain flows to each sector. Indeed, we present results
using just two such factors in order to clearly illustrate the role of sectors in understanding
capital flows. Table C6 shows other drivers of capital flows also have differing effects by sec-
tor and/or across AE vs EM countries. Thus, our findings suggest properly understanding the

drivers of capital flows requires analyzing them while distinguishing among sectors.


4.3   Capital Outflows by Sector

Total capital outflows (i.e. the sum of all sectors) respond similarly to total capital inflows:
negative response to the VIX (reflecting in part tighter conditions in international financial
markets) and a positive response to GDP (procyclical). Emerging market outflows, however,
don’t significantly respond to domestic GDP. Looking at results by sector in columns (2)-(4),
we see that again banks and corporates drive the negative response to the VIX. As for GDP
response, outflows from the public sector and from banks are both procyclical.
   Flows of official reserves are procyclical. This procyclicality at the global level is driven by
EME sovereigns. Although the coefficient is only significant in the full-country sample, when
results normalized by trend GDP, this result is significant for the EME sample (Table C4). This,
along with the results for inflows, indicates that the public sector can serve as a countervailing
force in terms of capital flows, as it borrows more when flows to the private sector fall, and it

builds up reserves when times are good and capital is flowing to the private sector.
   Flows to EME banks and the public sector respond negatively to the VIX, including flows
of reserves, but outflows by corporates do not show a significant response. EME outflows thus
are more driven by external factors rather than internal factors.
   Our results are again robust to a number of alternative specifications. Table C3 shows the
outflow regressions for different ways of balancing the sample. There are not enough observa-
tions for a large balanced sample extending back to 1997, but a shorter balanced sample from
2002q4-2014q4 shows largely similar results. Results are also robust to normalizing by trend
GDP (Table C4), with a few interesting results becoming more significant: outflows from AE
sovereigns are shown to be procyclical, outflows of EM sovereigns, when including reserves,
are also procyclical, and corporate outflows are procyclical for all countries and especially
EMEs. And, as with inflows, Table C6 shows that other push or pull factors also show these
important differences across sectors for outflows.

4.4    Comovement of Capital Inflows and Outflows

Inflows and outflows have been shown in the literature to be highly correlated. Neverthe-
less, inflows and outflows to each sector can have different drivers, as shown above. We next
examine correlations of capital inflows and outflows by sector to better understand their co-
movement and what drives the high correlation in aggregate inflows and outflows. Table 6
presents correlations conditional on country fixed effects, lagged GDP growth, and lagged log
VIX (as from previous regressions). Our results are robust to using unconditional correlations,
shown in Table C8.40
   The strongest inflow-outflow correlations tend to be within-sectors (e.g. inflows to banks
with outflows from banks) rather than across sectors. The highest correlation is between bank
inflows with bank outflows. It is particularly strong in the case of AE banks. The negative
correlations seen in the table always involve the public sector, once again reflecting the fact
that public sector flows tend to move in the opposite direction to private sector flows. Emerg-
ing markets have much lower within-sector correlations for the private sector than advanced
economies, though the within-public sector correlation is comparable.
   These correlations, coupled with the regression results discussed above, provide an im-
portant insight into the nature of capital flows. Capital inflows to any country are largely
controlled by investors in advanced economies. Outflows from advanced economies are also
(by definition) driven by investors in advanced economies. Hence, inflows to both advanced
and emerging economies tend to behave similarly, as do the inflows and outflows to and from
advanced economies. Outflows from EMEs, which are driven by investors in EMEs, follow
a different pattern. As a consequence, we see stronger correlations for advanced economy
inflows and outflows (since they are driven by the same decision makers) than we do for
emerging market inflows and outflows (since they are driven by different decision makers).

5       Discussion and Conclusion

We construct a novel data set for gross capital flows during 1996–2015 for a large set of coun-
tries at a quarterly frequency, focusing primarily on debt flows. We decompose debt inflows
and outflows by borrower and lender type: banks, corporates and sovereigns. We use the
standard BOP data from IMF as the starting source. In order to get a larger, longer, and more
balanced panel of countries with debt flows split by sector, we proceed with a data filling ex-
ercise. When the BOP data by sector is missing, we use an internal filling procedure and then
complement the gaps with other publicly available data from the IMF, WB, and BIS. Our data
captures fairly accurately the volume and variation of aggregate flows for most countries and
allows us to extend the coverage of the standard samples substantially.
      We establish several novel facts with the new data. Public sector flows respond quite dif-
ferently to (global and local) capital flow drivers, and thus tend to act as a countervailing force
to private sector flows, especially in EMs. The impact of the main capital flow drivers has
declined since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, especially for AE banks and EM corporates
but less so for EM banks. The high correlation between capital inflows and capital outflows
is mainly driven by within-sector flows, especially those of AE banks. Since inflows and out-
flows of AEs and inflows to EMs are all primarily made by AE investors, they all respond to
the main capital flow drivers in a similar fashion. Conversely, EM outflows respond differently
to those drivers, resulting in lower EM inflow-outflows correlations.
      These facts provide evidence against the predictions of a large class of models that assume
only productivity shocks. Unsurprisingly, standard international real business cycle models
with a single asset cannot account for these patterns. In these models, the only shock is a
shock to productivity in a single country, so capital inflows go in one direction only and hence
procyclicality and co-movement cannot be accounted for. A certain class of models have tried
to account for the co-movement.41 For example in McGrattan and Prescott (2010), a positive
productivity shock generates both capital inflows and outflows. The country with the positive
productivity shock receives inflows from multinationals. At the same time, it also experiences
outflows as affiliates of multinationals invest in other countries given their increased produc-
tivity. These patterns can also create procyclicality.
      However, our findings point to procyclical outflows only by banks in advanced countries
    41 See   Bai (2013) for a summary.


                                                35
and sovereigns in emerging markets, not by FDI debt investors as predicted by this model,
which would be corporates in our paper. The model by Bianchi, Boz, and Mendoza (2012)
assumes sovereigns borrow and accumulate reserves. When a sudden stop occurs, capital out-
flows decline along with inflows since reserves are used to smooth consumption. This model
would be able to account for capital inflow-outflow comovement in EM if the comovement
were driven only by sovereigns, but as we show it is not. Sovereign inflows are countercycli-
cal - in bad times, the sovereign sector borrows, increasing inflows, and runs down reserves,
decreasing outflows.
   Models with financial shocks, as in Kalemli-Özcan, Papaioannou, and Perri (2013), can
generate the positive correlation of banking inflows and outflows found in the data. Models
in which domestic financial frictions tighten for certain sectors during bad times, can also
match our findings. For example, R. Caballero and Simsek (2018) assume that, during crisis
times, financial frictions bind for domestic banks but not for foreign banks. Their model can
provide a rationale for our findings. These authors argue that models featuring only portfolio
investors ignore the important role of banks in intermediating capital flows. In their model
both banks and sovereigns play a role in EM, consistent with our data.
   Overall, our findings are consistent with models including financial shocks and/or finan-
cial frictions, giving a role to sovereigns and the banking sector. The results highlight the
importance of separating capital flows by borrower and lender sector to understand better
their effects, as well as the systemic risks that they may pose for borrowing and lending coun-
tries. They also show the difficulty of establishing robust stylized facts about the business
cycle properties of capital flows and their relationship with global push factors, especially in a
sample that combines EM and AE countries. Our new dataset, which will be updated contin-
ually and shared with the research community, should prove very useful for future research
on capital flows.

A       Dataset Construction

This appendix describes the construction of the dataset used in this paper, as well as the rele-
vant background information for capital flow data generally and the underlying data sources
specifically. The purpose of this dataset is to split capital inflows and outflows by capital
flow type and by sector of the domestic economy, focusing primarily on debt flows. We base
our dataset on the Balance of Payments (BOP) dataset, which includes capital flow data with
breakdowns by flow type and sector, but also has some missing data. We fill in gaps in the
data using some external datasets, such as the Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) and
banking and bond data from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).
    We describe first the basics of capital flow data, the structure and coverage of the BOP
data. We then explain the filling exercise and the external datasets that are used. We present
comparisons to illustrate the quality of the fit of our external data and the contribution of our
filling exercise. Lastly, we summarize the samples and coverage of our completed dataset. In
Appendix B, we give more detail on the BIS datasets and how those series are constructed.


A.1     Capital Flow Data

Some of the presentations and definitions of international capital flow data can be ambiguous
or inconsistent across data sources. In order to be clear about what we are doing, we briefly
highlight some basic concepts regarding capital flow data generally.


A.1.1    Net Flows vs Gross Flows

In the literature and in the data, there is some ambiguity of terms when referring to net and
gross flows. Essentially, there are three distinctions:
    Gross Flows: Strictly speaking, gross inflows and outflows refer to one-way flows without
netting out any capital flowing in the opposite direction. This definition of gross flows is
generally what comes to mind when the term is used. Nevertheless, data that actually matches
this definition are quite scarce.



                                                40
    Net Inflows and Outflows: What is commonly called “gross flows” in the literature is
actually more accurately described as “net inflows” and “net outflows”. There are no compre-
hensive datasets on flows that are truly gross. Instead, researchers tend to use net inflows and
net outflows, which can be obtained from the IMF’s BOP dataset. Net inflows are gross liabil-
ity flows, net of repayments. Net outflows are gross asset flows, net of disinvestment. Thus,
although these measures are often called “gross”, they can be positive or negative. The sep-
aration of flows into asset and liability flows allows interpreting liability flows as net inflows
from foreign agents, and asset flows as net outflows by domestic agents. This is the primary
working definition of capital flows, which we use across all data sources for consistency.
    Net Flows: This relates to the net movement of capital into and out of a country. This is the
equivalent of the negative of the current account, that is, the difference between Net Inflows
and Net Outflows (or equivalently the difference between Gross Inflows and Gross Outflows).
    Stock/Position Data: In general, there is no standard definition of “net” stocks, as some
countries report outstanding debt net of some financial assets (Arslanalp & Tsuda, 2014b),
while others do not. A more widely-agreed view is that the net stock of external wealth should
be equivalent to the Net International Investment Position, which is the difference between
outstanding external stock of assets and outstanding external stock of liabilities. Gross posi-
tions then refer to the outstanding stocks of assets and liabilities separately.


A.1.2     External Borrowing of Sectors

The focus of this paper is on the differentiation of capital flows by sector in the domestic econ-
omy. The term “sector” is used here to refer to institutional sectors: general government,
central banks, depository corporations except the central bank (“banks”), and other sectors
(“corporates”).42 There are other ways to define the sectors of the economy, but this break-
down is the most common in the data.43 For much of our analysis, and all analysis using asset
flows, we combine the central bank and general government sectors into a single sector called
“public sector”.
    These broad sectors can sometimes be decomposed into various institutional subsectors
  42 Itshould be noted that the BOP category “other sectors” is broader than what is captured by the term “cor-
porates”. Nevertheless, in most cases, there is fairly broad overlap between the two categories. That is why, in
the rest of this paper, we use the two terms interchangeably for presentational convenience.
  43 See Chapter 4 Section D of the 6th Edition Balance of Payments Manual for an overview of Systems of

National Accounts sectoral breakdowns, and the sectoral breakdowns used in the BOP (and often other) data
sources.

                                                      41
(for example, other sectors are sometimes split into other non-bank financial and other non-
financial sectors in the BOP data). Thus, sectors can also be defined differently depending on
the dataset or measure. For instance, several datasets such as the WB DRS produce statistics on
public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt. In this case, public refers to general government,
central banks, and the public sector portions of banks and corporates. Non-publicly guaran-
teed private sector debt is defined precisely as its name suggests and is the complement to
PPG. Otherwise, most datasets using a sectoral breakdown conform to the standard definition
of the main institutional sectors and subsectors given above. We consider PPG vs. PNG debt
in Appendix C.3.


A.1.3    Sign of Flows

There remains some confusion about the sign of capital inflows and outflows in the data. This
is primarily due to a change in sign conventions that occurred when the BOP data switched
from the BPM5 to the BPM6 version. In BPM5, a negative sign indicated that capital was
leaving the country on net, regardless of whether it was an asset or liability flow. In the current
version of the BOP data (BPM6), a positive asset flow represents capital leaving the country
on net by domestic residents, while a positive liability flow represents capital entering the
country on net by foreigners. We use the updated convention, where a positive sign indicates
an increase in either assets or liabilities, and adjust our interpretation accordingly.


A.2      Balance of Payments Data

The IMF’s Balance of Payments (BOP) data is the most comprehensive dataset available on
international capital flows and the basis for our dataset. It comprises two main accounts – the
Current Account and the Financial Account.44 The current account records transactions from
the real side, capturing imports and exports, factor income, and transfer payments. The finan-
cial account records transaction from the financial side, capturing the acquisition of financial
assets and the incurrence of financial liabilities. We focus on the Financial Account portion of
the BOP data.
  44 Athird account, the Capital Account, is generally much smaller than these two. Since the BOP uses double
entry bookkeeping, the sum of the accounts should be zero, so a Balancing Account called ”Net errors and
omissions” is defined to satisfy the identity: current account + financial account + capital account + net errors
and omissions = 0. Errors and omissions are usually interpreted as unrecorded private capital flows (see Forbes
and Warnock (2012)).


                                                       42
    There are several presentations of the BOP data.45 The standard presentation disaggregates
the data by flow type and instrument. Figure 4 illustrates this structure, with the available
breakdowns by sector. The analytic presentation, which is the one available within the IMF’s
International Financial Statistics (IFS), reports exceptional financing (used to meet balance-of-
payments financing needs) separately from the standard presentation.46 The analytic presen-
tation can be useful to separate some public flows from private flows, because exceptional
financing can be viewed as an alternative instrument to the use of reserve assets or IMF credit
to help deal with balance of payments shortfalls.47 We use the sectoral presentation, which
breaks down the standard presentation by domestic institutional sector, but we also use mea-
sures of exceptional financing from the analytic presentation to allocate all exceptional financ-
ing flows to the public sector.
    In theory, the structure of the BOP dataset should allow separating the flows by institu-
tional sector, but the requisite data is sometimes missing. It is difficult to determine if missing
data is truly missing, or if it is zero. Data on outflows are generally more sparse than data on
inflows. Further, the time coverage of the data varies greatly across countries. Especially for
variables with sectoral breakdown, the coverage is weighted heavily towards recent years.


A.2.1      Types of Flows

Capital flows in the Financial Account of the BOP are disaggregated first by type of flow. The
main types are direct investment, portfolio equity, portfolio debt, other investment, financial
derivatives, and reserves. For each of these flow types, the BOP reports asset flows and lia-
bility flows. We describe each type of flow and how it can be broken down into the various
institutional sectors.48 We focus on the debt portions of capital flows (portfolio debt, other in-
vestment debt, reserves, and sometimes direct investment debt) in our dataset, but we describe
all components of capital flows here.
    Direct Investment: Direct investment, commonly called FDI, captures investment involv-
ing at least 10% ownership. It is meant to reflect investment relationships based on control
  45 See Chapter 14 Section C of the 6th edition BOP manual for a description of the various presentations.
  46 Exceptional  Financing is usually classified under the other investment category.
  47 See the 6th edition BOP manual Appendix 1 for a description of Exceptional Financing. See Alfaro, Şebnem

Kalemli-Özcan, and Volosovych (2014) for discussion and use of IFS data to divide net flows into public and
private components.
  48 See Appendix 9 of the Balance of Payments Manual for a list of all the components of the Financial Account

with their structure in the BOP data.


                                                      43
and influence. In addition to equity investment, it also captures other investments under a
controlling relationship, including debt and reverse investment.
    Direct investment is not broken down by sector. Unlike the BPM5 version of the data, the
BPM6 data does have splits according to liability and asset flows for direct investment (consis-
tent with other BOP flows).49 Direct investment does not have a split in the BOP by sector, but
the debt portion of direct investment inflows can be allocated with some assumptions. Direct
investment debt inflows between affiliated parties are only recorded as direct investment debt
if at least one party is a non-financial firm. Thus for inflows, we can attribute all direct invest-
ment debt to the Corporate sector if we assume that such lending from offshore non-financial
firms to onshore banks is negligible.
    Portfolio Equity: Portfolio equity captures investment in equity securities not included
in direct investment.50 It is broken down by institutional sector and, in principle, asset and
liability flows are defined for all sectors. Note, however, that liability flows for central banks
and general government should equal zero regardless of data reporting.51
    Portfolio Debt: Portfolio debt consists of all debt securities not captured under direct in-
vestment. It is separated into asset and liability flows, and then disaggregated by institutional
sector.
    Financial Derivatives: Financial derivatives tend to be a quantitatively small category of
gross flows, covering derivatives and employee stock options. Financial derivatives that are
associated with reserve asset management are excluded. Both asset and liability flows offer
breakdowns by institutional sector.52 Due to its small size and sparse data, we ignore this
component in our analysis.
    Other Investment: Other investment captures all other investments not included in the
previous categories. It is first broken into other investment equity53 and other investment
debt. Other investment debt is then disaggregated as follows: currency and deposits, loans
  49 This  is one of the main differences between the BPM5 and BPM6 versions of the data.
  50 Equity   not in the form of securities is not captured here.
   51 Some countries report positive equity liability flows for the government or central bank, but we believe this

is equity from state-owned or quasi-public enterprises (banks or corporates) that was mis-recorded.
   52 Some countries may report financial derivatives on a net basis only. See 6th edition BOP manual paragraphs

6.60 and 8.34.
   53 This is equity investment that is not direct investment or reserve assets, and is not in the form of securities.

Equity securities are captured under portfolio equity. This category, introduced with the BPM6 version of the
BOP data, is sparsely reported.




                                                         44
(including use of IMF credit and loans), insurance and pensions,54 trade credit and advances,
other accounts payable/receivable, and SDR allocations.55
    Other investment debt as a whole, and each of its component instruments, is broken down
into asset and liability flows, and then further broken down by institutional sector. However,
there is no sectoral breakdown of Other Investment Equity.
    Reserves: Reserve Assets are external assets held by the Central Bank or Monetary Au-
thority that are readily available for use to meet Balance of Payments financing needs. These
include foreign currency, convertible gold, SDRs, and other reserve assets. Thus, this compo-
nent is an asset flow of the public sector only.
    While in principle the structure of the BOP data contains all the ingredients required to
compute each type of flow for each sector, with the exception of direct investment, in practice
there are some countries which do not exhaustively provide these breakdowns, especially for
earlier years.56 Table A1 highlights the coverage by flow type and sector in the quarterly BOP
data.57 For each component, the table displays the number of countries reporting data, the
number of quarters with at least one country reporting data, the number of country-quarter
observations with non-missing data, and the number of countries that have data for that com-
ponent in every period over the 1996q1-2014q4 period. Next to each of these numbers, in
brackets we report the implied coverage as percentage of the theoretical maximum, given by
190 countries, 144 quarters, and 27360 total observations. The direct investment and reserves
lines give us an idea of the coverage of the more standard items that are not disaggregated
by sector. Generally, we see that for most sectors and flow types, most countries and periods
show some data. However, the data is skewed towards recent years, and few countries show
coverage over the full 1996q1-2014q4 period.
  54 This  includes non-life insurance technical reserves, life insurance and annuities entitlements, pension enti-
tlements, and provisions for calls under standardized guarantees. This component is likely also small, and very
sparsely reported.
   55 SDR holdings (as opposed to SDR allocations) are included in reserve assets. A one time increase in SDR

allocations occurred in the 3rd quarter of 2009 for all IMF member countries, so those flows are removed.
   56 Table A3 lists the BOP variables required to compute each type of capital flow by sector. Variable names

are as they are found in the bulk public download of the BP6 version BOP data, as of May 2016. The Balance
of Payments data also includes International Investment Position (IIP) data, which is the stock equivalent of the
BOP flow measures. Variable names for IIP construction by sector are also included, for reference.
   57 Some items in the BOP data are available back to 1948, but this applies to very few of them. For this table, we

consider data only from 1980 onwards. The annual BOP data does have somewhat better coverage. For instance,
when shifting from quarterly to annual frequency, the number of countries with full coverage of portfolio debt
liability flows over 1996-2014 goes from (1,21,13,19) to (4,32,18,27) for central banks, general government, banks,
and other sectors, respectively.



                                                         45
   Table A2 shows the coverage breakdown for Other investment Debt by instrument, with
each instrument listed separately under Asset and Liability by sector. The table illustrates
how more detailed breakdowns tend to result in poorer coverage, as not all countries provide
such detail to the IMF. Generally, if other investment debt by sector is missing, then all of the
underlying instruments (with the exception of IMF credit) are also missing. When data for
instruments is reported, it can be the case that all of other investment debt is recorded under a
single instrument (usually loans), despite the number representing other instruments as well
(such as trade credit, etc.).58

     The dataset covers 190 Countries over 1980q1-2015q4 (144 Quarters), yielding 27360 Country-Quarter observations. The first
     number in each cell is the total number of countries, quarters, observations, and countries (respectively) with non-missing data,
     while the second number is the percent of total countries, quarters, observations, and countries, respectively. The Panel column
     is the number (and percent) of countries with non-missing observations over 1996q1-2014q4. Note that, at the time of download,
     most 2015q4 variables have not yet been reported. Data for Other Equity is extremely sparse, and so is not reported in this table.

A.3    Filling Missing Data

We proceed in two steps to fill the gaps in the BOP data. The first step is an internal fill.
When the BOP data reports the total for a flow type and reports 3 out of the 4 sectors, we
fill the fourth sector by subtracting the three reported sectors from the total, the residual being
allocated to the missing sector. In the case of capital outflows (asset flows), we combine general
government and central bank into a single public sector. So, when one or both of general
government or central bank are missing data, we fill the public sector with the residual of the
total minus banks and corporate sectors. After performing our internal filling exercise, we use
external data to fill the remaining gaps.
   We draw on 3 separate sources for data to construct measures of capital inflows that can be
used when the BOP data is missing. The first is banking and bond data from the BIS, which
is described in detail in Appendix B. We also draw on the International Investment Position
(IIP) data that accompanies the BOP data, and the Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS)
data which is produced jointly by the World Bank and IMF. Both of these are stock measures,
and have the same sector and capital flow type classifications as the BOP data. The QEDS data
is quarterly and is compiled from a combination of data reported to the IMF via their Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and their General Data Dissemination System (GDDS),
thus sometimes giving it better coverage than the reported IIP stock data. The IIP data comes
either quarterly or annually.
   The dataset with the broadest coverage by sector and capital flow type, and thus fills the
most observations, is derived from the BIS data. The BIS produces a database on international
bond issuances and databases on international banking flows (e.g. loans), which are described
in more detail below and in Appendix B. While the BIS data in many cases captures much
of the international financial flows we are trying to measure, it is not always an appropriate
fill and so we do not want to use just a single data source for our external filling exercise.
Specifically, bond inflows are measured in the BIS data as net issuance of debt securities in
international markets. While this measure is appropriate for many countries, countries that
have many foreigners buying domestically issued bonds or domestics buying international
issued bonds will introduce error. An important example of this is government debt issued by
advanced economies. The US has a substantial amount of sovereign debt that is traded abroad,
but nearly all of the debt is issued domestically, making the BIS measure an inappropriate way


                                                61
to fill that missing series.59 Thus to increase the accuracy of our filling process, we turn first
to the IIP and QEDS data. To approximate flows, we first difference the stocks with a simple
correction for exchange rate valuation effects.60 When both IIP and QEDS data are available,
we use the IIP measures for consistency with the BOP data. We use these stock measures to fill
both portfolio debt and other investment debt for the government and central bank sectors.
We also use these measures to fill Corporate portfolio debt in AE.
    For the remaining missing data, we use our BIS constructed measures. Table A4 summa-
rizes the process of constructing matching series for inflows using the BIS data.61




  59 The  only national data that we include is for the United States, which has substantial capital flows that won’t
be captured by the BIS data, but also a gap between the availability of QEDS and IIP data and the coverage of the
BOP data. Specifically, we fill in the stock IIP measure of government portfolio debt for the US using the TIC data
from the US Treasury, Securities data (B) Tables A.2.d and A.2.a, for the period 1999q1-2003q2, and then take the
first difference.
   60 Data on currency composition of external debt, split by capital flow type and sector, is scarce. We assume the

external debt is denominated in domestic currency. While this is not always the case, changing the assumption
to denominated in USD does not appreciably change our filling accuracy.
   61 Recall that other investment debt can be decomposed into loans, currency and deposits, trade credit and

advances, other accounts payable/receivable, and pension and insurance.

    For the BIS data, we construct our measure of portfolio debt flows from the BIS Interna-
tional Debt Securities (IDS) data. It captures net issuance of debt securities (bonds) in a market
other than that of the country where the borrower resides (Gruić & Wooldridge, 2012). This
does not necessarily imply that the securities are held by foreigners, but can be taken as an
approximation for external financing flows through debt securities.62 Since the IDS data are
compiled on a security-by-security basis, granular sectoral splits are easy to obtain; we thus
construct these net issuances by sector using the same sector definitions as the BOP data.
    For other investment debt, we construct our series from our BIS estimates as follows: First,
we examine the underlying components of other investment debt. The primary instruments
are loans (for corporates and governments) and currency and deposits (for banks and central
banks). If loans are missing for corporates or government, or currency and deposits is miss-
ing for banks or central banks, we rely on the BIS Locational Banking Statistics (LBS) to fill
in the data.63 The BIS data captures cross-border lending from banks in BIS reporting coun-
tries.64,65 This lending can be broken by instrument into loans, debt securities holdings, and
other instruments. We use just the loan instrument in our measure, and so avoid capturing
any bond holdings or equity investment made by banks. Since the BIS data will not capture
official lending, we add IMF Credit to these series to capture that component of loans.66 The
Locational Banking Statistics by Residence (LBSR) historically only break the counterparty sec-
tor for Bank lending into banks and non-banks, though recent data includes additional sector
splits. We employ the BIS Consolidated Banking Statistics (CBS) and the Locational Bank-
ing Statistics by Nationality (LBSN), both of which have further counterparty breakdowns, in
order to construct estimates for Bank lending flows for all 4 sectors for the entire period, as
described in Appendix B.
    After augmenting the Loans (or Currency and Deposits) with the BIS data, we sum them
  62 As  discussed above, the assumption does not hold well for sovereign debt, particularly in advanced
economies, but is otherwise appropriate for many economies.
  63 Interbank loan flows are automatically classified as deposits in the BOP data. Thus, all loans from BIS report-

ing banks to bank counterparties, including the central bank, would be captured in the currency and deposits
instrument in the BOP.
  64 This captures about 95% of all cross-border interbank business (BIS, 2015).
  65 There have been some discrepancies noted in the past between the BOP ad BIS data due for a few specific

cases, such as trustee accounts in Japan and custodial accounts in Switzerland. We give priority to the BOP data,
which is well reported for these series.
  66 IMF Credit is a subcomponent of the Loans instrument in other investment debt for general government and

central banks. This figure is known by the IMF even if the actual loans by sector are not reported by the country.
For central banks, since we fill the currency and deposits instrument with BIS loans, we add IMF Credit to the
central bank back in only if the Loans instrument is missing.

with any remaining non-missing instruments within other investment debt. This sum becomes
our estimate for other investment debt from BIS data.67
    Our corresponding stock measures are similarly constructed. We rely first on IIP data, with
an internal fill. We next fill any missing data with QEDS measures. And finally any remaining
missing observations are filled with our BIS stock estimates derived above.68
    Table A5 shows the percentage of observations for inflows that are filled by each step of
our filling exercise for each sector-instrument category for each country group. For outflows
(asset flows), there are few external datasets to do comparable filling. Thus, we rely primarily
on our internal filling strategy and end up with a much smaller sample of countries. In one
case, we can and do fill using external data. The BIS banking data has data for cross border
lending of banks in countries that report to the BIS, separated into loans and bonds. Thus,
we use this data to fill for the banking sector when missing, but given that most BIS member
reporting countries are advanced, this does not fill many observations.
    Figure A1 compares aggregate inflows as measured by our filled data and from the BOP
alone, for total external debt of banks and corporates in our samples of AE and EM. We plot
annual flows here for clarity. These graphs show that generally both series tell the same story,
but there are periods in which accounting for the missing data makes a significant difference.
For advanced economy corporates, a significant expansion leading up to the 2008 crisis and a
the subsequent contraction are missed. This is due primarily to filling in portfolio debt data
for the US and Spain for the 2008 surge, as well as a few other AE for the earlier 2001 peak. For
EM, both banks and corporates had much larger flows relative to the BOP measure following
the 2008 collapse, driven primarily by filling data for other investment debt inflows for China.
    Figure A2 plots total external debt inflows for government and central bank sectors. Miss-
ing U.S. government portfolio debt drives the difference for the AE in panel (a). EM gov-
ernments and AE central banks are fairly well represented in terms of volume. Note that net
inflows can be negative as well as positive, which is the case for EM central banks, where some
missing data consists of negative net inflows, which brings our filled data below the raw BOP
  67 In general, when other investment debt is missing, most data on the underlying instruments are also missing.

A few countries are exceptions to this, and only for a very few periods: Eritrea and Equatorial Guinea in the
annual data, and Eritrea and Kosovo in the quarterly data. None of these countries are included in our analysis
with this data.
  68 Even though the sector data may be missing in the BOP, the total for portfolio debt or other investment debt

inflows often is not. We do not constrain our filled series by sector to match the total of the flow type as reported
in the BOP. However, the two series correlate highly (.86 for total debt inflows) and exhibit similar patterns.

B       BIS Data

B.1        International Debt Securities

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) produces datasets on international bond issuance
and bonds outstanding, by sector and by residence or nationality of the issuer. International
debt securities (IDS) are defined as those issued in a market other than that of the country
where the borrower resides (Gruić & Wooldridge, 2012). This does not necessarily imply that
the securities are held by foreigners, but can be taken as an approximation for external hold-
ings of debt securities.71 Since the IDS data are compiled on a security-by-security basis, gran-
  70 The outflow figures are based on a balanced sample using annual data for 31 countries.
  71 While this is a reasonable assumption for most borrowing sectors and countries in the world, there are some
exceptions. Most notably, the gap between the set of IDS and the set of externally-held debt securities tends to be
considerable in the case of government bonds issued by reserve currency countries, since these countries often
issue large amounts of government debt in domestic markets, which are then traded abroad. Lately, this has also
been the case for the government bonds of several large EMEs (e.g. Brazil, Mexico, and Poland), albeit to a lesser
degree than for government bonds issued by reserve currency countries. For most of these cases, BOP data is
available and used. Otherwise, we rely on other data sources first to avoid this issue.


                                                        72
ular sectoral splits are easy to obtain, unlike the data on debt from international bank creditors
which requires some construction to obtain the split.
    The IDS data are important for our exercise. While the BOP data relies on reporting by
national statistical offices (which can result in incomplete coverage of portfolio debt securities
by sector), the IDS data are compiled directly on a security-by-security basis, which can result
in much better coverage. The IDS data can also be presented on a residency basis or by the
nationality of the issuing institution. See Avdjiev, Chui, and Shin (2014) and Shin (2013) for a
more detailed discussion of this issue.
    There are several options for how we allocate international debt securities to each sector.
As noted earlier, bonds can be classified based on the residence of the issuer or the nationality
of the issuer. Further, the BIS classifies IDS according to sector with several subsectors which
can be aggregated up to our public, bank, and corporate sectors: Public banks, private banks,
central banks, public other financial corporations, private other financial corporations, public
non-financial corporations, private non-financial corporations, and general government sec-
tors.
    We keep general government and central bank sectors as they are found. Public and private
banks are allocated to the bank sector. Public and private other financial and public and private
non-financial corporations are allocated to the corporate sector. This aligns the bonds up with
the standard institutional sector definitions in the BOP data. However, the role of public banks
and corporations can be quite important in some countries.


B.2     BIS External Bank Credit Data

The BIS compiles two sets of statistics on international banking activity. The Locational Bank-
ing Statistics (LBS) capture outstanding claims and liabilities of internationally active banks
located in 44 reporting countries against counterparties residing in more than 200 countries.
Banks record their positions on an unconsolidated basis, including intragroup positions be-
tween offices of the same banking group. The data are compiled based on the residency prin-
ciple (as done for BOP or QEDS). The LBS capture the overwhelming majority of cross-border
banking activity.72 The historical LBS data breaks down counterparties in each country into
  72 Due  to the fact that not all counties in the world report data to the LBS, these statistics do not capture
the entire global stock of outstanding external bank credit. Most countries which host large internationally ac-
tive banks have reported to the LBS for several decades (the full list of LBS reporting countries is available at:


                                                       73
banks (banks and central bank sectors) and non-banks (corporate and government sectors).73
The LBS reports outstanding stocks, and based on them BIS calculates exchange rate- and
break-adjusted flows.74
    The second set of banking data is the Consolidated Banking Statistics (CBS). This differs
from the LBS in that the positions of banks reporting to the BIS are aggregated by the nation-
ality (rather than by the residence) of the reporting bank.75 Currently, banking groups from 31
countries report to the CBS. We use the CBS on an immediate counterparty basis (CBS/IC).76
The CBS data does provide a borrower breakdown of the Non-Bank Sector into Public and
Private. Since there is no currency breakdown available for the CBS, the BIS does not calculate
adjusted flows.


B.3     Obtaining Borrowing Sector Splits for Bank Creditor Data

In this section, we describe our methodology for constructing gross capital inflows and debt
outstanding from BIS sources. Our goal is to obtain the stocks and flows measured based
on residency (consistent with the LBS data), but we also employ the CBS to obtain certain
(non-bank) borrowing sector splits. We deviate from residency in some cases to gain a more
complete picture of flows.
    The bank loan data is from the LBS by residency (LBSR). For observations prior to 2013,
the LBS only provide the breakdown between bank and non-bank debtors (where non-bank
http://www.bis.org/statistics/rep countries.htm). Nevertheless, there are a small number of notable exceptions,
such as China and Russia (the LBS series for both of which starts only as recently as Q4/2015). That said, the LBS
capture around 95% of all global cross-border interbank business (BIS, 2015). While there is no similar estimate
for the share of cross-border bank lending to non-banks captured by the LBS, it is reasonable to assume that it is
also above 90%.
  73 Data on total cross border claims by BIS reporting banks separated by bank and non-bank counterparties

are available going back to 1978. The recent enhancements to the BIS LBS data have provided more granular
counterparty sector splits. Most importantly in the context of our study, in the enhanced LBS data the non-bank
sector has been divided into the non-bank private sector and the public sector (Avdjiev, McGuire, & Wooldridge,
2015).
  74 Breaks may arise from changes in reporting practices, methodology, population of reporting institutions, etc.

Other valuation adjustments besides exchange rates are less concerning, as loans are generally not traded in
secondary markets.
  75 For example, the positions of a French bank’s subsidiary located in New York - which in the LBS are included

in the positions of banks in the United States - are consolidated in the CBS with those of its parent and included
in the positions of French banks.
  76 The CBS are compiled in two different ways: by immediate counterparty and by ultimate risk. The imme-

diate counterparty is the entity with whom the bank contracts to lend or borrow. Ultimate risk takes account of
credit risk mitigants, such as collateral, guarantees and credit protection bought, which transfer the bank’s credit
exposure from one counterparty to another. (BIS, 2015)




                                                        74
captures both the non-bank private and the public sector).77 We focus on cross-border bank
lending in the LBS in the form of loans, for which we have data starting in 1996. However,
our methodology described below can also be applied to total cross-border bank claims (in all
instruments).78
    Next, we describe how we use the sectoral split information contained in the CBS/IC data
in order to divide the Non-Bank sector in the LBS data into Non-Bank Public sector and Non-
Bank Private sector. This is described next. First, we go over our methodology for constructing
the split for the outstanding stocks of LBS cross-border bank loans. Then, we describe our
methodology for constructing the split for exchange rate adjusted changes, which relies on
currency composition information available in the LBS.


B.3.1   Borrowing Sector Splits for Outstanding Stocks

For outstanding stocks, we use the share of international bank debt for each sector from the
CBS to estimate the split of the Non-Bank LBS data into Public and Private components.79 We
calculate that as follows:

                                                              I NTCnbp,j,t
                             XBSnbp,j,t = XBCnb,j,t
                             [                                                                                   (6)
                                                        I NTCnbp,j,t + I NTC pub,j,t

                                                              I NTC pub,j,t
                             XBS pub,j,t = XBCnb,j,t
                             [                                                                                   (7)
                                                        I NTCnbp,j,t + I NTC pub,j,t

bank debt, XBC denotes the cross border claims (from the LBS) of BIS reporting banks, and
I NTC is international claims (from the CBS on immediate counterparty basis). The CBS inter-
national claims are defined as the sum of XBC and the local claims by foreign affiliates that are
denominated in foreign currencies (LCFC).
    This construction of the split of bank debt makes the following assumptions: First, the
sectoral shares for I NTC are the same as the sectoral shares for XBC. This is reasonable since
  77 The enhanced BIS data, available from 2013 on, splits the non-bank sector into public and private sub-sectors.

Note that the LBS include central banks with banks instead of public, but central banks tend to compose a very
small portion of cross-border bank claims in the BIS data.
  78 Starting in 1984, we have data for total bank cross-border credit (in all instruments). We don’t use this in our

initial analysis in order to avoid double counting external bond flows. In practice, the difference between total
bank credit and bank credit in just the loan and deposit instruments tends to be small.
  79 This estimation is also used in Arslanalp and Tsuda (2014a) and Arslanalp and Tsuda (2014b).



                                                         75
for most countries, LCFC tends to be small relative to XBC.80 Second, the sectoral shares for the
set of banks that report LBS data (44 countries) are the same as the sectoral shares for the set
of banks that report CBS data (31 countries). The 31 CBS reporting countries account for about
90% of the XBC in the LBS, and the CBS captures the activities of the subsidiaries of banks from
these 31 countries worldwide. As a result, the CBS data are sufficiently representative to make
the above assumption a reasonable one. Third, data for the CBS that allows us to estimate the
split of Non-Bank into Public and Private is not available for advanced economies before 2000,
and is only available on a semiannual basis for EM for the period before 2000. We linearly
extrapolate the semiannual shares to Public and Private into a quarterly series for EM. For
advanced economies, we assume constant shares from 2000 backwards.81
    Having made these assumptions and constructed the external debt to bank creditors, we
                                                          XBS to IDS for each sector. This will
can then estimate total external debt by sector by adding [
produce a longer series of external debt estimates by sector than the Quarterly External Debt
Statistics (QEDS)82 , and cover more countries.
    Recently, the BIS has released its enhanced banking data, starting in 2013. This data contain
more granular borrowing sector splits - Bank, Public, and Non-Bank Private. We use this
short, recent series to judge the quality of our decomposition. Our methodology for estimating
borrowing sector splits for the non-bank borrowing sector and the public sector generates
estimates that are very close to the actual (reported) underlying figures.83


B.3.2   Borrowing Sector Splits for Outstanding Flows

Obtaining exchange rate-adjusted flows to all sectors and to banks is straightforward since
they are reported in the LBS data. However, as discussed above, the historical LBS data do not
have a split of the non-banks sector into its public and private components. Thus, in order to
get estimates for exchange rate-adjusted flows to the non-bank private sector and to the public
  80 While  for most countries, LCFC tends to be small relative to XBC, there are a small number of exceptions.
For example, this is not the case in dollarized economies (e.g. Ecuador) and some emerging European economies
(e.g. Hungary and Poland), where lending denominated in euro and in Swiss francs has been non-negligible.
   81 The assumption of constant shares for advanced economies before 2000 is not too concerning when we are

only extending back 4 years.
   82 The QEDS data starts in 2004, and provides data on stocks of external debt by institutional sector for a wide

range of countries.
   83 Since not all LBS reporting countries have started providing the enhanced borrowing sector splits, these

comparisons are based on the set of LBS reporting countries which had started reporting enhanced LBS data as
of March 2016.

sector, we rely on the estimated stocks for those sectors obtained in the previous section.84 We
assume that the currency compositions of claims on these sectors are the same as the currency
composition of claims on the non-bank sector as a whole.
   Using the above assumption, we can obtain estimates of the stock of bank lending to the
non-bank private Sector denominated in currency j as follows:

C.2     Direct Investment Debt

The direct investment debt (DID) component of the data is not as extensively reported as our
augmented data for portfolio debt and other investment inflows, so we limit our sample for
this analysis.85 The balanced DID sample is a subsample of 67 countries, of which there are 20
advanced, 28 emerging, and 19 developing. Details of the 22 countries that are dropped can
be found in Appendix A.4.
    Direct investment debt is an important part of direct investment flows, as shown in Fig-
ure C6 where we plot it against direct investment equity, in aggregate terms. The figure shows
that they share the same pattern over time. However, with the rise in offshore issuance much
of direct investment debt may really be more like portfolio debt flows and hence less stable
than its equity counterpart (Avdjiev et al., 2014). Direct investment debt makes up a larger
share of direct investment for AE, but less so for EM and especially developing countries. It is
interesting to note that, for both debt and equity, direct investment has decreased substantially
in advanced economies following the global financial crisis, but has leveled off somewhat in
emerging and developing economies. Thus, while direct investment debt plays a larger role
in the advanced world prior to the crisis, its influence will be felt relatively more in other
economies.

    Direct investment debt is only recorded in the BOP if one of the (related) counterparties
involved is a non-financial entity. Debt flows between related financial enterprises (including
banks) are captured in either portfolio debt or other investment debt. We make the assumption
  85 When DID is missing, we fill it by subtracting direct investment equity (DIE) from total direct investment, as
with our other data series.


                                                        93
that direct investment debt flows from offshore non-financial firms to onshore financial firms
(or banks) are negligible. With this assumption, we can allocate direct investment debt to the
corporate sector. We compare direct investment debt, portfolio debt, and other investment
debt for the corporate sector in Figure C7.86

         (a) Advanced                             (b) Emerging                           (c) Developing

    We see that direct investment debt can be significant in size, relative to other capital flow
types. It tends to follow the same trends as other forms of debt in the aggregate, but can
have some influence on the evolution of total debt. In fact, it is larger than the other debt
components in some periods.


C.3     PPG vs PNG Debt Inflows

We have focused in this paper on the sectoral split of inflows by government, central bank,
banks, and corporates, and found important differences between public and private flows.
Another way to examine the roles of the public and private sector is to split the data by Public
and Publicly-Guaranteed Debt (PPG) vs Private Non-Guaranteed Debt (PNG). This allows us
to capture flows nominally allocated to the private sector which should actually be considered
liabilities of the public sector, such as borrowing by public and quasi-public corporations com-
mon in many EM.87 We can do this for emerging and developing economies using the World
  86 When   comparing direct investment with our other series that have been filled using BIS data, we need to
assume that direct investment debt flows from banks to non-financial firms are negligible (else they would be
double counted). This assumption applies to less than 3% of observations in our direct investment debt sample, as
most observations with non-zero direct investment debt are not missing the other investment debt for corporates
series in the BOP.
  87 The usual definitions allocate flows to the sector of the immediate borrower, not the sector who is ultimately

owes the debt, which may result in effectively misattributing the debt to the wrong sector. Also, note that all of

Bank’s Debtor Reporting System (DRS) data found within the World Bank International Debt
Statistics (WB-IDS). This data is annual going back to 1970 for many countries, but we use a
balanced sample of 14 EM and 60 developing countries over 1981-2014:88
    Emerging (14): Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Colombia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Malaysia,
Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Thailand, Turkey
    Developing (60): Algeria, Bangladesh, Belize, Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Botswana, Burkina
Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Republic
of Congo, Costa Rica, Cote d’Ivoire, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador,
Ethiopia, Fiji, Gabon, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Honduras, Ja-
maica, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Maldives, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco,
Nepal, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Rwanda, Senegal,
Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Swaziland, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Vanuatu,
Zambia, Zimbabwe
    Figure C8 (a)-(b) plots aggregate debt inflows from the DRS data, with flows split by PPG
and PNG debt. Panels (c)-(d) plot the average of PPG and PNG debt to GDP ratio for each
group of countries. According to these measures, PNG debt in EM soared leading up to the
GFC, as most measures of debt inflows did. Following a brief collapse, PNG debt rebounded
significantly in the aggregate, but this rebound is muted if we examine flows relative to GDP
for the average country. This is consistent with what we see in Figures 5 and C4, where much
of the post-2008 increase in aggregate flows is driven by large and quickly growing EM such
as China.89
    In both emerging and developing economies, and in both the aggregate and average GDP
figures, we see a steady decline in PPG debt until the GFC, after which it rebounds, and signif-
icantly so in the case of developing economies. This is similar to what we observe in Figures 5
our measures are based on the residency principle, however the recent increase in offshore bond issuance can also
be a source of mismeasurement of capital flows. Offshore bond issuance has received significant recent attention
in Shin (2013), Avdjiev et al. (2014), Avdjiev, McCauley, and Shin (2016), and others, so we refer the interested
reader to those sources for a more complete discussion of the issue.
   88 The DRS data is first split into short term, long term, and IMF credits. The long term data can be further

subdivided by PNG debt and PPG debt. The PPG debt can further be split by creditor. We assume that the
portion of PPG debt that is short term is negligible, and so attribute all Short Term Debt to PNG. We further
combine IMF credit into PPG debt to get our split of total external debt into public and private components. This
is analagous to the decomposition done in Alfaro, Kalemli-Özcan, and Volosovych (2014), who do their analysis
in the context of net flows.
   89 These figures will not be exactly comparable in terms of magnitude with our previous dataset in Figure 5, as

the underlying sample of countries is somewhat different.

and C4, but in those figures the decrease leading up to 2008 is not as pronounced as when you
take the longer time horizon.
   These figures also highlight how private and public capital flows can move opposite each
other, consistent with our previous results. This is particularly noticeable for EM around the
2008 crisis, where we see PNG flows fall dramatically while PPG flows rise, thus smoothing
out the total debt inflows.
