           Adjustment to Expected and Unexpected Oil Price increases



                                  ABSTRACT



     For   oil importers, differences in economic performance after the

1973—74 oil price increase and after the 1979—80 increase can be

attributed to a number of factors, including the fact that the 1973-74

oil price increase was unexpected whereas the 1979—80 increase was

largely expected.

     In this paper, we analyze how an economy's adjustment to expected

oil price increases might differ from its adjustment to unexpected

increases. By expected oil price increases, we shall mean ones that

were anticipated in the past, and by unexpected oil price increases,

we shall mean those that were not anticipated in the past but occur

unexpectedly in the present. We model this distinction using a three—

period model, where the periods are called the past, present and future.

1.   Introduction

     For many oil—importing developed economies, the adjustment to the

1973—74 oil price increase and to the 1978—79 increase differed markedly,

even though the magnitude of increase relative to the size of their

economies was roughly the same in each period.1 While countries often

experienced recession and an acceleration of inflation after each oil

price increase, there were noteworthy differences in degree between the

two periods. For some, such as Japan, the adverse consequences of the

second major oil price increase were much less severe, particularly in

the areas of consumer prices, industrial production and employment.2

     Differences in economic performance in the two periods have been

attributed to cyclical factors, industrial restructuring, policy actions,

and the willingness of industry and labor to accept the cost of the

terms—of-trade decline brought about by higher oil prices.3 Less

attention has been given to the role of expectations as a contributing

factor. While there has been some work on the role of expectations in

the adjustment process, it has focussed on how adjustment differs when

oil price increases are expected to be temporary rather than permanent

(e.g. Sachs (1981), Bruno (1982), Svensson and Razin (1982), Svensson

(1981), Marion (1981) and Marion and Svensson (1981, 1982)).    In comparing

the 1973—74 and 1978—79 experience, another distinction merits

examination —   that   between expected and unexpected oil price increases.

By expected oil price increases, we shall mean ones that were anticipated

in the past, and by unexpected oil price increases, we shall mean those

that were not anticipated in the past but occur unexpectedly in the

present.4 The different economic performance after each oil price
                                 2




increase may be due, in part, to the fact that the 1973-74 oil price

increase was unexpected, whereas the 1978—79 increase was largely

expected.

     In this paper, we present a theoretical model which enables us to

analyze how an economy's adjustment to expected oil price increases might

differ from its adjustment to unexpected increases.

     A priori, it seems that with expected oil price increases, the

adjustment can start in the past and   be spread out over time. With
unexpected increases, there can be no adjustment in the past, so all of

the adjustment must take place in the present and the future. Neverthe-

less, while the need to adjust in the present may be larger for unexpected

price increases, the capacity to adjust may be less, since we might

expect more rigidity and less substitution possibilities in the present

in the face of unexpected price increases.

     We shall model some of these aspects rigorously in a three—period

model, where the periods are called the past, present and future. We

shall calculate changes in output, oil imports, consumption, investment,

welfare, the trade balance and the current account of a small oil-

importing economy when there are present and future oil price increases,

in one case when these are anticipated in the past, in the other when

they are not.

     The following results are derived under the assumption that oil and

capital are "cooperative" factors:

     First, if wages are flexible and there is full employment, current

domestic product falls less for unexpected oil price increases than for

expected increases. The reason is that with unexpected oil price increases,
                                   3




firms have no opportunity to reduce past investment and hence they operate

in the present with a relatively larger capital stock. This outcome

illustrates that firms have less substitution possibilities in the short

run.

       Both present consumption and investment fall more with unexpected

oil price increases, loosely speaking because the necessary downward

adjustment of consumption and investment takes place only in the present

and future but not in the past.

       It follows that unexpected oil price increases cause a smaller

deterioration in the trade balance than expected increases. However,

they don't necessarily cause a smaller current-account deficit. This

is because expected oil price increases stimulate greater saving in the

past and hence lead to a larger service—account surplus in the present.

       Second, if real wages are predetermined so that full employment

results if previous expectations are fulfilled, then full employment will

be maintained only for expected oil price increases. For unexpected

increases, there will be a fall in present employment if labor and oil

are cooperative factors. This drop in employment causes an additional

drop in present domestic product. It no longer follows that the fall

in present domestic product is unambiguously smaller or that the trade

deficit deteriorates less for unexpected oil price increases than for

expected increases. In fact, if the employment effect is large enough,

the opposite may be true. This case may be more in keeping with the

experience of 1973—74, when real—wage adjustment was sluggish.

       The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops the model.

Section 3 compares the economy's response to expected and unexpected
                                 4




oil price increases. Section 4 shows how the comparative results are

modified when there are predeteinined real wages and the possibility

of less than full employment. Section 5 contains concluding remarks

and possible extensions.

2. The Model

        Consider a small open economy in an intertemporal framework. There

are three periods, indexed t =       0,    1 and 2, called the past, present and

future, respectively. In each period the economy produces final goods,

using domestic capital and labor and an imported intermediate input

called oil. There is no domestic oil production. Oil and final goods

are traded on the world market in each period at given relative prices.

There is a world credit market where the country can borrow and lend at

given world rates of interest.

        Let the production function in period t,be           x = ft(ktzt)   where x

is output of final goods, kt is the capital stock, and z is imported

oil We suppress the labor input, implicitly assuming full employment

of a fixed supply of labor. In Section 4 we relax this assumption in

order to deal with predetermined wages and variable employment. We assume

that the production function is strictly concave in the two remaining

arguments. We define the Domestic Product (DP) function for each period

asYt(, qt, kt)= max{xt —     qtzt: x = ft(kt,zt)},            where qt is the spot

price of oil in terms of final goods in period t. The first argument of

the DP function, the price of final goods, is set equal to unity since

we shall use final goods as nunieraire. The DP function has the standard

properties that equilibrium final goods output and oil imports are given

by

             t     t   t      t        t       t
            x (1, q , k )   =Y1(l,    q ,     k    )   and
(2.1)

            z(l, qt, kt) =   _Yt(l,    qt kt),

where 4 and            denote the partials of the D? function with respect

to the price of final goods and oil, respectively.

        Final goods can be invested in period t in order to augment the

capital stock in period t +                1,       i.e.

present value of future goods."The equilibrium investment levels will

maximize the present value of domestic product, net of investment, arid

since they will be unchanged in the following analysis.

        This completes the discussion of the supply side. Let us now deal

with demand. With regard to welfare and consumption, the economy is
                                     o    1                                         2                t
represented by a utility function U(c , c                                  ,    c       ),   where c denotes
                                         7


consumption of final goods in period t. The corresponding (present value)

expenditure function is defined as E(c50,                 u) = min{r3°c° + c' +

U(c°, c1, c2) > u}. Equilibrium consumption is given by


(2.5)        c = Et,   t =   0,   1 and 2,


where Et denotes the partial of the expenditure function with respect to

the present value price of goods in period t.

        The intertemporal budget constraint of the economy can now be

               .21'
expressed as

(2.6)        E(S°, ,         u) ÷ I0(ql,     k°)   + 11(q2,k1) =

             00
              Y (1,
                       0
                      q ,
                             0    1     1 1      22     2   2
                            k ) + Y (1, q ,k ) + Y (1, q , k ),


where the capital stocks fulfill


(2.7)        kt = kt+        1tqt+l kt) for t =     0 and 1.



Equation (2.6) states that the present value of expenditure on consumption

and investment equals the present value of domestic product. It can be

taken as expressing the welfare level u as an implicit function of the initial

capital stock, k°, the oil prices in the three periods, q°, q1 and q2,

and the present value factors, S° and .             The level of welfare can be

substituted into (2.5) to give the equilibrium levels of consumption. The

equilibrium level of final goods output, oil imports and investment are

given by (2.1) and the investment functions. Hence for a predetermined

past capital stock and exogenously given oil prices and discount factors,

the equilibrium of the small open economy is fully determined.

        The equilibrium can be interpreted as a perfect foresight equilibrium

over time. Equivalently, it can be viewed as a sequence of temporary
                                                        8


equilibria, where variables referring to later periods are perfect

foresight expectations and plans. We shall examine how the perfect

foresight equilibrium varies with a change in oil prices.

     First, we consider an initial equilibrium (over time), with given

oil prices q°, q1 and q2. Next, we consider the effects of an oil

price increase in the present and the future, i.e. a permanent oil

price increase, with dq1, dq2 > 0. We assume initially that this

oil price increase is anticipated in the past. We analyze howthis

expected increase changes the endogenous variables relative to the

initial equilibrium. In particular, we are interested in how expected

oil price increases affect the small economys welfare and how they

change domestic product, oil imports, investment and consumption in

the present period. We are also interested in how the present trade

balance and current account respond. To calculate these changes,

we merely differentiate the equilibrium conditions.

     We also wish to compare these changes to those which occur when

oil price increases are unexpected, i.e. not anticipated in the past.

In this case, agents in the past expect present and future oil prices

to equal qt1 t = 1, 2.             As they enter the present, they learn that

dqt > 0, t = 1, 2. We represent this case by a temporary equilibrium

in the present, conditional upon past values of production, investment

and consumption, x ,       i

                               ,



     We define the conditional expenditure function as (l, 2, u; c°) =

                :          ,



and future consumption required to reach a givenwelfare level, conditional

upon given past consumption. Then the budget constraint for the present
                                                     9


and   future periods, given the variables in the past, can be written as

                         2       u;   c°)   +   11(q2,k1) =
(2.8)                   Y1(1, q11k1) +          (SY2(1,    q2, k2) +


where

               k
                   1
                       = k0 +     I0and
               k2 =          +    11(q2,k1).

It   states that the present value of expenditure on consumption and
investment in the present and                    the future equals       the present value of
present      and future      domestic product plus 6°T°. The term 5°T° is the
present value of the past trade balance and                         is   equivalent to the
accumulation of net foreign assets                       at the   beginning of the present period
plus repatriated interest income)' Given unexpected oil price increases,
changes in the endogenous variables relative to the initial equilibrium
can now be derived by differentiating the relevant equilibrium conditions.

        In   the next section, we examine the changes in various endogenous

variables for the case where oil prices are expected and for the case

where they are not, and we compare the two cases.


3. Expected versus Unexpected Oil Price Increases

       In this section, we compare the effects of expected and unexpected

oil price increases on domestic product, output, oil imports, investment,

welfare and consinnption. We also compare their effects on the present

trade balance and current account.
                                               10



Domestic product, output and            oil     inputs

        First, let us compare the response of current domestic product

to expected and      unexpected        oil price increases. Differentiating the

DP function, we find that the change in domestic product given an ex-

pected increase in oil prices is


(3.1)        dY1 =   -dq1     +
                                  YdI0     <



The first term on the right—hand side of (3.1) represents a negative

oil terms    of   trade effect. The second           term is   the   effect of a change
in past investment on present domestic product, with

(3.2)       dI° =    IOdql.
                      q

Assuming    that oil and capitaL are "cooperative" factors , which occurs
if f > 0,      the partial 1° is negative; firms desire a smaller present capital
stock    in light of higher oil prices and reduce their past investment plans

accordingly. The drop         in   past investment as well as the negative terms

of   trade effect cause a         fall in present domestic product.

        The change in current domestic product due to an unexpected                 oil
price increase is


(3.3) d =            —z1dq1
                              <
                                  0,

where tildes over .fferentials or partials denote that they are conditional
upon given past variables. Now the drop in domestic product is due to

the negative terms of trade effect only. Since firms                    did   not anticipate

the oil price increase prior to            period 1,     they had no opportunity to

reduce past investment. It follows that the fall in current domestic
                                         11


product is less for unexpected oil price increases, i.e.


 (3.4)       dY1 < dY<      0.



         Of course, this outcome depends on three factors. First, oil

and capital are cooperative inputs, so that firms    will   reduce past

investment if they anticipate oil price increases. Second, firms utilize

the entire inherited capital stock in production even if for unexpected

oil price increases the ex post marginal product of capital, Y, is less

than the real interest rate, r0. Since firms have already purchased the

present capital stock, they will find it optimal to fully utilize it as

long as its marginal product is positive. Third, full employment of

labor is maintained. In Section 4 we find that pre—set wage contracts

introduce employment effects which modify the outcome in (3.4).

        We next compare the responses of current output and oil inputs to

expected and unexpected oil price increases. From (2.1) we get the

change in present output and oil inputs given an expected oil price

increase:


(3.5)        dx1 =    11 + 1o           0, and

                    +zldIO<O.

The first term on the right-hand side of each equation represents the
                                                    11/
negative substitution effect of higher oil prices.—' The second term

is the negative effect of lower past investment.

        When oil price increases are unexpected, there is no change in past

investment. The fall in present output and oil inputs reflects only the
                                         12


negative substitution effect, with

Although firms find themselves in the present period with                more   capital

than they would have liked had they known               of   the forthcoming oil price

increases, they nevertheless find it optimal to utilize it fully. There-

fore they end up producing relatively more output and using relatively

more oil inputs in the present when oil price increase are unexpected.

Essentially firms have less room for substitution in the present, given

the capital stock inherited fran the past.


Investment

        For expected oil price increases, the change in present investment

is


(3.7)        d11 = 11dq2 +
                             Idk1
                                    = 11dq2       -   dI°    0.



The first term represents the change in present investment due to an in-

crease in future oil prices. When oil and capital are cooperative in

future production, firms will desire a smaller future capital stock and

so invest less today; i1dq2 <       0.        The second term represents an increase

in present investment due to an increase in present oil prices. Since the

increase in present oil prices lowers past investment but does not change

the optimal future capital stock, it leads to an equal and offsetting

change in present investment, i.e. I = —1.                   It appears that present

investment may either increase or decrease in response to expected

oil price increases, of      course,     on net, investment falls over
                                     13


the past and present, since dI° + d11 < 0, and the smaller the adjustment

in the past, the more likely that investment will have to fall in the

present.

        For unexpected oil price increases, the change in present investment

is



(3.8)            = 11dq2 <   0.
                    q

Present investment unambiguously falls.        There is no offsetting change in

past investment, in contrast to the case with expected oil price increases.

        Comparing (3.7) and (3.8) we see that if present investment falls

in both cases, it falls relatively less when oil prices are expected. This

is because firms can react to expected increases by spreading the drop in

investment spending over the past and present. With unexpected oil price

increases, firms must make all of the adjustment in the present.


Welfare

        We now compare the welfare effects of expected and unexpected oil

price increases. Differentiating (2.6) and making use of (2.1), (2.3)—(2.5)

and (2.7), we get du, the change in welfare for an expected oil price in-

crease. We find that


(3.9)       Edu =   —z1dq1 — cS2z2dq2 <   0,

where E is the partial of the expenditure function with respect to the

welfare level and represents the inverse of the marginal utility of wealth.

Equation (3.9) indicates that the small country faces a negative oil terms

of trade effect in the present and in the future and consequently suffers

a welfare loss when oil prices increase.
                                                 14


        The change in welfare brought about by an unexpected oil price

increase, dii, can           be   calculated by differentiating (2.8), which gives


(3.10)          dii = —z'dq1          -
                                          52z2dq2 < 0.


As before, the welfare effect consists of the oil terms of trade effects,

although the inverse of the marginal utility of wealth is evaluated

conditional upon a given past consumption. It turns out that

the inverse is the same in both cases, i.e.                      =   E,]-.a" so the        first—order

effects on welfare are the same for expected and unexpected oil price

increases. That is,


(3.11)         du =    dii   <   0.


       The second—order effects on welfare are different, of course, and in-

clusion of the second—order effects would make the total welfare loss from

unexpected oil price increases larger than for expected oil price in-

creases. However, taking these second—order effects into account would not

Consumption

       When    oil   price increases are expected, the change in present consumption

is



(3.12)         dc1 = C1E du <
                           Wu         0,

which is equal to the welfare effect (3.9) times the marginal propensity to

consume present goods out of wea1th.-" Since oil prices reduce welfare,

they lower present consumption.
                                                        15



       For unexpected oil price increases, we find


 (3.13)     d& =                   <   0.

Comparing (3.13) with (3.12) and recalling that Edu =                                 we find that


            d1 - dc1          =
(3.14)
                                   ( - C)Edu.
In the absence of any particular reason for households to favor consump-

tion in any one period over any other, the conditional marginal propensity

to consumer should be larger than the unconditional since with the former,

households had no opportunity to adjust their spending in the past.

It follows that C >
                               C and        the fall in consumption is greater for unex-

pected oil price increases. Although we shall take this to be the case,

the opposite outcome is certainly plausible. For instance, if consumption

adjusts with some inertia, then the fall in present consumption could be

less with unexpected oil price increases.


The Trade Balance and the Current Account

       Since we have already compared the effects of expected and unexpected

oil price increases on domestic product, investment arid consumption, it is

a straightforward exercise to compare their effects on the present trade

balance and current account.

       The present trade balance is simply


(3.15)     T1 =   Y
                      1   —
                              E1
                                   - I1     =   x
                                                    1
                                                        — q 11
                                                             z   —   C
                                                                         1   —
                                                                                 i
                                                                                 .1




the   difference between domestic product and expenditure on consumption and

investment.

       If we add to both sides of (3.15) net interest income from abroad earned
                                             16


during the past, r0T0, we get the present current account,


 (3.16)     b1 = T1 + r0T0 =                 - q1z1   + r0T0) — c1] -


which is the difference between national product,                   x1 -   qz + r0T0, and
absorption, c1 + i1, or equivalently, the difference between national
           1     11 00 - c 1
saving [(x — q z ÷ r T )                 I   and investment, i
                                                                   .1


     To calculate the change in the present trade balance when there

are expected oil price increases, we differentiate (3.15). We get


(3.17)    dT1 = dY1 —           — d11,
                          dE1


where dY1, dE1 and d11 are given by (3.1), (3.12) and (3.7), respectively.

Expected oil price increases reduce present domestic product, which worsens

the trade balance, but they also reduce present consumption and may, under

previously specified circumstances, reduce investment as well. Any drop

in absorpti'on improves the trade balance.hul'

     For unexpected oil price increases, we again differentiate (3.15) in

order to calculate the trade balance response,


(3.18)    d& =   d'   -
                          d1
                                -   d,
where d'1, dE1 and         are given by (3.3), (3.13) and (3.8), respectively.

     Comparing the trade balance response for expected and unexpected oil

price increases, we find that


(3.19)    dT1 - dT1 =
                          -YdI° -(ã - C)Edu
                                                         -   dI°   > 0,



Equation (3.19) indicates that, under full employment, the present trade

deficit (surplus) is unambiguously smaller (larger) for unexpected oil
                                            17


price increases than for expected oil price increases. The first term

on the right—hand side of (3.19) is the investment effect on domestic

product. With unexpected oil price increases there is no fall in past

investment, so present domestic product is relatively higher. This helps

make the trade deficit smaller for unexpected oil price increases.

The second and third terms are the consumption and investment effects,

respectively, and we have already noted that present consumption and in-

vestment fall more for unexpected oil price increases since there was no adjust-

ment in the past. Since unexpected oil price increases reduce domestic

product less and reduce absorption more than expected oil price increases,

they cause a smaller deterioration in the trade balance.

     The same    cannot       be said for the current account. While unexpected

oil price increases cause a smaller deterioration in the trade balance,

expected oil price increases generate more improvement in the service

account.     Therefore       unexpected oil price increases may cause either a

larger or smaller current—account deficit (surplus) than expected oil price

increases.

     Specifically, oil price increases which occur inthe present and the

future have no effect on past output, but if they are expected, they do

permit households and firms to begin reducing their consumption and in-

vestment in the past. Hence the country saves more in the past and receives

a greater inflow of interest income in date               These   additional interest
income inflows do not take place if oil price increases are unexpected.

Comparing the current-account response in the two cases, we find that


(3.15)       db -   db
                         1       -l -
                             = (dT        1 00>
                                        dT )—r dT   0,
                                            18


where dT° =
              -CEdu
                       -   dI°   >   0.   As (3.15) makes clear, expected oil

price increases cause relatively greater trade deficits but relatively

greater service—account surpluses, so we cannot say anything definitive

about the relative current-account response to expected versus unexpected

oil price increases without more information on specific parameter values.

     Table 1 summarizes our results. It shows that the small economy

responds differently to expected and unexpected oil price increases. All of

the comparisons are made on the assumptions that oil and capital are co-

operative factors and that labor is fully employed.              In the next section,

we show how the existence of pre—set wage contracts can modify these re—

suits.

4. Predetermined real wages and employment effects

     We shall now consider a situation in which a period's real wage

is set in the previous period so as to equate expected labor demand to
                                                    19


 labor supply. This modification does not change our prior analysis

concerning the effects of expected oil price increases since full em—

ployment of labor results when the previous period's expectations about

oil prices are fulfilled. However, for unexpected oil price increases,

the    predetermined real wage for period 1 ensures full employment only
if oil prices are unchanged. When oil prices unexpectedly increase,
employment in date 1 falls. This employment effect leads to a greater

drop in domestic product, output, oil inputs, welfare and consumption. It is

then no longer true that unexpected oil price increases cause a smaller

drop in output, oil inputs and the trade balance than do expected increases.

        More precisely, let the production function be x =        ft(kt    9.t, zr),

where the labor       input is explicitly introduced and    9. is the fixed full—

employment    labor      supply. The DP function will be yt(1 qt, kt, 9.t) and

the    real wage in period t, w, will be set in period t —        1   so that

(4.1)        wt =    t
                    Y9.(l,   qt,   kt ,   9..
                                                t
where   Y is the partial of the DP function with respect to the labor input
and equal    to the demand price for labors 1_, Note that the oil price q
is    now the oil price expected in period t - 1 to rule in period t. Equation

(4.1) can be used to solve for the labor input as a function of the other

variables,   giving the       employment function Lt(1, qt, kt, wt).    Actual employment
 in   period t is now a function of the actual oil price in period t.

        For unexpected oil price increases, the present employment level will

fall by


(4.2)           = L1dq1 <       0,

where the partial            is negative if labor and oil are cooperative factors.2.2/'
                                        20


There is no reduction in employment in the future since future oil

price increases are anticipated when wage contracts are negotiated in

the present.

        The employment effect alters the analysis of unexpected oil price

increases. For instance, their effect on domestic product is now


(4.3)
                     11 +wd2.
               dY =-zdq  1-Si        <a.

The drop in domestic product is now larger due to the fall in employment.

It no longer follows that domestic product always falls less for unex-

pected oil price increases than for expected ones.

        Analogously, the adjustment of present output and oil inputs for

unexpected oil price increases will be


(4.4)         dx1 = x1dq1 +
                     q
                               x1d
                                Z
                                   <0      and


               dz1 = z1dq1   + zd2) < a,

which now take account of employment effects. It doesn't follow that pre-

sent output and oil inputs fail less for unexpected than for expected oil

price increases.

        Furthermore, the welfare effect is


(4•5)         EdU = -z 1 dq1   - 2.2 2
                                  z dq +
                                              l-l
                                             w d9.


The fall in welfare will now be larger for unexpected oil price increases

due to the fall in domestic product caused by reduced employment.

        It   also follows that when wages are predetermined and employment can
vary,   the trade deficit is no longer unambiguously smaller for unexpected

than for expected oil price increases. Unexpected oil prices still reduce
                                 21


present absorption more, but it is not clear whether they now reduce

domestic product less than expected oil price increases.
                                22




5.   Conclusions

     We have rigorously modeled the adjustment of a small oil—importing

country to expected and unexpected oil price increases. For expected

present and future oil price increases — expected in the sense of being

anticipated in the past - we have seen that the adjustment of investment

and consumption begins in the past, whereas with unexpected oil price

increases, all adjustments must take place in the present and future.

Regarding output and oil inputs, we have seen that there are less

substitution possibilities with unexpected oil price increases than with

expected, since firms must operate with a predetermined, larger—than—

desired capital stock when faced with unexpected oil price increases.

Consequently, output and oil inputs fall less with unexpected oil price

increases. However, with predetermined real wages, unexpected oil price

increases lead to a fall in employment which adds to the drop in output

and oil inputs. With regard to the present trade balance, we have seen

that under full employment it deteriorates less for unexpected oil

price increases since domestic product falls less and consumption and

investment may have to fall more. With predetermined wages, unexpected

oil price increases reduce employment and hence cause a greater

deterioration in the trade balance. If the employment effect is large

enough, unexpected oil price increases can now cause a larger fall in

the trade account than expected price increases. With respect to the

present current account, we have seen that both under full employment

and variable employment the current account balance may change more or

less with unexpected oil price increases than with expected increases.

But if the employment effect is sufficiently large, unexpected oil price
                                 23




 increases will cause the greater deterioration in the current account.

     Let us add some qualifications of these results. First, it is

clear than an oil—producing economy, or an economy producing investment

goods for the (world) oil industry, would react differently, even if it

imported some of its oil. The boom in the oil industry or the oil-

investment industry brought about by higher oil prices could dominate

the fall in output in sectors that use oil as an input only.

     Second, we have generally assumed that the present period's marginal

propensity to consume conditional upon unchanged past consumption is

larger than the unconditional one, which makes present consumption fall

more for unexpected oil price increases. If, as previously mentioned,

consumption adjusts with some inertia, the present conditional propensity

to consume would be smaller than the unconditional one. This ordering

would occur if, for instance, household consumption is complementary

with some household investment in the previous period, a situation which

could be modeled using a consumption technology with a household produc-

tion function.

     Third, with respect to predetermined real wages, we have assumed

that the lead time in wage determination is the same as the information

lead, so that full employment is maintained for expected oil price

increases. If the lead time in wage determination is longer, unemployment

would occur with expected oil price increases as well as with unexpected

ones. A rigorous analysis would require more periods on continuous time.

    Finally, we have modeled a small economy facing given world rates

of interest. A world equilibrium analysis with endogenous rates of

interest could easily be undertaken along the lines of Marion and
                                24



Svensson (1981) in order to examine the general-equilibrium effects of

expected vs. unexpected oil price increases. One issue that might be

of interest is whether the present rate of interest is depressed more or

less by unexpected than expected oil price increases and whether any

fall in the rate of interest is temporary or permanent.

       1.     Following R. Solomon (1980), we may take the size of the OPEC

surplus     on current account as a measure of the   contractionary effect on

the   rest   of the world of an increase in oil prices. The $110 billion

increase in the OPEC surplus from 1978-80 was about the same magnitude,

relative to the GNP of the industrial world, as the $60 billion increase

from 1973 to 1974. Alternatively, one can calculate the percentage

increase in the average dollar price of a country's crude oil imports

between 1973—75 and between 1978—80 and calculate the increase in a

country's petroleum imports as a fraction of GNP to see      that for a
number of countries,    the magnitude of increase was about the   same in

each period. For a rigorous theoretical analysis of the general

equilibrium effects on the rest of the world of      oil price increases,

longer necessarily perfect foresight ones. For another example of an

extension of the microeconomic interteinporal approach to a situation

with unfulfilled expectations, see Persson and Svensson (1982).

       5.    Let rt, t=0, 1, denote the final goods rate of interest

between period t and t+1. Then the present value factors 6 and 62
                                         F—2



are defined as cS°=l+r° and 62=l/(l+r1). Note that 6°          is   a "capitaliza-

tion" factor, whereas 62 is a "discount" factor.

       6.      We disregard any corner solutions. Equation (2.3) says that

the value of the present marginal product of capital, Y, plus the

present value of the future marginal product of capital, 62y=1, equals

the present value of past investhient goods, 50• Equation (2.4) says

that the present value of the future marginal product of capital equals

the present value of present investment goods.

       7.      We asstme there is no initial debt at the beginning of period

0.

       8.      Note that T0=(1+r0)T.

       9.      This terminology is used in Hebrew, according to Elhanan

Helpman. With many capital goods and oil, the definition of cooperation

in terms of the signs of the elements of the matrix 'q is not equivalent

to the usual definition of complements/substitutes in terms of the cross

derivatives of the factor demand functions. With only one capital good

and one kind of oil, it is equivalent to positive cross partials of

the production function, i.e. f > 0.

      10.      The capital—labor ratio will be higher for unexpected oil price
increases      though. One can think of this higher-than-optimal capital-

labor ratio as a measure of the underutilization of capital.

      11.      An oil price increase will reduce oil inputs (the own su.bsti—

tution      effect z1   is always   non—positive since the DP function is convex
in   prices). Since the marginal product of oil is positive, final goods

output will fall, i.e. x1 < 0.

       12 •    We   have the identity E (6°, 1, 62 u) E

(1,    62, u; E(6°, 1, 52, u)) + 6°E0(5°,         1, 6,   u). Then
                                                        F—3




 EU =    B
          U      + (E/c° ) E       U
                                        + E. .          But        = —(S°, the   negative of the
 demand price for past consumption.
         13.      As long as the first—order effects are non—zero, they dominate

the second—order effects for small oil price changes. For an analysis

of both first and second—order welfare effects, see Persson and Svensson

 (1982).

         14. We have dE1 =                          =
                                          E1du          (E1/E) (Edu),   where 4       = E1/E     and

Edu      is given by (3.9).

         15. Note that the unconditional marginal propensities to consume

fulfill                 +
                            4 + C52C = 1,           whereas the conditional ones obey

     +            =   1.     If the propensities to consume in periods 1                   and 2 are
in fixed proportion to each other (4/C = constant), and if consumption
in period 0 is normal (C > 0), it follows that 4 > 4. This would
be   the case if the           utility function is of the form
tJ(c°,    C1,     c2)   =   g(c°,      h(c1, c2)) where h(c1, c2) is homothetic and

all goods are normal.

         16. Note that T =
                                    1
                                          Y
                                              1 -
                                                    (.1.1.    .1-c —i.iL
                                                       +1 ) = (x       )—
                                                                          11      z   ,   the value
of net exports of final goods minus imports of oil.

         17. Note that the partial effect on the present trade balance of

past investment magnifies the change in the latter. We have
             =
                  (Y    +   1) =   1 +    r0 > 1        as long as r0 is positive.

         18. We assume             that   bonds have a one—period maturity.

         19. There is no- need to negotiate an indexing scheme since agents

have subjective certainty about future periods. Moreover, indexing

would stake        no difference since final goods prices are                    fixed    in this

analysis.

    20. In the simple case with one type of labor and one kind of

oil, cooperation is equivalent to having positive cross partials of

the production function, f > 0.

        21. We implicitly assume that leisure does not enter into the

utility function. If it does, and if labor supply is endogenous,

the expenditure function should be written E(6°, ,           5,   U;   £°   £1 £2)

The predetermined present wage rate will fulfill w1 =                   =

since           is the supply price of present labor. Differentiating the

budget constraint for unexpected oil price increases will give

        =   z1dq   — (52z2dq2 +
                                  (Y—E/2)d2,1.   But since             will equal

            the last term will be zero. Hence, there will be no first

order welfare effects of changes in the employment level, since the

value of the increased leisure, (/a)(—d), equals the loss in

domestic product, Yd2). consequently, there would be no additional

welfare effects on consumption from the change in employment. There will
                           —.   1 -.1
be substitution effects, (DE1/9 )d2. ,      though, and the effect on domestic

product remains.
