                                          ABSTRACT

Using patents as indicators of inventive activity, this article characterizes the concentration of
origins of invention from 1976 to 2010, and how these changed over time. The analysis finds
pervasive deconcentration in virtually every area related to ICT, but it can explain only a small
part of this trend. Deconcentration happens despite the role of lateral entry by existing firms. New
firm entry drives part of the deconcentration, but this alone cannot explain the change. A single
supply factor in the market for ideas, such as the breakup of AT&T, also cannot explain the trend.
Finally, eleven percent of patents change hands through mergers and acquisitions activity, but this
does not make up for the declines in concentration in the origins of invention.

Introduction
The market structure for the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) equipment

industry has undergone enormous changes in the last four decades. Thirty years ago, most

innovation took place in established firms, in particular large laboratories such as Bell Labs and

IBM Labs (Rosenbloom and Spencer, 1996). Decades ago, such labs began to lose their

prominence to widespread, decentralized, and small-scale innovators. The trend goes by many

names in many analyses. In this study we use the label “divided technical leadership,” or DTL

for short. This is the framework put forward in Bresnahan and Greenstein (1999), which argues

that high rates of firm entry and exit may occur without changing the concentration at the

platform level. DTL plays a key role in shaping a market environment that nurtures open

innovation (Chesbrough, 2003), supports open and proprietary platforms (Gawer, 2010,

Greenstein, 2010), and encourages “innovation from the edges” (Greenstein, 2015). It also plays

a key role in the externalization of R&D by large firms, who use acquisitions of smaller firms for

many of their innovative activities (Gans, Hsu, and Stern, 2002). DTL contributes to a market

structure in which a dispersed set of market participants produces a range of new innovative

prototypes for potential acquisition. Firms such as Cisco, IBM, and Apple participate in such

activities, each of which have made more than one hundred acquisitions over the last two

decades.

       While the presence of DTL has received notice, its causes have not been examined. In

part this is due to the slow pace of change in market structure. Large scale DTL did not arise

instantaneously; rather, it has gradually emerged in different parts of ICT markets, and only over

long time spans – several decades – would an observer expect stark differences to become

apparent, and amenable to statistical analysis. Against such challenges in observation, this study

offers the first statistical information and econometric analysis of the long run causes behind


                                           Page 2 of 40
DTL. Accordingly, the research goals are both descriptive and causal, and measurement

challenges determine the lengths we can pursue in both.

           We first establish some novel facts. Does statistical evidence of long-term change show a

deconcentration in the sources of inventive ideas, as held by conventional models of DTL? The

article characterizes the concentration in the origins of inventions in the ICT equipment industry

in a given year. Next we describe changes over time. Finding long term trends consistent with

the increasing importance of DTL, the study turns to a second question: what factors determine

the concentrated supply of, and concentrated demand for, inventive ideas, and how do these

factors drive change? This part of the study uses variance between different technology segments

within ICT equipment to identify determinants of changes in concentration. The statistical

exercise tests several hypotheses, measuring the contribution of economies of scope, product

market leadership, entry by domestic and foreign firms, and changes in demand for ideas from

1976 to 2010.

           To construct measures of the origins of innovation, the study examines the concentration

of granted patents in ICT equipment in the period from 1976 to 2010, which accounts for

roughly 14 percent of all US patents. The study utilizes a data set constructed from XML and

text files of patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) between

1976 and 2010. The data covers four more recent years than the NBER patent data files, the

standard data source for many studies on patents. 1 The novel length of time covered is essential

for realizing our research goals, as the economic forces should manifest in slow changes, if at all,

and at varying paces in different technical areas. In addition, this length of time accounts for a

unique event, the dot-com boom, which is coincident with the acceleration in patenting in the

late 1990s. Finally, the new data contains standardized patent assignee names that enable patent

data to be linked to other information about mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity. As a

result, mergers of both publicly traded and private firms can be examined.

          The study supports the prevailing view about DTL. We find a trend in deconcentration,

both in the ownership of new patent applications and also in the cumulative ownership of active

patents. The analysis measures considerable variation in the size and scope of the changes, with

some segments of ICT equipment undergoing dramatic changes. For example, while on average

the top twenty-five firms accounted for 72 percent of new patents in 1976 and 59 percent of the

patent stock in 1986, the top twenty-five firms accounted for only 55 percent of new patents and

50 percent of the patent stock by 2010. Furthermore, the trend emerges in starker terms when we

restrict the sample to high-quality patents, with a decline in top twenty-five firms’ ownership

from 86 to 62 percent in new patents and 65 to 51 percent in the patent stock over the same

period.

          Why does this deconcentration arise? On the supply side, one hypothesis stresses that

large firms may utilize economies of scope by entering other technologies, which may appear as

increased or decreased concentration, depending on the size of the entry. 2 We use such lateral

entry as a proxy for economies of scope and find evidence that ownership concentration

increases with lateral entry, i.e., that economies of scope are not a cause of deconcentration.

Next we examine evidence that de novo firm entry caused it, and we find mixed evidence. There

is little evidence that non-US firm entry caused the change, which is another common hypothesis

(reflecting a larger fraction of imports and exports in the US economy over this period). 3 Rather,

established changes in concentration may come from two distinct areas of the ownership


2
  For economies of scope in technology see e.g. Chen, Williams, and Agarwal (2012), Leiponen and Helfat (2010),
and Miller (2006).
3
  As with the rest of the literature, we are somewhat cautious in our interpretation of foreign firms. A patent
owned by Sony, for example, will appear as a US patent due to the location of its US-based subsidiary. As with the
prior literature (e.g., Hall, 2005), we focus on changes due to US patents with US assignees and non-US assignees,
and examine whether the surge in patenting with Asian and European assignees accounts for change.
                                                  Page 4 of 40
distribution: 1) declines in the leading, large firms and 2) an increase of innovation in the small,

“tail” firms within the US. These entry results are consistent with the growth of small firms as a

source of ideas, perhaps as part of redistribution from other domestic large firms.

           We further explore a popular hypothesis about large firms, that the decline in the

importance of the very largest firms merely reflects a decline in their importance in downstream

markets. 4 The preponderance of evidence suggests this is not the primary cause of change

(though we also find a few exceptions). More specifically, we find that long-term trends in

deconcentration cannot be fully accounted for by the divestiture of AT&T, or the loss in

commercial leadership at IBM, Motorola, or any other recognizable firm in the industry. Hence,

we can reject the most sweeping version of the hypothesis that points to one antitrust case, one

company’s strategic error, or the break-up of one large, leading innovator of yesteryear as the

cause for deconcentration.

           Finally, the study looks at the demand for inventive ideas by examining the merger

market. Rather than own all the inputs into creating ideas that lead to patents, many large firms

increasingly let others focus on that activity and make the purchase after the patent is granted. 5

Accordingly, we perform a (first-ever) census of such merger activity for ICT equipment,

involving extensive data-matching (described below). The study finds that M&A activity results

in the transfer of approximately 11 percent of the entire patent stock and 12 percent of the high-

quality patent stock in the ICT equipment industry. Though the intensity of patent transfer

through M&A is associated with a slight decrease in concentration for high-quality patents, the

size of this transfer is not enough to revert the composition of ownership to its pre-

deconcentration levels in any segment. Moreover, in the regression analysis, merger activity and

intensity, which proxies for demand for externalized invention, cannot explain variance in

concentration between segments. We conclude that the trend towards deconcentration has not

been due to, or reversed by, firm strategies to externalize R&D activity.


Relation to prior research
Our study relates to the research streams in two main channels. First, it relates to the literature on

DTL, as noted, and, more broadly, to an analysis of the causes of market leadership and

incentives in innovative activities. Following this literature, 6 we generally distinguish between

product market leadership and technological leadership and focus on the latter. We follow the

literature that hypothesizes that the dispersion of capabilities over frontier technology shapes

firm behavior. Second, the impact of M&A activity on the technological leadership relates to the

literature on R&D incentives in the shadow of M&A and to the literature on start-up

commercialization. We differ from prior literature with our focus on understanding the causes

behind changes in technical leadership in more recent decades. Finally, this is the first study to

put these together. That is, we investigate the extent of, and causes behind, deconcentration in

innovation in the ICT equipment industry, and the potentially countervailing M&A mechanism.

           We follow prior research that considers the resource-based and industrial organization

streams together by considering industry and firm effects in a unified framework. 7 We differ

from Skilton and Bernardes (2015), however, in that we distinguish between technology markets

and product markets, and stress competition and entry into the former instead of the latter.

           We further build on prior research into patenting, which touches on related themes, but

has not examined the sources of deconcentration. Kortum and Lerner (1999) associated the

increase in US patenting activity to an increase in US innovation and to changes in the

management of R&D, which may have included actions such as reallocating efforts to more

applied problems with higher patent yields. Kim and Marschke (2004) concluded that the

6
    Greenstein, 2010 and 2015 review the literature on computing and commercial Internet, in particular.
7
    See e.g. Mauri and Michaels (1998), Hashai (2015), and Misangyi et al. (2006)
                                                    Page 6 of 40
increased patenting activity was due to increases in R&D in some sectors and increases in the

rate of patenting in the computing, electronics, and auto sectors. Hall (2005) found that growth

occurred in complex product industries such as telecommunications and concluded that this

increase also spilled over to those firms’ patenting behavior in other industries.

        In our study, in contrast, we focus on the distribution of the increase in patenting between

firms within each technology class; in other words, we differ in our focus on technical leadership

in the technology class level, and its concentration. Indeed, our up-to-date data on patents allow

us to answer an open questions posed by Hall (2005), namely, “What happened during the

1990s? Did the positive premium for entry with patents continue during the rapid growth of the

computing and electronics sector in the late 1990s? Has the growth in patenting continued to be

due almost entirely to U.S. firms in computing and electronics?”

        The deconcentration results also relate to the research stream on how incentives change

with competition. We provide evidence of the increased competitive conditions in the ideas

market. This increased competition may be indicative of higher incentives to innovate. However,

there are also limits. The results cannot distinguish between a model of monotonic increase in

innovation due to more competition, or merely a movement on the “upward” part of the

“inverted U” relationship hypothesized by Aghion et al. (2005). Our results are consistent with

both.

        The discussion of the M&A activity of the established firms in our study relate to the

start-up commercialization framework of Arora, Fosfuri, and Gambardella (2004); Gans, Hsu,

and Stern (2002). This research posits that a startup innovator with a successfully developed,

commercial technology faces a choice between competing with incumbent firms in the market

and cooperating through selling or licensing the technology to the incumbent firm. Our study




                                            Page 7 of 40
also proceeds from the same premise. In contrast, we provide a measure of all acquisitions of

patents, measure its importance for all inventive activity, and find it plays only a small role.

           Most of the prior literature on the interaction of M&A activity with innovation comes

from analyses of public firms, as data on private firms is scarce. Here, again, we contribute by

analyzing private firms. The gap in the literature is substantial. Private firms constitute an

important part of the US economy: Asker, Farre-Mensa, and Ljungqvist (2012) estimates that

private US firms account for 67.1 percent of private sector employment, 57.6 percent of sales,

and 20.6 percent of aggregate pre-tax profits. As a result, analyses of M&A activity that filter out

the deals of private firms yield biased results. 8 We expect this bias to be exacerbated in the study

of innovation through acquisition of startup firms, as startup firms are likely to be

underrepresented in deals of only public firms. Linking the USPTO patent data to the M&A data

enables us to work around this issue and to provide new insights on the behavior of this

nontrivial, yet underexplored, part of the US economy.

           Finally, we draw on prior work by Ozcan and Greenstein (2013), which examines the

flow of new patents in communications equipment markets. Both papers are motivated by a

similar set of concerns, stressing the importance of long term deconcentration of invention. The

scope of the prior work was quite narrow, however, offering a prototype of investigative

approach and stressing the implications for legal researchers of patents. This paper, in contrast,

examines a wider set of markets, develops new information on (accumulated) stocks and (yearly)

flows of new inventions, expands the number and range of economic hypotheses examined (with

a larger set of exogenous variables), identifies and considers a range of robustness tests, and,

accordingly, comes to a much richer set of conclusions about the economic causes and non-

causes of changes in DTL in the high technology economy.

ICT Equipment Industry Concentration
How should we think about deconcentration of inventive activity in the ICT equipment industry

from the late 1970s to the present? ICT equipment is responsible for electronics, computing, and

the infrastructure of radio, television, voice, and broadband communication services. It would

take several books to describe the changes in market structure during this time, and this section

cannot hope to review all the details. The purpose here is only to refresh the reader’s memories

about what the literature takes for granted about major changes in the concentration of origins of

inventive ideas in a wide set of related industries. This will provide just enough of a brief

overview to guide the development of a framework for the statistical exercise.

Historical Overview
Prior to the 1980s, the ICT equipment industry consisted of various segments, depending on

whether it was oriented towards computing, as it was then understood, or communications,

namely, voice or data. Both of these segments were highly concentrated in final goods markets.

At the end of the 1970s, IBM dominated the computing segment with its mainframe systems and

the components built around those systems. It also dominated the personal computer system

market for a short time, growing a small systems division that in 1984 was the third largest

computer company on the planet (behind Digital Equipment Corporation and IBM itself).

       Starting in the mid-1980s and accelerating thereafter, IBM lost market shares in personal

computers and in many of the peripheral markets. After the introduction of the IBM PC in 1981,

a wide range of firms entered into printers, software, component production, local area networks,

and more. In the 1990s, Microsoft and Intel began to assert control over an increasing fraction of

valuable components within the PC market; nonetheless, a large number of firms played a role in

many of its segments.

       Before the 1980s, AT&T was the dominant provider of networking equipment in the

voice segment, largely due to its regulated monopoly position in telecommunication services:

                                           Page 9 of 40
approximately 90 percent of AT&T’s equipment purchases were supplied from its equipment

subsidiary, Western Electric. The voice segment was based on circuit-switching technology and

provided the infrastructure mainly for local and long-distance telephone companies.

Furthermore, AT&T fought regulations that ended the requirement that any equipment attached

to its network be supplied by AT&T, even on the end-user site. The purchase behavior and

network attachment requirement of AT&T restricted entry into the telecommunications

equipment markets, thus carrying AT&T’s dominant position in telecom services into the

telecom equipment sector.

           AT&T eventually lost most of those fights, which yielded change, but slowly. In 1968,

AT&T lost an antitrust suit against Carterfone Company and was forced to permit private

interconnection equipment on the AT&T network. In 1975, the Federal Communications

Commission (FCC) extended the Carterfone decision to all private subscriber equipment that is

registered to and certified by the FCC. These decisions removed barriers to entry into the

telecommunications equipment industry; however, as long as AT&T remained the dominant

purchaser of equipment, entry was limited. The market structure changed further with the 1974

US Department of Justice antitrust suit against AT&T. The case was settled in 1982, with AT&T

dividing itself into one long distance telephone provider, and seven independent, regional

holding companies. That eventually altered equipment purchasing decisions. As a result the

telephone markets underwent considerable changes in the early to mid-1990s. 9

           The data segment was based on packet-switching technology and supplied the

communication equipment required in the computing industry, including modems and local area

networks. Until the emergence of the Ethernet standard, this segment was characterized by

proprietary protocols. Only with widespread use of the Ethernet standard in the late 1980s and


9
    See, e.g., Crandall and Waverman (1995) for a detailed discussion.
                                                    Page 10 of 40
the Internet IP stack in the early 1990s did non-proprietary standards begin to shape industry

structure.

           The networking and Internet revolution of the 1990s blurred the distinction between

different segments of ICT equipment (Lee 2007). This process sometimes receives the label

“convergence,” which means that previously independent product market segments increasingly

become substitutes or complements in demand. On the computing side, systems of PCs and

workstations were initially hooked together with a local area network (LAN). Over time, client-

server systems within large enterprises and across ownership boundaries were established.

Novell, 3Com, Oracle, and Cisco were among the firms with dominant positions in this era.10

With widespread Internet use, the scope of ambitions became quite large, touching on virtually

every economic activity in which transmission of information played an important role. This

period was marked by economic changes to the applications of computing and communications,

as well as any related upstream or downstream activity. It was marked by optimism and labeled

“the dot-com bubble,” in recognition of the many startups that ended with the top-level domain

name “com.” 11

           In contrast, by the beginning of the millennium, many layers of the industry underwent

upheaval. Some of this was associated with large, painful adjustments due to a decline in demand

that was linked to the implementation of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, resulting growth,

and the Telecom Meltdown. Some of it was due to the bursting of the dot-com bubble.

Eventually the equipment market stabilized, leaving Cisco in the dominant position in enterprise

computing to serve data communications. Yet other firms who grew spectacularly during the

1990s, such as JDS Uniphase, Corning, Lucent, Nortel, and 3Com, did not fare as well.

       This brief review suggests several of the core questions that motivate our statistical work.

First, is the evidence consistent with the common understanding of this industry history, that

there has been a deconcentration in the ownership of inventive ideas? Second, can this

deconcentration be explained by something straightforward, such as the divestiture of AT&T or

the loss of commercial leadership at IBM, Motorola, or any other large industry firm? Third,

what role do other factors play, such as firm entry, particularly non-US-firm entry, which has

accelerated over this period? Fourth, has the externalization of R&D by established firms merely

changed the structure of the origins of invention, but not its concentration as it relates to final

output markets?

Theoretical Framework
This section provides a brief overview of our framework. It fixes a few key ideas and provides a

roadmap for later developments.

       Following prior literature (Arora and Gambardella, 2001, Gans, Hsu and Stern, 2002), we

divide the industry into an upstream sector that supplies invention and a downstream sector that

supplies products. The downstream sector employs inventions from the upstream sector in

production.

       The literature on the rise of DTL focuses on the increasing infrequency of situations

where one firm has a monopoly over an idea. In practice, these ideas come from very specific

classes of technologies and map into very specific product markets. The literature stresses that

such monopolies are less likely to arise where many technical substitutes can emerge. Substitutes

are more likely to emerge in settings where many potential inventors generate similar ideas and

where entry into production of ideas is less costly.

        We considered a wide range of alternative ways of measuring settings where many

potential inventors generate similar ideas. For reasons explained below, we settled on a top-

twenty-five concentration ratio over the ownership of inventive ideas, which we label as C25, in
                                           Page 12 of 40
technological class, indexed as i. Illustrating the concept, a technological class i is said to be

more concentrated if the largest twenty-five firms own 80 percent of the inventive ideas, instead

of, say, 50 percent of the ideas in that technology class.

         The literature discussed many related measures of concentration for a sector, which are

book-ended by two concepts, one related to the flow of new ideas, another related to the stock of

ideas that firms own and use. The existing literature on DTL suggests the flow of ideas is

relevant for fostering entry into product markets, for example, while the stock of ideas is relevant

for new combinations of technologies fostering entry or industrial change. Hence, we consider

both.

         Flow and stock of ideas in technology class i are related to one another. The stock in

sector i in time t is:

                                 𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖,𝑡 = 𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑖,𝑡 + (1 − 𝛿) ∗ 𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖,𝑡−1 ,

where 𝛿 is a discount rate for old inventive ideas, and flow is the total available new ideas in

sector i in a given year. Some of the writing on DTL suggests that many patents are not relevant

for entry, and only high-quality patents facilitate entry. The above definition can be modified to

focus on the stock and flow of only high quality ideas. 12

         The first key question concerns changes in the concentration of ownership over time. Is

the evidence consistent with decreasing concentration over time? We focused on the question for

each i, namely,

                           (𝐶25𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝑜𝑟 𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘 )𝑖,𝑡 − �𝐶25𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝑜𝑟 𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘 �               < 0.
                                                                              𝑖,𝑡−1


         Generally, we find below that a wide range of technology classes did become more

deconcentrated. This motivates the second question, concerning the causes of changes in


12
   In this study we provide results for patents that receive the bulk of citations, which are presumed to be of higher
quality. We define high quality as the top quartile within each technology class-year group cells, in terms of
citations received. For details, see Appendix A3.

concentration over time. In general, our approach identifies the causes of the variance in changes

of concentration between different technology classes. That is, we posit:

            (𝐶25𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝑜𝑟 𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘 )𝑖,𝑡 − �𝐶25𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝑜𝑟 𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘 �              = 𝑓(𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑦 𝑖𝑛 𝑖, 𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑖𝑛 𝑖).
                                                              𝑖,𝑡−1


           The literature on DTL frames the open question: what factors caused changes in

concentration? As our review of the history suggests, important supply-side factors include the

decline of dominant firms, increasing economies of scope across technology sectors, the entry of

foreign firms, and the entry of small firms. Important demand-side factors include the increasing

use of mergers by leading firms to obtain invention from external sources, increasing acceptance

of technical products from unbranded firms by users, and the increasing use of open standards

that permit customers to buy interoperable products from more than one supplier. We will

construct measures for all three supply factors, while the latter two demand factors will be

absorbed into time trends, so we will be able to measure only the demand for mergers.

Data
Patents are one of the most utilized sources of information in the innovation literature. The use of

patent data as a proxy for inventive activity dates back to Schmookler (1951) and Griliches

(1990). Since then, an extensive literature on using patents as indicators of innovative activity

has developed. 13 Here we follow this literature and focus on patents granted in the ICT

equipment industry as a proxy for the origins of innovative activity. Since pursuing questions

related to DTL led us to modify the practices underlying existing patent datasets widely in use,

we first devote space to explaining our overlap with and departures from the existing literature.

We then establish changes in the level of ownership composition of new and cumulative

innovative activity, and then link these changes to underlying supply- and demand-side factors.

     See, e.g., Griliches (1990) and Nagaoka, Motohashi, and Goto (2010).

Supply-side factors include new entry, lateral entry (a firm’s economies of scope), and growth;

the demand-side factor we utilize is the M&A activity of established firms.

       The standard source for patent data in the innovation literature has been the NBER patent

data files. However, we use raw USPTO files to construct updated patent data files and to enable

linkage between the patent data and the M&A data. Appendices A and B describe the

construction of patent data from 1976 to 2010 and the data linking procedure, respectively. We

identify the ICT equipment industry in the patent data by extracting forty-four patent technology

classes from the USPTO patent data. We then drop fourteen classes due to sparse patenting

activity. The final dataset has 550,884 patents with primary technology classes in the thirty ICT

equipment classes, assigned to 38,359 unique assignees. The patent literature firmly establishes

that patent values are highly skewed, with studies noting that the most valuable 10 percent of

patents account for as much as 80 percent of the total value of patents. Below we provide results

for patents that receive the bulk of citations, which are presumed to be of higher quality. We also

examined the entire sample of patents and the top decile of patents, without any large change in

inference. Appendix C reports these results. We use M&A activity as a measure of the demand

for patented technology from other firms. We identify acquisitions in the ICT equipment industry

using the Securities Data Company’s M&A data module, which covers all US corporate

transactions, public and private, since 1979. From this data we identify M&A deals in which

either the target, the acquirer, or both firms have at least one patent in the ICT equipment

industry between 1979 and 2010. We then eliminate deals that are not of interest. The final

sample has 19,878 M&A deals from 1976 to 2010. Further details on the M&A data, and the

filters we apply are discussed in Appendix A4.

       We are concerned that M&A is not the only channel for transferring ownership of patents

between firms. Licensing and outright sale of patents are two other channels, both of which


                                           Page 15 of 40
provide additional information about the market demand for ideas. 14 However, comparison with

Serrano (2010) leads us to believe that a merger is a very good proxy for demand. Serrano

records that 13.5 percent of all granted patents are traded over their life-cycle; we obtain a

similar scale of transfer (11%) through M&A activity, which suggests that over 80 percent

(11/13.5 > .8) of the transfers in ownership of patents measured by Serrano occur due to M&A.

Concentration and Other Measures
In this section we describe the market structure, technology supply, and technology demand

proxies we use in our empirical framework. 15

        Our main variable is the patent ownership concentration in a technology class. We

capture the ownership concentration of granted patents in each technology class-year group as

the share of top firms in the ICT equipment industry. More specifically we create variables

𝐶1𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 , 𝐶2𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 , …, 𝐶25𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 , where 𝐶𝑋𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 is the share of patents applied for by the top X firms

within the technology class-year group. In each year group we reselect the top firms; in other

words, even though the number of firms used to calculate CX is kept constant at X, the set of

firms may be different from period to period. We stop at 𝐶25𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 because in many of the

technology class-year groups, the top twenty-five firms reach 100 percent ownership in the early

years of our sample. On average the top twenty-five firms in a technology class-year group own

68 percent of high quality patents. However, as we discuss in the next section, there is

considerable variation in this concentration over time. 16

        There are various theories on why the changes in concentration arose. We divide these

theories into two distinct groups: those concerning the demand and the supply of technology. In

acquisition of invention, patent applications reflect only the invention created by the patent

14
   See Arora and Gambardella (2010) and Serrano (2010).
15
   Table B1 in the Appendix provides a summary of these variables.
16
   In this context, more general measures of concentration, including Gini coefficients and HHIs for each patent
class-year group, could be constructed. In Appendix C we discuss our choice of C25 further, repeat our analyses
using these alternative measures of concentration and discuss implications.
                                                  Page 16 of 40
applicant and do not take into account alternative mechanisms of obtaining patents, including

acquisition of patents or acquisition of other patent assignees. We consider the acquisition of

patents through acquisition of other patent assignees a source of demand for innovation and

construct a measure of Merger Intensity to account for this phenomenon. The merger intensity in

a technology class in a year is the ratio of total patent stock transferred through assignee

acquisitions to the total stock of patents in that year. In our theoretical setting, a higher Merger

Intensity implies a lower transaction cost of absorbing ideas from small firms. On average, each

year around 1.1 percent of existing high-quality patent stock is transferred through M&A activity

(Table 5), with considerable variation across different technology sectors. Though this may seem

small on the surface, it is not in practice. We will show that around 12 percent of high quality

patents change hands through the merger and acquisition of patent assignees.

           The location of the inventive activity constitutes a supply side factor in deconcentration.

Metropolitan areas may provide an ecosystem that nurtures small firms, providing smaller

entities with access to a highly-skilled work force and an ecosystem of complementary services

within which to thrive. 17 Such an ecosystem may result in metropolitan areas substituting for

large, established firms, hence enabling outsourcing of invention. Alternatively, Top 10 MSA

Share, the ratio of patents originating from the top ten Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs)

may be indicative of high entry costs or fewer sources for diffusing the underlying know-how,

leading to concentration of economic activity in a smaller set of urban areas. The latter would

result in an increase in the concentration of ownership. We consider this an empirical question.

           Firm entry into innovative activities provides one theory on deconcentration (Hall, 2005,

and Kortum and Lerner, 1999, among others). In an effort to capture the impact of firm entry, we

have three classes of entry variables. In the first class, patent-weighted entry level, we construct


17
     See Chang and Wu (2014) for a discussion of the role of agglomeration on entrant costs.
                                                    Page 17 of 40
two measures of entry based on the previous patenting activity of the firm: new entry and lateral

entry. Firm i is considered a new entrant to technology class j in period t, if the firm does not

have any patents in any of the ICT equipment classes prior to period t and has at least one patent

in technology class j in period t. When such an entry occurs, we consider all patents of firm i in

period t in technology class j to be patents by a new entrant and calculate the new entry share by

dividing the total number of new entry patents by the total number of patents in technology class

j in period t. The new entry variable then captures the level of transaction costs of entry into the

market for ideas. When we restrict the variable to account for only foreign entry, we then capture

the transaction costs of entry by non-US firms. Firms that have no prior ICT equipment

innovation activity produce, on average, 19 percent of patents in a technology class. 18

         In addition to firms entering into the ICT equipment industry from outside, firms may

also be active in one ICT equipment class and later move to a new ICT equipment class. We

consider such firms lateral entrants. More specifically, we consider firm i a lateral entrant to

technology class j in period t if the firm did not have any patents in technology class j prior to

period t, had at least one patent in another ICT equipment technology class prior to period t, and

has at least one patent in class j in period t. We then calculate the lateral entry share as the ratio

of patents by lateral entrants in period t in class j to the total patent count in period t in class j.

We theorize that a higher lateral entry level implies higher economies of scope across different

technology classes. On average 15 percent of high quality patents come from lateral entrants. 19




18
   Note that in this setting the sample is restricted to high-quality patents, hence the entry variables capture entry
into the high-quality patent pool rather than entry into the entire patent pool. In other words, a firm with many
low-quality patents and no high-quality patent in prior periods would be considered an entrant in the first period it
produces a high-quality patent.
19
   Taking into account that the entry of a firm may not fully materialize within one year, we also construct entry
variables with a four-year time window, in which we consider any entry over the previous period a new entry of
the current period. The extended time window increases the new entry share from 19% to 30%, whereas lateral
entry share remains relatively constant, increasing from 15% to 16%.
                                                   Page 18 of 40
       The two entry variables, new entry share and lateral entry share, proxy for patent-count

weighted entry into a technology. We should note that when combined, these two variables

capture the inverse of the serial dependence of patenting by firms already in a technology class.

In other words, considering the 19 percent new entry and 15 percent lateral entry averages, we

deduce that on average 66 percent (100-19-15) of patents come from firms that already had

patents in a technology class in prior periods. As a result, when we include both entry variables

in the model, we also account for serial dependence.

       The second class of entry variables is the growth in the number of firms active in a

technology class. Using simple firm counts, we calculate the growth in the number of firms over

time. We see that on average the number of firms has increased by 15 percent every two years,

with firms located outside the United States having a relatively higher growth rate of 22 percent.

As an overwhelming majority of the firms in the sample are US-based, the total growth in the

number of firms is very close to the growth in US-firms, which is around 14 percent.

       The growth in the number of patents constitutes our third class of independent variables.

We see that on average the patent count has grown by 20 percent every two years (19% in

domestic and 30% in foreign firms). When we take into account the 15 percent average increase

in the number of firms over two-year periods, which is considerably less than the 20 percent

growth in patent count, we deduce that patent growth is coming from both entrants and

incumbents.

       The final class of control variables in our model consists of proxies for an increase or

decrease in product market leadership: dummies for the presence of a big firm. Conventional

wisdom that the breakdown of AT&T caused the deconcentration in patent ownership calls for

these controls. In an attempt to discern whether the existence of big firms, namely AT&T,

Motorola, and IBM, have an impact on the concentration, we include lagged indicators for their


                                          Page 19 of 40
existence among the top five patent applicants. We see that the presence of AT&T is somewhat

dwarfed by the strong presence of IBM: IBM is among the top five patent applicants in 49

percent of technology class-year group cells, whereas AT&T and Motorola are in the top five

patent applicants in only 42 and 29 percent of the cells, respectively. 20

Deconcentration of Patent Ownership
Composition of ownership in new patents: historical trends
We begin by describing long-term trends, which characterize our endogenous variable. We

construct a measure of concentration and then analyze the new patent creation across the thirty

ICT equipment technology classes. To capture the dynamics of new patent creation, we calculate

the patent flow variable—the number of new patents a firm has applied for in a given year and

was granted at a later date. 21

        To ensure that we have enough observation of each patent class during each period in our

analyses of patent flow, we use two-year intervals as the measure of time, instead of individual

years. Therefore, the observation level throughout the patent flow analyses is a technology class-

year group.

        We use 𝐶25𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 , the share of top twenty-five firms in new patents, as our measure of

concentration. We discuss this choice of the concentration measure further in Concentration and

Other Measures Section.

        Figure 1 illustrates the 𝐶𝑋𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 values for technology class 385 (Optical Waveguides).

The top line in Figure 1 represents the share of top twenty-five firms in the class (𝐶25𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 ), and

the bottom line represents the share of the top firm only (𝐶1𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 ). The share of the top twenty-

20
   These cells correspond to two-year periods as opposed to one year, as discussed in the Deconcentration of
patent ownership section.
21
   The patent grants may come many years after a patent is applied for, and this delay is coined as the patent
application-grant delay. The convention in the literature on patents is to use the patent application year as the
year of the innovation/invention because the application year is closed to the actual creation of the idea; whereas
the delay, hence the grant year, is a function of other factors including the workload and staffing issues at the
USPTO. In this study, we follow this convention, and use the patents applied for and granted between 1976 and
2010.
                                                  Page 20 of 40
five firms has seen a decline from around 70 percent from 1976 to 1977 to around 41 percent

from 2006 to 2007. In fact, we observe a similar trend in twenty-seven of the thirty classes in our

sample of high quality patents. The values of 𝐶25𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 fluctuates in only four classes. All these

trends suggest a deconcentration of ownership in new patents in our sample period.

       We now turn to Table 1 to observe this deconcentration trend across all technology

classes. Table 1 shows the distribution of 𝐶25𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 values across all technology classes for all

high quality patents in the ICT equipment sample. The mean value of the top twenty-five firms’

new patent share across technology classes follows a gradual decline over the years from 86

percent in the 1976 to 1977 period to 62 percent from 2006 to 2007.

       We now investigate potential causes of this deconcentration across technology classes.

Industry insiders attribute this deconcentration to the breakdown of AT&T in 1982 during the

deregulation of the telecommunications industry. To see if this claim holds in a first pass through

the data, we calculate a simple statistic, the number of firms that contribute 90 percent or more of

the changes in 𝐶25𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 , the share of top twenty-five firms, over our sample period. The results

are presented in Table 2, which reports the changes for high quality ICT equipment patents. We

see that of the twenty-seven classes with deconcentration, in only three classes are three or fewer

firms responsible for 90 percent or more of the reduction in 𝐶25𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 . In the remaining twenty-

four classes there is an industry-wide deconcentration trend, which suggests that the breakdown

of AT&T, or another leading firm, cannot be the sole reason for the established deconcentration.

The qualitative observations remain the same when we remove the restriction on the high quality

patents and consider the entire patent sample.

       In Appendix B, we analyze these questions in a fixed effects model to provide a coherent

framework. The main results show that for the high quality firms growth in the number of firms

is an important driver of deconcentration, suggesting that a smaller transaction cost for entry

                                           Page 21 of 40
results in lower ownership concentration. Lateral entry and Top 10 MSA Share work in the

opposite direction of entry by increasing the concentration of patent ownership. When we turn

our attention to the entire sample of patents, we obtain similar results for the growth in the

number of firms; the impact of lateral entry and top ten MSA share increases, but the patent

growth loses both economic and statistical significance.

       These findings also raise an interesting open question. Looking at how new entry and

lateral entry vary over time (averaged across technology classes), we observe a declining trend in

both. The new entry share starts around 23 percent in 1978 to 1979 and gradually drops to 10

percent in 2006 to 2007. The lateral entry share follows a similar declining trend, with 32 percent

in 1978 to 1979, and 8 percent in 2006 to 2007. It is possible that the factors of lateral entry and

new entry only reflected a one-time change that has largely played itself out. If both have

declined permanently, then neither factor can play as large a role in the future.

Patent ownership variables: patent flow and patent stock
In earlier sections we presented historical trends of ownership composition of innovation in the

ICT equipment industry, using the flow of granted patents of a firm as a measure of its

innovative activity in a given year. However, a firm accumulates ownership of many inventions

by accumulating ownership of patents over the active lifetime of patents. We now turn our

attention to this historical stock of patents and calculate a proxy for all the patents a firm has

created that are still active—the discounted sum of patent flow over the firm’s history, less the

expired (old) patents, called the patent stock. For the purposes of calculating the patent stock, we

consider a patent active for twenty years, starting with the patent filing year, or for seventeen

years, starting from the patent grant year, whichever comes later. Based on the set of active

patents in a given year, we then calculate the patent stock by discounting the patents from prior

years using the declining balance formula. More specifically, we calculate the cumulative patent

stock of firm i in period t by the following formula:
                                           Page 22 of 40
                               𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖,𝑡 = 𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑖,𝑡 + (1 − 𝛿) ∗ 𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑖,𝑡−1 ,

where we use the depreciation rate, δ, of 15 percent. 22 This depreciation accounts for two known

factors: the obsolescence of patents over time as the technology becomes older and irrelevant,

and the shorter remaining active time of older patents. Both of these imply a lower value for the

patents.

        The stock variable depends on the history of patenting activity; therefore, we allow for

the variable to accumulate for the first ten years of our sample period and start our analyses of

the patent stock in 1986. In other words, our sample for the patent stock section reduces to those

in the 1986 to 2007 period.

        A second difference between the patent flow and patent stocks is the leadership

dynamics: an entrant may obtain a leadership position in patent flow relatively quickly by

producing more than its competitors in a given period, as there is no dependence on past activity.

However, assuming a leadership position in patent stocks may take longer due to the

accumulated patent stock of incumbents over prior decades.

Composition of ownership in cumulative patent stock
In this section we turn our focus from new patent applications to the entire stock of patents in the

ICT equipment industry, i.e., patents that have been granted since 1976 absent expired patents.

Thus we repeat the analyses of patent flow on the cumulative patent stock. This switch also

enables us to include the merger intensity measures in our analyses, as merger intensity is a

measure of stock. The switch to the patent stock is interesting mainly because, in new patent

applications, entrants may surpass industry incumbents in a relatively short period, but this may

not be the case for the cumulative patent stock. Leading industry incumbents, even if they lose

their edge in new patents, will enjoy the benefits of their prior patents for a while. Microsoft

22
   The returns to patents are estimated to decline by 10% to 20% per year (Schankerman and Pakes, 1986). In
calculating the patent stock, use of the declining balance formula with 15% depreciation rate is prevalent in the
literature (e.g., Griliches, 1989; Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg, 2005; and Hall and MacGarvie, 2010).
                                                 Page 23 of 40
illustrates this lag well. It appears as one of the top five patent applicants in a technology class

for the first time in 1992. However, it appears as one of the top five holders of cumulative patent

stock in a technology class only three years later, in 1995.

       The measure of concentration in this section is the ownership share of top twenty-five

companies in the entire patent stock, 𝐶25𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘 . As opposed to using two-year periods as the unit

of time, in the stock analyses we use each year as a separate period because stock variables do

not exhibit the scarcity issue of the flow variables. As was the case with flow, we observe that

the share of top twenty-five firms in patent stock decreases from 51 percent in 1986 to 39 percent

in 2007 for technology class 385, Optical Waveguides.

       The deconcentration trend in patent stock prevails across technology classes in ICT

equipment. Table 3 reports the annual averages of 𝐶25𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘 values across the technology classes

in our sample. The average share of top twenty-five firms in the stock follows a trend downward,

from 65 percent in 1986 to 51 percent in 2005, and plateaus thereafter. This deconcentration

trend also holds for the entire sample of patents, with a reduction from 59 percent in 1986 to 50

percent in 2007 (see Table G.4). As in the patent flow case, we see no clear relationship between

the presence of large leading firms and this deconcentration trend. Table 4 reports the number of

firms responsible for 90 percent or more of the reduction between 1986 and 2007; in only six

technology classes do three or fewer firms account for this change. In the remaining classes the

reduction comes from a group of companies, providing evidence that the divestiture of AT&T, or

the activities of Motorola or IBM, cannot account singlehandedly for this trend. In unreported

results, we observe a similar trend in the entire sample of patents.

Role of acquisitions
We have shown that the top twenty-five firms in the ICT equipment industry hold a smaller share

of the patent flow and stock than they did three decades ago. However, these analyses consider

only the in-house production of patents and do not take into account the patents acquired through
                                            Page 24 of 40
alternative mechanisms, including acquisition of innovative firms. We see tremendous number of

acquisitions taking place in the ICT equipment industry, and the impact of the transfer of patents

through acquisitions on concentration depends on the status of the target and the acquirer. In

cases in which the buyer is simply supplementing its existing portfolio of patents by acquiring a

target active in the same technology class, then ownership becomes more concentrated.

However, if the acquirer is simply entering a new technology class by acquiring a target active in

that technology class, then the ownership concentration does not change in that technology class.

       We resort to the M&A data to proxy for the demand for invention and to see the

magnitude of patent transfers through M&A in the ICT equipment industry. In 1,881 of the

M&A deals (9%) in our sample, both the acquirer and the target firm have at least one ICT

equipment patent and, in 1,127 deals (6%), only the target has ICT equipment patents. Please

note that transfers of patents take place in approximately one out of seven (3,008 out of 19,878)

M&A deals involving ICT equipment patent holders (See Appendix A4, and Table A3).

       The sheer ratio of M&A deals with patent transfers may not translate into a large number

of patents if the target firms possess only a few patents. To assess the share of patents transferred

through M&A, we report the patent stock for the ICT equipment industry and for the firms that

were targeted in an M&A deal in Table 7. We calculate the patent stock using the declining

balance formula as described above. The total stock of acquirers includes patents by the

acquirers independent of the year they make acquisitions. As an example, the patents of a firm

that makes an acquisition in 1997 are accounted for in the patent stock before, during, and after

1997. For the purposes of Table 7 we similarly calculate the patent stock of target firms. Note

that, unlike earlier sections, which considered the patents of only the top twenty-five firms, Table

7 reports patents acquired by all firms.




                                           Page 25 of 40
       In Table 7 we observe that the stock of patents that changed hands through M&A

transactions increase over time in nominal terms, though with some fluctuations in the 1980s.

Yet the share of patents transferred with respect to the entire stock of ICT equipment patents

gradually decreases from approximately 20 percent in the early 1980s to 12 percent in 2007. This

observation holds for both the entire sample and high quality patents, with a share of the

transfers 2 percent higher across the board for high quality patents.

       The ratio of transfers increases dramatically when we change the denominator from the

entire ICT equipment patents to patents of firms that conduct an acquisition. In the early years of

our sample, the size of transferred patents corresponds to more than 30 percent of the acquirer

patent stock, which decreases to 19 percent in 2007. We see a similar trend with a slightly lower

transfer ratio in the entire patent sample.

       The transfer of 12 percent of an industry’s patents through M&A activity is a significant

source of ownership change. However, we can compare the 14 percent approximate decrease in

the ownership share of the top twenty-five firms in cumulative patent stock to the 12 percent of

patents being transferred through acquisitions. Given that not all of the transferred patents go to

the top twenty-five firms, the magnitude of transferred patents is not great enough to revert the

deconcentration trend we established in our analyses. The following section puts the various,

competing explanations of deconcentration in patent stock ownership into a single framework.

Composition of ownership in patent stock: the model
Having established historical trends of patent stock ownership, we now turn our attention to

combining demand-side and supply-side explanations in a fixed effects model. Table 5 presents

the summary statistics used in the patent stock model. These variables are constructed in the

same way as described for the flow analyses above, with the difference that we now use the

depreciated stock of active patents instead of the flow of new patents. Keep in mind that the

period for these patent stock analyses is a single year, as opposed to the two-year period in the
                                              Page 26 of 40
flow section above. In light of this information, we see that the number of firms grows at a pace

of 9 percent each year and the number of patents grows at 10 percent.

       As expected, recycling patents over their lifetime results in a lower new entry and lateral

entry share: each year, 3.7 percent of the patents in a technology class belongs to new entrants,

and another 2.7 percent belongs to lateral entrants. This implies that each year roughly 94

percent of the depreciated high quality patents stock belongs to firms that were active in the

technology class in a prior year. When we increase the entry window to four years, the new entry

increases six-fold to 26 percent per year, and lateral entry increases to 7.7 percent. The positions

of IBM and Motorola appear slightly stronger in the patent stock than in the patent flow due to

the cumulative impact of their prior patents, whereas AT&T remains roughly at the same

position.

       We now combine the various factors in the following fixed effects model:

(𝐶25𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘 )𝑗𝑡 = 𝛽0* (M&𝐴 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦)𝑗𝑡 +𝛽1* (Top 10 MSA Share)𝑗𝑡 + 𝛽2* (New Entry)𝑗𝑡

            + 𝛽3* (Lateral Entry)𝑗𝑡 + 𝛽4 * (Growth)𝑗𝑡 + 𝛽5 * 𝛿𝑗,𝑡−1,𝐴𝑇&𝑇 + 𝛽6 * 𝛿𝑗,𝑡−1,,𝑀𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑎

            + 𝛽7 * 𝛿𝑗,𝑡−1,𝐼𝐵𝑀 + 𝛾𝑗 + 𝜃𝑡 + 𝜀𝑗𝑡 ,

where j is the technology class indicator and t is the time indicator. The list of regressors include

new entry and lateral entry into technology classes, growth measures, and indicator variables for

the presence of big firms, namely AT&T, Motorola, and IBM. We use two sets of entry

measures, defined on one-year and four-year time windows. Similarly, we use two sets of growth

measures, one for growth in the number of firms and a second for growth in the number of

patents. We further divide these growth variables into two components: growth in US-based

firms and patents and their foreign counterparts. The growth measures are highly correlated,

therefore, we use either the firm-based or the patent-based measure in a single model. The use of



                                                  Page 27 of 40
patent stock enables us to include M&A intensity, i.e., the measure of transferred patents through

M&A activity in a technology class, in our analyses as an additional variable.

         We present the fixed effects model of patent stocks in Table 6. The dependent variable in

the model is 𝐶25𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘 , the share of top twenty-five firms in cumulative patent stock up to the

period of observation (indexed by t). All models include class and time fixed effects. 23 We

clustered the standard errors by technology class. 24 The columns differ in the inclusion of

different patents and the number of firm growth variables, as well as the time windows for the

entry variables.

         Figure 2 reports the coefficient estimates of the time fixed effects from the model, which

indicate a secular deconcentration over the years, as was the case with the flow of patents. On

average, the concentration of a technology-class in a year-group is 8.12 percent (=-9.61%-(-

1.49%)) lower in 2007 than in 1987. In discussing the impact of other covariates below, we will

occasionally compare the impact induced to this time impact of 8.12 percent to gauge a relative

sense.

         The results (somewhat) mimics our observations on patent flow. The results on new

entry, which is a proxy for the patent-weighted entry of firms that were not active in ICT

equipment previously, are mixed for the one-year entry window, but are quite robust for the four-

year entry window. In the entire sample of patents, the new entry has a statistically and

economically significant impact on the concentration: a yearly 2.3 percent entry (the average

level) results in a 0.8 percent (=0.023 * 0.38) yearly decline in concentration. But when we

restrict the sample to high-quality patents, new entry share loses its statistical significance in

some of the models. On the other hand, new entry every four years is both statistically and

economically significant. The average four-year new entry of 26 percent results in a 8.4 percent
23
   In unreported results we use a linear and a quadratic time trend instead of time fixed effects. The qualitative
results remain the same in these alternative specifications.
24
   Two-way clustering of the standard errors by class and time does not change our statistical inferences.
                                                   Page 28 of 40
(=0.25 * 0.32) reduction in concentration, which is roughly the same level of deconcentration

induced by time fixed effects, with the difference that the new entry impact is based on only one

period’s impact.

       As in the flow analyses, the increase in the number of firms is also important, though this

result is not robust across models and different samples based on patent quality. Similarly, the

increase in the number of patents also lacks statistical significance.

       As in the flow analyses, the lateral entry is associated with an increase in the ownership

of top firms, though the impact loses its statistical significance in some models. A technology

class experiencing the average level of lateral entry, 2.7 percent per period, faces a 2.07 percent

(=0.76 * 0.027) increase in 𝐶25𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘 . This result may be driven by the fact that firms conducting

lateral entry operate in multiple segments of the industry, hence they are expected to have a

bigger operation than others, and the loss of statistical significance may be attributed to the

slower pace of change in the stock of patents than in the flow of patents. Note that lateral entry in

this context means having a high-quality patent in one ICT equipment class and producing a new

high-quality patent in another ICT equipment class in which the firm did not have high-quality

patents previously; having low-quality patents in either industry has no effect on the entry

measure among high-quality patents.

       The models suggest that the existence of AT&T as one of the top five patent owners in

the prior period does not have a statistically significant impact on the concentration of the patent

class, which is consistent with our earlier trend analyses. The coefficient of the IBM indicator is

also not significant. The presence of Motorola as a prior top-five patent applier, however, is

associated with an approximately 2.7 percent increase in the ownership concentration of the

patent class over two years. A detailed look at Motorola’s activity reveals that it focuses on five

technology classes in which the deconcentration is less than the average across all technology

                                            Page 29 of 40
classes. We cannot say whether the increased concentration is caused by the presence of

Motorola in these technology areas or whether Motorola selected to invent in areas with this

feature.

        M&A intensity does not have a statistically significant impact on market concentration.

This is true for both the entire sample and the high-quality patents, implying that demand for

ideas does not have a big impact on the concentration of ownership. 25

        The impact of top ten MSA share is also both statistically and economically significant

across specifications for the high quality patents. An average level of top ten MSA share, 50

percent, results in increased concentration of 15.57 percent (=0.50 * 0.31), which is almost twice

the magnitude of the deconcentration induced by time (8.12%). This results holds both for the

top quartile and top decile patent samples; however, in the entire sample of patents, the share of

top ten MSAs does not have a statistically significant impact on concentration.

        The main results across all models show that growth in the number of firms is an

important driver of deconcentration, suggesting that a smaller transaction cost for entry results in

lower ownership concentration. Lateral entry and Top 10 MSA Share work in the opposite

direction of entry by increasing the concentration of patent ownership. When we turn our

attention to the entire sample of patents, we obtain similar results for the growth in the number of

firms; the impact of lateral entry and top ten MSA share increases.

        Based on these results, one may ask what causes entry into new innovative areas by firms

who previously have little inventive experience. The changes in entry levels may be due to

various factors, including increased technological opportunities or product market demands,

easier access to external funding sources, such as Venture Capital funding, and demand from




25
  In unreported results we found that, by restricting the sample to the 10% highest-quality patents, M&A intensity
has a marginally significant negative impact on concentration, but even this impact is economically small.

firms with established product market presence for external innovation. This question constitutes

the next step in analyzing the innovation markets and must be left for future work.

Conclusion
In this article we characterize long-term trends related to the concentration of the origins of

inventive ideas in the ICT equipment industry. Analyzing the concentration in granted patents in

this industry from 1976 to 2010, we compare measured changes against popular assumptions

about the size and scale of changes in innovation.

       Overall we find a substantial decline in concentration. The data show that the

deconcentration arises in every measure of the trend. It is present both in the ownership of new

patent applications and in the cumulative ownership of active patents. We also show that the size

and scope of the changes vary considerably, with some segments of ICT equipment undergoing

much more dramatic changes in concentration.

       We analyze evidence about the causes of this change. The statistical evidence is

consistent with explanations that stress the role of supply-side changes more than demand-side

changes. We present evidence that firm entry accounts for part of this deconcentration.

Importantly, we reject the notion that non-US-firm entry is the sole cause of the change. We also

reject the notion that one antitrust case, one company’s strategic error, or the break-up of one

large leading innovator of yesteryear accounts for this change in structure.

       Furthermore, we show that the deconcentration results, as well as the results on the

drivers of deconcentration, hold in the entire patent sample and in the high quality patent sample,

across a variety of concentration measures.

       The deconcentration of ownership results we obtain relate to the literature on Divided

Technical Leadership (DTL) and, more broadly, to debates about the causes of market leadership

and incentives in innovative activities. By distinguishing between product market leadership and

technological leadership and focusing on the latter, we provide evidence of increased
                                           Page 31 of 40
competition in the ideas market. This increased competition may be indicative of higher

incentives to innovate, hence higher levels of inventive activity under a model where incentives

increase monotonically with greater competition.

       Finally, this is the first study to investigate the extent of the potentially countervailing

M&A mechanism using a census of the M&A activity in the ICT Industry. First, we showed that

there is a considerable transfer of patents through M&A, which relate to the literature on R&D

incentives in an M&A context on one hand, and the start-up commercialization framework of

Gans, Hsu, and Stern (2002) on the other. We then show that the size of the patent transfer

through M&A is not enough to revert the composition of ownership to its pre-deconcentration

levels. We conclude that the leading firms’ strategies to externalize R&D activity has not

reversed the trend towards deconcentration. Furthermore, M&A intensity does not have a

statistically significant impact on the ownership concentration of ideas.

       The study has several inherent limitations. The USPTO classification system we used

constitutes a limitation. Though no single technology class dominates our data, the definition of

these classes may depend on industry developments, which may have ramifications for our

analyses. In addition, our data includes patents granted since 1976. This restriction does not

impact our patent flow variables, as they are based on the patent applications within each year;

however, it truncates the patent stock variable for the early years of our sample, as we do not

have information on active patents before 1976. Though the history of (de)concentration in

electronics goes back much further in history, these data limitations prevent investigation of the

earlier trends and causes.

   Notes: The sample includes patent stock values from 1986 to 2007,
   calculated from patent applications in top quartile quality level in the
   period from 1976 to 2007 that are ultimately granted by USPTO on or
   before 2010. The averages are across the thirty ICT equipment industry
   patent technology classes and years. C25stock is the patent stock share of
   top twenty-five companies within a cell. HHI refers to the Herfindahl–
   Hirschman Index calculated within each cell. New Entry Share is the
   share of patents in a technology class in a period that are held by
   assignees that did not have any patents in any ICT equipment industry
   patent technology classes in prior periods. Lateral Entry Share is the
   share of patents in a technology class in a period that are held by
   assignees that had patents in other ICT equipment industry patent
   technology classes in prior periods, but did not have any patents in the
   current technology class in an earlier period. Growth is measured within
   each technology class across two consecutive calendar years. The firm
   dummies indicate the presence of the firm among the top five patent
   stock holders in the previous period.

Notes: Cumulative ICT equipment industry patent stock transfers through mergers against
the entire ICT equipment industry patent stock from 1979 to 2007, at the highest quartile
patent quality level, where quality is measured by citations received. The patent stock is
the discounted sum of unexpired patent holdings in the sample. The M&A activity
includes deals from SDC’s M&A module between 1979 and 2010, in which the target has
at least one ICT equipment industry patent between 1976 and 2007. The sample includes
only the following transaction forms: merger, acquisition, acquisition of majority interest,
acquisition of assets, and acquisition of certain assets. Deals that include a firm from the
financial industry or a utility firm on either side, or a subsidiary as a target, are dropped
from the sample.

   Figure 1: Patent flow concentration levels (technology class 385)
Notes: The sample includes patent applications from the Optical Waveguides technology class (class 385)
from 1976 to 2007 that are ultimately granted on or before 2010, at all levels of patent quality. The years
are grouped into two year cells. The concentration is measured by the share of top i firms in terms of
patent applications within each two-year cell, where i ranges from one to twenty-five.




    Figure 2: Patent stock – time fixed effects coefficient estimates
Notes: Coefficient estimates of time fixed effects from Model 1 in Table 6. Regressions are ordinary least
squares, the solid line represents the coefficient estimates, and the dashed lines indicate the 95%
confidence intervals obtained from standard errors clustered by class. An observation is a patent
technology class and a year. N is 660. Each model includes technology class and time fixed effects. The
sample includes the highest quartile of patents in the period 1986 to 2007 that are ultimately granted by
USPTO on or before 2010, where quality is measured by citations received.
