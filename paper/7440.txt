Predictors of Mortality Among the Elderly

NBER Working Paper No. 7440
December 1999


                                              ABSTRACT


        The objective of this paper is to find the quantitative importance of some predictors of mortality
among the population aged 70 or over. The predictors are socio-economic indicators (income, wealth and
education), thirteen health indicators including a history of heart attack or cancer, and subjective
probabilities of survival. The estimation is based on mortality between waves 1 and 2 of the Asset and
Health Dynamics among the Oldest-Old study. We find that the relationship between socio-economic
indicators and mortality declines with age, that the 13 health indicators are strong predictors of mortality
and that the subjective survival probabilities predict mortality even after controlling for socio-economic
indicators and the health conditions.

1. Introduction

         Mortality risk is a fundamental determinant of consumption and saving in a life-cycle model.
Understanding the behavioral reactions to variation in mortality risk is important from a scientific point
of view and from a policy point of view. The reaction will reveal the degree of risk aversion, which is
an important behavioral parameter. The economic status of the oldest-old will depend on their
consumption and saving choices in the years closely following retirement. Under the life-cycle model
the predicted changes in life expectancy will have an effect on national saving beyond what would be
forecast from a compositional effect.
         Mortality risk in the population may be adequately measured by lifetables; however,
individuals are likely to have additional information about their life chances and use that information in
making consumption and saving decisions. Some of that information may be related to observable
characteristics such as health status and socio-economic status (SES). Accounting for the relationship
between SES and mortality (the SES gradient) is particularly important. The gradient is important
because it causes difficulties in predicting the economic status of a cohort and in understanding life-
cycle behavior from cross-section variation in wealth. Besides cohort effects that would, by
themselves, cause wealth to decline with age in cross-section, the mortality gradient will cause wealth
to increase both in cross-section and in panel. As a cohort ages those with less wealth die, leaving
survivors from the upper part of the wealth distribution. Thus, even if no couple or single person
dissaves after retirement, the wealth of the cohort would increase with age. This makes it difficult to
study life-cycle wealth paths based on synthetic cohorts, which will eliminate cohort differences in
lifetime time resources but not differential mortality. These difficulties carry over to studies of income
and consumption in synthetic cohorts.
         Yet, it is likely that individuals have subjective information about their own survival chances
that cannot be discovered from mortality rates stratified by observable covariates such as SES. First,
some personal characteristics are not easily measured, so they cannot be used as stratifying variables.
 Second, individuals may misperceive their survival chances, choosing consumption based on
subjective yet biased life expectancy. If we are to understand consumption choices we need to have
observations on the subjective variables that individuals use in making their choices. Third, even if we
could stratify by many characteristics and understand average bias, there surely would remain
considerable heterogeneity in subjective survival probabilities: understanding that heterogeneity would
help in the estimation of life-cycle models.
         To model and use heterogeneous information about survival chances in life-cycle models is a
multi-step process. First, we need to find the observable correlates of mortality and measure their
effects. Second, we need to measure the perceptions of individuals about their own mortality risk,
and, given observable characteristics, to find if these perceptions have explanatory power for
mortality. Third, we need measures of mortality risk that embody all of our knowledge about
heterogeneity in models of decision making. This paper addresses the first two of these steps.
         Differential mortality by socio-economic status (SES) has been observed over a wide range of
data and populations: mortality rates are high among those from lower SES groups (Kitagawa and
Hauser, 1973; Shorrocks, 1975; Hurd, 1987; Hurd and Wise, 1989; Jianakoplos, Menchik and
                                                       3
Owen, 1989; Feinstein, 1992). However, because of data limitations the measures of SES have
typically been occupation or education. In the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the Asset and
Health Dynamics Study (AHEAD) there is scope for expanded studies of differential mortality
because these are panel surveys with considerable age density and they obtain extensive data on
income, wealth and health conditions in addition to occupation and education. The AHEAD data in
particular offer opportunities for increasing our knowledge of the gradient because the population (age
70 or over at baseline) has been not been studied to the extent to which younger populations have
been. Furthermore, the fact that the AHEAD population is almost completely retired means that a
very strong confounding effect of health on income via work status is practically eliminated. Finally,
almost the entire AHEAD population is covered by Medicare: therefore, an important causal
pathway linking SES to mortality via access to health care services is reduced and even possibly
eliminated.
         The HRS and AHEAD asked respondents to give an estimate of their survival chances to a
target age, which was approximately 12 years in the future. In the HRS this variable is a significant
predictor of mortality between waves 1 and 2 (Hurd and McGarry, 1997). Here we aim to find if it
has predictive power for mortality in the AHEAD population both unconditionally and conditionally on
observable characteristics.
         In this paper we will verify that SES is related to mortality in the AHEAD data. Then we will
give evidence about the validity of the subjective survival probabilities. The evidence will be of three
kinds: whether the subjective survival probabilities vary in cross-section in a way that is appropriate
given the variation in actual mortality; how the subjective survival probabilities change in panel in
response to new information such as the onset of an illness; and whether they predict actual mortality.
We will then examine whether, conditional on health status, SES and the subjective survival
probabilities have explanatory power for predicting mortality

2. Data

         Our data come from the study of the Asset and Health Dynamics among the Oldest-Old
(AHEAD).1 This study is a biennial panel survey of individuals born in 1923 or earlier and their
spouses. At baseline in 1993 it surveyed 8222 individuals representative of the community-based
population except for oversamples of blacks, Hispanics and Floridians. Wave 2 was fielded in 1995.
         The main goal of AHEAD is to provide panel data from the three broad domains of economic
status, health and family connections. Our main interest in this paper is to understand the predictors of
mortality between waves 1 and 2, especially education, income, wealth and the subjective probability
of survival. In wave 1 individuals and couples were asked for a complete inventory of assets and
debts and about income sources. Through the use of unfolding brackets, nonresponse to asset values
was reduced to levels much lower than would be found in a typical household survey such as the
SIPP.2

 See Soldo, Hurd, Rodgers and Wallace, 1997.

 To handle non-response to asset and total income questions, we use a nested composite imputation
procedure. We impute non-response to asset ownership, unfolding brackets, and asset amounts
                                                    4
        Both HRS and AHEAD have innovative questions about subjective probabilities, which
request the subject to give the chances of future events. We will use observations on the subjective
probability of survival. The form of the question is as follows:

        [Using any] “number from 0 to 100 where “0" means that you think there is absolutely no
        chance and “100" means that you think the event is absolutely sure to happen ... What do you
        think are the chances that you will live to be at least A ,"

where A is the target age. A is 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 if the age of the respondent was less than 70,
70-74, 75-79, 80-84, 85-89 respectively. The question was not asked of those 90 or over or of
proxy respondents.
         AHEAD queries about a wide range of health conditions. Many are asked of the
respondent in the following form: “Has a doctor ever told you that you have …” We will use
information on 10 conditions such as cancer, heart attack/disease and lung disease. The respondent is
queried about limitations to activities of daily living (ADL). We will use as an indicator of poor health
three or more ADL limitations.
         AHEAD measures cognitive status in a battery of questions which aim to test a number of
domains of cognition (Herzog and Wallace, 1997). Learning and memory are assessed by immediate
and delayed recall from a list of 10 words that were read to the subject. Reasoning, orientation and
attention are assessed from Serial 7's, counting backwards by 1 and the naming of public figures,
dates and objects.3 In prior work we have found that unrealistic stated subjective survival
probabilities are associated with low cognitive performance (Hurd, McFadden and Gan, 1998).
Therefore we aggregated the cognitive measures in AHEAD and formed a categorical variable to
indicate low cognitive performance.
         AHEAD also has a battery of questions that are extracted from the CESD scale. The scale
aims to assess depressed mood. We form an indicator of depressed mood based on these questions.

3. Results

       The baseline AHEAD sample was 8222, of which 813 died between waves 1 and 2, and
7364 survived. The vital status of 45 is unknown. Excluding the 45, the two-year mortality rate was
0.099.4 This mortality rate cannot be compared with any lifetable rate for two reasons: first, the

sequentially. Ownership and complete brackets are imputed using stepwise logistic regression on a
number of demographic characteristics. Dollar amounts are then imputed, conditional on a complete
bracket, using a nearest neighbor which makes extensive use of covariates (Hoynes, Hurd and Chand,
1998).
  3
   Serial 7's asks the subject to subtract 7 from 100, and then to continue subtracting 7 from each
successive difference for a total of five subtractions.
  4
   The mortality rate including the 45 cases among the living was 0.0988. Including them among the
dead the mortality rates was 0.104. In the rest of the paper we will include them among the living for
                                                    5
AHEAD baseline is the community-based population, so that it excludes residents of long-term care
facilities who have substantially higher mortality rates than the community-based population.
Lifetables include residents of long-term care facilities and of other institutions.5 Second, the AHEAD
sample includes spouses of AHEAD age-eligible respondents, but the spouses may themselves not be
age-eligible. The age-ineligible spouses do not make up any population whose mortality rate can be
compared with a lifetable.
          The mortality rate of the AHEAD age-eligible sample (n=7446) was 0.107; the lifetable rate
interpolated to 1993 was 0.155. The difference comes from the high mortality rates among the
institutionalized.
          Table 1 shows weighted mortality rates for the age-eligible part of the AHEAD population by
age and sex, and the number of observations. A few respondents were age 69 at their initial interview
but we include them in the 70-74 age band. The weights account for the oversamples at baseline.
The figures show sharply increasing mortality rates with age and a considerable difference between
men and women. At older ages the number of subjects diminishes rapidly due to mortality, cohort
effects, and the fact that the institutionalized are not in the AHEAD baseline.
          Table 2 presents mean wealth and income by age and marital status. Wealth is the total of
housing wealth, financial, business and other real estate wealth, but it does not include any pension
wealth. Income includes all financial income such as pension income, but no flow from owner
occupied housing. Just as in other cross-section data sets, wealth and income fall with age, and both
are higher among couples than among singles. The table makes clear that we cannot study the
relationship between mortality and economic status without effectively controlling for age.

Wealth, Income and Education

        Table 3 shows average and median wealth in wave 1 by vital status in wave 2. At baseline
among single males aged 70-74 who survived to wave 2, average wealth was about $216.5 thousand.
 Wealth was just $67.2 thousand among those who died. This is, of course, a substantial difference
and indicates considerable differential mortality by wealth holdings. The difference among single
females is smaller but still substantial. Among married males there is only a small difference, whereas
married female survivors had almost twice the wealth on average as deceased married females. The
medians also indicate considerable differential mortality by wealth.
        There is diminished differential mortality by wealth among those 75-79. Given the amount of
observation error on wealth, we judge there to be little difference in wealth holdings by mortality
outcome among those married at baseline, either male or female. There is some difference among
singles. The differences are smaller still among the 80-84 year-olds, and there are no consistent


convenience, but their treatment is not consequential compared with the lack of data on the
institutionalized population.
  5
   Because AHEAD will follow the baseline respondents into institutions, it will eventually be
representative of the entire cohort of 1923 or earlier.

differences among the 85-89 year-olds. The medians show somewhat more differential mortality but
not as much as at the youngest age interval.
         Among those 90 or over, sample sizes are small. For example, just 39 single males and just
twenty married females were in the age interval at baseline. The group with the largest number of
observations (single females) shows no differential mortality.
         These data are summarized in Figure 1, which shows the wealth of decedents relative to the
wealth of survivors.6 For example, single female decedents aged 70-74 had about 40 percent of the
wealth of survivors. The figure shows a general trend to smaller differences in wealth at greater ages.
We conclude that overall there is evidence of differential mortality by wealth: on average those who
died had about 70% of the wealth of those who survived. However, the difference decreases with
age.
         Table 4 has comparable results but for average education. Thus, among males age 70-74 the
average level of education was 11.5 years among survivors and 10.4 among the deceased. In the first
age band the differential is considerable and it is the same for each sex. At ages 75-79 the differential
decreases for men but remains about the same for women, and by 80-84 there is no differential
among men. It is notable that in the highest age interval, the educational level of women is higher than
that of men even though for these cohorts the educational level of a complete population of men would
have been considerably higher. An explanation is found in the differential mortality at younger ages:
women consistently have a higher mortality gradient by education than men, causing the better
educated women to survive at a higher rate than the better educated men.
         Tables 5 and 6 show mortality rates by wealth and income quartiles. The quartiles are defined
separately by marital status, but the quartile boundaries are the same over the entire age range.
Because of the correlations between age and economic status, and between age and mortality, overall
mortality varies strongly by wealth or income quartile as shown in the last line of each table.
However, this relationship is much less clear when age is controlled for. In the first age band there is a
consistent decline across the quartiles, but in the other age bands there is little consistent pattern even
though mortality is generally the largest in the first wealth quartile. Mortality by income has a more
consistent pattern and for some age intervals the effects are very strong. For example among 80-84
year-olds the morality rate in the lowest income quartile is about 56% greater than in the highest. As
with wealth, however, the differential seems to diminish with age.
         These figures, particularly for wealth, suggest that differential mortality may decrease with age.
 To test that idea we estimated analysis-of-variance models where the observations are mortality rates
classified by age intervals, and income and wealth quartiles. The models had complete interactions
between age intervals and income quartiles and between age intervals and wealth quartiles. We tested
for significance of the interactions. We could reject the null hypothesis that the interactions for couples
and separately for singles are all zero at the five percent level, but not at the one percent level.
Because the age interactions are not particularly strong and in the interest of simplifying the analysis,
our basic model will have age effects, and income and wealth quartiles but not interactions. We will
leave the exploration of the age interaction for future research.

         Table 7 has mortality rates by education level for males. As the table shows, in the AHEAD
data mortality is higher for men with 9-11 years of education than for males of 0-8 years of education,
and this is true holding age constant. We have no good reason for this result, except possibly that
those with 0-8 years of education have been highly selected by the time they reach the AHEAD ages.
 Holding age constant, we see some pattern of differential mortality in the younger age bands, but it is
less apparent at older ages.
         Among females in their 70s there is a strong and consistent relationship between mortality and
education, but at older ages there is little if any (Table 8).
         Overall we conclude that there is differential mortality by educational attainment at the younger
ages in the AHEAD population, but the effects diminish with age. Particularly among females, who
comprise most of the observations in the population 80 or over, there is little evidence for a mortality
gradient by education.




Subjective Probabilities of Survival

         The subjective probability of survival has been studied extensively in data from the HRS
(Hurd and McGarry, 1995, 1997). In cross-section it aggregates well to lifetable levels and it varies
appropriately with known risk factors. Furthermore, in panel it is a significant predictor of actual
mortality even after accounting for SES and a number of disease conditions. In AHEAD baseline it
aggregates well to lifetable values among those aged 70-79, but in the older age groups the subjective
survival probabilities overstate survival compared with lifetable rates (Hurd, McFadden and Gan,
1998). One cause of the excess survival probability is that a fairly small number of subjects give a
probability of 1.0 of surviving to the target age. The propensity to give a probability of 1.0 is related
to low cognitive status, and often an individual will give a probability of 1.0 to a number of unrelated
subjective probability questions. Such regularities provide evidence of error in some of the responses.
 Nonetheless we will take the responses as they were given by the AHEAD subjects. We imagine,
however, that the predictive power of the subjective survival probabilities could be increased were
some of the reporting error removed by application of a model of the error.
         Table 9 shows the average subjective survival probability by age band and wealth quartile.7 It
is important to group by age in this manner because all the respondents in each age band were given
the same target age. As would be expected the average survival probability declines with age, but
unlike actual mortality there is little systematic variation in the survival probability as a function of
wealth. For example, among those 70-74 the average subjective survival probability is about the
same in the lowest and the third quartiles. Only in the highest quartile is it greater. Yet the actual two-
year survival rate was five percentage points higher in the fourth quartile than in the first quartile: Such
a large difference in two-year survival should accumulate to a much greater difference in subjective
survival to the target age.

    Both the wealth and income quartiles are calculated separately by marital status.
                                                      8
         As shown in tables 10 and 11, there is little variation in the survival probabilities as a function
of income quartiles or of education bands.
         A possible reason for the lack of any pattern by wealth, income, or education is the rather
high rate of nonresponse to the survival probabilities.8 A substantial number of interviews were by
proxy, often because of the frailty of the targeted respondent. In this case it made no sense to ask a
proxy about the subject’s subjective survival probability. In addition a rather large number of
respondents replied “Don’t know” (DK) to the query. Table 12 has the counts of nonresponse as a
function of wealth quartile. Overall about 25% of singles and 21% of married persons were
nonrespondents. It is clear that the rate of nonresponse is greatest among those in the lowest
quartiles. For example, among 70-74 year-olds the rate of nonresponse was about 31% in the
lowest quartile and 11% in the highest. Furthermore, because the propensity to give a proxy interview
and the likelihood of a DK are related to health status, it is probable that the responding sample is
systematically selected toward those with higher survival probabilities. Therefore, the averages in the
lowest quartiles are higher than the true quartile averages whereas the averages in the highest quartiles
are closer to the true averages, acting to reduce any upward trend in the subjective survival
probabilities as a function of wealth.
         We ask whether the pattern of nonresponse could conceivably be responsible for the lack of
pattern in the subjective survival probabilities, even though there is a clear pattern in actual mortality.
We illustrate that it could be responsible by assigning a subjective survival probability of zero to the
nonresponders. Figure 2 shows the variation in the subjective survival probabilities under that
assignment. The probabilities increase in wealth in each age band. These results show that differential
nonresponse has a quantitatively important effect on the level and variation in the subjective survival
probabilities. In future work we will explore methods for imputing missing values, but for the rest of
this paper we will, as appropriate, use categorical variables to account for nonresponse.
         Table 13 shows the estimated regressions of the subjective survival probabilities on the wealth
and income quartiles, education bands, and other explanatory variables. We control for age and for
the varying interval between the interview and the target age by including as a right-hand variable the
lifetable survival rate to the target age from the age of the respondent. If respondents reported their
subjective survival probability to be the same as the lifetable rate, the coefficient on this variable would
be 1.0. The estimated coefficient shows that the age gradient in the subjective survival probability is
less than the age gradient in the lifetable rate. This is partly due to the overestimation of subjective
survival probabilities among the oldest compared with the lifetable values.
         The three sets of SES variables show no systematic pattern, which is the basic finding
from the cross-tabulations in tables 9, 10 and 11. Relative to the lifetable, males overstate their
survival chances by 0.07. This tendency to over-optimism is also found in the HRS population (Hurd
and McGarry, 1995).
         The last two columns of Table 13 contain regressions which include controls for health
condition. Most of the health conditions are asked of the respondent in the following form: “Has a
doctor ever told you that you have …” The exceptions are “low cognitive score,” which is a
categorical variable indicating a low score on the sum of three items that were administered in the

8
    This low response rate in AHEAD is in contrast to the very high response rate in HRS.
                                                     9
survey itself; and “depression,” which is based eight items from the CESD (Wallace and Herzog,
1995). A categorical variable for depression indicates a score of five or more on the CESD. Eight of
the 13 health variables are significant at the 0.05 level, and they are associated with a reduction in the
subjective survival probabilities of nine to 25 percent of the average probability. For example having
had a heart attack or heart disease prior to wave 1 is associated with a reduction in the subjective
survival probability of 0.062 from a base of 0.415 or about 15 percent. Based on these results we
would expect the subjective survival probabilities to predict actual mortality because of their
association with the health conditions which, themselves, are associated with mortality.

Change in the subjective survival probabilities

         As individuals age the subjective survival probabilities should increase among survivors
holding the target age constant. Between waves 1 and 2 the average increase was 0.064 (16 percent)
among singles and 0.051 (15 percent) among couples. Tables 14 and 15 show the levels and
changes by age band and by sex. The tables show that the subjective survival probabilities are
overstated relative to lifetables at older ages, particularly among men. For example among men aged
85-89 the average subjective survival probability to age 100 is 0.314 whereas the average lifetable
value is 0.034. In terms of relative risk, the increases in the subjective survival probabilities from
wave to wave are reasonably close to the increases in the lifetable probabilities except in the oldest
age intervals. Although it is difficult to know what the appropriate standard of comparison is, it is
notable that in all age bands the subjective survival probabilities increase between the waves. This
increase was not found in HRS: among survivors the average subjective survival probability
decreased slightly (Hurd and McGarry, 1997).
         Besides increases in the subjective survival probabilities that are due to the AHEAD subjects
surviving for two years, the probabilities should change in response to new information that alters
survival chances. Such information would be onset of a health condition that is associated with an
increased risk of death. Table 16 shows the incidence of new conditions between waves 1 and 2 for
all respondents. Thus, for example, among singles who had not had cancer prior to the baseline
interview, 5.1 percent had a cancer between the waves. Among all singles, including those with a
history of cancer prior to baseline, 5.5% had a new or initial cancer between the waves. Although it is
not the focus of this paper the table shows that having a prior history of cancer, stroke, heart
attack/disease, hip fracture or fall increases the risk of a new, similar event. Having a low cognitive
score, which is associated with increased risk of dementia, has the greatest rate of onset.
         About 8.2 percent of singles who were living in the community at wave 1 were in a nursing
home at wave 2.
         There is little difference in the rates of onset between singles and couples except for limitations
on the activities of daily living (ADL limitations) and nursing home entry. The measure of ADL
limitations is an indicator for ADL limitations greater than two, and singles had an incidence rate of
10.4% compared with couples of 6.6%. The difference likely comes from the fact that on average
singles are older than couples and from the ability of couples to help each other, disguising some mild
cases of ADL limitations. As in the case of ADL limitations the rate of entry into a nursing home is

                                                    10
greater among singles because of age differences and because a spouse can provide help that will
keep the other spouse in the community.
         Table 17 shows the estimated regression of the change in the subjective survival probabilities
between waves 1 and 2 on the incidence of health conditions and other events.9 To the extent that the
onset of a new condition provides new information about survival chances, onset should reduce the
subjective survival probabilities. A number of the conditions have negative coefficients indicating that
onset reduces the subjective survival probabilities, and cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes and
depression have negative effects that are significant at the five percent level. The depression indicator
is somewhat different from the other health condition indicators in that it probably depends on the
same or similar aspects of health as the subjective survival probabilities.10 The death of a spouse
increased the subjective survival probabilities. In the HRS the death of a spouse decreased subjective
survival probabilities (Hurd and McGarry, 1997). An explanation for the difference may be that at the
ages of the AHEAD respondents the death of a spouse is preceded by a period of care that reduces
the optimism of the caregiver.
         The onset of ADL limitations of three or more increased subjective survival probabilities.
Because there is no obvious reason for this result we performed some estimations with more detail.
First, the increase is found in detailed regressions for singles and couples separately. Second, we
defined some additional categories for change in ADL limitations and estimated their effects. The
categories were: (1) no baseline ADL limitation and one or more ADL limitations in wave 2; (2) one
or more ADL limitations in baseline and an increase in limitations by wave 2; (3) one or more ADL
limitations in baseline and no increase by wave 2. For category (1), which is onset of any ADL
limitation, the effect is to reduce the subjective survival probability by a small amount (-0.014, not
significant). For category (2), the effect is to increase the subjective survival probability by 0.054 (p-
value of 0.045) and for category (3) it is to increase the subjective survival probability by 0.040 (p-
value of 0.109). Thus the increase in the subjective survival probability accompanying the onset of
three or more ADL limitations is due to those who had existing baseline ADL limitations reporting
higher probabilities in wave 2. We have no explanation for this increase.

Subjective survival probabilities and mortality

As discussed earlier, the rate of response about subjective survival probabilities was rather low in
AHEAD, and actual mortality between waves 1 and 2 was above average among the nonresponders.
 As shown in the last row of Table 18, the overall mortality rate among the 7446 age-eligible subjects
in wave 1 was 10.6% The other rows show mortality rates among those who did not answer the
question about subjective survival probabilities. These nonrespondents are divided according to
reason for nonresponse. The first row shows the mortality rate among those who were age 90 or
over at wave 1: by survey design they were not asked the question about subjective survival, and their

  For heart attack, cancer and stroke, those with a history of the condition at baseline and who had a
new incident between waves 1 and 2 are included as incident cases.
10
   The depression indicator takes the value one if the sum of the eight items on the CESD8 is greater
than four.
                                                   11
two-year mortality rate was about 0.30. Those who answered DK (do not know) had approximately
average mortality rates whereas those who answered RF (refuse to answer) had somewhat elevated
mortality rates. A large group (685) were interviewed by proxy in wave 1, and they had a
substantially higher mortality rate than average. A main reason for interview by proxy was that the
subject was too frail or cognitively impaired to be interviewed. This frailty is reflected in the mortality
rate.
         Table 19 has mortality rates by subjective survival probability in wave 1. The table shows
that the subjective survival probabilities have considerable explanatory power for mortality particularly
in the low range. Thus, for example, the mortality rate among those who gave a zero probability of
survival was about 0.13 compared with about 0.05 among those that gave a 0.50 probability of
survival. The mortality rates are basically flat from the interval 0.21-0.30. This is similar to the
relationship found between the subjective survival probabilities and mortality in the HRS (Hurd and
McGarry, 1997). The increase in mortality at the two highest probability intervals indicates
observation error that is likely related to misunderstanding or cognitive malfunctioning.
         More detailed cross-tabulations of the correlates of mortality are not practical, so we turn to
data-descriptive probit estimation as a way to reduce the dimensionality of the predictors. Table 20
has the results from probit estimation of the determinants of mortality. The left-hand variable takes the
value one if a subject died between the waves and zero otherwise. We control for age and sex by
including as a right-hand variable the two-year mortality rate by age and sex from an interpolated
1993 lifetable. Thus the other right-hand variables will show the deviation in mortality rates from the
lifetable rate. The probit coefficients have been translated into probability effects via the linear
approximation

         ∂P
            = βφ
         ∂x

where β is the probit coefficient on x and φ is the normal density evaluated at the average mortality
rate of singles.11
         The table has three sets of results depending on which variables are included. In each set the
first column has the effects and the second the statistic for testing the null hypotheses that the effect is
zero. Approximately, a statistic of 2.0 indicates significance at the five percent level.
         The first entry in the table is the coefficient on two-year age- and sex-specific mortality rates
from a 1993 interpolated lifetable. The coefficient is less than 1.0, reflecting the fact that in AHEAD
mortality does not increase with age as rapidly as the lifetable mortality. The difference in mortality is
partly due to the increasing fraction of the population that is institutionalized at greater ages. In that
this part of the population is missing from AHEAD mortality rates in AHEAD will be progressively
lower than mortality rates from a lifetable, which reflect the entire population. An additional factor


11
   We will use the word “effects” when we refer to the probability coefficients. We recognize that
while they describe systematic relationships in the data they do not necessarily measure causal
relationships. It would require considerable more investigation to ascribe causality.
                                                    12
could be that AHEAD is a more accurate measure of current mortality than the lifetables that we
use.12
         In the first column of Table 20 mortality does systematically decrease in wealth in
approximately the same way as in the cross-tabulations in Table 5, but the coefficient on just one of
the wealth quartiles is significant at the five percent level. Mortality is generally lower in the higher
income quartiles. The effect of education is partly obscured by the higher mortality rate in the second
education band compared with the first, but moving from the second to the fourth education band
reduced mortality by 0.039 (p-value of 0.054).
         The mortality rate of men was about 0.022 greater than would be predicted from the
lifetable.13 Married respondents had mortality rates that were about 0.023 lower than singles: this is a
substantial reduction amounting to about 21% of average mortality. There was no differential effect of
marital status for men compared with women. That is, marriage does not provide additional mortality
protection for men relative to women.14
         The next two columns show the effects when the subjective survival probability is added along
with a set of variables to account for missing observations on the subjective survival probability. We
entered the subjective survival probability as a deviation from the lifetable survival rate to the target
age. We did this because of the varying time interval between the age of the subject and the target
age. This formulation also automatically scales for the fact that the effect on two-year mortality of a
survival probability to an age 11-15 years in the future will vary with baseline age.
         When the subjective survival probability is added, both the wealth and income effects are
reduced and they are no longer statistically significant. The effect of education as measured by the
difference between the second and fourth bands remains substantial and the difference is significant.
The subjective survival probability is itself a powerful predictor of mortality: varying the subjective
survival probability from zero to one would reduce two-year mortality risk by 0.079 or 74%. The
indicator variable for proxy interview predicts much higher mortality.
         The last two columns have probit results when the baseline health conditions are included. Of
the 13 health conditions, 10 are significant at the 0.05 level, and each acts to increase mortality risk
with the effects varying from 16 to 66 percent. Adding the health variables reduces the effect of the
subjective survival probability by 33 percent, but it is still substantial. The effect of a proxy interview is
reduced, as would be expected because proxy interviews are often due to poor health. Those with
low cognitive status at baseline had elevated mortality rates.15
         In additional estimations which we do not report here, we estimated separate mortality probit
models for males and for females. Our objective was to find if there were substantial differences in

   To test whether our single lifetable mortality rate was adequately controlling for age we also added in
five age intervals (not shown). None was significant and all were small. We conclude that there is no
requirement for age indicators when the age- and sex-specific lifetable mortality rates are used.
13
   Separate estimation of the mortality probit by sex shows that the coefficient on “lifetable” is different
for male and female.

   See Lillard and Waite (1994) for the opposite finding.
15
   We interacted low cognitive status with the subjective survival probability. The interaction did have a
positive sign, indicating that among those with low cognitive status the subjective survival probability are
less predictive of mortality, but the effect was small and not significant (not shown).
                                                     13
the effects of SES or health conditions on mortality. In general there were few differences: as in the
pooled results no income or wealth quartile had a sizable effect nor was any significant. However, the
education gradient between the second and fourth age bands, which we found in the pooled
estimation, was only found in the results for men. The effect of marital status was somewhat greater
for men than for women, reducing the mortality rate by 0.032 compared with 0.015. In terms of
relative risk, the reduction in risk for men was 26 percent and for women it was 16 percent. The
effects of health conditions were about the same for men and women.


4. Conclusion

         We found that, as in other data, mortality is related to SES. The relationship is strong at
younger ages in AHEAD and appears to weaken at older ages. Any explanation at this point would
be rather speculative, but the finding is consistent with the view that the primary cause of the gradient
is unobserved individual characteristics that cause both bad health and therefore early death, and that
cause lower earnings and therefore lower wealth and less education. Were the causality primarily to
run from economic resources to health and mortality, we should see a persistent difference in mortality
outcomes in very old age between those with substantial resources and those with few. We
tentatively conclude that we do not see this, although we acknowledge this should be confirmed by
further analysis. If the differential is due to unobserved individual differences, the mortality gradient
operating at younger ages will have truncated the distribution, so that in extreme old age the variation
in individual characteristics would be greatly reduced. Therefore, classifying people by SES would
not produce any substantial differences in mortality.
         In cross-section the subjective survival probability is related to baseline health conditions, and
there is some consistency in the relative importance of the health conditions on the subjective survival
probability and in their importance in predicting actual mortality. For example, of the five largest
health effects on the subjective survival probability, three are among the five largest predictors of
mortality (cancer, lung disease and ADL >2). In panel the subjective survival probability increases
among survivors, and the effects of new health conditions on the panel change in the subjective
survival probabilities are similar to the cross-section effects of baseline health conditions. For
example, of the five largest effects of the onset of health conditions on changes in the subjective
survival probability, three are among the five largest cross-section effects (cancer, lung disease and
depression).
         The subjective survival probability predicts actual mortality as in the HRS, which should
increase our confidence that it can be used to construct individualized lifetables for models of life-cycle
saving behavior as proposed by Hurd, McFadden and Gan (1998). Whether such lifetables will have
substantial explanatory power for saving remains to be determined as more waves of AHEAD
become available.
         The relationship between SES and mortality that is found in cross-tabulations (as in Table 5)
disappears when health status is controlled for as in Table 20. This result suggests that any differential
access to health care services related to SES is small. Were that not the case, in a population with
homogeneous baseline health (or with effective controls for baseline health status) those with higher
                                                      14
SES would be more likely to receive appropriate treatment for the onset of a severe condition and,
therefore, to survive. We do not find such a relationship. There could still be a role for SES,
however, through modifications in the probability of the onset of health conditions, which, in turn,
would affect mortality risk. To assess that path will require an additional dynamic model of health
status.
