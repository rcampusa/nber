                          TAXATION AND EXCESS BURDEN:

                            A LIFE CYCLE PERSPECTIVE



                                     ABSTRACT


     A lifetime perspective is appropriate in assessing the welfare implications

of government tax policies. Although a number of attempts have been made to ex-

amine the excess burden of taxation in life-cycle models, these have tended to

ignore the role of human capital accumulation and/or the leisure—income choice.

In this paper, we do numerical simulations with a model that takes both of these

phenomena into account.

     We find that under reasonable assumptions, the failure to take into.account

distortions of human capital decisions produces substantial underestimates of the

excess burden of income taxation. In addition, allowing for the endogeneity of

human capital increases the efficiency of a personal consumption tax relative to

that of an equal yield income tax.

I.       INTRODUCTION


         Proper understanding of many important economic decisions requires

that.theybe viewed in a life cycle context. Similarly, such a perspec—

tiye.is appropriate in assessing the welfare implications of government

tax policies. Quite possibly, a tax that appears efficient from the

point of view of one year may be inefficient in a life cycle perspective

because of intertemporal allocation effects.

     This important point was made several years ago by Levhari and

Sheshinski 119721 when they analyzed the excess burden of an income tax

in a model of lifetime utility maximization. However, as Levhari and

Sheshinski recognized, their model was characterized by several restric-

tive features: (a) Utility depended only upon the lifetime consumption

vector --    the   value of leisure was ignored;   (b) The elasticity of the

marginal utility of consumption was constrained to be unity; and (c)

There was no consideration of pre—tax wage determination; i.e., earnings

capacity was exogenous rather than generated by rational human capital

investment decisions. Even more recent models of tax policy in life cycle

models have tended to ignore the role of human capital accumulation.1

     The payoff for such restrictive assumptions is that they allow the

derivation of an elegant analytic expression for excess burden. The

problem is that the substantial lack of "realism" precludes the possibil-

ity of producing numerical estimates of what the welfare costs of taxation

might actually be. An important purpose of this paper is to study via

simulations the impact of taxation in a model that allows for endogenous

leisure and human capital decisions. Our main focus is on how the life-

time excess burden of an income tax varies with key behavioral parameters.

However, the study also sheds light on such issues as the relative effi-

ciency of income and consumption taxes, and the consequences of failing to

account for human investment decisions when considering the welfare costs

of taxation.

     In Section II we describe the model of lifetime earnings and labor

supply, and explain how its parameters are set. The simulation results

are presented and discussed in Section III. A final section contains a

sununary   and   suggestions for future research.



II. THE MODEL


A.   Framework

     Theoretical analysis of the individual's allocation o time over the

life cycle has been done by a number of investigators (see Blinder and

Weiss {1976], Heckman 11976] or Ryder, Stafford and Stephan 11975]). In

basic structure the models are quite similar. Each period the individual

divides his time between work, leisure and training (either at school or

on—the-job). Earnings capacity in a given period depends on past training,

i.e., the stock of human capital. Saving and borrowing can be done freely,

subject to the constraint that there be no outstanding debts at the end of

the life. All parameters of the model are known with certainty,2 and



     2Problems which arise as a consequence of stochastic returns to human
capital are treated by Levhari and Weiss 11974] and Eaton and Rosen 119801.
                                          —3—


conditional on their values, the individual maximizes           a   utility function

which depends upon vectors of leisure, consumption, and possibly bequests.

     Such models have been quite successful in reproducing the stylized

facts of observed life cycles: early specialization in formal schooling

followed by entry into the labor force, at first in a job with a relative-

ly high proportion of on-the-job training and then, as time goes on, in

jobs involving little human capital investment. On the other hand, the

models cannot purport to be general equilibrium, because the gross rate of

return on capital is set exogenously.

     Conceptually, the incorporation of taxes into the analysis is straight-

forward. Because individuals react to net rather than gross magnitudes, the

imposition of a proportional income tax leads to new effective wage and in-

terest rates and hence to new optimal paths of leisure, consumption, savings
                       3
and human   capital.       In practice, the models are sufficiently complex that

the only way to generate useful comparative dynamics results is by means               of
simulations. (See Driffill [1977].)

     Similarly, the computation of excess burden poses no serious conceptual

problems. Suppose that in the absence of taxation the individual's consump-

tion and leisure vectors are C0           and    ,    respectively.   Then prior to

taxation, lifetime utility is

                                     0      0  0
                                    u    =u(c ,)

where ui) is the utility function. Suppose that the post tax bundles
are C1 and 9l      ,    so   that post tax utility is

                                     1            1
                                    U    =u(c 1 ,Z)

     3The effecisof taxation on human capital accumulationand labor supply
have been studied in a one-period framework by Kesselman [1SV6].
                                               —4—


Excess burden is the diminution in utility in excess of that which would

have occurred had the tax been collected as a lump sum, and can be calcu—

lated by the following procedure:                Ci) Compute utility with the tax im-

posed Cu1)     .       (ii)   Find utility u2 when the same tax revenue as in (i)

is obtained by a lump sum payment. Ciii) Compute the compensating variation

associated with u2 -          u'   ;   i.e.,   calculate the lump sum payment which will
                          2
raise utility to u in the presence of the tax.



B. Functional Forms

    We could flesh out the general framework just discussed with any number

of models. One that is particularly well suited to our present purpose is

that of Blinder and Weiss (B-W) 119761. They postulate that the individual's

maximand   is additively separable over time with a constant discount rate.
The time endowment each        period is one, and time not spent on leisure is de-

voted to work and human capital accumulation h ,                (h =   l-L)   .   A   fraction x
of h is devoted to human capital accumulation. x can be thought of as an
index that rates jobs on. the basis of the proportional growth rate in human
capital that they allow. When x = 0 potential earnings are fully realiz-
                                                     ,



ed; while x =      1    is associated with the maximum rate of growth: "pure

schooling." B—W assume that as x decreases, earnings increase less than

in proportion, because combining training and work on—the—job is not equiv-

alent to dividing one's time between working and attending school. The

    4mis differs slightly from the definition of excess burden used by
Diamond and McFadden [19741, who define it1as the compensating variation
associated with the change from u0                to u minus
                                                   the tax revenues col-
lected along a compensated demand curve. As Diamond and McFadden as well
as a number of others have pointed out, the notion of excess burden is
consistent with a number of possible conceptual experiments. Our is
quite suitable for the purpose at hand. See Auerbach and Rosen [1980].
                                          —5—


 effective fraction of time spent on earning is therefore a function

 g(x) ,    which B-W argue is likely to be characterized by g"(x) < 0

 (p.453.)
        The next important component of the model is the human capital

 production function. The individual's stock of human capital, K(t)

 is equivalent to his potential earnings. B-W assume that the percent-

 age growth rate in K is proportional to the amount of time devoted

 to human capital accumulation, hx ,             less    a constant depreciation

 rate, S


 (1)                        K(t) =       K(t)   (ahx —   tS)



where the constant a is the rate of return to "education."                            This

equation is based upon the assumption that the human capital production

function is homogeneous of degree one in K (Blinder and Weiss 11976,

p.     455].)
                             5
        The remaining equation in the B-W model is simply an accounting

identity which relates saving (A) to the stock of physical assets (A)

consumption:

       In order to make the Blinder-weiss model operational                for our simula-

tions, first we must postulate specific functioral. forms for the lifetime

utility function, and for g(x)       ,    the   effective fraction of time spent on earning.


    5There are also a number of non-negativity constraints which are not
detailed here.

      We   assume that the utility function takes the form

where c(>O) ,     E(>O),   W(<O), B(>0) and p(>O) are parameters, and T

is the length of life. This specification, of course, is far from general:

leisure and consumption are separable, the elasticity of the marginal utility of

consumption is constant, and a constant percentage rate of change of the marginal

utility of leisure is imposed. Unfortunately, allowing for non-separability

would render the problem virtually intractable. Utility function (3) is chosen

because it is tractable and yields interesting results. It is, incidentally,

considerably more general than others that have appeared earlier in this

literature.6 (See, for example, Levhari and Sheshinski [1979], who implicitly

set E=land W=O..)
utility of leisure is imposed. However, this functional form is tractable,

yields interesting results, and is considerably more general than the one

used by Levhari and Sheshinski, who implicitly set E = 1      and W = 0

      For the effective fraction of time spent on earning, we choose a

quadratic functional form:

      6EconometriC testing of whether or not the
                                                 separability assumption is
 correct
                                                            of Blundell and
            is very difficult. For example, the careful study
 Walker (1981) rejects separability, but their specification ignores both
 saving and the role of human capital in determining of the wage.

       Finally, B-W's budget constraint (2) must be modified to allow for
                                                                  7

 principle.     The optimal paths for the variables in the general case are

 described in detail by B—W.

         A possible limitation of our model is its partial equilibrium nature.

    Following Levhari and Sheshinski [1972], Feldstein [1978], Hec]Qnan [1976],

    and many others, we assume that the pre—tax rate of return is invariant

 with respect to changes in the tax system. As King [1980] and Fullerton,

    Shoven and Whalley [1978] have pointed out, it might be more appropriate

    to analyze broad based taxes in a general equilibrium framework. Given, our de-

 sire to concentrat9 upon the human capital and life cycle aspects of the
                                                                     8
 problem, such a course would appear to be computationally infeasible.



       ince all variables in the model are in real terms, we are not able
 to analyze the distortive effects of an unindexed tax system in the presence
 of inflation.

    available to it certain policy instruments in addition to tax rates (e.g.,
    debt policy), then the gross rate of return can be set optimally, indepen—
    dent of tax rates.

C.   Parameter Values

     As noted above, for models of this complexity, the only way to obtain

interesting results on the efficiency effects of taxation is by means of

simulations based on specific parameter values. A number of attempts have

been made to estimate jointly the parameters of human capital models. (See,

e.g., Heckinan 11976] or Rosen 119761 . }   However,   serious econometric prob-

lems arise in the course of estimation, and the results cannot be viewed

with great confidence. Our strategy, therefore, is to piece together a

set of parameter values by appealing to empirical studies in various parts

of the literature. One of the advantages of a simulation methodology is

that the sensitivity of our substantive results to changes in the parameters

can be examined.



     1. The Rate of Thterest.

     The model assumes that the individual can borrow and lend at the s.me

interest rate. Historically, in the U.S. the average of long term real

before tax interest rates has been quite low. Brown 11976] and Feldstein

11973] have suggested a figure of 3 or 4 percent, about the growth rate of

real output. Interest rates inferred from optimal human capital accuinula—

tion models vary widely. Ben—Porath. 11970] found an implied interest rate

of about 20%, while Haley's 11974] estimate was between 5 and 8 percent, We

settle upon a valtie for r of 5%.
                                      -9-

       2. Rate of    Return to Education.

       Estimating   the return to education is   a well-established activity,

and the evidence indicates that the return depends on the level of educa-

tion, assumptions concerning mortality, etc. (See the survey by

Psacharopoulos [1973].) We choose a conservative estimate of 5%. Note,

however, that in the simulations h is scaled so that its "normal" value

is one—half. Therefore, in order for a normal yearts work at school to

increase potential earnings by 5%, the value for a must be set at twice

that, i.e., 0.10.



       3. Depreciation of Human    Capital.
       Several estimates of the hmian capital depreciation rate are avail-

able. Heckman 11976] computed a figure of 3.7% for people with 13—16

years of education and 7% for people with 16 years of school. Haley 11976]

found   rates   in the region of 3—4%, and Mincer's 11974] estimate was

At the same time an individual ages, his human capital may be growin9 in

value due to economy-wide increases in productivity. In our models, 6

reflects   the net effects of depreciation and exogenous increases in prod-

uctivity. We settle upon a value of 6         of   —0.01, which is consistent with

(say) a 4% annual growth in productivity and a 3% reduction in potential

earnings due to aging.




       9
      These estimates are all generated by odels, in which.. gros.s human
capital accumulation is constrained to be positive throughout the lie—
time, and may he biased if there is a phase of pure work" during some-
part of the lifetime.
                                        — 10 —




     4.   Length of Life.

     It is assumed that the beginning of economic life occurs at the end

of compulsory education, and that differences in human capital accumulat—

cci to that point are exogenous to the model. We set T = 55, which might

be interpreted as the horizon of a plan made at age 15 by a person with a

life of 70 years.



     5. Utility Functions.

     The parameter E of equation (11 is the elasticity of the marginal

utility of income. As Maital 11976] has noted, a value of 1.5 crops up

often in the literature, and it is used in many of our simulations. We

choose B , the parameter that iuultiplies leisure in the utility function,

so that it is consistent with econometric results on the supply of labor.

More specifically, we take Kiefer's 11975] estimate of 0.181 for the frac-

tion of a change in nonlabor income spent on leisure, and work backwards

from the first order conditions to find the implied value of B (condition-

al on a value of E =      1.5   ).   This results in a value of B equal to
about 20.0.

     The parameters a and W affect the relative preferences for con-

sumption and leisure, and only their ratio matters. For each. simulation,

we set them so that a period of "pure schooling" of approximately three

years. occurs at the beginning of the individual's life.



     6. Endowments.

     In order to solve the odel two initial conditions are required, en—

doicunents of han   and   physical capital. The human   capital   endowment, K0
                                     — 11   —




is   set at $13,000, implying that if the individual devoted the entire

year to work, he would earn $13,000.      (As noted above, the "normal"

individual   would be working only half time.) The endowment of non-human
capital A , is set at zero.

      7. Productivity of On-The-Job Training
      No direct evidence on the productivity of on-the—job training as re-
flected in the parameter      of equation (2) is available. Therefore,

was chosen by experimenting with alternative values, and setting it with

reference to its effects on the simulated life—cycles. These experiments

showed that the principal effect of changing               was to alter the length

of the period of on-the-job training (OJT) in the model. Following a sug-

gestion by l4incer 119741, we assume that OJT is completed at about age 47,

which is consistent with     =   -0.25.


      8. The Rate of Time Preference.

      Blinder and Weiss show that if p >        r   + 6   an individual will "retire"

at the beginning of his life, if at all, whereas if p <           r+   6   ,   an indi-

vidual may retire at the end of his life. The size of p also affects the

profiles of consumption and leisure over the individual's life. The rate

of growth of consumption is (r-p)/E .       During the schooling phase, hours
of non-leisure rise at a rate h = p/B       and during the working phase of life,

they fall if r + 6 - p > 0    since h = — (r+6—p)/B

      A "stylized fact" of lifetime labor supply is that hours of ion—leisure ac-

tivity (h(t)) at first rise with age, reaching a peak in middle life, and then

fall somewhat. This suggests a value of p in the range 0 < P <                  r   + 6
                                               — 12 —




It seems reasonable too that consumption should rise gently over the life-
cycle, suggesting p <        r   .    Within   this range variations in the value of

p had small effects on the simulations, and a value of p = .01               was used.




III. SIMULATIONS


     With specific functional forms and parameter values in hand, we can

compute the excess burden of any given tax system. The procedure is as
                                 10
follows: Solve the model assuming no taxation, generating the optimal

pre—tax paths of hian capital accumulation, savings, consumption, leisure

and hence (by substituting into equation (3)) a value for lifetime util-

ity. Then solve the model with budget constraint (2') in order to find

post—tax utility u1      .   Next, find the utility level (u2) which results
when the present value of the income tax receipts is extracted from the

individual as a lump sum. Finally, compute the amount by which the non-

human wealth endowment, A , must be increased to raise utility from u1

to u2 .     This   amount is the excess burden of the tax.

     In the process of doing these calculations, a good deal of interest-

ing comparative dynamics information is generated. For the sake of brevity,




    10The solution of the model is obtained by a numerical method. The
solution is defined by differential equations describing the motion of the
state variables (assets A and human capital K ) and two co—state vari-
ables, and the initial conditions and transversality conditions on the
values of those variables. For any given set of initial values, the dif—

these results are not reported here in any depth. The reader is referred
to Driffill 119771 for a thorough discussion. One should note, however,

the interesting result that in this model a proportional income tax in—
                                   11
creases human capital accumulation.   This is due to two mutually rein-

forcing effects. The tax lowers net earnings, and for some values

Qf the parameters, individuals reduce leisure, increasing both

training and working. At the same time, the income tax reduces the effec—
                                                                  12
tive interest rate, which also tends to encourage human investment.     (The

decrease in the interest rate increases the attractiveness of human capital

vis   vis physical capital as a vehicle for carrying consumption into the

future, ceteris paribus.)

      We begin ou.r simulations by examining how excess burden iraries with

the income tax rate and with the behavioral parameters. In the next set,

lifetime excess burdens are computed on the assumption that human capital

accumulation is exogenous. Because this assumption is implicitly made in

most studies of the efficiency of taxation, it is of some interest to see

whether or not it leads to large differences in the estimates. Next, we

       The magnitude of the response depends upon particular parameter values
and stage of the life cycle, but tends to be substantial. Around the neighbor-
hood of t =0 , when B=20 , and E=2.0 , the elasticity of lifetime human
capital wih respect to t      is about -0.09 . In the absence of very much
econometric evidence on th long—run elasticity of human capital with respect
to its rate of return, it is hard to say whether or not this value is realistic
(although Willis and Rosen [1979] have found very large values for the elas-
ticity of the probability of college attendance with respect to its return).
It is likely that a model with capital market constraints would lead to less
responsiveness, but this is beyond the scope of the present paper.

         similar effect is found by Heckman [1976]. Again, the precise re-
sponse depends upon the specific parameters. For most values of B and E used
in this study, the elasticity of lifetime human capital accumulation with
respect to the interest rate is about —3.5

calculate     excess burden on the assumption that leisure is not a choice

variable, which is close to the spirit of the Levhari-Shesh.inski model,

and leads us to the kind of results that might have been obtained if

they had attempted numerical solutions. Finally, we use the model to

compare the efficiency of income and consumption taxes, an exercise of

considerable interest given the current policy debate over the relative

merits of these two tax bases.



1.     Excess Burden of an Income Tax.

       Table I shows how the excess burden of a proportional income tax

depends upon the tax rate (ty)           and the utility function parameters.

Thus, for example, when the tax rate is 0.05, E =          1.5 and B = 15   ,   lifetime
tax revenues are $4,021, and the liftetime excess burden is $646. The following

observations are based upon the table:


       (a)    For a giyen tax   rate, reasonable changes in the   utility func-
tion parameters change the excess burden somewhat, but not wildly. The
figures are quite similar, except for the case of E = 0.5 , and this
value of E is rather far from the t!consensushl value for the elasti—
city   of the marginal    utility of   income.


       (b)       given values of B and E , the        excess burden increases

aproximate1y with. the square of        the tax xate. This result accords with.
intuitions deye1oed in the simple static case for small changes in the
tax   rate.   When the   algebraic express-ion for   the famous "Harberger tri-

angle" is written in elasticity form, it indicates        that excess burden
varies   in direct proportion to. the square of the advalorem tax rate.

       Cc)   As a proportion of tax   collections,   the excess burdens are con—
siderably higher    than those which have been generated in static models.

Analysis of static models has yielded ratios of excess burden to tax rev-

enue under 5%.      (See Harberger 11964, p. 51] or Rosen 11978, p. 512].)

In contrast, Table I indicates a ratio of about 15% for low tax rates, and

about 80% for higher tax rates. This large discrepancy between the static

and   life-cycle   results suggests that ignoring the endogeneity of human

capital may lead to serious underestimates of excess burden.



2.    Excess Burden with Human Capital Fixed.

      In light of point (c) above, it is important to know what the excess

burdens would have been if we had (mistakenly) assumed that human capital

investments are fixed exogenously. We consider the following experiment:

for   a given set of   behavioral parameters, and assuming no taxes, generate

the. optimal lire cycle plan as before. Now impose a proportional income

tax, :but constrain the growth of human capital investment to be exactly

the ame as it was in the pre—tax situation. Taxes, then, can distort the

leisure—income tradeoff daring a given period as well as interteiuporal con—

surnption decisions, but they haye no effect on human capital.

       The outcome of this experiment is shown in Table II. Compared to

Table I, the most striking aspect is the dra.iatic fall in the ratio of ex—

cess burden to tax revenues. The figures. are now n the order of 2 to 3%

for low tax rates, and 10 or 15% or higher tax rates. Thus, as conjectur-

ed aboye, the failure to consider human capital accumulation generates sub-

stantial downward errors in excess burden calculations. Itis also note-

worthy that thi faIlure leads to overestimates of tax revenues.

     The reason for this overestimate is related to the fact, noted above,

that the income tax leads to expansion of human capital. The increase in

human capital delays the individual's earnings and increases the value of

his debts. Both of these effects reduce the present value of tax revenue

relative to what it would have been had human capital been fixed, and they

more than offset the revenue effects of the tax—induced increases in earn-

ings capacity.



3.   Excess Burden with Fixed Labor Supply

     It is often assumed in human capital models that the individual's goal

is income maximization rather than utility maximation. In the next set of

simulations, we investigate the errors that might be induced when the leisure—

income tradeoff is not taken into account. To do so, we first compute the

optimal lifetime plan in the absence of taxation. We then recompute the plan

including taxes, but constraining the values of leisure to their pre—tax

values, although human capital decisions are still endogenous.

     The results are shown in Table III. Compared to Table I, there are

smaller excess burdens, but the differences are not as dramatic as those in

Table II. Failing to consider the distortionary effects of taxes on the

leisure-income choice does not lead to as much of an error as ignoring the

endogeneity of human capital. This perhaps suggests that more effort should

be devoted to estimating the effects of taxes on human capital accumulation,

and less to refining estimates of the elasticity of hours of work with re-

spect to the tax rate.

4.   Income Versus Consumption Taxation

     A major debate in public finance concns the merits of consumption

versus income taxation. An important issue is the relative efficiencies

of the two tax bases.       In order to investigate this matter, we did the

following:     (i) For a given income tax rate, compute lifetime tax revenues

and excess burden as before.      (ii) Find the consumption tax rate (te of

equation (")) that generates the same present value of tax revenues.                (iii)


Compute the excess burden associated with the consumption tax, and examine

its ratio to that of the income tax.

     Before presenting these results, it should be emphasized that although

our utility function (3) is separable in consumption and leisure, it is not

homothetic in leisure. If homotheticity obtained, then a consumption tax

would be more efficient than an income tax, independent of the parameter values

chosen. Given (3), however, it cannot be known a priori which tax is more ef-

ficient.     (See Atkinson and Stiglitz 119761 or Auerbach [19791.)

      The    results are shown in the first three columns of Table IV. Each
 entry gives the ratio of the excess burden of a consumption tax to that of
 an equal yield income     tax, for   each income tax   rate   and set of utility
 function    parameters.   (Thus, for example, if E     = 1.5,    B = 15 , and the

 income tax is 0.05, then the excess burden of a consumption tax is 2.1% of
 the excess burden of an equal yield income tax.) The figures suggest that

 for all parameter values, the consumption tax is considerably more efficient

 than the income tax, and that the relative efficiency is an increasing func-

 tion of the income tax rate.

      Because consumption taxation is often analyzed using models which ig-

 nore human capital, it is of some interest to see how these results would

 have changed if we had assumed exogenous human capital accumulation. The

 outcomes are shown in the last three columns of Table IV. A glance at these

ratios    indicates that although they are still small (generally under 0.10),

they are larger than their counterparts in the first half of the table.

Thus, failure to take human capital into account would bias downwards one's

estimate of the efficiency gains achievable by moving from an income tax to

a consumption tax.

     Of   course, we cannot claim that these simulations have "proven" that            a

consumption tax is more efficient than an income tax.              The   results, after
all, are consequences of the specific functional forms we have chosen. It
is   nevertheless interesting to see this conclusion fall out of a model of

a sort that has achieved widespread acceptance in other contexts.



IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

     Most attempts to analyze the excess burden of taxation have relied on

static models. A few studies have viewed excess burden in a dynamic con-

text but these have ignored the potentially important role of human

capital accumulation. In this paper, we have used simulations to analyze

a more general model which explicitly allows or endogenous human capital

decisions.

      Our results suggest that conventional measures of excess burden seri-

ously understate the true' éfficienOy losses of taxation. This outcome

occurs despite the fact that we impose on the model a rather conservative

yalue forthe. rate of return to education. As stressed above, no claims

to: perfect .9enerãlity can be made because our results are conditional upon

specific functional forms and      parameter      yalues. However, we did attempt

to make. these as t1realistic" .   as   possible. .   Noreover,   previous . attempts have

usedl assumptions considerably more restrictive than our own,
                                   — 23 —




    while   searching for parameter values fo.r the model, we discovered a

surprising scarcity of estimates of the impact of taxes on human capital

accumulation. Our simulation results suggest that there might    be   a
