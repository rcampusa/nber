Introduction
        It is almost invariably taken for granted in theoretical descriptions

of the international price mechanism and in the construction of trade

models that a country's export price for a particular product is identical

to its domestic price. Any impact of foreign or domestic events on prices

is expected to fall identically on the export and the domestic price for a

good.

        In contrast to these conventional assumptions, the few empirical

studies of international prices have shown that there are fairly substantial

and long—lasting divergences between export and domestic price changes for

the same or closely related products) If that evidence is accepted, the

*The basic data collection and construction of price indexes for this paper
were done under several grants to the National Bureau of Eàonomic Research
from the National Science Foundation and extended to recent years under a
contract with the U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Competitive Assess-
ment. The views reported here do not necessarily reflect those of either
agency. Some computer time was provided by the City University of New York
and the general funds of the National Bureau. An earlier paper describing
some of these results, entitled tiExport Prices and the Transmission of
Inflation," was published in The American Economic Review, Papers and
Proceedings, February 1977. The indexes included here are in some cases
revisions or extensions of thosein the earlier article.
      We are indebted to Mary Boger, Daniel Gottlieb, Marianne Rey, and Judy
Rosenzweig for data collection and programming and to Eliot Kalter of the
University of Pennsylvania for the matching of U.S. export and domestic price
data for the latter part of the period.

 mechanisms of response and adjustment to changes in foreign and domestic

 economic conditions and to exchange rate changes become more complex than

 those usually hypothesized.

       If there is specialization or if the law of one price does not hold

 immediately or exactly, two   sets   of relative price changes are usually

 expected from an inflation or a devaluation. One involves country to

 country relative price changes; for example, the prices of a depreciating

 country's exportables relative to those of other countries should decrease.

 The other involves within—country changes in the prices of tradable goods

 (both exportableg and import—type goods) relative to nontraded goods; a

 depreciation, for example, should raise the country's tradable goods prices

relative to prices of nontradab].e goods. The first price change should

involve a gain in a country's price competitiveness and therefore in its

share of world markets; the second should involve a shift in production to

exportables from riontraded goods.

      If there can be divergences between export and domestic prices,

another type of relative price mechanism may be at work: the depreciating

country should find export prices rising relative to domestic prices of the

same goods. Thus any tendency for exports to increase will reflect not only

the reduction in foreign—currency prices of the country's exports, which

makes its products more attractive to foreign buyers, but also the rise in

own—currency prices of its exports relative to domestic prices of the same

goods, which raises margins on export sales and thus makes exporting a more

profitable activity for its own producers. Even for a small country whose

foreign—currency prices of its exports and imports are fixed by world

markets, the relative rise in profit margins on exports may occur if there

is a sufficient degree of separation between home and foreign markets. Thus
                                        —3—

there is a supply side aspect      to   the adjustment, operating through changes

in profit margins on export sales relative to domestic sales, as well as

the more familiar demand effects. That is not to say that there will not

also be changes in the domestic prices of exportables relative to home

goods, and shifts in production in response to such relative price changes.

However, since a producer can shift more easily from domestic to export

sales of a product than from production of home goods to production of

export goods we should expect the changes within commodities between

domestic sales and exports to occur more rapidly.

     What we expect to find, if export and domestic prices of the same

products need not be identical or move identically, is something like the

following sequence of events from inflation in country A relative to

country B:

      1. A's domestic prices rise more than, or sooner than, A's export

             prices of the same products.

      2. Exporters in A, enjoying an increase in profit margins on

             domestic sales relative to exports, tend to shift their sales

             to the home market.

      3. The     rise   in A's domestic and export prices relative to B's prices

             will mean an increase in demand for B's exports of the same

             products and a shift of buyers in A and elsewhere from A's

             products to B's products.

      4. The increase in export demand will raise B's export prices but

             not by as much as the rise in A's prices.

      5. The rise in B's export prices relative to its domestic prices

             of the same goods will induce a shift by B's producers from home

             to foreign markets.
                                 —4--


       6. B's domestic prices will rise, as a result of the decrease in

          supply, but not by as much as B's export prices did.

      A depreciation in country A's exchange rate relative to country B,

arising perhaps from speculative or capital movements, might produce the

following sequence of events:

      1'. A's export prices in A's currency rise relative to domestic

           prices.

      2'. Exporters in A finding export margins higher relative to

           domestic margins shift sales from domestic to export markets.

      3'. The shift to export markets causes an increase in domestic

           prices in A but by less than   the increase   in export prices.

      4'. The decline in A's export prices in foreign currency, relative

           to B's prices, produce a shift of buyers from B to A.

      5'. The fall in demand for B's exports brings about a decline in

           B's export prices, a reduction in export margins relative to

           domestic margins, and a shift from export to domestic sales.

      6'. The rise in domestic supply causes a decline in B's domestic

           price, but not by as much as the decline in B's export price.

      Under a system of floating exchange rates both sequences could dIs-

appear if exchange rate changes immediately and completely offset relative

movements of domestic prices. For exanmie, steps 1' and 3' would cancel

step 1 of the first sequence, step 2' would cancel step 2, step 4' would

cancel step 3, etc. As we point out below, that is not what actually

took place: there were substantial fluctuations in relative dollar prices

as well as in domestic currency prices. While some of the domestic price

movements were offset by exchange rate changes, in other cases the exchange

rate changes themselves produced relative domestic price movements that
                                      —5—

were not present in, or smaller in the indexes based on own—currency

prices. Thus we must consider the possibility of treating exchange rate

changes as an independent variable affecting relative prices.

       Since the evidence is strong that there are divergences between

export and domestic prices, 'e wish to trace through the effects of

foreign price changes and exchange rate changes on export and domestic

prices and see whether a mechanism of the hypothesized type exists. In

this paper we concentrate our attention on price movements, but offer some

evidence that the response of exports to these price divergences is in the

expected direction.


Data

       The origin of this study is in the. data collected for the original

Price Competitiveness study.2 The price indexes published originally for



          2
              Kravis and Lipsey (1971].



U.S., U.K., German, and Japanese international trade in metals and machinery

for 1953, 1957, and 1961—64 were based on a substantial amount of original

price collection and form the foundation for our later work. These indexes

were interpolated for the Intervening years by whatever data were available3

              As described for the German indexes in Kravis and   Lipsey   [1972].

and those for Germany, Japan, and, partly, the United States extrapolated

to 1975 using publicly available data. In addition, the published data

for Germany and Japan have been used to construct indexes outside the

metals and machinery groups originally covered. For these two countries

our indexes cover all manufactured products except foods and fuel through

1974.

        To match the international trade price indexes we constructed

domestic price indexes for the same three countries and the U.K. The

U.S., German, and Japanese domestic price indexes cover all manufactures

for 1953 to 1974, while the U.K. indexes cover all manufactures for

1968—74 and only SITC 67 through 73 before that. For SITC 7, however, the

domestic price indexes for all the countries have been extended through

1975.


        In calculating these indexes we have started with the price data

for individual commodities or the most detailed categories for which

indexes were available from the sources cited in the Appendixes. We

constructed unweighted indexes at the 4—digit SITC level,4 assuming

in effect that all commodities in a 4—digit subgroup were closely

related, and then aggregated these to broader group indexes. Each

4—digit subgroup index was weighted by the particular country's exports

of that subgroup in 1963; this weighting scheme was applied alike in

the aggregation of export price indexes and domestic price indexes and

to the ratios of export to domestic price changes.

Results for U.S. Prices

      Our examination of U.S. export and domestic price behavior is

confined to those subgroups of machinery and transport equipment for

which the BLS has published export price indexes covering the years

since 1964. The most recent BLS release5 includes 61 four— and

five—digit SITC product categories, accounting for 40 per cent of

U.S. exports in 1974, but we are not able to use, in time series analyses,

those commodities for which BLS price collection began only recently.

We were able to extend nine of the BLS series back to 1953 and four

others part of the way back using the Kravis—Lipsey price indexes. In

addition, we have indexes for 1953—64 based on the full set of data

from the Price Competitiveness volume.

are not identical, do not move identically, and sometimes are not even

very highly correlated. However, the correlation is higher for the

United States than for the other three countries for which comparisons

were made, and high enough that each type of price would usually be

significant in an equation for the other type. Since some part of the

correlation between the two sets of prices may represent not an impact

of   one on       the other, but the fact that common factors operate on both,

there    is some advantage in concentrating on the ratio of export to
domestic   prices.

         If, as we hypothesized above, export prices are more sensitive,

and/or more quickly sensitive to foreign economic developments than are

domestic prices, we should find that a rise in foreign prices, other

things    equal, increases the ratio of export to domestic prices. An
increase    in foreign income should have the same effect. Similarly, a

devaluation of the U.S. dollar relative to other        currencies should
produce   a relative rise in U.S. export prices even if foreign prices,

in foreign currency, do not increase.

        The course of the ratio of U.S. export to domestic prices of

machinery and transport equipment (SITC 7) over the period from 1953

through 1975 is described in Chart 1, along with the movement of U.S.

 exchange rates. The rise in U.S. exchange rates until 1969 reflects

 depreciations in other currencies——France in the late 1950's, Canada in

 the early 1960's and the U.K. at the end of the 1960's. 'The fall between

 1969 and 1971 reflects currency appreciations, principally that of the

 Deutschmark.7 After 1971, of course, the depreciation of the dollar is

             The change in the effective exchange rate of the U.S. dollar

   against other major currencies as a group (see Appendix Table D—l)

   during the period of "fixed rates" up to 1971 is not atypical of

   major currencies. The constancy of exchange rates under the Bretton—

   Woods system may easily be exaggerated.



the main constituent of this average exchange rate movement.

      The depreciation of the dollar from the late 1960's to the mid—1970's

(about 17 per cent) was accompanied, or followed, by a substantial upswing

in the rate of U.S. export to domestic prices (amounting to almost 7 per

cent). The earlier long appreciation of the dollar from 1954 to 1968 or

1969, by about 10 per cent, was accompanied by a 2 per cent decline in the
price ratio (or about 5 per cent if the more complete, but less consistent
B Series of   Appendix   Table A—l is used).8 Thus there is some indication

         As can be seen from the columns in Appendix Table A-i
                                                                     showing

  unweighted average and median export/domestic price ratios and the

  series on the diffusion of relative price changes (the per cent of

  increases in tue export/domestic     price ratio among   four—digit sub-

  groups), the   movement of the price ratio for SITC 7 did almost always

   represent      a consensus among the subgroups, with the aggregate price

   ratio rising when more than 50 per cent of the subgroup ratios were

   rising.       There were only three exceptions to this agreement in the
   22   years.



here that the export/domestic price ratio may have been influenced by

exchange rate changes, although the relationship is certainly not close.

        Aside from questions of causation, it is clear that U.S. export

prices in foreign currency did not fall as much in the 1970's or rise

as much in the 1950's and 1960's as one might have inferred from the

movements of domestic prices and the U.S. exchange rate. In other words,

even if U.S. domestic prices were not affected by depreciations or

appreciations of the dollar, 20 to 50 per cent of the effect of apprecia-

tions up to 1968 and almost half of the effect of the later depreciations

on foreign currency prices of U.S. exports was offset, after a few years,

by declines or rises in U.S. export prices relative to domestic prices.

If U.S. domestic prices were decreased by the appreciation and increased

by the depreciation, the offset was even larger.

        The changes in the export/domestic price ratio mean that there

must have been changes in margins on export sales as compared with those

on domestic sales. Producers' margins on export sales must have declined

relative to those on domestic sales for most of the period, particularly

from 1953 to 1957, and 1964 to 1966 or 1968 and then must have risen

substantially after 1972.

        We would expect the U.S. export/domestic price ratio to be

affected not only by exchange rates but also by foreign price movements,

if they are different from those in the United States. The relative
                                      — 12 —




 price   movements are measured in two    ways.   One is the relative rate of

 inflation, which is a comparison of price indexes in each country's own

 currency.       The second is the index of domestic price competitiveness,

 which is the comparison of price indexes translated into a single

 currency. For example, to examine effects on the United States, we

 translate foreign prices into dollars. The measure of domestic price

 competitiveness is intended to reflect domestic rates of inflation and

 cyclicaipressures, plus the effects of changes th exchange rates,

 rather than the ability of each country to sell abroad in competition

 with others. That we measure by a price competitiveness index based on

 international prices.

       If we were not confining our attention in this paper to the price

movements themselves, an obvious extension would be to substitute, for the

inflation      rates, some of the factors that account for the rate of inflation,
such as the growth in the money supply of each country. Except to the
extent that the money supply is itself dependent on the balance of
payments, the use of a money supply variable .'ould avoid the problem that
our "independent" variables, such as foreign prices and exchange rates,
could be thought of as depending to some degree on the home country's prices.
       The movements of the U.K. and German relative inflation rates, in
chart 2, appear to offer a possible explanation for some of the fluctua-
tions in the U.S. export/domestic price ratio up to the early 1960's.9

After   that, the changes in U.S. domestic price competitiveness, particu-

larly relative to Germany, which reflect the sharp exchange rate changes

of the 1970's, seem more closely related to the price ratio (Chart 3).

        Although the timing is not exact, each broad movement in German and

U.K. prices relative to U.S. prices, in their own currencies or translated

into dollars, is matched by a corresponding change in the U.S. export/

domestic price ratio. That is, if we divide the period into phases accord-

ing to relative price movements (Table 1) we find that during each period

of relatively falling German and U.K. prices the export/domestic price

ratio for the United States declined, and during each period of rising

German and U.K. prices the U.S. export/domestic price ratios increased.

The change in Japanese relative prices involved only a long decline through

1971 and then an increase but there was no close match with the U.S. export/

domestic price ratios.

        The swings in the export/domestic price ratio appear fairly small

compared with the changes in domestic price competitiveness. However, if

the effect of these changes on the export/domestic price ratio is mainly

via changes in margins on exports compared to those on domestic sales,

even a small swing in the price ratio could strongly influence the supply

of exports. For example, jf the margin on both domestic and export sales

was initially 5 per cent1° and the export price then rose by one per cent

               For the U.S. domestic corporations roughly approximating SITC 7

   the ratio of net income before tax to sales was about 4 per cent in

   1970. After tax income was less than 2 per cent of sales (Statistics

  of Income, 1970: Corporate Income Tax Returns, p. 18, Industries 25

   through 28).

 relative   to the domestic price, the margin on export sales would become

 20 per cent higher than that on domestic sales, giving a strong inducement

 to producers to shift from domestic to export markets.

         The effect of any inducement to U.S. producers to shift to export

 markets should be evident in the ratio of exports to domestic shipments.

 As can be seen in Chart 4, there were comparatively small swings in this

 ratio before the early l970's, but the sharp rise in the export/domestic

price ratio after 1972 was accompanied by a similarly sharp increase in
 the   ratio of export to domestic sales. Thus the record of these last
years conforms to the hypothesis of a high elasticity of response, on the
supply   side, to a change in margins on export relative to domestic sales,

although it presumably also reflects the effects of relative changes in

demand, which could produce a similar relationship.

        One problem of the analysis of price and exchange rate changes is

clear from a comparison of Charts 1 and 3. That is that the major swings

in German, and later British prices, expressed in dollars, took place in

the years after 1969, at the same time as the major changes in the exchange

rate of the dollar, and it will therefore be difficult to distinguish

statistically between the two variables. tn fact the depreciation of the

dollar relative to the DM was a significant part of the change in the U.S.

exchange rate vis—a—vis all countries after 1969, plotted in Chart 1.

        The effects of exchange rate changes can be seen in a comparison

between the two parts of Appendix Table A—4, summarized in Table 2.    Over

the period as a whole, exchange rate changes for the U.K. and Japan tended

to offset relative price changes, almost completely for the U.K. and

partially for Japan. However, in the case of Germany, the rise in the

exchange rate, while it was in the direction opposite to that of price

movements, went so far in the other direction as to produce a large change

in domestic price competitiveness. In the flexible exchange rate period

taken by itself two out of the three exchange rate movements produced

changes in domestic price competitiveness instead of simply offsetting

changes brought about by differences in rates of inflation. In the case

of Germany, the rise in value of the DI resulted in a large increase in

U.S. price competitiveness, in a period when the U.S. and Germany had

almost identical rates of inflation. A relative fall in Japanese own—

currency prices was reversed and turned into a relative rise in Japanese

prices in dollars.

         We   are thus led to suspect that changes in exchange rates play
 some partially independent role and are not simply offsets to differences
in inflation rates. For that reason we treat them separately in analyzing
movements in prices and in the export/domestic price ratio.
      Since we are looking here for measures of pressure on each country's
domestic economy we also experimented with non—price measures of business
cycle conditions. They proved significant only for Japan, however, and
we therefore reserve discussion of them to the section on factors influ-

encing Japanese     prices.
      Any analysis of one variable at a time is subject to the difficulty
that several, variables are likely to be acting simultaneously on prices.
We have therefore explored several combinations of variables with a few
multiple regressions in which we attempt to explain the movements of
export and domestic prices and the export/domestic price ratio by changes
in some of the obvious variables.
                                   In particular we wish to consider the
effects of foreign relative inflation rates, U.S. exchange rates, and the
combination of the two: U.S. domestic price competitiveness relative to
each country. We have somewhat biased the results against
                                                               our hypotheses
by taking one country at a time relative to the United States, when
presumably all have some influence. We were not able to include more
than one foreign country in an equation because we quickly ran short on
degrees of freedom.
      Looking first at the movement of the U.S. export/domestic price
ratio we examine the influence of
                                  relative inflation rates and exchange
rates separately in the first six equations of Table 3 and     then their
combined influence as the domestic price competitiveness variable     in
the   next four equations)''


         11
              The exchange rate variable in the equations is the change in

  price of foreign currency, rather than the change in price of the

  dollar,as in Chart 1. Thus the effect of a U.S. devaluation in the
  equations is in the same direction as that of a rise in foreign prices.

        For Germany it is changes in the exchange rate (the price of the
DM) which affect the U.S. export/domestic price ratio, with a one—year

lag. In the case of the U.K., the only significant influence on the

U.S. price ratio is the        expected   positive one of relative inflation rates

in the same year. For Japan there is some indication of both price and

exchange rate influences with a one—year lag in equation 5 while the

exchange rate with a two—year lag is the significant variable once it

is entered.

        When we combine exchange rates and           relative   inflation rates for

Germany and Japan the results are quite consistent in showing a signif i—
                                                                              with a
cant impact of changes in domestic price competitiveness acting

one—year lag. Equations 8 through 11 mostly explain less of the varia-

bility in the U.S. export/domestic price ratio than equations 3 through

6, but they are also less affected by serial correlation.                In the British


case,   however,    little relation to U.S. price ratios is visible, perhaps

because there was little overall change in domestic price competitiveness.

         On the whole, then, the evidence suggests that the U.S. price ratio

 is influenced in the expected direction by foreign price and exchan,e rate

 changes, mostly with a lag of about a year.              The   German influence   was


           through exchange     rate changes, not surprisingly because U.S. price
 mostly

 competitiveness      relative to Germany was dominated by exchange rates;
 relative    inflation rates were similar.

          In Tables 4 through 6 we break down the effects of foreign               prices
 and exchange     rates on the U.S. export/domestic price ratio into the

 separate influences on U.S. export and domestic prices. The analysis is

 crude in several respects. In particular, of the many domestic influences

 on prices we have       selected only one, unit labor costs, as a way of
                                   — 24 —




 summarizing the effects of any domestic monetary and fiscal developments

 as well as those of changes in labor productivity. Unfortunately, the

 unit labor cost variable applies to manufacturing as a whole rather than

 to machinery and transport equipment. Thus the variable is only really

 appropriate in the equations for all manufacturing.

      The equations for German price and exchange rate influences on U.S.

prices (Table 4) consist of three sets: four equations for an aggregate

of those subgroups of SITC 7 for which both export and domestic prices

are available, two equations for domestic prices of SITC 7 as a whole,

including those commodities for which we have no export price data, and

two equations for all manufactured products, SITC 5 through 8.    They sug-

gest some lagged effects of German prices, at least in the machinery and

transport equipment area, and lagged effects of exchange rate changes on

U.S. domestic prices of manufactures as a whole. As we expect from the

results for the export/domestic price ratio, the rate of inflation in

Germany did not affect U.S. export and domestic prices very
                                                              differently,

although there were significant lagged effects on both of them. The

exchange rate coefficients are unexpectedly negative for the current year,

but again of roughly the same size for U.S. export and domestic prices.

They are also of about the same size as, but opposite in sign to, the

price coefficients, and most of the current year impact therefore washes

out in the equations in which German nrices in dollars are used. In the

case of the exchange rate lagged one year, however, the coefficient for

export prices was positive while that for domestic prices was negative,

although neither was statistically significant. It is this difference

in sign that produces the lagged relationship of foreign prices in

dollars   to the export/domestic price ratio. Thus our comparisons of

equations for matched sets of export and domestic prices indicate that

German own—currency prices or rates of inflation affect both U.S. exoort

and U.S. domestic prices by a year later. German prices in dollars

significantly affect only U.S. export prices, also after a year.

      The equations for SITC 7 as a whole can only be calculated for

domestic prices but they suggest results fairly similar to those for the

subgroups: a lagged foreign inflation or foreign currency price effect

and a perverse current exchange rate effect. The equations for all manu-

facturing, SITC 5—8, indicate a strong lagged positive effect of exchange

rate changes, more than offsetting the unexpected current year negative

coefficient, and a corresponding strong effect for German domestic prices

in dollars, also lagged one year. For all manufacturing then, the equa-

tions suggest that 10—15 per cent of the effect of, say, a rise in German

domestic prices or exchange rates is offset, after a year, by a corre-

sponding rise in U.S. domestic prices, apart from any additional offsetting

that would occur from a rise in the U.S. export/domestic price ratio, such

as we found for machinery.

      British prices (Table 5) also showed a larger impact on U.S. export

prices than on domestic prices over two years, as we would expect. The

impact on export prices was in the current year, as was that on the U.S.

export/domestic price ratio, while that on U.S. domestic prices showed

some tendency to be delayed until the next year. There was no visible

effect of exchange rates and that of U.K. prices measured in dollars was

only marginally significant, although the coefficients were substantial.

We can observe a similar, but even stronger relation of current British

 inflation   to U.S. domestic prices in the equation for all manufactured

 products. Again there is little or no effect of exchange rates or of

 British prices measured in dollars.

       Japanese prices appear to have a somewhat larger impact on U.S.

 export prices than on U.S. domestic prices (Table 6). No exchange rate

 effects are visible, but the combination of inflation rates with exchange

 rates in the dollar price equations produces some very different results

from those in the equations in which the variables are separated. In

the latter case (own—currency prices) there seem to be positive current

and lagged price effects, but in the former case (dollar prices) the

current year coefficients are generally negative, and all the expected

positive price effect is concentrated in the second year. We tend to

discount the equations in yen prices because the coefficients for U.S.

unit labor cost seem suspiciously low. Presumably the current—year

relative inflation effect becomes entangled with the current—year labor

cost effect.


Results    for German   Prices

      For    Germany we are able to extend our study beyond machinery and

transport equipment, which has been the focus of our attention until now,

and to examine the behavior of prices of all
                                                manufactured goods (SITC 5-8)
except foods and fuel. One advantage of the broadness of the German

coverage is that we can more appropriately use variables for total manu-

facturing, such as unit labor cost. These aggregate variables are still

not ideal for our purposes, since the
                                        weighting is generally by the domes-
tic importance of each industry, but they may nevertheless provide some

insights   into price behavior.

     As is true for the United States, there have been substantial move—

merits in the ratio of German export to domestic prices (Chart 5). For all

manufactures the peak ratio, in 1954, was about 8 per cent above the

lowest, in 1972. Between those two years the    change   in this-ratio offset

roughly 20 per cent of the effect of exchange rate changes on German

export prices in foreign currency. The trend of the ratio was down, just

as the trend in exchange rates was up, and the largest decline in the

ratio was from 1960 to 1962, at the time of and after the 1961 revaluation.12



         12
              The fall in the export/domestic price ratio was quite general

   among the classes of German manufactured goods, particularly from 1960

   to 1962.



Contrary to our expectations regarding the effect of exchange rates,

however, the ratio rse from 1972 to 1974 despite large upward revaluations

in those years, and it also fell sharply in 1954—57, when the exchange rate

was stable. Clearly, then, the exchange rate was not the sole influence

on the export/domestic price ratio.

      The decline in the price ratio in 1960—62 was over 3 per cent, while

the upward revaluation of the DM was 5 per cent. Thus more than 60 per

cent of the effect of the revaluation on export prices in foreign currency

(assuming no effect on domestic prices) was offset by the fall in the

export/domestic price ratio. If domestic prices were reduced by the

revaluation, of course, the offset was even greater. In 1970—72 the

offset was much smaller——only 2 per cent against a revaluation of .7 per

cent, or of 16 per cent if we take the change from 1969 to 1972.

In   1972—74 the change in the price ratio reinforced the effect of the

revaluation on German export prices.

        The machinery and transport equipment group, which was the one

analyzed for the United States, is shown separately in Chart 5. Here the

relation of exchange rate changes to the price ratio seems stronger, with

the price ratio declining from 1959 to 1962 and 1967 through 1974 while the

price of German currency was rising in both periods. When the currency

price was relatively stable, in the mid—1950's and the mid—1960's, the price

ratio also had a period of stability. The 1959—62 fall in the price ratio

by almost 4 per cent offset almost three quarters of the upward revaluation

of the DM in 1961 (spread over two years in the annual averages shown on

the chart). In 1967—74 the fall in the price ratio, again over 3 per cent,

offset less than 8 per cent of the large upward revaluation of the DM.

        Of course, the fact that changes in the export/domestic price ratio

do not go far toward offsetting a more than 40 per cent revaluation is

not surprising. Even a 3 per cent change in the export/domestic price

ratio is large relative to typical sales margins in manufacturing, as was

pointed out earlier. The fact that the ratio for Germany could fall as

much as the 7 per cent shown for all manufacturing or the 5 per cent for

machinery and transport equipment suggests that German manufacturers'

margins on exports nay have been greatly inflated by the undervaluation

of the DM in the late 1950's.

        Another possible influence on the German export/domestic price

ratio is, of course, foreign prices, shown in Chart 5•13 The decline in

   by   domestic trade weights, which are different for each country, and

   because they    differ   substantially in coverage.



the German export/domestic price ratio before 1963 and some of the fluctua-

tions after that followed fairly well the movements of relative Japanese

prices. The French relative price level, rising from 1971 through 1974

and the sharp increase in British and Japanese prices a year later may

provide a reason for the increase in the German export/domestic price

ratio after 1972, which seemed to be inexplicable in terms of exchange

rate changes. Thus some of the movements in the export/domestic price

ratio seem to be related to inflation in other countries, as we hypothesized.

        German domestic price competitiveness relative to the other countries

(relative prices in DM), particularly France and Japan, show a closer

relationship with the export domestic price ratio than the own—currency

indexes (Chart 7). They match in the long decline to the earlier 1960's,

the rough stability through that decade, the sharp decline until 1971

(for prices) or 1972 (for the price ratio), and then the rise after that

date. Thus there is some      suggestion here that the German   export/domestic

price ratio   responds to the combination of relative inflation rates and

exchange rates represented by these measures of domestic price competitive-

ness.

        Since we think of the relative inflation rates as indicators of

pressure on domestic economies, we experimented also with measures of

business cycle    conditions. We found these less satisfactory than the
relative price measures, however, in explaining changes in the German
export/domestic   price ratio.
      Fluctuations in the German export/domestic price ratio for all

manufacturing seem to be related to those in the share of German production

of manufactured goods that is exported. The trends are very different, but

the deviations from trend show similar broad movements, although sometimes

with different timing. On the whole, when the export/domestic once ratio

was above its trend, the export/domestic shipments ratio also tended to be

above its trend, and the years when both were below their trends also

tended to coincide (Chart 8). Aside from 1955—57 and 1968—70, there was

also a rough matching between the broad movements in the two series relative

to their trends, although not between year—to—year fluctuations. Taking

deviations from straight line trends for both series we find a relationship

between them as follows:


            X/O =   .00 ÷ 1.09                           = .24    DW =    1.04

                    (.00)   (2.70)


where X/O is the deviation from trend of the ratio of manufactured exports

to output of manufactures and        is the deviation from trend of the

export/domestic price ratio.

      We attempt to explain the fluctuations of the German exoort/domestic

price ratio for all manufactures by exchange rates and foreign prices in

the equations listed in Table 7, although the charts did not suggest much,

if any, relation to exchange rates. On the whole, the explanatory power

of the equations is poor. The exchange rates are never statistically

significant, as Chart 5 suggested. If there is any effect, it is with a

lag of one year. French prices, the only ones that were significant, had

their impact in the current year, although there is some indication in

the case of Japanese prices of a delayed effect on the German price ratio.

      The combined effect of relative inflation and exchange rates, as

German price competitiveness, was again weak. As was true for the U.S.

export/domestic price ratio, there is some hint of a delayed impact of

foreign relative prices, but only the coefficient for Japanese prices

is close to significance at the 5 per cent level.

      The results for tne machinery and equipment group are a little

stronger (Table 3). Here there are significant exchange rate coefficients

for the U.S. and the U.K.,.with a lag of one year, and several significant

or almost significant price coefficients, current for the U.S. and the

U.K. and lagged for Japan. When we combine the price and exchange rate

effects, the explanatory power of the equations is weaker for the most

part, but there is a bit of a consensus that these domestic price

conpetitiveness effects take a year to work through.

      On the whole, then, we have not been able to explain much of the

variation in the German export/domestic price ratio, but what influence

foreign prices and exchange rates had seemed to operate largely with a

lag of one year.

      The   separate   equations for German export and domestic prices of all

manufactures (Table 9) confirm some of our expectations about the mechan-

ism of transmission. In every case German domestic prices are more

strongly influenced by domestic costs, in the form of unit labor cost,

than are export prices. Foreign own—currency prices apear to have a

strong current year impact on both domestic and export prices but in

every case the impact on export prices is larger, as hypothesized

earlier. French and Japanese prices appear to have also a lagged impact

on German prices, even larger than the current year effect in the case

of France, and again the coefficients are larger for export prices than

for   domestic prices. The lagged effect of U.S. prices in dollars, on the

other hand, is negative, partly reversing the current year impact.

However, the net result of the two years is still much more strongly

positive on export prices than on domestic prices.

       There are fewer significant coefficients for exchange rates, and

only those for France match our expectations, all being positive and at

least slightly larger for export prices than for domestic prices. The

exchange rate coefficients for the United States and Japan are all nega-

tive, although only three of the eight are statistically significant.

They suggest, paradoxically, that a rise in the price of the dollar or

the yen, and thus of U.S. or Japanese exports, tends to reduce German

export and domestic prices. 1ore likely the results reflect our diffi-

culty in distinguishing the effects of foreign price movements from those

of exchange rates.

       The equations using German domestic price competitiveness as the

price variable mostly support our expectations but contain a few puzzles.

As expected, German unit labor costs influence domestic prices more than

they do export prices and foreign prices affect German exort prices more

than they do German domestic prices. However, the lagged effect of U.S.

and U.K. prices on German prices is negative and larger than the current

effect, a relationship that is difficult to explain. All the equations

for U.S. and U.K. prices show substantial serial correlation. The equa—

tions that do not, for Japan and France, also do not have the paradoxical

negative price coefficients, and suggest that these countries' prices

influence German prices both currently and with a one—year lag.

         The equations for SITC 7   in Table   10 are of interest partly because

they    cover the same range of products as the U.S. equations. They suffer
from the same drawback as the U.S. equations, in        the fact that the unit

labor    cost variable is not really applicable to the particular commodity
group. On the whole, however, the results conform to those of Table 9,
with German unit labor costs affecting domestic nrjces more than export
prices   and some strong Japanese price impacts on German     prices, particu-
larly    export prices (no data are available for French prices). The

relationships of exchange rates to German prices, especially German

domestic prices, are comparatively weak and often perverse.

Results for Japanese Prices

        The range of the Japanese export/domestic price ratio f or all

manufactures was 11 per cent: the greatest among the three countries.

Although there were substantial year—to—year fluctuations in the price

ratio there was   a   clear downward trend through the whole period, and on

the whole an upward trend in the effective exchange rate (Chart 9). The

rise in the exchange rate through the 1950's and 1960's was gradual and

could not account for the sharp fluctuations in price ratios. However,

the jump of over 20 per cent in the exchange rate from 1970 to 1973 and

the following fall were mirrored by a decline of more than 5 per cent in

the export/domestic price ratio and then a rise after 1973, as we would

expect. Thus the major changes in the exchange rate did aprear to

influence the price ratio.

        Of the roughly 30 per cent rise in the exchange rate from 1953 to

the   peak in 1973 almost a   quarter was offset by the reduction in the

price   ratio. The degree of offsetting was substantial even in the wide

swings in the exchange rate that took place between 1970 and 1974. A
quarter of the 1970—73 increase in the price of the yen and about half

of the drop in 1974 were offset by changes in the export/domestic price

ratio.

         Changes in relative foreign prices do not appear to have been

related at all to the fluctuations in the Japanese export/domestic price

ratio, as can be seen from the data in Appendix C. The price ratio fell

substantially over the period as a whole while relative foreign prices

rose relative to Japanese prices——the opposite to what we would expect

if   foreign   prices were influencing the ratio. The same was true of the

shorter   fluctuations:    they were unrelated to or even in the opposite
direction from foreign price changes instead of the same direction, as
would seem logical. Thus we cannot expect to explain the export/domestic

price ratio well by either exchange rate or relative price variables,

except for the apparent relation of exchange rates to price ratios after

1971.

        We are thus left, as far as these variables are concerned, without

any explanation for the wide fluctuations in the Japanese export/domestic

price ratio between 1953 and 1971.

        Given the timing of the swings in the price ratio one might guess

that they were related to cyclical fluctuations in countries to which

Japan exports. For U.S. and German prices we found that direct measures

of cyclical conditions did not add substantially to the explanation of

the price ratio. We can test the same possibility for Japan by comparing

the price ratio to a measure of foreign cyclical conditions, as in
                                       — 52   —




Chart             The fluctuations do seem related, with almost every swing



           14
                The measure of cyclical fluctuations in Chart 10 is a

     composite of deflated, detrended leading indicators for six

     countries: France, Germany, Italy, the U.K., Canada, and Japan.

     It would have been preferable, of course, to use an index which

     excluded Japan.



in   tne cyclical index matched by a corresponding change in the Japanese
price ratio, at least through 1971. The implication of the chart is
that in the rising phase of foreign business cycles Japanese export
prices rise relative to domestic     prices while in the downward phase

Japanese   export prices tend to fall relatively. While export     prices

thus responded to foreign cyclical conditions they also acted as something

of a buffer between foreign economies and the domestic Japanese economy.

        The equations relating the Japanese exDort/domestic rrice ratio

for all manufactures to relative foreign prices and exchange rates are

listed in Table 11. As was suggested by a look at the data themselves,

these two variables explain comparatively little of the variation in the

price ratio.       Iany of the price coefficients and several of the exchange

ficient is that for the dollar/yen rate, an outcome that is not

surprising in view of the large importance of the U.S. market for Japanese

exports and the movements of the price ratio and exchange rates in 1970—74.

 coefficients,   and all that are close to statistical significance, are

positive, although negative signs prevail among   the   lagged price coef-

ficients. That is not an unreasonable result, as long as the negative

coefficients do not exceed the positive ones, since it could imply a

return to an earlier relationship between export and domestic prices

after the initial disturbance arising from foreign developments.     However,

these equations are too crude to establish a sequence of this sort. None

of the lagged foreign price coefficients are statistically significant.

      When we examine the separate effects on the export and domestic

price indexes for all manufactures in Table 13 we find the equations

again unsatisfactory, although they do show large price effects and the

variables included account for a large part of the variation in export

and domestic prices. With only a few exceptions the coefficients for

unit labor Costs are negative in the equations based on relative rates

of inflation and none of them are statistically significant.
                                                                 Probably
because the unit labor cost variable works so poorly the coefficients of

the current year foreign price variables are exaggerated. The lagged

foreign price and exchange rate variables are mostly negative, however.

      The equations based on Japanese domestic price competitivenesg are

not quite as outlandish, some containing reasonable coefficients for unit

labor cost and positive coefficients on current price.     However, there

are again very large negative coefficients on lagged foreign price and

some serious problems of serial correlation.

      The equations for machinery and transport equipment that use

Japanese domestic price competitiveness as the foreign price variable fit

our expectations a little better than those for all manufactured products

(Table 14). The coefficients on unit labor cost are positive and most

are statistically significant, and the same is true, as we expect, of

the current foreign price coefficients. Among the price coefficients

that are statistically significant, those for export prices are larger

than those for domestic prices, as we expect. All the lagged foreign

price coefficients are negative, indicating a reversal of the effect of

foreign prices after a year, and the reversals are larger for domestic

than for export prices.

      On the whole, the variables that served to explain U.S. and

German prices to some extent give more erratic results in explaining

Japanese prices. In the few equations that do seem reasonable——those for

SITC 7 based on price competitiveness——the net effect of foreign price

changes is mostly erased after a year.

      Since the earlier look at the fluctuations in the export/domestic

price ratio suggested that foreign cyclical fluctuations may have had a

substantial influence, we experimented with a few equations relating the

price ratio to indexes of U.S. and other major countries' business cycle

conditions. The cyclical indicators by themselves did not explain move-

ments in the   price ratio at all, as we could   have expected from the contrary
fluctuations during the period after 1971. However, when the cyclical
variables were combined with Japanese effective exchange rates, the results
were quite good. The cyclical indicator indexes had positive coefficients,

showing that a foreign expansion raises Japanese. export prices relative

to domestic prices while a foreign contraction leads to a relative reduc-

tion in Japanese export prices. The positive coefficient on current

exchange rate changes indicates that a rise in the price of foreign

exchange increases Japanese export prices relative to domestic price

and a decline reduces the Japanese export price ratio, as we expect. The

exchange rate effect seems to be partly offset a year later, but most of

it remains even after two years, judging by other equations not shown

here.

        The success of foreign cyclical fluctuations in explaining the

export/domestic price ratio suggests that the same variable might influence

the ratio of exports to manufacturing production. Chart 11 indicates that

there may have been such a connection, at least through the mid—l960's,

although it is not close. The peaks in the U.S. leading indicators in

1955, 1959, and 1966 all had counterparts in the Japanese series, although

the   troughs did not match as well.
        There were   two swings in the Japanese price ratio in the earlier

years but they seemed to lag a year or two behind the movements of the

shipments ratio. Thus it does not seem reasonable to suggest that the

movements of the export/shipments ratio were mainly responses on the supply

side to shifts in the profitability of export as compared with domestic

markets. It seems more likely, from the behavior of both the price ratio

and the shipments ratio, that these short—term fluctuations largely

ef1ected influences on the demand side, which Japanese exports responded

to more actively than did U.S. and German exporters.

Summary

1. Export price movements differ from those of domestic prices for

    substantial periods.

          In all three countries, the United States, Germany, and Japan,

    the divergences between export and domestic price changes were substan-

    tial, and some were long—lasting. The range of the U.S. ratio for

   machinery and transport equipment (SITC 7) was 7 percentage points,

    that of the German and Japanese ratios for all manufactured products

    (SITC 5—8) almost 8 points and 11 points. For each country there

   were periods of comparative stability, when the ratio moved within a

    range of three percentage points or so, but even that range allows

    for large changes in relative margins between export and domestic

   sales. The major changes in the export/domestic price ratio were,

    in the United States, a rise after 1972, in Germany, a decline until

    1963, and in Japan, two cycles, a rise from 1953—56 followed by an

    equal decline and a fall from 1969 to 1973, followed by a rise.

   Over the whole period the U.S. ratio for SITC 7 rose by between 1 1/2

    and 4 1/2 per cent, depending on the series used as a measure. The

   German ratio fell by 6 per cent, and the Japanese ratio fell by

    4 per cent. The long—term changes are compatible with an interpreta-

    tion that the DM and the yen were undervalued at the beginning of

    the period, in the 1950's, and the dollar was overvalued, and that

    the realignment of currencies has reduced or eliminated, or even

    reversed these disparities.

2.   Changes in export/domestic price ratios offset, to some degree,

     changes in exchange rates and in relative domestic prices.

           If a country's export prices rise relative to its domestic

     prices when foreign inflation is more rapid than home inflation, or

     if they rise when the country devalues its currency, some of the

     competitive advantage that might otherwise be expected will be lost.

     On the other hand, if the price ratio falls in a rapidly inflating

     country or in a country revaluing its exchange rate upward, the

     decline in price competitiveness will be less than expected. These

     effects are in addition to any impact of exchange rate changes or

     foreign inflation on a country's domestic prices in general, or

     domestic prices of tradable goods, which are more frequently con-

     sidered.

           In the case of U.S. exports of machinery and transport equip-

     ment, 20 to 50 per cent of the appreciation of the dollar through

     1968 and almost half of the depreciation after that was offset by

     first a decline and later a sharp rise in the   export/domestic   price

     ratio. Of the effects of major swings in the German rate of inflation

     relative to the U.S., apart from the effects of currency changes,

     between 10 and over 50 per cent were offset, with the larger propor-

     tions associated with the smaller differences in relative inflation.

     The offsets to relative U.K. inflation ranged between a quarter and

     a third.

           For Germany, the fall in export/domestic price ratios for all

     manufactures was notable in the degree to which it offset the 1961

     revaluation of the DM——the offset being about 60 per cent. In 1969
                                    — 67 —



to   1972 the offset was   only   16 per cent and after that   the changes
in the ratio reinforced the effects of revaluation instead of

offsetting them. The large decline in German price ratios from 1954

to 1963 reinforced the German gains from slower inflation than the

U.S., the U.K. and France, and offset almost 50 per cent of the rela-

tive decline in Japanese prices.

       The Japanese effective exchange rate rose only gradually from

1953 through the late 1960's and most of that rise was offset by a

decline it export/domestic price ratios. From 1970 to 1973, a large

jump in the exchange rate was about 1/4 offset by a very sharp decline

in price ratios and the fall in the exchange rate in 1974 was offset

by about half. With respect to relative prices, however, the movement

of the export/domestic price ratio did very little offsetting. The

large gains in price competitiveness indicated by the domestic price

indexes were enlarged by the change in export/domestic price ratios.

In other words, the gains in Japanese price competitiveness were

substantially larger measured from export prices than from domestic

prices.

       It    is clear, then, that changes in the relationship between
export and domestic prices of the same commodities must be taken into
account     in estimating the effects of differences in inflation rates

or of changes in exchange rates. On the whole, the changes in the

price ratio have tended to offset exchange rate movements and have

sometimes offset and sometimes added to effects of differences in

rates of Inflation.

3.   Export/domestic price ratios responded to foreign prices and exchange

     rates.

              Although we are not able to explain all the fluctuations in

     export/domestic price ratios in each country we did find evidence

     that   they responded to the two variables we hypothesized should
     affect them; relative rates of inflation in other countries compared
     to   that of the home country, and changes in the rate of exchange.

     Thus we have evidence that the fluctuations in the ratio are not

     simply the result of chance or of defects in measurement.

              We have separated the relative foreign price in own currency

     and the exchange rate on the possibility that they could have differ-

     ent effects. One reason might be that sellers would consider relative

     price changes less ephemeral than exchange rate fluctuations, or that

     the effect of exchange rates would depend on the currency in which

     prices are quoted or goods are invoiced. If the response is identical

     and foreign relative price and exchange rate changes are independent

     of each other we should find positive and equal coefficients or the

     two variables. If the price and exchange rate changes tend to offset

     each other, however, we will have difficulty senarating their effects

     and we may find perverse coefficients as a result. In such a case,

     the variable which combines price and exchange rate effects, the

     relative price in home country currency, may be the only one we can

     relate to the export/domes tic price ratio.

              The U.S. price ratio, we found, was affected in the same year by

     changes in British prices and a year or more later by changes in

     German and Japanese exchange rates, and perhaps by Japanese prices as
                               — 69 —



well.    When we put price and exchange rate effects together by

measuring prices in dollars there was generally a one—year lag in

the effect.

        Changes in the German price ratio were less well explained

by the two variables but there was some evidence of current year

effects of U.S., British and French prices and lagged effects of

Japanese prices. Exchange rate influences were slight, and they were

mostly lagged effects.

        Almost all the measured price and exchange rate effects for

the United States and Germany were in the directions we originally

hypothesized. A currency devaluation would raise the export/domestic

price ratio and a more rapid rate of inflation than those of trading

partners would tend to reduce it. Thus the first steps in the rela-

tive inflation and currency revaluation sequences described in the

Introduction are confirmed by the U.S. and German data. The

Japanese price ratios were least well explained and as many coef-

ficients contradicted our hypotheses as confirmed them, particularly

coefficients for foreign prices. The Japanese price ratio we found,

at least before the major exchange rate changes, responded mainly to

U.S. and European business cycle developments. The ratio rose in

times of foreign prosperity and declined in times of foreign reces-

sion, a relationship we did not find for the U.S. or German price

ratios. Thus while the U.S. and German price ratios responded to

foreign price developments, the Japanese ratio seemed to respond

to cyclical, probably income developments in other countries.

        Once we took account of the foreign cyclical influence on the

Japanese price ratio, changes in exchange rates produced the
                                 — 70 —



    expected effects, with the yen's upward revaluation lowering the
   ratio and the yen depreciation raising it. The Japanese results

    therefore also confirm the first step in the currency revaluation

   sequence.

4. Both export and domestic prices responded to changes in foreign

   prices and exchange rates, but the export price response was greater.

         The coefficient for German price effects on U.S. domestic prices

   are mostly in the range of ten per cent to over one third, with a one—

   year lag, suggesting that over 10 per cent and probably more of a

   change in German domestic prices is transmitted to U.S. domestic

   prices by a year later. However, there are some offsetting negative

   exchange rate coefficients which suggest that   we are   mixing up price

   and exchange rate effects. When we combine the two and examine changes

   in German domestic price competitiveness in dollars we find an effect

   of almost 25 per cent on U.S. export prices but only about half that,

   and not statistically significant, on U.S. domestic prices after a

   year. Combining the current and lagged effects, mostly not signif i—

   cant, cuts both estimates in half.

         U.K. relative inflation effects are large, more in the current

   year than in the following year, and twice as high for U.S. export

   as for U.S. domestic prices, where we can make the comparison.

   However, the effects are much reduced and not statistically signifi-

   cant, although still large, when we take U.K. relative prices in

   dollars. Some of the equations suggest the following pattern. The

   current year effect of British prices is stronger on U.S. export

   prices than on U.S. domestic prices. However, a year later, the
                                  — 71 —



 the   effect on   export prices is small, though still positive, while

the U.K. price effect on U.S. domestic prices is larger than in the

first year. By the end of the second year U.S. domestic prices have

almost caught up with export prices. It is this catching up in the

second year that accounts for the negative lagged coefficients in
the equations for the U.S. export/domestic price ratio.
        Japanese prices in yen are shown to have very large impacts on
U.S. prices, in the current year and a year later, to an extent it          is

hard   to believe. Probably the excessively high estimated effects for

Japanese prices are related to the low coefficients for U.S. unit

labor costs In these equations. Where the comparison can be made, we

find that foreign price and exchange rate effects are greater on U.S.

export prices than on domestic prices.

        The response to Japanese prices in dollars   Is   also large, but

tends to be pushed into the next year, with some coefficients for the

first year price change unexpectedly negative. The combination of

current and lagged coefficients of Japanese prices in dollars ranges

around 10—20 per cent, still surprisingly high.

        The German data, which are by far the most complete, give the

clearest and most reasonable results. Foreign prices strongly affect

German export and domestic prices but always the export prices more

than the domestic prices. The same greater effect on export prices

is evident if we net out some negative exchange rate or lagged price

coefficients. As a corollary to the stronger foreign price impact

on German export prices, unit labor cost in every case has a stronger

impact on domestic prices than on export prices. The price effects on
                                — 72 —




   Germany are mostly in the current year, except for French and

   Japanese prices, the latter somewhat suspect because there are

   substantial negative exchange rate coefficients offsetting the lagged

   price effects.

        The foreign effects on Japanese prices estimated by the equa-

   tions are too large to be believable, all being close to or even

   above one. The unit labor cost coefficients, on the other hand, are

   extremely low, suggesting that the unit labor cost effects have been

   confounded with the price effects.

         On the whole, there is strong evidence for Germany and the

   United States and some less clear evidence for Japan that foreign

   price changes influence both domestic and export prices within each

   country. Furthermore, at least for Germany, there is a clear pattern

   in which foreign prices have a larger impact on German export prices

    than on German domestic prices, as we hypothesized earlier.

5. Changes in the export/domestic price ratio are associated with shifts

   between exporting and selling at home.

         Another test of the significance of the export/domestic price

   ratio, aside from its relation to foreign prices and exchange rates,

    is whether it is related to the share of exports in total production.

   We hypothesized earlier that a rise in the export/domestic price

   ratio should lead to a shift by producers from domestic to export

   markets, or, in other words, a rise in the ratio of exports to

   production, and a finding that it did would confirm the genuineness

   and importance of the movements in the export/domestic price ratio.

          In the United States, the export/domestic price ratio for

   machinery and transport equipment changes little before the 1970's
                                  — 73 —



    but   the sharp rise after 1972 was accompanied by a substantial shift

    to export markets. In Germany, there were large and unrelated

    trends in the two ratios but deviations from these trends seemed to

    have the expected relationship. That is, when the export/domestic

    price ratio was high relative to its trend, the export/domestic

    shipment ratio also tended to be high. For these two countries,

    therefore, the evidence supports the validity of the measurement

    of the export/domestic price ratio and its role in determining the

    division of sales. However, we could find no such relationship

    in the Japanese data.

     We have not been able to test every link In the sequences of events

resulting from inflation and exchange rate changes that we hypothesized

earlier, and the tests we have made are crude because we are not able to

attempt here a complete explanation of prices and trade. However, the

tests we have been able to run fit well with our expectations in most

cases and rarely contradict them. We thus feel that there is a

substantial case for the existence of differences between export and

domestic prices and for their playing a significant role in the inter-

national adjustment to differences in rates of inflation among trading

countries and to changes in exchange rates.

     We find that commodity markets for manufactured goods are sufficiently

tied together so that a rise in one major country's price level tends to

raise prices in other countries but that the reaction sometimes takes

a year or even more and leaves the relation between the two countries'

prices changed to some degree. Neither the links between different

countries' export prices nor those between a country's export and its
                                — 74 —



domestic prices are perfectly tight, and as a result the connections

between different countries' domestic prices are looser than is often

supposed in theorizing about international monetary disturbances and

adjustments.

                         Notes to APPENDIX TABLE A-i

      Domestic price data are BLS wholesale price indexes for specific
commodities aggregated into 4—digit SITC classes. Export price data
(A Series) are BLS export price indexes for SITC subgroups and items
extended back to 1953, where possible, by indexes from Irving B. Kravis
and Robert E. Lipsey, Price Competitiveness in World Trade, NBER, 1971,
with interpolations for 1954—56 and 1958—60 as described in Kravis and
Lipsey tIInteationaJ. Trade Prices and Price Proxies" in he Role of the
Computer in Economic and Social Research in Latin America, NBER, 1974.
The number of series ranges from 8 in 1953 to 22 in 1975. We are indebted
to Eliot Kalter for the selection and matching of export and domestic
price series. The B Series adds to the A Series those 4—digit SITC sub-
groups covered in Price Competitiveness, for periods through 1964, even
if they were not included in the BLS data after 1964. It is thus more
complete for the pre—1964 period.

      In calculating the weighted aggregate of export/domestic once
ratios, each 4—digit subgroup was given its weight in U.S. exports in the
calculation of 3—digit group indexes. Each 3—digit group was given its
weight in U.S. exports in aggregating to 2—digit classes except when the
coverage of 4—digit subgroups was less than 40 per cent of the value of
exports in the 3—digit group, in which case only the weight of the covered
4—digit subgroups was used. The same procedure was used in aggregating
from the 2—digit to the 1—digit level (SITC 7 as a whole).

      The unweighted average of 4—digit ratios, the median ratio, and the
per cent of ratios greater than one are all derived from the A series data.

      Two 4—digit indexes available in the original sources were omitted
in this calculation. One was the BLS series for SITC 729.3 and the other
was the NBER series for SITC 722.1. In both cases the reason was that the
ratio did not represent the movement of export prices relative to domestic
prices for the same or similar products. In the case of SITC 729.3 the
BLS export price index is dominated by semiconductors while the wholesale
price index is heavily weighted with television tubes. In the case of
SITC 722.1, from 1953 to 1964, the NBER "international price index" is
constructed from domestic transactions prices while the BLS domestic price
index is based on list prices which differed greatly (see Kravis and
Lipsey, Price Cournetitiveness, pp. 408—421). Thus the ratio shows mainly
the   relationship of transaction to list prices rather than the ratio of
export to domestic prices.

                       Notes to APPENDIX TABLE A—3

      The indexes for Germany and Japan through 1974 are aggregates of
4—digit relative price indexes. The individual—country 4—digit price
indexes are themselves calculated from individual commodity price data
classified into SITC subgroups by the NBER. Each German and Japanese
domestic price index at the 4—digit level is divided by the corresponding
U.S. index and the resulting relative price indexes are aggregated up to
3—digit, 2—digit, and 1—digit levels using as weights total OECD exports
in 1963. The equations using Japanese prices reported in the text tables
are mostly based on a Japan/U.S. relative price index that was constructed
by comparing the Japanese price index for SITC 7 with that for the U.S.
instead of aggregating up relative price indexes from the 4—digit level.
The two methods produced results that were so similar that we did not
consider it worthwhile to recompute the equations on the preferred basis.

      The U.K. data were not available at the 4—digit level and were
therefore derived by dividing the U.K. aggregate index for SITC 7 by that
for the U.S. The U.K. aggregate indexes were provided to the NBER by the
Department of Industry, Economics and Statistics Division. The indexes
through 1971 were aggregated from the 4—digit level using 1963 OECD
weights, as for the other countries, but those for later years are based
on U.K. export weights for 1973.
      For descriptions of the German and Japanese indexes see Appendix
Tables B—i and C—l. The U.S. extrapolating index for wholesale prices is
a weighted average of group indexes for Transportation Equipment (.32805)
and Machinery and Equipment (.67195). The weights are based on 1963 U.S.
exports. Data for U.S. indexes are from BLS price tapes and the Monthly
Labor Review.

                        Notes to APPENDIX TABLE B—i

     Indexes are aggregations from individual commodity export and
domestic price series, as described for the United States in the Notes
to Appendix Table A—i. The discontinuity in the export price indexes
at the time of the shift to the value—added tax was treated by assuming
no change in price for the month of the shift in the tax system.
Extrapolations to 1975 for SITC 7 were based on combinations of published
group indexes as follows:

          Domestic price is a weighted index of the following
          group indexes of the "Index der Erzeugerpreise
          industrielle Produkte"

              Maschinenbauer zeugnisse
              Strassenfahrzeuge
              Elektrotechnische Erzeugnisse

         with weights taken from the export price index.

         Export price is a weighted index of the following
         group indexes of the "Index der Ausfuhrpreise"

              Maschinenbauerzeugnisse (einschl. Lokomotiven
                und Ackerschlepper)
              Strassenfahrzeuge (ohne Ackerschlepper)
              Elektrotechnische Erzeugnisse

         with weights of .50637, .29078, and .20286 respectively.
         •The weights are from the index on 1962=100.

      Indexes are aggregates of indexes for 4—digit SITC subgroups,
as described in the Notes to Appendix Table A—i. For sources, see Notes
to Appendix Table B—i.

      The export tax, introduced at the end of 1968 and removed at the
end of 1969, was tried as a variable in a number of equations not shown
in the text tables. They did not change the results enough to warrant
use of the equations that included them.

      Indexes are aggregations from individual commodity export and
domestic price series, as described for the United States in the Notes
to Appendix Table A—i. Extrapolations to 1975 for SITC 7 were based
on combinations of published group indexes for:

           Electrical machinery
           Transport equipment
           General machinery and precision instruments

with weights taken from 1963 Japanese exiorts. The weights are .34690,
.41820, and .23490.

       Data are from the International Monetary Fund.
      The effective exchange rates are those derived from the LtF
Multilateral Exchange Rate Model (MEBN), as described in Rudolf R.
Rhomberg, "Indices of Effective Exchange Rates,t' MF Staff Papers,
Vol. XXIII, No. 1, March 1976. The rates against the dollar are
annual averages of daily noon rates in New York.
       The bilateral exchange rates for the DM and the yen used in
 equations for those countries in this paper are all derived from
 these rates against the dollar.
