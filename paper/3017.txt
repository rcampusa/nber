           ARBITRAGE AND THE SAVINGS BEHAVIOR OF STATE GOVERNMENTS


                                  ABSTRAGI


    The federal tax code creates strong incentives for tax arbitrage activity
on the part of state governments. This arbitrage activity is illegal and
previous research has typically assumed that the constraint against arbitrage
activity is binding.     This paper explicitly tests this proposition by
considering whether financial asset holdings increase as the yield spread
between taxable and tax exempt securities rises. Using a data set on 40 state
governments over a 7 year period, I find that there is a significant response
to changes in the yield spread. One implication of these results is that the
Tax Reform Act of 1986 which made even greater efforts to curb arbitrage
activity is likely to be ineffective.

                                  I Introduction

     One by—product of the tax exemption granted to municipal bonds is the
opportunity for arbitrage by state and local governments. A state government,
for example, has clear incentives     to   issue a tax exempt bond at          rate r,
invest the proceeds at taxable rate r and earn the difference r_rm, the yield
spread between taxable and tax exempt bonds
      This practice is illegal and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has made
vigorous efforts over the past 15 years to prevent state and local governments
from earning arbitrage profits.     Previous research on the financial behavior
of   state and local governments has assumed that the             IRS    limitations on

arbitrage are binding.     This paper          considers that question directly by
measuring the responsiveness of financial asset holdings to changes in the
yield spread between taxable and ax exempt securities. As the yield spread
increases, there are greater incentives to engage in activities which allow
assets and debt to be accumulated while avoiding IRS penalties for arbitrage.
To test this, I employ a panel data set on forty state governments over a
seven year period prior to the Tax    Reform Act of 1986 (TRA86).

      State governments are studied for several reasons.                First, they are
significant holders of financial assets.           In   fiscal year   1987   they held
two-thirds of the $1048 billion stock of state and local government financial
assets.   Second, to   the extent that sophisticated accounting practices are
required to engage in arbitrage successfully, state governments may be better
able to carry out arbitrage.
     The empirical evidence in this paper suggests that the IRS has not been
very successful in its efforts to halt arbitrage.         Thus, at the margin states




                                           1
respond to increases in the yield spread by holding greater amounts of
financial assets.     Whfle TRA86 attempts to curtafl arbitrage activity further,
its basic approach is flawed and is likely to be ineffective.
      This has implications which go beyond this particular issue.                It has
become    increasingly popular to           place legal   restrictions on governmental
activities.      In   addition   to   the    arbitrage regWations,    examples    include
Propositions 13 and 2 1/2,       and   balanced budget laws at the state and local
level, and the Grarnm—Rudman—Hollings Law at the federal level.              The evidence
in   this paper provides additiona' evidence that these legal limitations are
exceedingly difficult to enforce and suggests that some other approach to the
problems underlying the limitations may be needed'.                In the conclusion,   I

briefly mention an alternative solution to the arbitrage problem.
      The next section of this paper gives some background on the growth and
composition of financial assets         held by state and       local governments and
explains some of the available arbitrage opportunities.               A section follows
which details an econometric mode' to test for the presence of arbitrage
effects followed by a section of resuks.           A brief conclusion ends the paper.
                         II. Arbitrage and Asset Accumulation
     At the end of fisca' year 1987, state governments held $696 billion in
cash and securities2. The build up cannot be sokly attributed to an effort
to fund       pension liabilities as assets        heM in    non—insurance    trust fund
accounts also increased substantiafly — to $253 billion by the end of               1987.

Over the period from 1977 through 1985, the stock of financial assets grew at

the spirit has certainty been vio'ated.

an annual rate of 14.5% while long term debt grew at an annual rate of 116%.
Over    the same period, general expenditures grew at an annual rate of less than


       There are two additional facts worthy of note.           First, the composition of
the    non—insurance    trust assets changed significantly over that decade.
Whereas in 1977 29% of the assets were in short term cash and deposits, only
20%    of   the assets were held short term in 1987,          Similarly holdings of state
and local government bonds fell from 8% to 3%.           Holdings of federal securities
also fell from 26% to 21% while holdings on non-governmental securities rose
from 37 to 55%.
       Housing    Finance Authority   assets     make    up     one   component   of   the
non-governmental securities category.         Gold (1986) notes that Housing Finance
Authorities (HFAs) hold a large proportion of financial assets and that there
has been rapid growth in this category of assets since 1979.               (Much of the
value of assets held by Housing Finance Authorities is the value of houses on
which mortgage loans have been written.            In no sense do they represent
financial assets available to the Authorities.)         The other major component of
this category is the state and local government holding of corporate bonds.
Unfortunately, it is not clear which of these assets predominate in this
category since the Census data do not break out holdings of corporate bonds.
The Federal Reserve Board F'ow of Funds Balance Sheets do not help either.
The balance sheets incorrectly assume that the state and local sector holds no
corporate bonds, an error the Board of Governors is currently correcting4.

Small Business Administration backed business loans underwritten by local
banks. While the intention of this initiative was to promote local business,
it should be noted that these loans paid near—commercial loan rates to the

                                          3
        There are two types of arbitrage that states can engage in which will
lead to an increase in financial asset holdings            First, states can borrow by
issuing municipal bonds, paying interest rate r, and then invest the proceeds
in higher yielding corporate or U.S. Treasury securities.              This becomes more
attractive the greater the yield spread between taxable and tax exempt
securities.      I will   call this financial arbitrage.    Alternatively,       states can
raise taxes and invest the proceeds in financial assets.               The interest from
the investment is returned to taxpayers through lower taxes in the future,                   In

essence, states do the savings for their residents at the before—tax interest
rate; the arbitrage gain to this activity is r — (1—t)r or rE where t is the
marginal tax rate on interest income to taxpayers in the community.                     I   will

call this saving arbitrage.
        Section 103(c) of the Federal Tax Code specifically prohibits financial
arbitrage6.      A fundamental problem with regulation of this form of arbitrage
is the need to link bonds with specific assets. Consider a state which
historically has paid for bridge construction through tax revenues and raises
a certain amount of taxes each year for "capital improvements".                      Then one
year, it issues a bond for bridge repair and uses the bond proceeds to fix the
bridge.       The additional tax revenues that would have been used for bridge
repair can now be invested in an unrestricted fashion.                         Clearly, with
sufficiently sophisticated        (or intricate)   bookkeeping1   it    will    be    difficult
for the IRS to prove that arbitrage is occurring.


city.
   Gordon and Slemrod (1986) present a detailed explanation of the various
types of arbitrage activities in which communities can engage. Steuerle
(1985) also discusses tax and financial arbitrage at some length.
6
       After Tax Reform, the arbitrage rules are mainly collected into section
148.     Metcalf (1988) describes the evolution of the arbitrage regulations in
detail.

                                             4
     The IRS has never tried to prohibit saving arbitrage altogether, perhaps
partly due to the difficulties involved in measuring the substitution of
community for individual saving and partly due to the lack of a general
principle which would motivate their concern Since the gain from this
activity is equal to rr      ,   we   would expect states to increase their holdings of
financial assets as rt rises. However1 states with a mobile population should
be less inclined to undertake this activity since the residents who paid the
higher taxes initially may not remain in the community to obtain the future
      .8
benefits.
      While simple in concept, saving arbitrage may require the co—operation of
many different individuals from different parts of government. Taxes must be
raised      —   involving   legislative    as   well   as   administrative   action   —   and

investment       decisions made.       Then some mechanism must          exist to transfer
investment earnings to the General Fund in future years and to lower taxes by
an amount equal to the transferred funds.              Such a degree of co—operation may
be difficult to imagine.         However, saving arbitrage is not simply an academic
construct. The state tuition prepayment programs which have recently become
popular are clear examples of saving arbitrage9.


    In the case of arbitrage bonds, the guiding principle was that these bonds
were a form of federal subsidy over which the federal government had no
control. From both efficiency and equity considerations, they were
in defensible.
8   Mobility should be irrelevant if capitalization of the future tax savings
occurs in housing prices. However, capitalization depends on perfect
knowledge on the part of potential buyers of the property in the community.
While there exists empirical evidence in support of capitalization of local
taxes and services (viz Bloom, Ladd, and Yinger (1983)) it is hard to imagine
that potential buyers would have complete understanding of the savings
compact, especally at the state level.
   The IRS agrees and has moved to tax the income accruing to these funds to
the individuals participating in these programs (New York Times, Aug, 29,
1988, p. D2).

                                                 5
     In the empirical       part   of   this paper,    I     will    restrict my analysis        to

non—insurance     trust financial assets         (hereafter,         simply   referred      to   as
financial assets).     Arbitrage opportunities certainly exist in pension funds.
In fact, prior    to   the Tax Reform Act of         1986,    state and local governments
could issue tax exempt bonds and use the proceeds to purchase annuities for
their pension funds.       However, there are a variety of complicating factors
which come into play when public sector pension funds are included in the
analysis.     These include the composition and size of the public sector, the
bargaining     power of public sector        employees, and            their attitude toward
unfunded pension liabilities, among other things.
     There exist additional reasons for states to hold financial assets beyond
arbitrage considerations.      The buildup in financial assets may simply reflect
the conversion of non—financial assets            into financial assets.           Perhaps the
most important non—financial assets that governments hold are the future tax
claims on minerals still in the ground beneath the community or state.                      Given
the volatility of mineral prices, tax smoothing considerations                     would argue
for saving a large portion of severance tax revenues.                     A major source of
financial assets is the Permanent Funds — proceeds from severance taxes (the
two largest being Alaska and Texas),             While these funds are important for
helping to explain the growth in financial assets in the late 1970s during a
period of high oil prices, they are less helpful in explaining the growth in
the 1980s.
     Gramlich     (1978)   implicitly   considered     the      question of      the     size    of

financial    asset holdings     by the     state and         local    government     sector by
investigating the large budget surpluses of the latter 1970s.                          He    finds
evidence that the states accumulated surpluses partly as a result of the
emergence from a recession during which taxes had been raised and partly as a
result of a fall off in construction expenditures due to peculiar properties

                                             6
of the Public Works Employment Act of 1976.               His first explanation suggests
that some measure of economic activity in a state (e.g. the unemployment rate)
should help explain asset holdings.
        It is generally perceived that TRA86 contains the strongest language yet
to control and curb arbitrage activity.            The two major features of the law
which accomplish this are new volume caps and arbitrage rules'.°                 Prior to
TRA86, volume caps of $150 per capita existed for industrial development bonds
(IDBs)    and student loan bonds.             Now there    is   a   uniform cap for most
private—purpose bonds of $75 per capita or $250 million, whichever is greater;
the cap will      fall    to $50 per capita (or $150 million) at the end of     1987.   In
1984, $108.6 billion of new issue municipal bonds were underwritten; of this
amount, 31 percent would have fallen under the newly defined category of
private activity capped bonds, according to Petersen.
        Tax reform should produce several offsetting effects. First, there is
likely to be a sharp reduction in the issue of private activity tax—exempt
bonds (mitigated to the extent that those bonds are repackaged in such a way
as to become categorized as "governmental purpose' and thus not subject to the
cap).      This    will    limit   arbitrage activity by limiting the availability of
municipal debt.            Second, the elimination of many tax shelters        will likely

increase the demand for municipal bonds, thereby driving rm down.               However,
lower individual marginal tax rates should decrease the demand for municipal
bonds.     The net effect on the yield spread is ambiguous. The evidence from
monthly rates on AAA rated general obligation municipa' bonds and 30 year
Treasury bonds indicates that the lower marginal tax rate effect dominates.
The average yield spread over the period from 1980 through 1985 is over 100

Reform Act of 1986 on the municipa' bond market.

exclude 1986 for timing reasons.           There was a massive surge of new issues in
1986 to avoid being subject to new regulations contained in Tax Reform.                      This
surge briefly drove the implicit tax        on   municipal bonds to zero.)
       New arbitrage rules limit the amount of legal arbitrage that can be
earned.       Additionally, more stringent penalties are imposed for arbitrage
violations.    The effect of these restrictions should be to reduce the amount
of debt issue as a result of increases in the yield spread. But the new rules
do not affect incentives to issue "governmental purpose debt (which in                       1984

accounted for nearly 40% of new issues using the post—TRA86 definitions) to
replace taxes as a source of revenue for projects.                 Hence, it is      not clear
that     arbitrage   activities   as   typified      by   the   bridge     example    will     be

eliminated.
     There has been very little research on the accumulation of financial
assets. The paper closeät in spirit to this one is a paper by Gordon and
Slemrod (1986) which examined data on 276 communities in 4 of the 6 New
England states for the fiscal year ending in 1977.              They find little evidence
of saving arbitrage and, because they lack data on municipal borrowing rates,
they present no evidence on the magnitude of financial arbitrage 11
       While Gordon and Slemrod's paper accomplishes much, it suffers in several
respects.     First, it assumes away financial arbitrage.         Second, they examine a
period before the IRS implemented significant regulations which were intended
to     shut off this form of activity2                Finally, they      cannot control for
individual effects ('tastes" for assets, if you will) using only a single


       They assume that at the margin the IRS is able to enforce section 103(c).
12
    For example, there were few limits on the use of sinking funds to carry out
financial arbitrage.

                            III. Econometric Model and Data
     The financial data for state governments used in this study are from the
Annual Survey of Government Finances conducted by the Census Bureau. Data on
revenues and expenditures as well as asset and debt composition are collected
from all state governments as well as a sample of local governments (town and
county governments, school districts, etc.).               All   financial variables are in
per capita, real dollars (1982 dollars using                the CPI).       For the      taxable
interest rate, I use the rate on 20 year Treasury bonds as of the beginning of
the fiscal year.      I   compute    municipal interest rates (rm) based on Moody's
credit   ratings    for    each     state's   general    obligation     (G.O.)    debt   (where
applicable) as published monthly in Moody's                      Record.    I    use the rating
that held at the beginning of the fiscal year. Moody assigns credit ratings
to many outstanding debt issues and also for most states assigns a rating to
apply to G.O. debt in general. However, not every state is assigned a rating,
many because they          do     not issue   G.O.   debt (e.g. - Colorado).             In   the
econometric analysis, I exclude states which have no outstanding G.O. debt as
well as Alaska3       Alaska is particularly troubling since it has financial asset
holdings per capita which are some 14 times the national average. After
determining ratings for each state in each year, I assigned an interest rate
based on the average rate for that class for the month of July, which Moody's
also publishes.
     Table   1    reports some summary statistics on interest rates.                 The mean
municipal rate rose from a low of 5.35% in 1977 to a peak of 12.02% in 1982.

rate is close    to   the one reported by Poterba (1986) 14                     The key statistic
however is  not the implicit municipal tax rate but the yield spread itself.
As the table shows, they can move in opposite directions (viz 1981—1982).
More importantly, a low implicit municipal tax rate does not imply a low yield
spread. In two of the three years when the yield spread exceeded 3 percentage
points, the implicit municipal tax rate was less than 26%.
       Based on the discussion of the previous section, I estimated a model of
the form:

     A.t =         + P9rttlt   +   X
                                          +
                                              9.
                                                   +    ct   +           (1)


where   i runs from 1 to N and t from 1 to T.                    Financial assets (At) in state i
in year t depend on the yield spread (S1), a measure of saving arbitrage, and
a vector of demographic and fiscal variables (Xt). Also (4) allows for fixed
effects (0.) as well as macroeconomic influences not specific to any one
community (c).
       The tax variable (as well as other tax variables discussed below) are
calculated using individual tax returns and the National Bureau of Economic
Research's TAXSIM model for the years 1979 through 1985. The tax variable is
a weighted      average of the additional taxes paid per additional $100 of
interest income.       A weighted average               of itemization    status in each state
(computed from        TAXSIM)      is   included in the             equation.    The   itemization
probability is important in the saving arbitrage story.                         If taxpayers all
itemize (for    simplicity), then taxes can be raised 1/(1—t), which only costs


14
     The implicit municipal tax rate is the tax rate which equates the after tax
 yield on tax—exempt and taxable securities of equal riskiness. That is, the
tax rate is defined by equating (l_tm)r =                r.
15
     The number of actual tax returns in each year varied from 76,561 in 1983 to
165,810 in 1979.

                1


years, r/(1—t) is returned through lower taxes which is only worth r, again
because of the federal deduction on state taxes. Itemization leads to greater
amounts of asset holdings. No attempt is made in this paper to identify
rigorously a "decisive" voter and whether she is an itemizer or not.         Rather,
I assume that decisions are made through some voting/bargaining framework and
that itemizers and non—itemizers are both important. Therefore the proportion
of itemizers in each state should be positively correlated with asset and debt
holdings.
      Demographic variables include the percentage of population aged 18 to -14,
and the percentage aged 65 and older. Fiscal variables include per capita tax
collections    (less severance   tax   collections) and per capita severance tax
collections.    Also included is the state's average unemployment rate.          In
summary, I have data on 40 states covering the fiscal years 1980 through 1986.
Table 2 presents some sample statistics describing the data.
      Before discussing regression estimates, there are important simultaneity
issues which need to be considered which may impart bias to coefficient
estimates.      First, the credit rating of a community is endogenous and
responsive (among other things) to changes in debt and asset levels.            Also

there may be unobserved determinants of asset levels which also determine
credit ratings. Events or propensities which induce a community to hold
greater amounts of assets will likely lead to a higher credit rating and hence
lower borrowing costs. Or more directly, higher asset levels may lead          to a

higher credit rating and lower borrowing cost.        This is less likely.    Credit
ratings depend on a measure of net debt rather than any measure that includes
asset holdings.      Moreover, this definition of net debt is simply debt that
must be repaid out of the General Fund (as opposed to having an earmarked
revenue source).   In either case, the coefficient on the yield spread is


                                           11
biased upward and it         will   be    difficult to distinguish whether     a     positive
coefficient on this variable is due to arbitrage activity or to simultaneity
bias.
        Offsetting this bias is bias due to opportunities for legal arbitrage and
the endogeneity of debt. Prior to TRA86, it was possible to hold roughly 15%
of the bond proceeds in a debt reserve fund'6.            Therefore states with large
amounts of debt may be able to hold larger amounts of assets.                However, the
larger debt is likely to lower the government's credit rating.                This effect
will bias the estimates downward.
        Because of these problems, I employ an instrumental variables estimation
procedure to estimate consistent values of the               coefficients,    relying for
identification on the excluded variables from the unspecified credit rating
determination and debt equations. I employ as instruments per capita income
in the state, tax capacity and tax effort indices as measured by the Advisory
Commission on Intergovernmentai Relations (ACIR)'7 and the percentage of taxes
raised by the largest tax. The first three instruments are reasonably measures
of the fiscal well—being      of a       state which should affect its credit rating.
Also, because tax revenues are included in the regression, I would not expect
that the error in the regression equation would be correlated with the
instruments.      The last   instrument measures the extent to which a state
diversifies its tax collections.         This measure should be correlated positively
with the municipal rate; again there is no reason to expect that it would be
correlated with the error in the regression equation.            (For a discussion of
the determination of a community's credit rating, see Rubinfeld                    (1973)   or


16
   Assets could be held in debt reserve funds, debt service funds and
temporary funds. See Metcalf (1988) for more details.
17
        Tax capacity is the amount of taxes a state could collect if it applied an
average set of rates to its tax base. Tax effort is the ratio of actual tax
collections to tax capacity.

Aronson and Marsden (1980).)           A complete model would link the financing
decisions with the tax and spending decisions. I assume here that the tax
variables, while endogenous, are uncorrelated with the error term in the asset
equations.       Since   unanticipated    tax        collections lead   directly to       higher
financial asset holding, this is not an unreasonable assumption.
     As   written, equation      (7)   allows        for fixed   effects.   Ignoring these
parameters creates no bias so long as the effects are uncorrelated with any
included variables. As in most empirical studies in atate and local public
finance, this is unlikely to hold (viz Holtz—Eakin (1986)).
                                         IV. Results
     Table 3 presents estimation results for the model in equation                    1   above.

All of the regressions have per capita real financial assets (net of insurance
trust assets) on the left hand side. Fixed effects and year dummies are not
reported in the table.       The rirst regression ignores the endogeneity in the
determination of the state's credit rating.                 The coefficient on the yield
spread variable is positive and significant at the 95% level suggesting the
responsiveness of financial assets to movements in the yield spread. The
effect of changes in the yield spread is important.               A one standard deviation
move in the yield spread implies an increase in financial assets of $70 per
capita, 9% of the mean holdings across the 40 states over the seven year
period.
     None of the other variables in the regression are significaxit (other than
year and state dummies).  The data provide no support for savings arbitrage.
The coefficients on the interest tax wedge variable (rr) and fraction
itemizers variable are actually negative, contrary to theory, and entirely
insignificant. Aside from the practical difficulties of engaging in savings
arbitrage at the state level, there are statistical difficulties. Changes in
these two variables are closely linked to changes in the federal tax code.

                                                13
Much of the variation in these data is likely                    to    be captured in the year
effects.
     The trade off involved in estimating fixed effects models is apparent in
the significance of the other coefficients.                Most of the variation in the tax
variables and the demographics variables is across states rather than within
states across   time.           for these four variables, the fraction of the
                         In fact,
total variance in the variables accounted for within states across time never
exceeds 15%. In contrast 36% of the variance in the unemployment rate is
within states across time while nearly 90% of the variance in the yield spread
variable is within states across time.
      The unemployment and lagged unemployment rate variables were included in
the regression to test for Gramlich's hypothesis that surpluses accumulate as
states emerge from recessions due to lags in state law tax changes.                                This
hypothesis suggests that the coefficient on the unemployment rate variable
should be negative.        Current unemployment comes in positive and lagged
unemployment negative, albeit with a t statistic of one'8.
      The   remaining     regressions    in        table     3        are   instrumental    variable
regressions to control for the endogeneity in the credit rating (and hence the
yield spread variable).      The second regression is the full model.                           Nothing
qualitatively changes from the OLS regressions except for the magnitude of the
coefficient on the yield spread variable.              It increases to 673.11 and while
the standard error increases, it        is still significant — now                at the 99% level.
The positive coefficient on the yield spread variable                       is   not due   to    credit
rating agencies giving higher ratings to                    states with large amounts of
financial assets19.     The final regression drops all of the variables from the

    This raises the issue though of the proper treatment of debt. As a first

regression except the yield spread variable and the year dummies.                               The

magnitude of the yield spread effects drops somewhat but is still significant
at the 95% level20.
        As     with   all      instrumental variable       regressions, it is       important     to

consider the exogeneity of the instruments.                    One could make a reasonable
argument that the tax effort variable                 is   correlated with the error in the
equation.       A shock to the local economy which drives down asset holdings might
also be related           to   the effort that a community makes to raise taxes.                The

correlation would likely be negative since tax effort would probably be
increased due to an increased need for transfers and a diminished tax base. A
similar argument would suggest a positive correlation between the shock and
tax capacity.     attempt to control for this type of correlation by including
                      I

tax collections in the regression so that this shock is not incorporated in
the error term. Hausman and Taylor (1981b) suggest a variant on the Hausman
Specification Test which can test for the appropriateness of my control (see
their paper for a more precise formulation of the statistic).                   I    compute the
statistic under the assumption that the variable measuring the proportion of
taxes raised by the largest tax is an admissible instrument for the municipal
rate.        The chi—square statistic will have one degree of freedom.                I   first test
for the admissibility of each instrument separately and then test them as a
group,   The highest chi—square statistic occurs in the test of tax capacity
(.68) but is well below the 10 percent significance cut off point. This test


effort to control for the legal arbitrage opportunities, I ran a regression in
which I assumed that states always invest 15% of their debt proceeds for the
life of the bond. The dependent variable then is financial assets less 15% of
outstanding debt. While the regression estimate falls by $100 per capita, it
is still quite substantial and still significant at the 95% level.
20 A Wald test for dropping the eight variables from the regression is not
rejected. The test statistic is 7.22 and is distributed as a Chi Square
random variable with 8 degrees of freedom (See Engle (1984) for a derivation
of this test.)
                                                 15
can also be used to check for endogeneity of the yield spread variable. Under
the assumption that the yield spread is exogenous, the OLS regression can be
interpreted as the efficient IV estimator for the purposes of the test.                     I

compare the      IV   estimator with all four instruments           included to the OLS
estimator.     The test statistic    is   4.82 and exceeds the critical value for          a

chi square statistic with one degree of freedom at the 95% level.
                                      L   Conclusion

      This paper has shown that there may be significant marginal arbitrage
effects due to the yield spread between taxable and tax—exempt interest rates.
For fiscal year 1986, the standard deviation of the yield spread across the
forty state sample was 0.17.        Based on the IV regression estimates from Table
3,   this implies a difference in financial asset holdings of $114 per capita,
14% of the mean financial asset holdings across the states in the seven year
sample.      As in Gordon and Slemrod's paper, there is no evidence of savings
arbitrage.     Clearly one area for further research would be to replicate this
analysis for a large panel of local governments from the Annual Survey of
Government Finances.       Besides the greater number of observations, this would
provide opportunities to contrast state level behavior to local government
behavior.
      The regression results suggest that the Tax Reform Act will not eliminate
arbitrage activity by municipal governments. We should expect that the trend
toward private activity tax—exempt bonds               will   be   reversed with greater
reliance now on governmental activity municipals21.                These bonds   will   still
provide opportunities for arbitrage.


21
    This is borne out by the evidence on new debt issues in calendar year 1986.
issues of private activity municipal bonds fell dramatically while new issues
of public purpose debt rose. As in previous years, a large amount of
borrowing occurs toward the end of the calendar year and is reflected in
fiscal year 1987 totals, not in the data employed in this study (Statistics of
Income, Summer 1988).
                                             16
     If financial arbitrage is to be eliminated, some other approach will have
to be   taken.   The obvious approach, to tax municipal bond interest, is
unlikely to be taken. There is strong political support for the exemption.
Another approach that deserve considerations is a first dollar arbitrage rule.
Here, unrestricted yields could only be earned on an amount of assets equal to
the net financial holdings of a community.    This rule, in effect, broadens the
concept of replacement and eliminates the need to create a link between
specific debt obligations and asset holdings2.2 While a more detailed analysis
of this proposal would be necessary, one effect of this approach to arbitrage
might be to induce state and local governments to fund more of their unfunded
pension liabilities.
      Questions about marginal arbitrage activity relate to the larger question
of the determinants of the yield spread between taxable and tax—exempt rates.
Explanations of the spread have traditionally concentrated on demand side
theories attempting to identify the marginal investor in tax-exempt bonds (see
Poterba for a description).       The supply side stories may be an important
determinant as     well.   High   levels of asset accumulation due in part to
arbitrage may help explain the low implicit municipal tax rate observed in
recent years.


22   Henry Simons (1938) notes that Andrew Mellon proposed this idea in 1923 to
curtail individual arbitrage activity (investing borrowed funds for which a
tax deduction has been taken in municipal bonds).
