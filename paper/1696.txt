                                       ABSTRACT


      The paper analyzes the change in unemployment in 12 OECD countries over

 the period 1970—83 in terms of
                                  underlying aggregate supply and demand shifts.

 Earlier evidence on wage gaps (given by Bruno and Sachs) is revised and

 extended. For most European countries a process of reduction in gaps is

 taking place in the 1980's, but the average absolute levels, when weighted by

country size, are still sizeable, thus a 'classical' element of unemployment

remains. However, most of the large additional increase in unemployment after

1980 (as well as the profit
                              squeeze and investment slowdown) is ascribed to
the contractionary stance of macro policy in Europe, in contrast to the

subsequent expansion and sharp fall of unemployment in the U.S. The large

U.S. deficit coupled with monetary restraint and the resulting dollar

appreciation also account for the sharp difference in the behavior of import

prices in the U.S. and Europe which in turn may explain the considerably

slower inflation deceleration in Europe and the reluctance to expand activity

more rapidly.

  AGGREGATE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FACTORS
                                        IN OECD UNEMPLOYMENT: AN UPDATE'



 Introduction

 Unemployment in the OECD countries has continued to rise to unprecedented
 levels. The EEC countries, which
                                    on average ended the turbulent l97O's
 with an unemployment rate of close to 7 percent are now, in the mid
                                                                     80's,
 approaching an 11 percent level. The U.S. is
                                                virtually the only country
 for which the changes in
                            unemployment during the l970's have not been
 systematically upward and for which the 1984
                                                rate was, more or less, back
 to where it had been both ten
                               years and five years earlier (see Figure 1).
      The reasons for the sustained
                                    increase in unemployment during the
l97O's as well as the possible
                                 reasons for differences in patterns across
industrial countries have been studied but question marks
                                                              undoubtedly
remain. Our own emphasis in an earlier study has been on the combination

of the great supply shocks of the previous decade and the
                                                              contractionary
macro—policy response of most OECD countries
                                               to these shocks as well as on
the more recent policy
                         co—ordination problem between the U.S. and Europe.
With a few more
                  years that have elapsed and quite a few
                                                            percentage points
of additional unemployment there is obviously room for both
                                                            an update and
a reappraisal.1



  See Bruno and Sachs
                      (1985). The period covered in that study extended
  only up to 1981 for which the
  countries was still incomplete.coverage in terms of data for individual
                                   It is worth Pointing out that between
  1981 and 1985 the number
                           of unemployed in Europe increased by almost 50
  percent!

    Starting from a fairly conventional aggregate supply (AS) and aggre-

                                         of either the AS curve or the AD
about as a result of a leftward shift

curve or a combination thereof (see Figure 2). The first 'pure' case of
                              both unemployment and inflation and is
a supply shock brings about

generally understood to have characterized the period both immediately

before and after the first oil shock (1973—74), the extent of resulting

stagflation in various countries depending on the extent of real wage

rigidity. Such shift from southwest to northeast in the unemployment—
                                              characterized the second
inflation framework (see Figure 1) has also

oil shock (1979—80). An added leftward bias of the AS curve in the

1970's may have been caused by the depressive effect of the profit

squeeze on capital accumulation. All of these have imparted a

 'classical' element to the unemployment which has certainly not been

                                            episodes. However, even the
present in earlier, cyclical unemployment

developments immediately following the two oil shocks cannot be
                                                                   forces
understood without explicit regard being paid to contractionarY

 coming from leftward shifts in the AD schedule-s of countries (see

 Figure 2).

      The period immediately following the first oil shock (1974—77) cer-

 tainly looks more like a conventional northwest to southeast movement down

 a short—run Phillips curve (see Figure 1). In terms of the story for the

 1970's this could be explained as a combination of the depressing effect

 of oil and raw material prices on real income, the anti—inflationary

 response of macro policy to the first oil shock and the interaction of

 depressed world markets on export demand in the individual countries. A

 similar story, with some variations, could still be told for 1980—81. From
                                    —3—

  that phase onwards the differential movement of unemployment in the U.S.

  and Europe has become a central issue which
                                                requires analysis in its own
  right.

       In the coming sections we take up the main issues pertaining to the

 role of AS and AD factors in the
                                    rising unemployment. Section I recon-
 siders the concept of the real wage gap, and applies alternative measures

 to the data up to and including 1983. Our
                                             general finding is that by the
 end of the period considered wage gaps for most countries recorded have

 come down from their peak levels in 1979—81, but are still sizable on

 average in Europe. Section II takes up the role of the profit squeeze. We

 find that while profits have played a very important role in the invest-

 ment slowdown the main reason for the profit squeeze has come from depres-

 sed demand conditions and less from the direct effect of high real wages.

 While the slowdown in capital growth may provide an eventual constraint on

 rapid growth in the manufacturing sector it is unlikely to be an obstacle

 to expansion at the present moment due to excess capacity.

     Section III takes a summary overview of the demand for labour in the

manufacturing sector applying a neoclassical demand curve for labour with

some Keynesian AD elements superimposed on it. Section IV reconsiders the

overall unemployment performance of countries in terms of the basic under-

lying AS and AD components reinforcing the argument that the more recent

rise in unemployment is primarily an AD contraction phenomenon. The last

section (V) discusses the dilemma of individual
                                                  country expansion and
reconfirms the argument that there is a serious policy co—ordination prob-

lem between the U.S. and Europe in which the large U.S. deficit coupled

with monetary restraint and the European fear of renewed inflation have

simultaneously provided the conditions for rapid U.S. expansion and the
                                   —4—

sluggishness of revival in Europe. The policy proposals recently put

forward,2 calling for co—ordinated, more active expansion in Europe with

some incomes policy hedges, thus receive added support.




I. The Rise and Gradual Fall of Wa&e Gaps



Several studies have produced evidence that for a number of countries

during the 1970s, at least, an important supply factor has been a persis-

tent excess of real wage levels above the marginal product of labour at

full employment.3 It is therefore important to update and reconsider the

evidence from the vantage point of the mid—1980s.

       Assuming a well—behaved production function in terms of value added:

V =   F(L,   K; t), and suppose one can measure the marginal product at full

employment (Li), FL(L, K; t). Under output—market clearing and competi-

tive firms (W/P) =               K; t) is the level of product wage at which
                         FL(L,
labour demand will equal     L. The wage gap, wX, is the percentage

deviation of the actual product wage W/P         over (W/P) or, in log—

linear approximation, wX = (w —         — (w —
                                                                         in
       The notion that the marginal product of labour may mean something

the aggregate or that the aggregate demand for labour may depend on the

 real wage is, of course, controversial, mainly because of the competitive

 assumption implied for firms. We here proceed under the supposition that

      See, for example, Layard etal. (1984).

      See Sachs (1981), Bruno and Sachs (1985), Artus (1984), Lipschitz and
      Schadler (1984), McCallum (1984), and OECD Economic Outlook, miscel-
      laneous issues.
                                   —5---


 like many artifacts in applied macro—economics, the notion of a wage gap

 could, under certain circumstances and with some caveats, perform a useful

 diagnostic function. When based on a sub—sector like
                                                        manufacturing it may,
 perhaps, be less controversial than otherwise, since for most economies

 this is a highly tradable industry and one that is reasonably

 competitive.

      Under a CES production function with elasticity of substitution a

 between   L and K the elasticity of demand for labour with respect to

 the product wage is C/Ski where    Sk is the capital share in value

added. Thus, a log—linear approximation of the employment shortfall in the

short run (i.e., at given capital stock, k5) due to a positive wage gap

is given by



(1)         d —     = _(a/sk)wX                (d =      when   wX =   0)


      The main problem of measurement lies in estimating the marginal pro-

duct of labour at full employment. In principle, one could estimate the

production technology directly and calculate   FL for L. Such estimates
must usually assume market clearing on a year—to—year basis, which is

obviously problematic. The alternative procedure followed here is to

suggest a range of estimates of wX under alternative assumptions from

which, it is argued, a general picture nonetheless emerges.




  Note that as long as marginal revenues of firms move with prices (i.e.,
  there is a constant 'degree of monopoly'), the notion of a wage gap
  could still remain valid even under monopolistic competition.

  The importance of this caveat will be further clarified below.
                                  —6—

     The simplest assumption for calculating wX is the Cobb—Douglas

technology (o   = 1)   for which the marginal product moves parallel to the

average product and the problem then boils down to measuring the gap

between (w —      and the trend of the average product at full employment

    — 9),   namely, a corrected relative wage share measure, normalized by

some base—year benchmark. Table 1 gives this first measure for 12 OECD

countries taking the benchmark for wX {= w —    v — (v —        to    be 0 on

average during the period 1965—69 and taking the average growth rates of

v — Z   during 1960—73 and 1973—85 to represent the respective "full

employment" trend (v — £     ).

     The findings based on the simplest measure of the gap suggest that

after a rise in the gap in the early 1970s and a very sharp rise during

the first oil shock, to a weighted average of 11 percent by the end of the

decade, there was a gradual fall in most countries from about 1980 onward.

The move in a downward direction seems to have become more marked during

1982—83. The table also underscores the fact that there are sharp differ-

ences among countries both for the peak years and for the deceleration.

The U.S. and Canada importantly show very little variation during the oil

shock, and only the Netherlands and Sweden were the exception to an other-

wise real wage—resistant Europe.7 The U.K. and Belgium stand out as two

    While 1960 and 1973 probably represented cyclical peaks, 1983, which is
    the last observation in our data, is obviously not. The alternative
    followed in Bruno and Sachs (1985) took 1979 to be a cyclical peak and
    extrapolated through that year. Both procedures are problematic, and an
    alternative trend measure of yf —   2  after 1973 is given below
    (Table 2).

    See Bruno and Sachs (1985) for an extensive discussion of the differ-
    ence between nominal and real wage rigidity. French data on the low
    wage gap shown here may be misleading (see discussion      cit.and also
    Table 2).
                                                   —7—

     countries with large remaining gaps by the end of the period. Japan's 1979

  figure, one can argue, is misleading since the reference period, 1965—69,

  probably did not reflect an equilibrium in its labour market.8 Anyway, it

  shows substantial reduction after 1979.

         We consider two major sensitivity tests for the basic measure used in

 Table 1, one having to do with the technology and the other with the

 hypothetical measure of                  —        during   the recent unemployment years.

         The first argument against findings based on the simple measure of

 wX comes from the assumed
                                      unitary elasticity of substitution. We know
 that when a < 1 a rise in real wages will also show in a rising labour

 share in value—added, which would have nothing to do with disequilibrium.

 The sharpness of the rise in wX in the mid—19705 and its subsequent fall

 towards the early l980s would cast doubt on such explanation, but it is

 nonetheless important to see how sensitive this result is to the size of

a. Various recent studies of the production function
                                                                              for manufacturing

across countries suggest the assumption of Harrod—neutral technical

progress and a range of estimates of a between 0.5 and 1, with an

average of about

      If V is       the (log) labour input in intensity units, we have

and again applying it to the trend between the 'peak' years 1960, 1973,

1983.

        The above approximation obviously requires knowledge of capital stock

figures, which were available for only 8 of the countries in question. The

last three lines of Table 1 give a summary average estimate for these 8

countries (Belgium, Denmark, Italy, and the Netherlands are excluded here)

for the 3 assumptions on 0, from which we can see that the 1979 and 1981

peak estimates of wX are only slightly modified. There is a somewhat

larger difference in the subsequent years —                 the   smaller a,   the   larger is

the estimated reduction in the gap by 1982. There are, of course, differ-

ences for individual countries (these data are not reproduced here), but

the general result holds on average.

        The second sensitivity test involves an alternative estimate for

v —         which attempts to correct for the effect of the unemployment

level and changes thereof on full employment productivity growth. The

method used" was to run for each country a regression of labour producti-

vity on unemployment, the current and lagged change in unemployment and

time, with a time shift factor after 1975:




(note 10 continued:)

        But for CES, v2,, =      0'(v    —   9,'),   and thus:

            = (v—2.) — (v—9.') +          = (v—Q) +
                                                           [(1_a)IaII[sk!(1_sk)I(k_v)

        Under Hicks—neutrality we would similarly get

        v, =   (v   —   )+   [(1 —
                                     a)/a]sk(k
                                                 —   2).   Here the correction would be

         larger, since k —      i     changed by more than (k —         v).

  normalized to zero in '65—'69.

            The resulting adjusted estimates are given in Table 2. It
                                                                      is inter—
  esting to note that on the whole the
                                                previous general finding remains
  intact, both concerning the size of the increase in 1976 and the
                                                                    gradual
 fall after 1979. The two
                           extreme cases, Belgium and the United Kingdom,
 now look even worse, and it
                              seems that France too is in much worse shape
 once the correction for
                          unemployment is made. We note that the
                                                                 weighted
 mean for Europe, when Belgium and the U.K. are excluded, shows
                                                                 a lower
 peak but only a very mild slowdown.

     An important question that arises relates to the
                                                      sources of these
changes in the measured
                        wage gap. At least a partial answer is
                                                               provided by

the real consumption

product prices (        — ), where      the latter include changes in relative

II. The Role of the Profit Sgueez


                                               data shown in the last section
The general picture that emerges from the
                                               of the early 1980s the wage gap
suggests that during the depression years

has most probably been reduced in all but two or three countries. What

 this implies is that at given capital stock levels (providing the esti-
                                               whole economy, and not only to
 mated wage gap is also applicable to the

 the manufacturing sector), the demand for labour would come closer to

 maintenance of full employment. The emphasis on the word given is impor-

 tant because both the labour force and the capital stock normally grow at

 some balanced rate from which we have abstracted so far. The point is that

 when the capital stock levels depart from their previous growth paths this
                                                         labour demand and full
 could be an additional argument for a gap between
                                                        to which we turn later. A
 employment, quite apart from Keynesian arguments

 fall in investment demand could be linked to a profit squeeze which, in

 itself, may have been caused by an increase in the price of other factors
                                                       depressed demand condi-
 of production (material inputs and labour), by

 tions, or (as in fact was the case) by a combination of both.

     minded approach in which capital stock
                                               growth is expressed as a function
     of past profits (a three—year
                                      average is used in the data below) and the
     real rate of interest. The real
                                        rate of profit, in turn, is expressed as a
     function of the real product

     a measure of demand pressure.

add a term
            a2d to equation (5) and also allow for a drop in productivity

estimation. The regression

     This procedure was followed in a recent OECD memo. We also

     the same purpose. Broadly
                               similar results are obtained, but    d seems
     a better aggregate
                        proxy for all countries. For the basis of

          Both equations show a very strong effect of the profit
                                                                 rate and an

     behind the former could be via the effect
                                                  of present profit rates on the
     expectations of future profits or else may be a the result of financing

     constraint on firms which enhances investment from
                                                          retained earnings when
     the latter increase. Whichever the channel
                                                  it is obviously a strong rela-
     tionship. It is further borne out by individual
                                                       country regressions given
     in Table 5. These are based on annual data and a logarithmic specification

     (with the exception of the U.K. in which only the linear form gave signi-

 ficant results). There the profit variable ()        stands for the log average
 profit rate for the last three years.

         Table 5 shows the elasticity of
                                           capital stock growth with respect to
 profits to be highly significant in almost all cases (the U.S. is a
                                                                     pos-
 sible exception), the average value being 1.46. The coefficient for the

 real interest rate is
                       significantly negative in only three cases'3 (only
 one case with a significantly positive
                                        coefficient, France, makes no
economic sense).

        Writing the investment equation in the form


(7)


and substituting for        from r in equation (5) we can express the

growth in the capital stock as a function of the
                                                       real product wage
(level), the demand variable (d) and the real interest rate (leaving out

time shifts):




13
      The limited role of interest rates may be due to the fact that
                                                                      they
      are much more volatile than profits [see Iieda and Yoshikawa (1985)].

       Looking at the size of the implied elasticities and the actual change

in the underlying variables one major conclusion emerges —       the   real wage

could not but have a relatively small direct role in the slowdown of

capital accumulation while the output contraction (from the demand side)

played the dominant role in the profit squeeze and the resulting contrac—

tion in investment.

       The product of the average a1 (1.6) and the average b1 (1.5) gives an

elasticity of 2.4. A permanent increase in w of 5 percent over its

equilibrium level would thus imply a fall in k of 12 percent.14 We know

from Section I that in the mid 70's there were temporary increases of w,

which on average were twice that but by the beginning of the 1980's the

gap for most countries had already come down substantially. At the same

time the rate of growth of the capital stock was cut to less than half its

rate over the decade for most european countries for which data are recor-

ded here. The total elasticity for the d variable, on the other hand

(b1a2), amounts to 4.5 and the relative fall in its level over the period

was of the order of 20 percent ,thus being capable of 'explaining' drops

of up to 90 percent in k.

      This general assessment of the relative importance of the two factors

 (as well as a minute role for the real rate of interest) also emerges when

an analysis of components is carried out by individual country (not repro-

duced here). We may thus conclude that while the profit squeeze probably


 14
      The average product of a1b1 (rather than the product of the averages)
      is 2.22. The highest product of a1b1 by half the wage gap in 1976 (see
      Table 1), from among the eight countries recorded, is 0.24 for Germany
      with all other countries far below that.

 played an important role in the investment slowdown, for most countries
 and for most of the time, high real wages played only a small direct role

 in the latter. Indirectly, of course, the contractionary bias of macro-

 economic policy was probably related to wage rigidity (fear of inflation),

 but this is another matter to which we shall return. First we take a

 summary overview of the factors affecting employment in manufacturing.




 III.   An Analysis of the Demand for Labour in Manufacturjzg


To take   a summary view of the factors affecting employment in manufac—

turing we modify the conventional demand curve for labour by
                                                                                          assuming
gradual adjustment           [2, — 2,       =   (2,d —   )J as well as a short—run role
for aggregate demand factors. For the latter three variables were used —

the   government deficit (df, corrected for full employment and inflation),

deviations from the trend in world trade (d) and the real money stock

(m, lagged). For most countries there is considerable positive correlation

between the fiscal and monetary variables and only for the U.S., where the

two conflicted, did the monetary variable play an important separate role

(M2 was used and the world trade variable was not included). The log

linear equation that was fitted for most countries (see Table 6) is the

following:

                                  — 16 —


countries   show significant negative coefficients for the product wage

variable. The 'long—run' elasticity (but at given capital stock) of labour

demand varies from about one half for Belgium and Norway to two and above

for Japan, Denmark, France and the Netherlands (these values are obtained

by dividing c2 by 1—c1). The implied elasticity of substitution can be

obtained by multiplication of these values by the share of capital which

for most countries is of the order of 1/3 (somewhat higher for Japan). The

world trade variable is significantly positive in most cases as is the

deficit variable for those countries for which data could be included.

     The direct role attributed to aggregate demand in these regressions

is certainly not negligible and if we add the indirect role working

through the investment slowdown it is quite sizable. In the way we have

specified the model it is constrained to show constant returns to scale in

labour and capital and thus any factor accounting for a 1 percent cut in

the rate of change of k also, ceteris paribus, indirectly accounts for the

same in terms of the rate of change in manhours. At the same time,the fact

that the demand slowdown played a direct role in the regression provides

evidence that by the end of that period (after considerable demand slow-

down) there was probably no capacity constraint. This is also borne out by

direct measurements of capacity utilisation [see European Community

business surveys quoted in European Economy, 1983, and in Layard et al.

(1984)].



IV. An Analysis of Overall Unemployment



So far the analysis dealt only with the manufacturing sector. There are

obvious advantages to a consideration of that sector both for analytical
                                    — 17 —


 reasons (a neoclassical labour demand framework is more defensible for

 this sector, at least in a typical European open economy context) and

 because such data as product wages and capital input are more readily

 available. We do not, at the moment, have a
                                               satisfactory aggregate macro-

 economic model formally combining demand and supply factors in a way that

 could be used for econometric estimation of labour
                                                        demand, especially in

 an imperfectly competitive setting. In the absence thereof, we make do

 with an ad—hoc formulation, which follows the logic of the preceding

 discussion   and could also be given justification   on the basis   of gradual
 adjustment   to aggregate demand and aggregate supply within a disequilib-

rium setting.'5

     We write down a reduced form in which unemployment is expressed as a

function of the lagged real wage gap, and the aggregate demand factors

with two lags for each. The more distant lags could be rationalized on the

basis of delayed effects working either on the aggregate demand schedule

or via profitability and capital investment on the aggregate supply side.

It is in that 'hybrid' sense that the results of Table 7 should be inter-

preted.

    Table 7 presents unemployment
                                    regressions for eight countries. Only in
the case of the U.S. both the monetary and fiscal variables appear (with-

out the world trade variable). In the case of the other countries the

addition of a fiscal variable did not make any significant difference and

the lagged real money stock variables seemed to do all of the action on

the domestic demand side.'6 We note that the signs of coefficients are, in


  See Bruno and Sachs (1985), chap. 10.
  We have no explanation as to why the fiscal variable seems to perform
  better in the manufacturing labour demand equation and the monetary
  variable works better here.

most cases, the 'right' ones,17 although they are not always significant

at the 1 percent level.

       Because of the statistical problems that are attached to this type of

single equation estimation for each country, there is some advantage to

also taking an overall cross—section view of the rise in unemployment

using the same underlying model. The following is the resulting regression

(20 years x 8 countries = 160 observations) of first differences:


               = 0.32 +            +              —            —1 + 0 .6lAm—2

                                                                            = 0.51


       With the exception of the second lag on money (which could be left

out), all coefficients have the right sign and are highly significant

 (numbers in brackets are standard errors of coefficients). The assumption

underlying (10), that the elasticities are the same across countries, is,

 of course, problematic, but it is reassuring to find such a strong overall

 qualitative result. If one adds dummy variables for countries and/or each

 time period, none of these dummies come out significant, and the overall

 regression is not improved.

        The average quantitative implications that could be read into the

 regression is that for each 1 percent rise (fall) in the wage gap, the

 unemployment rate rises (falls) by 0.15 percent within two years, while



 17 Only one of the 16 coefficients of the wage gap is significantly nega-
    tive, for the case of the regression for France which is suspect anyway
    (see discussion below). Most of the coefficients on the demand varia-
    bles are negative as expected.
                                    — 19 —


 for   each 1 percent drop in the rate of growth in real money stock,

 unemployment rises by 0.06 percent after a year.

        Consider, for example, the average drop in real money growth between

 1974—78 and 1978—82, which was about 4 percent in annual average terms.

 The regression would thus attribute an annual average rise of 0.24 percent

 in the unemployment rate to this factor alone in the last period.'8

        Table 8 gives a summary analysis of the analogous regressions that

 were based on the adjusted wage gap measure (these regressions are not

 reported here). It indicates the role of the major factors accounting for

 the increase in unemployment in each country. For each period the average

cumulative change in the average unemployment rate since 1965—69 is given,

as well as the estimated role of the adjusted wage gap (with its two lags)

and the sum total of the aggregate demand factors. The table reinforces

the earlier finding that wages played an important role mainly in the mid—

seventies and primarily for three of the countries recorded (the U.K.,

Belgium and Denmark) and that its relative importance for most countries

diminished during the last sub—period, 1978—82, where most of the

incremental increase in unemployment can be attributed to aggregate demand

shifts (subtract the second column of Table 8 from the third or fourth

column). However, by 1982 the average remaining effect of the wage factor

sèk remained high for the 5 European countries recorded in this table.




18
     The 'world trade' factor here
                                   appears separately, although it, too,
     could ultimately, in a world model, be attributed to 'domestic' con-
     traction in all countries combined. Its implied response coefficient of
     0.16 'explains' a rise in unemployment of 0.4 percent annually during
     1974—78 and 0.3 percent during 1978—82.

V. Inflation, Exchange Rates and the Co—ordination Problem


The previous discussion has highlighted the dominant role of contraction—

ary macro—policy in the recent further rise of unemployment in Europe.

The same framework is also consistent with the concomitant fall in unem-

ployment in the U.S., given the extensive fiscal expansion in that country

since 1981. We conclude the discussion by noting that it is the combina-

tion of fiscal expansion and monetary contraction in the U.S. which, at

least in part, may indirectly account for the reluctance to expand in

Europe on account of sluggish inflation deceleration. The causal link is

provided by exchange rate developments during the same period.

      The rise in real interest rates and net capital flows into the U.S.

account for the large dollar appreciation since the beginning of 1981 (of

the order of 50 percent nominal and 38 percent in real terms). This has

had a dramatic effect on the relative import price developments in the

U.S. as compared to Europe which, we would argue, is the dominant reason

for the differential inflation performance on the two sides of the Atlan-

tic (see Figure 1).19 The evidence for this is so striking that it is hard

to understand why it often gets overlooked.

      Consider the following two sets of numbers for annual rates of change

in import prices and consumer prices for the U.S. and the average for the

EEC countries since 1980:




19
     The drop in world relative commodity prices is the dominant factor in
     the overall inflation slowdown while exchange rates have respectively
     enhanced or weakened their effect. For cross—section analyses of Infla-
     tion in the OECD countries emphasizing the key role of import prices
     and exchange rates see Bruno (1980), and Beckerman and Jenkinson
     (1984). See also Gordon (1977).

   Consumer prices: U.S.            10.4      6.2       3.2       4.3

                       EEC          11.1      9.8       7.5       6.3



      A simple reduced form inflation equation for the years 1961—80 (based

 on a pooled   regression prepared two years ago) gives a fairly close post—
 sample prediction of 1982—84 developments for both the U.S. and the EEC.
It considers the inflation rate as a sum of lagged inflation (with a
coefficient of 0.66) and current import price change (with a coefficient
of 0.18) along with a capacity term which is ignored here. This gives the

predicted rates of 7.1, 3.9, 2.7 for the U.S. during 1982—84 and 9.0, 7.6,

6.9 for EEC. The predicted mean inflation    during 1982—84 for the U.S. and

EEC is 4.6 and 7.8, respectively, while the actual rates were 4.6 and 7.9,

not a bad £ it, on the average.

     The real depreciation of European currencies relative to the dollar

thus explains why inflation slowed down so much less fast on the European

continent. It may also help to explain why Europe as a whole was reluctant

to expand and rather adopted contractionary macro policies until very

recently. These helped to support the slowdown in inflation but at a for—

inidable cost in terms of unemployment. Each country by itself will not

expand because it risks running into balance of payments problems and

added pressure on its exchange rate (with inflationary consequences) and

for all countries to expand simultaneously requires more co—ordination

than seems politically feasible, especially since the U.S. must agree to
                                — 22 —


cut its own fiscal deficit pan passu. A turn around in exchange rates,
such as occurred in 1985, could of course alleviate some of the pressure.

On the other hand, too rapid expansion in the OECD countries as a whole

would risk the possibility that relative prices of industrial raw

materials will rise again, but it is a trade—off worth considering.
