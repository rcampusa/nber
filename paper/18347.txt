                                           ABSTRACT

It is often argued that informal labor markets in developing countries promote growth by reducing
the impact of regulation. On the other hand informality may reduce the amount of social protection
offered to workers. We extend the wage-posting framework of Burdett and Mortensen (1998) to allow
heterogeneous firms to decide whether to locate in the formal or the informal sector, as well as set
wages. Workers engage in both off the job and on the job search. We estimate the model using Brazilian
micro data and evaluate the labor market and welfare effects of policies towards informality.

1      Introduction
Informal labour markets are a standard feature of labour markets in developing coun-
tries. These labour markets are generally seen as operating outside the tax and regu-
latory framework of the country, not paying taxes or social security contributions of
any sort, violating minimum wage laws and not complying with employment pro-
tection regulation. It is often argued that as a result they are the engine of growth
because their existence allows firms to operate in an environment where wage and
regulatory costs are lower. On the other hand, informality implies that the amount of
insurance offered to workers is lower. Moreover, informal markets are also subject
to regulatory costs: while formal firms pay income taxes and severance, informal
firms are subject to being caught and fined by the labour authorities. An interesting
policy question is to which degree stricter regulatory codes affect output, sector of
employment and the distribution of wages in the formal and the informal sector.
     The most traditional view associates informality with a subsistence sector in a
segmented labor market market, restricted by the minimum wage and tax laws. Het-
erogeneous workers sort themselves out of heterogeneous sectors according to the
classical representation of a competitive, segmented economy à la Roy. To date, a
large empirical literature has shown evidence against the segmented market view.
They usually find significant job mobility across sectors or workers reporting be-
ing better off by taking up an informal job.1 In accordance with the data and this
literature, our model allows for transitions between formal and informal sectors,
subject to informational frictions and choice. Workers can be exogenously laid off
or can take up a job opportunity in an alternative firm either in the same sector or in
    1 Forexample, Maloney (1999) shows no evidence of segmented markets for Mexico, where tran-
sitions between formal and informal sector seem to be equally probable in both directions. Barros,
Sedlacek and Varandas (1990), Neri (2002) and Curi and Menezes-Filho (2006) analyze Brazil and
also point to the significant mobility between sectors. Furthermore, Maloney et al (2007) shows for
Colombia that informal workers are more satisfied than formal workers in terms of job flexibility.
For Argentina, Pratap and Quintin (2006) findings suggest that informal workers can be as well off
as similar formal workers.

the other, and all the directions of mobility are potentially observable because jobs
(firms) are heterogeneous both between and within sectors. In order to account for
worker heterogeneity, we segment the market across observed characteristics, such
as completed education and gender. Finally, the policy environment is described by
corporate and labour taxes, severance payment, unemployment insurance, a legal
minimum wage and an intensity of monitoring of compliance by firms.
    Our paper relates to that of Albrecht, Navarro and Vroman (2009) who use the
matching framework of Mortensen-Pissarides (1994) to model the informal sector
as unregulated self-employment with fixed productivity, while allowing for hetero-
geneity in the formal sector. Bosch (2006) uses a similar framework and adds het-
erogeneous productivity in the informal sector. The author assumes the two markets
are subject to the same frictions and direct job flows only take place from the infor-
mal to the formal sector, with the assumption that formal workers never accept an
offer from the informal one.2
    The model in this paper presents one major theoretical innovation with respect
to the existing literature. Specifically, our framework adds to the literature of equi-
librium search models with heterogeneous firms and on-the-job search3 by allowing
endogenous choice of sector by firms. We thus allow firms to differ in their pro-
ductivity regardless of the sector in which they operate, implying that any type of
firm could act in a sector, with no ex-ante restriction on whether a sector is more
productive than the other.
    The model is designed for analyzing economies with substantial informal and
formal sectors, found across a wide range of developing economies. Here we es-
timate it using data from Brazil where informality of labour is about 40 percent of
   2 Other   related papers are for example Gabriel Ulyssea (2010), El-Badaoui, Strobl and Walsh
(2010), Boeri and Garibaldi (2005), and Fugazza and Jacques (2003). They use a more simplified
structure for dual economies than that of Albrecht et al. (2009) and Bosch (2006).

the salaried labour force.4 Our main source is the Brazilian Labour Force Survey,
Pesquisa Mensal de Emprego, which provides a rotating panel of individuals sam-
pled from the six main metropolitan regions of Brazil. Finally, the model allows us
to discuss the relative merits of alternative policies towards informality.
   We draw the following conclusions. First, increasing the cost of informality by
10% actually improves welfare. The resulting increased competition among firms
in the formal sector is the main cause, which pushes up wages and thus welfare for
individuals in all states. Moreover, firms that remain informal are more than com-
pensated by the increase in profit margins, following the move of marginal firms to
the formal sector. Second, if we go as far as abolishing informality the results are
more complex. First, in all cases workers’ welfare (including those unemployed)
increases substantially. This is both because they obtain formal jobs that are more
valuable and because in most cases formal sector wages go up due to increased
competition for workers among firms. Average firm profits can either increase or
decrease, depending on the specific market. The extent to which they decrease de-
termines whether welfare will increase or not. Although the model does not predict
just one direction of welfare, in most markets we consider overall welfare goes up
with the abolition of informality.
   In the next section, we present the model. In Section 3, we describe the data and
the details of estimation of the model. In Section 4, we present and comment on the
main results. In Section 5, we examine the effects of changes in the compliance costs
and other policies such as changes in severance and unemployment compensation.
Conclusions are in Section 6.

2    The Equilibrium Search Model
We have in mind a pool of low skilled homogeneous workers that will typically
engage in jobs requiring low training input. This explains why we have decided to
construct a wage-posting model, instead of assuming a bargaining mechanism for
wage setting. Monopsonistic models are indeed usually thought as best suited to
labour markets with an abundant workforce. Productivity differences will arise in
this model because of firm level heterogeneity.
    There are two sectors in the economy, the formal and the informal one. The two
sectors arise because of the existence of taxes and regulations governing the em-
ployment of workers. Imperfect monitoring of compliance with the legal framework
creates profitable opportunities for lower productivity firms to ignore the regula-
tions and operate in the informal sector. The policy environment is described by the
corporation tax on profits, income tax, social security contributions, severance pay
upon laying off a worker and unemployment insurance, which is implicitly funded
by taxes. All these features can be avoided when the worker is employed infor-
mally. However, firms are monitored and if caught not complying they pay a fine.
Firms have a given productivity level, maximize profits and have to decide whether
to comply with the regulations or employ in the informal sector, risking a fine. So
the choice of sector is endogenous, which greatly complicates the determination of
the equilibrium vis-à-vis standard wage-posting models à la Burdett and Mortensen
(1998).
    Workers seek to maximize their expected lifetime income. The flow utility of
workers depends linearly on the wage they receive plus the value of the social se-
curity contributions made by the firm on their behalf, which we include in the wage
measure and are net of any taxes due. Workers also value severance pay and unem-
ployment insurance as will be evident in the value function. The economy is subject
to search frictions and workers search both when unemployed and when they are


                                         5
employed. They also receive competing offers from both sectors. Subscripts with
value 0 denote the unemployed, with value 1 denote the formal sector and with value
2 the informal one.


2.1    Workers

Workers maximize the expected lifetime income discounted at a rate of r. At any
instant, unemployed workers receive an income stream b, taken to be constant across
individuals, regardless of their history. Let W1 (w) and W2 (w) denote the values of a
wage contract w in the formal (sector 1) and the informal sectors (sector 2), and let
U be the value of unemployment.
   Individuals receive job offers according to a Poisson process with arrival rate
λi j , where i = 0, 1, 2 denotes the current state (unemployed, or working in the for-
mal/informal sectors) and j denotes the source of the offer. An offer is an employ-
ment contract promising a fixed wage and, implicitly, specific outside options. In
particular, a worker can receive offers from either sector – indeed we also allow
offers from the informal sector to the formal one and some of these offers may be
worth accepting – and can be laid off at sector-specific rates λi0 , i = 1, 2. Lastly,
Fj , j = 1, 2, defined on [W j ,W j ], denotes the (equilibrium) distribution of (present
values of) contracts from which workers sample their offers. These distributions are
endogenous and the rest of the paper will explain how they are determined.
   The wage in the formal sector represents the entire monetary compensation for
the worker: thus it is after tax but before social security deductions, which are ef-
fectively part of their compensation as it entitles them to a pension and to health
benefits. Pay also includes contributions to pensions made by the employer on be-
half of the worker; in the informal sector no taxes or contributions are made so the
wage is just the gross wage.
   The value functions for each state, namely employed in the informal sector, em-


                                           6
ployed in the formal sector and unemployed describe the optimal behavior of work-
ers. As usual these values combine the immediate gains of being in the sector (e.g.
the wage) together with the resulting option values, such as the possibility of mov-
ing to better jobs within or between sector or the impact of exogenous shocks, such
as the possibility of job destruction leading to unemployment. Thus the value of
working in the informal sector, is


  rW2 (w) = w + λ20 [U −W2 (w)] + λ21 EF1 max{W −W2 (w), 0}

                                                                  + λ22 EF2 max{W −W2 (w), 0},


where EFj , j = 1, 2, takes expectations over a generic contract value W distributed as
Fj in sector j. Later in solving for equilibrium it is useful to rewrite this expression
after integrating by parts,5

                                                    ˆ    W1                        ˆ   W2
   rW2 (w) = w + λ20 [U −W2 (w)] + λ21                        F 1 (x) dx + λ22                F 2 (x) dx,   (1)
                                                     W2 (w)                          W2 (w)


where overlines on distribution functions denote survival functions: F = 1−F. Thus
the flow utility in the informal sector is the wage rate (w) plus the loss that the
individual may incur if laid off, which happens at rate λ20 , as well as the “capital
gain” of obtaining a better offer either from the formal or the informal sector with
rates λ21 and λ22 respectively.
    A similar expression can be derived for the value of working in the formal sector.
The key difference here will be in the definition of the wage, which we discussed
   5 We   make use of the following property. For any random variable X with distribution (CDF) F
on [x, x], and for all u ∈ R,
                                        ˆ    x                           ˆ    x
                   EF max{X − u, 0} =            max{x − u, 0} dF(x) =            F(x) dx.
                                         x                                u

before and in the expression for the loss incurred when moving to unemployment.
We write the value of employment in the formal sector (using the second expression
derived above) as


  rW1 (w) = w + λ10 [U +UI + s · w −W1 (w)]
                                        ˆ W1                  ˆ                  W2
                                  + λ11      F 1 (x) dx + λ12                            F 2 (x) dx. (2)
                                                      W1 (w)                    W1 (w)


The cost of becoming unemployed is mitigated by two factors. The first is unem-
ployment insurance (UI) which we assume for simplicity6 is paid upfront. The sec-
ond term is severance pay s · w, s being the compensation rate in the case of termina-
tion of employment. As we show below, we determine the level of UI endogenously
based on the tax rate used to fund it and on the overall number of unemployed. Both
UI and severance pay increase the value of employment in the formal sector – and
in the informal sector since a transition between the two is possible – and both affect
the equilibrium distribution of wages. The only difference of UI from severance pay
is that the firm directly pays the latter, whereas UI is funded by general taxation.
This distinction will be of importance when we define the firm’s problem. Finally,
since there are no shocks to productivity, jobs are only closed down because of ex-
ogenous job destruction, which may differ depending on the sector, λ10 and λ20 .
    To write the value of unemployment note that in equilibrium, firms will only
offer acceptable wages so that the value at the minimum offered wage, W 1 and W 2 ,
are greater than U, otherwise no production would take place. So the equilibrium
value of unemployment is such that


                              rU = b + λ01 (µ1 −U) + λ02 (µ2 −U),                                   (3)
   6 Specifically   it avoids making the duration of unemployment a state variable if UI is time limited
for example.

where µ1 =    W1    x dF1 (x), µ2 =    W2    x dF2 (x) denote the mean contract values offered
in the formal and the informal sector respectively, and b is the flow-value of leisure..
   Contract values reflect the benefits, opportunities and costs of working in each
sector. They are increasing functions of wages, yet the wage rate alone is not suf-
ficient for ranking jobs across sectors, because each sector comes with different fu-
ture opportunities. It is thus possible that a move across sectors is accompanied by a
pay-cut. However in this model mobility within the sector can only take place when
accompanied by a wage rise, which has to imply a move to a higher productivity
firm. This is because there is no other source of heterogeneity (such as productivity
shocks) and because firms do not respond to outside offers.


2.2    Steady-State Worker Flows

The value functions discussed above describe the optimal choices of workers and are
conditional on the wage offer distributions in the formal and informal sectors. These
are equilibrium objects. To derive them we need to define the steady state flow of
workers between the three states (unemployment, formal and informal employment)
as well as the behavior of the firms. In steady state, the stocks of workers and firms
in each sector and in each part of the contract value distribution remains stable. We
now define these flows and use them to solve for the steady state stocks and for the
relationship between the equilibrium contract offer distribution and accepted offers.
   Define the fraction of the labour force in each sector to be mi , i = 1, 2, and the un-
employment rate to be u = 1 − m1 − m2 . Let G1 (W ) and G2 (W ) be the distributions
of accepted contract values in the formal and informal sectors, respectively: they
denote the proportion of the stock of individuals with a contract value lower than or
equal to W , respectively. First we define flows in and out of the formal sector along




                                                  9
the cumulative distribution of accepted contracts. Thus, for any W ∈ [W 1 ,W 1 ],

   λ10 + λ11 F 1 (W ) m1 G1 (W ) + λ12 m1                 F 2 (x) dG1 (x)
                                                    W1
                                                               ˆ   W
                                  = λ01 uF1 (W ) + λ21 m2              [F1 (W ) − F1 (x)] dG2 (x). (4)
                                                                 W2


The mass of workers in the formal sector at or below contract value G1 (W ) is
m1 G1 (W ). Some of these are destroyed because of exogenous layoffs (λ10 ), receipt
of offers valued more than W from other formal firms, and receipt of acceptable of-
fers from the informal sector.7 On the right hand side is the balancing job creation.
Jobs are created with contract values below W in the formal sector, in when the un-
employed accept offers less than W or workers in the informal sector receive and
accept offers whose value is lower than W .8
    Similarly we can also define the flow equation for the informal sector. For W ∈
[W 2 ,W 2 ],

  �                  �
                                                  ˆ   W

                                                               ˆ   W
                                  = λ02 uF2 (W ) + λ12 m1              [F2 (W ) − F2 (x)] dG1 (x). (5)
                                                                 W1


    In Appendix A we show how to (uniquely) solve equations (4) and (5) for the
distributions of accepted contracts G1 and G2 given the distribution of offered con-
tracts F1 and F2 . There exists an equilibrium relationship between the distribution of

not only the ones leading to higher contract values than W.

where Φ(W ) ≡ Φ[F1 , F2 ](W ) is an operator on F1 and F2 that is derived in Appendix
A, and that is nil for all W ≤ max{W 1 ,W 2 }, and where, in the denominator,


                       d1 (W ) = λ10 + λ11 F 1 (W ) + λ12 F 2 (W ),               (8)

                       d2 (W ) = λ20 + λ21 F 1 (W ) + λ22 F 2 (W ),               (9)


are the total job destruction rates in sectors 1 and 2.
   Straightforwardly, we can also derive expressions for the proportion of workers
in each sector and in unemployment, by setting W (in equations (6) and (7) equal to
its largest value and making use of the fact that m1 + m2 + u = 1:

                               m1     λ01 − Φ(W 1 )
                                  =                      ,                      (10)

                                  =                      ,                      (11)
                               u    λ20 + λ21 F 1 (W 2 )

   Hence, knowledge of the distribution of wage offers by the formal sector, F1 , and
the informal sector F2 , allows us to infer the steady state stocks of employment (m1
and m2 ) and unemployment (u) as well as the equilibrium distribution of accepted
wages G1 and G2 that are observable. This is not a full characterization of equilib-
rium; we now need to show how the offer distributions F1 and F2 and the decision to
post offers in one or the other sector are determined. This depends on firm behavior


                                           11
to which we now turn.


2.3   Firms

Firms maximize profits by choosing in which sector to operate and the wage they
will post, which determines the size of their labour force, given their specific pro-
ductivity p. In the formal sector there are a number of costs associated with hiring a
worker at a wage rate w. These include payroll taxes (τ), corporate taxes on profits
(t) and severance payments (s · w) to workers who are laid off. Finally, these firms
may be subject to minimum wage laws wmin , which imply that firms cannot nec-
essarily adjust pay to offset the effects of severance pay (Lazear, 1990). Informal
labour markets are monitored randomly by the government authorities whose role
is to enforce tax and labour laws. When caught a firm has to pay a fine depending
on its size. We denote as C(�2 ) the expected cost of informality, assumed convex in
firm size �2 . This function will have to be estimated from the data, based on firm
behavior.
   The strategy of the firm is to choose a contract value (or wage) to offer any
worker it contacts. The strategy will determine the attractiveness and hence the size
of the firm and hence in equilibrium there is a tradeoff between low labour costs and
size. There are no adjustment costs and, conditional on the wage they pay workers,
no dynamics in the decision problem of the firms. They just choose a wage and thus
implicitly a contract value W to maximize profit flows.
   Specifically, firms will offer optimal contracts K1 (p) and K2 (p) that solve the
following profit maximization problems given productivity p:


      π1 (p) =          max         (1 − t) [p − (1 + τ + λ10 s)w1 (W )] �1 (W ),   (13)
                 W ≥max{U,W1 (wmin )}

      π2 (p) =          max             [p − w2 (W )] �2 (W ) −C(�2 (W )),          (14)
                 W ≥max{U,W2 (wmin )}



                                                12
where �1 (W ) and �2 (W ) are the size of informal and formal firms respectively, of-
fering a wage contract worth W , and w j (W ) denotes the wage to be paid to a worker
in sector j corresponding to a contract value W.
      The wage functions w1 (W ) and w2 (W ) are the wages defined by W1 (w) = W and
W2 (w) = W , from equations (2) and (1) respectively. That is,

                                                            ˆ   W1                      ˆ   W2
(1+λ10 s)w1 (W ) = (r +λ10 )W −λ10 (U +UI)−λ11                       F 1 (x) dx−λ12              F 2 (x) dx,
                                                             W                           W
                                                                                                   (15)
and

                                            ˆ   W1                      ˆ   W2
      w2 (W ) = (r + λ20 )W − λ20U − λ21             F 1 (x) dx − λ22            F 2 (x) dx.       (16)
                                             W                           W


      In steady-state, the flow of workers leaving the workforce of any firm (d1 (W )�1 (W )
and d2 (W )�2 (W ) for the two sectors respectively) should be equal to the inflow of
new hires. Hence,

                                           1 h1 (W )
                                 �1 (W ) =            ,                                            (17)
                                           n1 d1 (W )
                                           1 h2 (W )
                                 �2 (W ) =            ,                                            (18)
                                           n2 d2 (W )

where n1 and n2 are the (endogenous) proportions of firms in the formal and informal
sector respectively, h1 (W ) and h2 (W ) denote the share of contacts between firms and
workers willing to accept a job paid W , i.e.


                   h1 (W ) = λ01 u + λ11 m1 G1 (W ) + λ21 m2 G2 (W ),                              (19)

                   h2 (W ) = λ02 u + λ12 m1 G1 (W ) + λ22 m2 G2 (W ),                              (20)


and d1 (W ) and d2 (W ) are the total job destruction rates (equation (8) and (9))).



                                             13
2.4    Equilibrium Productivity Distributions

A key element of our model is that firms decide whether to post vacancies in the
formal or the informal sector as well as what wage to post. In equilibrium all strate-
gies (given productivity) will yield equal profits, a property we now use to determine
how firms locate. Because of the various costs of employing workers in the formal
sector, we can expect firms with lower productivity to locate in the informal sector,
at least in the presence of minimum wages, if expected fines for informality are not
too high. However, there may be a range of productivities over which, in equilib-
rium, firms are indifferent between the two sectors; indeed this turns out to be the
case. This is a particularly important feature of the model with key implications for
the welfare effects of policies towards informality. Of course, the fact that firms of
both types coexist over a productivity range does not mean they will have the same
size or pay the same rates; quite the contrary and we will discuss this later.
   We assume that there exists a number of potential entrants, normalized to one,
with a distribution of productivity Γ0 (p) on [p, p]. In equilibrium we will obtain a
measure of productivities in each sector. We denote the equilibrium measure of pro-
ductivity in each sector by Γ j (p) ( j = 1, 2). At the equilibrium, each firm maximises
profit flows given the equilibrium contract distributions. Hence,


                                Γ1 (p) = n1 F1 (K1 (p)),                            (21)

                                Γ2 (p) = n2 F2 (K2 (p)).                            (22)


   Denote the support of the measure for informal firms to be [p2 , p2 ] and for formal
firms [p1 , p], where it is possible that to have overlap in the supports, i.e. p2 > p1 .
As discussed above, we expect that the equilibrium is such that the initial interval
of productivity will be occupied by informal firms only, i.e. p2 < p1 , and wage
offers may be below the formal minimum wage. For p1 ≤ p ≤ p2 , firms operate in


                                           14
both sectors. We also allow for the possibility that there is a range of productivities
(p > p2 ) where firms operate only in the formal sector. Given this, we shall consider
equilibria displaying the following regimes.

   1. Inactivity: For p ≤ p < p2 , π1 (p) < 0, π2 (p) < 0, and Γ1 (p) = Γ2 (p) = 0.
      This is important to consider when discussing counterfactual policy experi-
      ments

   2. Informal sector only: For p2 ≤ p ≤ p1 , π1 (p) < π2 (p), Γ1 (p) = 0, and
      Γ2 (p) = Γ0 (p) − Γ0 (p2 ). It is possible that this interval is just zero, mean-
      ing that the first relevant interval is the next one. The existence of this interval
      depends on the relative importance of formal labor market regulation and the
      costs of informality.

   3. Overlapping region: In this region formal and informal firms of identical
      productivity coexist and make the same profits: For p1 ≤ p ≤ p2 , π1 (p) =
      π2 (p), and
                              Γ1 (p) + Γ2 (p) = Γ0 (p) − Γ0 (p2 ).


   4. Formal sector only: For all p ≥ p2 , π1 (p) > π2 (p), Γ2 (p) = Γ2 (p2 ), and


                              Γ1 (p) = Γ0 (p) − Γ2 (p2 ) − Γ0 (p2 ).


If there is a range of productivities where only formal firms operate, this will be in
the higher range. Implicit in this assertion is that informality profits are increasing
slower than formal profits, possibly because rapidly increasing costs of informality.
For example, if the probability of detection as well as the fines increase fast enough
with firm size, this will lead to convex costs of informality, making participation in
that sector unprofitable. However, we cannot exclude the theoretical possibility that
informal firms operate at all levels of productivity.

                                            15
    The computation of the equilibrium is not trivial. The way we calculate equi-
librium distributions Fj and sectors sizes n j is described in Appendix B. Note that,
intuitively, what happens in the tail left to threshold p2 is irrelevant. Hence, many
distributions Γ0 are compatible with the same equilibrium. For any distribution Γ0
                                                                  �0 (p) = Γ0 (p)−Γ0 (p2 ) deliv-

                                                                                            n

                                                                                           2
                                                                                             .
This remark will take full sense when we discuss the identification and estimation
of the productivity distribution.
    The nature of this equilibrium has interesting implications because it can ex-
plain two seemingly contradictory assertions: first, we would expect compensating
differentials to increase wages of the workers taking informal jobs: in the overlap-
ping region the informal firms may have to offer higher wages than equivalent (in
productivity) formal firms to make up for the lack of UI and severance pay and to
account for the different labor market opportunities. However, there are more for-
mal jobs at higher levels of productivity than at lower ones. This will imply that on
average formal workers will be paid more than informal ones due to a composition
effect. Hence the model can explain what is observed in the data and at the same
time imply compensating differentials as we would expect.



3     Data

3.1    The Brazilian labour force survey (PME)

Our main source of data consists of a panel of individuals of working age, sampled
by the labour force survey of Brazil, Pesquisa Mensal de Emprego (PME). PME was
designed and conducted by the National Statistics Bureau to follow individuals of
the six main metropolitan regions of Brazil. Each individual is interviewed during
four consecutive months, then for another four consecutive months one year after

                                               16
their entry into the sample. The sample period starts in January 2002 and goes until
December 2007.9
    For the purpose of this paper, we select workers from age 23, where the chance
of returning to full time education is very low, up to age 65 who are found to be
either unemployed10 or working as an employee (registered or unregistered). Our
definition of formal workers in this paper is thus whether the worker’s current job
is registered with the Ministry of Labour.11 In Brazil, there is a federal minimum
wage, which should be the minimum paid to all formal employees. The average
legal minimum wage over the sample period is of 300 reais per month.12 Workers
under a formal contract found to earn less than the minimum wage were removed
from the sample (8% of formal workers). We believe this is due to reporting error
and we similarly discard the 5% lowest wages out of the informal workers sample,
thus excluding mostly the zero-wage earners and some part-time jobs. We also trim
the very top wages (0.01% highest of the sample).
    Table 1 shows the proportions of workers unemployed, formal salaried and in-
formal salaried, by year. The cross-sectional sample contains about 66% of formal
salaried workers, 20% of informal salaried and 14% of unemployed. Over the period
2002-2007, we observe a large increase in the proportion of formal wage workers.
In particular, substantial changes have taken place more recently with the propor-
tion of formal workers increasing from 64% in 2004 to 68% in 2007. Over the same
period, we observe a relatively large drop in the proportion unemployed.
   9 Due   to methodological changes in the PME data with effect from 2002, we opted to use only
PME from year 2002. The first reason is that we solve for the steady-state, which is an assumption
hard to defend over a long period of time. The second reason is that PME from year 2002 contains
retrospective information about duration of the actual employment, which we need to identify job-
to-job transitions.
   10 We take out unemployed whose last job was not as an employee. By doing so, we exclude mostly

unemployed who once was self-employed or inactive, e.g. individuals whose behavior deviate from
the predictions of our model.
   11 The job is registered if the worker reports having a worker’s card, which means that the workers

is protected by the Employment laws.
   12 All wages are in reais of June of 2008.

            Note: Brazilian Labor Force Survey 2002-2007, individuals aged 23-65. The
            values are percentages of individuals according to their working status at the
            first interview.



    Now, looking at our measure of informality (proportion of informal employees
in the population 23 to 65 years old), we see that a significant fraction of the work-
force is informal in the six largest metropolitan regions of Brazil, an average of
21% of the active workforce. As Table 1 shows, informality increased in our data
until 2004 following the same trend observed since the 80s in the country. There-
after informality decreased coinciding with an improvement in the business cycle.
Our model does not distinguish across periods. However, one could estimate over
different sub-periods to obtain a structural interpretation of the changes over time.
    We follow individuals for up to four months or until their first move (if that
is sooner). This can be job-to-job, unemployment-to-job or job-to-unemployment,
where the job can be in the formal or in the informal sector.13 At the date of the
first interview, we observe the worker’s employment status, the duration of the spell
(time elapsed) and the wage earned. From the subsequent three months, we construct
the censoring indicator (equal to one if the individual or data is missing in all three
following months), the remaining time in the status and the transition indicators.
We identify job-to-job transitions using the survey question on job duration.14 For
example, we classify a worker as a non-mover in the third month of the interview
if she/he does not change status (e.g. remains formal) and declares that the current
  13 We   do not use the entire sixteen-months window of PME due to attrition problems.
  14 This  question is only available in PME after year 2002.


                                                   18
spell has lasted more than three months, i.e. more than the period that passed since
the last interview.
    Table 2 presents information on the transitions based on all sample and by region.
The average exit rate from unemployment towards the formal sector is about 10%
and towards the informal one 15% implying an overall duration of unemployment
of 11 months. Exit from unemployment to an informal sector job is more frequent
and counter-cyclical judging from the exit rates over the downturn years of 2003 and
2004. Exit to the formal sector is trending up.
    Job to job mobility is much higher among informal workers than formal ones,
both within the informal sector and from informal to formal. Relatively to all tran-
sitions which occur by sector, the transitions from the formal to the informal sector
are quite high compared to the transitions from the informal to the formal sector. Fi-
nally, the transitions towards the formal sector have increased recently, as reflected
in the decrease in the rate of informality.
    When we break these down by region, Recife and Salvador which are less de-
veloped have a higher unemployment rate (18%) than the better off regions of Sao
Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Porto Alegre (12%).15 However, the
level of development does not have an obvious relationship either to the degree of
informality or to the turnover rates.
    The way the model is set up, workers are homogeneous.16 We thus focus on
low education workers and estimate the model separately by sex. This implicitly
assumes that the labour markets are segmented for these groups and they do not
compete directly. We define low education to mean those with eight or less years
  15 Over  the period of analysis (2002-2007), the average GDP per capita in 2008 prices for the
Recife and Salvador regions were respectively 3.6 and 3.9 thousand dollars, whereas for Sao Paulo,
Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Porto Alegre the figures were about twice as much or more: 11.2,
9.8, 6.2 and 8.5 thousand dollars, respectively.
   16 Ridder and Van den Berg (2003) assume segmented markets with workers with same ability

within market, but different across markets. Bontemps, Robin and Van den Berg (1999) include
worker heterogeneity within market through differences in the value of leisure. Shephard (2009)
uses this to consider the incidence of tax credits in a model with search frictions.

of schooling. We also estimate the model separately for two regions with clearly
distinct labour markets, namely Sao Paulo and Salvador. The former is a well de-
veloped low unemployment economy, while the latter is characterized by very high
levels of unemployment. Separating these regions is important, because both the job
destruction rates and the arrival rates are likely to be very different. Our empirical
work treats these as independent local labor markets.
   Table 3 displays the composition of workers at the date of the first interview by
region and sex, the informality rate and turnover information. Informality is 3-4
percentage points higher among females, regardless of the region. Transitions out of
unemployment in Salvador are much lower than in Sao Paulo, but within Salvador
these transitions are much higher among males than females. Transitions out of
formal jobs are similar for males and females in Sao Paulo, but again the turnover
is larger among males than females in Salvador. On the contrary, the exit rate from
informal sector jobs to formal ones is 2.6 times larger for males than for females in
Sao Paulo and more similar across males and females in Salvador.
   In Table 4 we show summary statistics of wages by region and sex and formal
versus informal sector. On average, within each region and sector, males are paid
more than females. Formal (informal) workers and those located in Sao Paulo (Sal-
vador) earn more (less). The amount of wage dispersion (measured by the standard
deviation of log wages) is larger for males than for females in both regions. The
standard deviation of wages in the informal sector is larger than in the formal sector
across all groups and more pronouncedly in Sao Paulo.


3.2   Specification and Estimation

The estimation problem is much more complicated than for the standard Burdett-
Mortensen model, such as discussed in Bontemps et al. (2000). Because of the
endogenous choice of sector activity, the market equilibrium sets two distributions of

labour contracts and two distributions for the productivities of firms operating in the
formal and informal sectors. A new estimation strategy had to be devised such that
the distributions of contract values have first to be guessed so as to verify equilibrium
conditions given observables. Then, the distributions of firm productivities can be
identified through profit-maximizing restrictions.


3.2.1   Offer Distributions

In Section 2.2, we have derived the way the offer distributions Fj (W ), j = 1, 2, are
related to the accepted contract distributions G j (W ), j = 1, 2. Adjusting these for
the fact that they are defined in the contract space rather than in the wage space, the
latter are observed and hence we can then estimate non-parametrically the offer dis-
tributions. However, we simplify the estimation problem by specifying a parametric




                                           23
distribution as approximation, namely a non standard beta distribution:
                                    �                     �
                                         x −W j
               Fj (x) = betacdf                    ; α j , β j ,W j ≤ x ≤ W j ,
                                        W j −W j

where betacdf(·; α, β ) is the CDF of a beta distribution with parameters α and β .
    Let F1 and F2 be two candidate offer distributions, defined on the spaces of con-
tract present values. Let G∗1 and G∗2 denote the observable distributions of wages in
both sectors. By construction, G∗1 (w) = G1 (W1 (w)), where W1 (w) is the value of
wage contract w derived in equation (2). A similar restriction holds for the infor-
mal sector. Given F1 and F2 we can use equations (6) and (7) to calculate G1 and
G2 . The estimation algorithm first aims at finding the couple of offer distributions
(F1 , F2 ) that best matches (G∗1 , G∗2 ) with (G1 ◦W1 , G2 ◦W2 ). An important practical
reason why a parametric specification is useful is that, in order to calculate the func-
tion Φ of equations (6) and (7), and other transition rates (see below), we need to
calculate offer densities f1 = F1� and f2 = F2� . Assuming a parametric specification
guarantees the smoothness of both the distribution function and its derivative.
    To estimate the parameters we use the method of moments. We match the dis-
tribution of wages for each sector and the transition rates implied by the model to
those observed in the data. Given the above specification, we need to estimate the
six arrival rates and the two job destruction rates all denoted by λ = (λi j )i, j=0,1,2
and six further parameters θ = (W 1 ,W 1 ,W 2 ,W 2 , α1 , β1 , α2 , β2 ) characterizing the
offer distribution. Our algorithm estimates θ given the λ . We then update the latter.
Although we could iterate on all parameters at the same time, this turned out to be a
very quick procedure in practice.
    Given the λ we estimate θ by minimizing the quadratic distance

estimated from the data and evaluated at the implied grids for wages: w jk ≡ w j (W jk ),
using equations (15) and (16); and G j (W jk ) is the distribution of contracts in the
population of employed workers implied by the model and which depends on all
parameters (θθ and λ ).
   We use Chebyshev nodes for the grid of contract values and we replace the inte-
grals in contract spaces by Clenshaw-Curtis (CC) quadrature approximations. Com-
putational details are provided in Appendix C.


3.2.2   Transition Rates

In a similar way as we estimate θ given λ , we can estimate λ given θ by matching
the appropriate moments. In the data we observe the proportion of workers in state
i = 0, 1, 2 at the beginning of the survey moving to state j = 0, 1, 2 before the end of
                               � i j ). We can use the model to compute the theoretical
the survey, lasting T periods (D
counterparts to these proportions (Di j ) as we show in Appendix C. For example the
proportion who were in a formal sector job and move to an alternative job within the
same sector is given by

                                 W1
                                      λ11 F 1 (x)
                             ˆ
                     D11 =                        (1 − e−d1 (x)T ) dG1 (x).
                             W1         d1 (x)

Now, in equilibrium,
                                        1 h1 (x) m1 dG1 (x)
                           �1 (x) =               =            ,
                                        n1 d1 (x)   n1 dF1 (x)

allowing to replace the derivative of G1 by that of F1 inside the integral. Then CC-
quadrature can be used to approximate the integral.




                                               25
    We thus estimate λ given θ by minimizing the criterion

pute the implied amount using the government budget constraint

where D10 is the average transition probability from a formal sector job to unemploy-
               �∗ is the estimated wage distribution. Remember that UI is paid
ment and where G 1

to workers at the moment of transition into unemployment; hence this calculation is
useful for constructing an amount that is consistent with the expected expenditure
by Brazil and with the way we model UI.
    Having estimated the contract values in both sectors and having set U to be equal
to W 2 (the legal minimum wage is not enforced in the informal sector and hence the
minimum observed wage is the reservation wage) we can use the value function for
the unemployed (3) to estimate the value of leisure, b.17
  17 An  important issue here is measurement error. At present we have not allowed for wages to be
measure with error. If we did, this would affect the estimation of the the distributions G and the value
of leisure b.

3.2.4   Productivity Distribution

Up to this point, there has been no need to use the firm profit functions, the costs
of informality, or indeed the distribution of productivities: the arrival rates, the job
destruction rates and the wage offer distribution can be identified purely from the
distribution of wages and the transition rates. The offer distribution implicitly de-
pends on the costs of informality however. Thus, counterfactual policy simulations
require an explicit specification and estimation of the costs of informality, which
will allow us to compute the new equilibrium.
   We specify the cost function as C = c�2 (W )γ , with c and γ being the parameters
to be estimated. Given values for c and γ, and for n1 and n2 such that n1 + n2 ≤ 1,
                                                                       1 h1 (W )
we solve for the labour force size in the formal sector (�1 (W ) =     n1 d1 (W ) )   and in the
                             1 h2 (W )
informal sector (�2 (W ) =   n2 d2 (W ) ).   From the firm’s maximization problem in each
sector, we can derive the way contracts and productivities are related. We start by
deriving the support of productivities in each sector and and we then show how we
derive the entire distributions. The key point is that firm profits, given productivity
are equalized, across sectors.
   To derive the support note that the first order conditions for the firm’s optimiza-
tion problem (see (13), (14)) gives

                                                               �1 (W )

where the expressions for w�j (W ) and for ��j (W ), as well as further details, are given
in the appendix.
   For each point of the contract grids, W jk , one can thus calculate a point p jk =
K −1
  j (W jk ) on a productivity grid, with p2 = p20 , p1 = p10 , p2 = p2N and p1 = p1N ,




                                                27
allowing the calculation of the productivity distributions as


                    Γ j (p jk ) = n j · Fj (W jk ), j = 1, 2, k = 0, ..., N.


   To estimate the remaining parameters, c and γ, and n1 and n2 , we use the equilib-
rium conditions requiring that π2 (p2 ) = 0, and π1 (p) = π2 (p) > 0 for p ∈ [p1 , p2 ].
We thus estimate c and γ, and n1 and n2 such that n1 + n2 = 1, so as to minimize

                               M
                        2

                             k,k =0


where K is a kernel density.

with the additional restriction: Γ0 (p2 ) = 0. This distribution is the exogenous dis-
tribution of productivity truncated below at p2 . There is no way one can identify the
portion of the distribution below p2 .


3.3    Endogenous Arrival Rates: Estimating a Matching Function



Counterfactual simulations in a general equilibrium framework require accounting
for the impact of policy on arrival rates, as the number of job seekers and the num-
ber of firms in the two sectors react to policy changes. To estimate the relationship


                                               28
between arrival rates and search activity we specify a matching function f (θ ), de-
scribing the flow of matches as a function of market tightness (the effective number
of firms divided by the effective number of job seekers).18 This is combined with
an assumption about the way these contacts are allocated between the formal and
the informal sector. We then identify the parameters of this model by imposing the
restriction implied by the matching functions on the job arrival rates separately for
each submarket using minimum distance.
    Define market tightness as

                                              n1 + αn2
                                     θ=                      .                                 (26)
                                           u + s1 m1 + s2 m2

where s1 and s2 are the search effort of those employed in the formal and the in-
formal sector respectively relative the search effort of the unemployed s0 , which we
normalize to one. Define the flow of contacts by the matching function f (θ ) = µθ η .
We assume that the probability of an offer from the formal sector is n1 /(n1 + αn2 )
and the informal one αn2 /(n1 + αn2 ), where α denotes relative visibility of infor-
mal vacancies in the market. Given these specifications, the job offer arrival rates to
workers in state i = 0, 1, 2 from the formal and the informal sector, can be written
respectively as

                                                n1
                                 λi1 =                  si f (θ );                             (27)
                                            (n1 + αn2 )

                                                αn2
                                 λi2 =                  si f (θ ).                             (28)
                                            (n1 + αn2 )

    We do not attempt to estimate η, but we try alternatives based on the range of
   18 Since firms will hire anyone they meet offering them their posted wage the effective number

of firms relative to the effective number of job seekers is equivalent to the number of vacancies per
worker searching.

4       Results
We focus our estimation for low education individuals, for whom individual hetero-
geneity is probaby less important. We present estimates separately for males and
females and for two contrasting regions of Brazil: wealthy and dynamic Sao Paulo
and the poorer region of Salvador, allowing us to see how the welfare effects of
policy towards informality may change with the context.


4.1      The Model Fit

Table 5 presents evidence on the fit of the model. The model is capable of repli-
cating well the proportions of workers in the formal and informal sectors and the
unemployed and particularly well all the transitions between sectors. The distri-
bution of wages is also very well replicated, although the fit is not always perfect,
particularly at the lower tail.


4.2      Frictional Parameters and the Level of Informality

Table 6 shows the estimates for the job destruction and the job arrival rates with as-
sociated standard errors obtained using 500 bootstrap replications.20 The estimated
job destruction rates are three to five times as high in the informal sector as in the
formal one. However, even informal jobs seem to be very stable, with an expected
duration of nearly five years in the absence of job to job mobility. Unemployed
    19 Theelasticity of the matching function with respect to vacancies η is usually estimated in the
range 0.3-0.5 (see, Petrongolo and Pissarides, 2001).
   20 The unit of time is a month. Subscript 0 refers to unemployment, 1 refers to the formal sector

and 2 to the informal. The arrival rates λi j denote an offer arriving from sector j to someone currently
in sector i.

workers receive twice to three times as many job offers relative to those employed
in both regions. Interestingly, the arrival rates of offers from other informal jobs is
higher for individuals already working in either sector than for those who are un-
employed. It is also easier to locate formal jobs once working in the formal sector.
However, obtaining formal job offers while working in the informal sector is much
harder than when unemployed.
    Comparing across regions, Sao Paulo has higher destruction rates than Salvador
in the informal sector, while for both regions the destruction rates in the formal
sector are very small. Effectively formal jobs last a very long time. In the more
dynamic Sao Paulo informal jobs in particular, seem to be created and destroyed at
a much higher rate. Within sector offer rates are similar in both regions; however
in Sao Paulo the chance of obtaining an offer from the formal sector when in an
informal job, although low, is substantially higher than in Salvador. However the
key differences between the regions seems to be in job destruction rates and in offers
received when unemployed.
    These differences reflect themselves in the implied unemployment rates: that of
Salvador is twice that of Sao Paulo (Table 5), which mirrors the data. The implied
proportion of formal and informal firms are essentially the same across markets

(about 30%; see Table 7) – there is no data counterpart to this. The estimates of the
matching function that relates these transition rates to market tightness are shown
in Table 8. According to these estimates informal jobs are 4-6 times as visible as
formal ones. Moreover, search intensity is higher among the employed than the
unemployed in all submarkets but those for males in Sao Paulo.


4.2.1   Informality Cost and the Value of Leisure

Table 9 presents the implied cost to the firm of remaining informal. This cost arises
from random monitoring and imposition of fines. We report the parameters of the
cost function, C = c�2 (W )γ , and the mean cost per unit of profit. The costs are linear
in firm size for Sao Paulo and strictly convex for Salvador. In both cases the gradient

c is very high for both males and females. These features imply that informality will
be concentrated among smaller firms as we would expect. This is an interesting
result particularly given that we do not observe firms directly.
    In the last column of Table 9 we present the estimated flow value of leisure.
These are lower in Sao Paulo for each gender. Moreover, women value leisure much
more than for men, possibly reflecting the demands of families and home production.
The differences across regions are not significant in this case.


4.3     Formal and Informal Sector Productivity and Wages

A key feature of the equilibrium we describe is that given productivity, both formal
and informal firms can coexist. This can have important policy implications. Poli-
cies that reduce informality will not necessarily shut down all jobs in this part of the
productivity distribution; on the other hand this should not be taken to imply that
such an exercise will be costless, because lower levels of productivity may be able
to sustain only smaller and fewer formal firms, given the amount of competition for
workers and the overall regulatory costs. We consider these issues by first describing


                                                  34
the equilibrium that results from our estimates and subsequently by counterfactual
simulations.
   Based on the estimates we can back out the implied allocation of workers to
the formal and the informal sector for different levels of productivity, as well as
the pay structure. The results are presented in Tables 10 and 11 for low education
males, and in Tables 12 and 13 for low education women, in Sao Paulo and Salvador,
respectively.
   For males the lowest point of support of the productivity distribution is similar
for both Sao Paulo and Salvador. However, all other percentiles are lower in Sal-
vador, reflecting lower productivity and lower wages. In Sao Paulo there is less than
six percent of firms in the formal sector below the 10th percentile of the productivity
distribution. In Salvador formal firms start operating at a level of productivity above
the 25th percentile. In both markets, informality is to be found at decreasing rates at
all levels of productivity, but the size of formal firms increases rapidly.
   One of the most interesting features of the model is the implied wage structure.
First, comparing wages and productivities the implied rents are quite high and partic-
ularly so for low productivity firms. In both labor markets frictions imply substantial
rents accruing to firms, which of course can motivate welfare improving policies.
   Second, the results justify two seemingly contradictory statements. Wages are
on average higher in the formal sector than in the informal one, because the formal
firms become increasingly large as productivity increases and wages increase with
productivity (as indeed in the standard Burdett and Mortensen model): this is a
composition effect. However, given productivity, for the most part formal firms
pay less than informal ones: this is a compensating differential for the UI, pension
entitlements and severance pay, although frictions and different job arrival rates will
imply that the relationship is not one-to-one with these benefits. This differential
declines and even gets reversed at the highest levels of productivity.



                                           35
    The overall picture is similar for women with some small differences: first for-
mal firms in Salvador start operating at a higher point of the distribution of pro-
ductivity like in the male market; second the wage structure is different and the
distribution of productivities do have different shapes. Comparing the wage struc-
tures is not straightforward because of the differing productivities of the jobs they
tend to work and the resulting changes in composition. However, male wages in the
formal sector are more dispersed than those of females in both regions.
    Table 14 presents male and female wages for the two regions by sector and over-
all, at the same productivity level. In all cases, but the informal sector of Salvador,
women are paid more conditional on productivity, for lower productivity levels. This
is reversed at the higher productivity levels. Thus women in most cases seem to
work in more competitive labour markets with lower monopsony power for firms.
However, on average women are paid less than men because most of them work in
lower productivity (and hence lower paid) jobs. In other words the model interprets
discrimination as being due to the type of jobs in the female labour market.



5    Policy Analysis
The model aims at providing a framework for understanding the impact of reduc-
ing or eliminating informality in an equilibrium setting. The latter is crucial here,
because we need to know how the wage structure will change and what will be the
overall welfare loss from such policies after allowing firms to relocate sector in re-
sponse to the policy change. Note that we can only simulate reforms that decrease
the number of operating firms (increase p2 ), as we have not identified the part of Γ0
below the inferred minimum productivity in the sample.
    We simulate an increase in UI which we briefly discuss below. We then con-
sider a policy that increases the cost of informality (possibly as a result of improved

detection rates or fines). We then simulate a bold counterfactual, where we close
down completely the informal sector. Table 15 reports estimates of the effects of
these changes on the composition of the workforce, firm size and welfare, for the
San Paolo region and for low-education males. Table 16 reports the effects on the
wage distributions and Table 17 the effects on the distributions of firm productivi-
ties. Tables in Appendix D show results for other groups. Here we summarize the
implications.


5.1       Unemployment Insurance and Severance

We consider an increase of UI by 100%: although this sounds a lot, UI in Brazil
is quite low particularly because it is time limited: we increase it from one to two
minimum wages per month, payable for three months.21 In our model such a policy
encourages employment, rather than the opposite, because it is payable upfront and
because once employed individuals have no endogenous incentive to quit – the only
way to claim again is to be laid off due to exogenous job destruction. In reality claim-
ing UI after expiration requires six months legal work. Changing UI will change the
  21 UI benefit ranges from 1 to about 2 minimum wages monthly, depending on the average of the
three last wages received from last job, and are payable up to 5 months, depending on the last job
spell. The majority of low education workers are entitled to 1 minimum wage per month during about
3 months.


                                               39
equilibrium distribution because it will increase the relative attractiveness of formal
jobs, it will increase the cost of formal employment and it will increase corporation
taxes, which is the source of funding - all our simulations keep government revenue
constant.
   We only summarize the results. As we expect the effects of increasing UI from
such a low base are small but interesting: the increase in UI decreases overall welfare
because it decreases firm profits without increasing worker welfare. This is because
it increases the supply of workers to formal firms, which now become a bit larger,
although some lower productivity formal firms become informal. The resulting shift
increases the profits in the formal sector but decreases informal profits, with the
net effect being no change in worker’s welfare and an overall drop in firm profits.
Increasing severance pay by 5 percentage points has a very small negative effect on
welfare which can be related mainly to a small decline in formal profits.


5.2    Increasing the Cost of Informality

We now consider a 10% increase in the costs of informality. The reform is revenue
neutral; any increase in revenue from fines is redistributed by reducing corporation
tax. As seen in Table 15 this increases the proportion of formal firms, reduces unem-
ployment and increases the proportion of workers in the formal sector. The resulting
average firm size declines.
   The movements also lead to changes in the distribution of wages: as seen in
Table 16, mean wages in the informal sector in Sao Paulo decline by 8% and the
distribution (within that sector) becomes more compressed. Formal sector wages in-
crease above the 25th percentile. Firms that are relocating to the formal sector tend
to be the higher productivity informal firms. Thus competition at the higher levels of
productivity increases and leads to more rents being captured by the workers. More-
over, with the increase in revenues from fines in the informal sector, the corporation


                                          40
tax decreases. The net effect is an increase in welfare overall (Table 15) and for all
concerned (formal and informal workers and firms as well as the unemployed). In
particular, the welfare of formal workers increases because their wages go up, due
to the increased competition; informal workers and the unemployed are also better
off because the value of a formal sector job, that they may move to, has increased.
This more than counteracts the decline in informal sector wages.
   For females in Sao Paulo, (Tables D.1 and D.2) the proportion of formal firms do
not increase but the proportion of formal workers increases by 3 percentage poins
(pp) and there is a decline in unemployment. The increased supply of workers in
that sector forces contract values and wages down, particularly at the lower end. On
average, there is a small decrease in the values offered in the formal sector, following
an also slight decrease in wages in that sector. However, overall welfare still goes
up, mostly due to an increase in formal sector profits.
   The results above were for Sao Paulo. For males in Salvador, Tables D.4 and
D.5 show that increasing the cost of informality has a positive but much smaller
impact on the overall welfare of workers and no effect on firms profits. This follows
from a 2-3% increase in wages in the formal sector, despite a 10% decline of wages
for the informal sector at all percentiles. As for females, Tables D.7 and D.8 show
that overall welfare increases; the decline in wages in the informal sector by about
4% at the median and more at lower percentiles is counteracted with an increase
in informal wages at higher percentiles. This occurs due to relocation of some low
productivity informal firms to the formal sector. Moreover, informal firm size goes
up by 2 percentage points, which leads to an increase in profits in the informal sector.
   While there are differences in the results implied by variation in preference and
technology parameters across markets (regions and genders), one thing stands out:
reducing informality increases welfare overall. This is because the presence of in-
formal firms limits the size of the more productive formal firms and at the same

time allows the latter to keep more rents per worker. We now ask the question of
what would happen if we could abolish completely the informal sector. Clearly, this
eventuality is far outside the sample and we do not wish to imply that all effects are
captured here. However, this will give an idea of the direction of the effects.


5.3     Abolishing Informality

We now present an experiment where we close down the informal sector. The results
for Sao Paulo are in Tables 15 and 16. The Tables for the other markets are in
Appendix D. All simulations are revenue neutral, which is achieved by adjusting
the corporation tax. Note that in the absence of an informal sector the corporation

tax is non-distortionary because it is imposed on rents and hence can never affect the
decision of a firm either to hire or to operate. We present three different scenarios:
one in which the contact rates are kept fixed and two where they are endogenised as
shown in subsection 3.3, each with a different elasticity for the matching function.
   With fixed contact rates (the λ ) unemployment increases in all markets. Workers
welfare always declines, while overall welfare only increases for the male markets.
However, the results look very different once we allow the contact rates to adjust. In
this case unemployment declines in all markets and overall welfare increases as does
workers’ welfare. In Sao Paulo about 18% of firms now close down and the average
firm size declines to 11-12: many of the previously informal firms become relatively
small formal ones, reducing the average firm size. Despite the increased competition
among firms the increase in the number of workers has meant a decline in wages,
with respect to those in the formal sector and indeed a decrease in overall inequality.
With greater sensitivity of the matching function to labor market tightness wages
still decline but inequality goes up. The overall effect is an increase in workers’
welfare. However, what happens to firm profits depends on the the elasticity of
the matching function. At a low elasticity firm profits decline. When the elasticity is
higher profits increase. Most of these effects are common (to various degrees acrosss
markets). In all cases overall welfare increases with the abolition of informality and
so does workers’ welfare, driven by a decline in unemployment, a repositioning in
the higher paying and more productive formal sector and somewhat counteracted by
a decline in formal sector wages relative to the baseline.
   Thus the key result that is found across all markets we look at is that abolishing
informality redistributes wealth towards workers. However, the extent to which this
happens varies with the specific conditions (reflected in the estimated parameters)
and does rely on allowing the contact rates to adjust as the number of job seekers and
firms change. Part of this redistribution occurs because workers are shifted to the

formal sector, with an associated decrease in unemployment. Although wages in the
formal sector decline on average (Sao Paulo) or increase just marginally (Salvador
- depending on η) the formal sector wages remain much higher than the wages
in the informal sector. In terms of productivity formal firms still start operating
at the same level; so all low productivity informal firms that did not have formal
counterparts just close down and do not switch to the formal sector. However the
density of lower productivity formal firms increases as some of the informal firms
on the overlapping range switch to become formal.

6    Conclusions
Informality is extremely common in developing countries. While the phenomenon is
well recognised its effects are highly disputed and policy makers tend to be hesitant
in addressing the issue one way or another. With this paper we wish to contribute to
this debate.
    On the one hand informal firms are portrayed as regulation busters that offer
a much needed competitive fringe. Hence they are considered job creators and an
indirect way by which employment protection legislation can be relaxed without
governments being accused of siding in favour of business and against the workers.
Moreover, informal firms have low productivity; an interpretation is that these jobs,
which would not have existed in a tightly regulated economy are allowed to exist
and hence increase employment. On the other hand workers in the informal sector
are often denied access to the benefits of modern societies, such as unemployment
insurance and public pensions (except at a minimum level) as well as a proper health
and safety framework.
    To understand the balance between the pros and cons of informality we set up a
model with search frictions, costs of informality (because of penalties when caught)
and with endogenous decisions by both workers and firms as to where to work and
locate jobs respectively. Clearly a competitive framework would necessarily im-
ply that informality is welfare improving, at least with risk neutral agents. Our
results show that search frictions are very important and without these elements in
the model it would be very hard to understand the role of informality. Our model is
motivated by the empirical observation that low skill workers are observed working
both in formal and informal jobs; there is little empirical support of the idea of com-
parative advantage that leads to segmentation on the basis of skill - at least in the
observable dimension. In our model segmentation is endogenously determined by
an interplay between search frictions, the institutional requirements for formal firms


                                          46
and the penalties of informality. This generates profit making opportunities by firms
selecting in either the formal or informal sector. In equilibrium profits are equalised.
   Using the simulations from our model we draw two sets of important conclu-
sions. First, marginal increases in regulation, such as UI, in the presence of an infor-
mal sector have little or no perceptible effect on the economy; they also have little
effect in the distribution of activity between the formal and informal sector. How-
ever, increasing the cost of informality by 10% actually improves overall welfare
and either reduces unemployment or leaves it unchanged in all markets we looked
at. The way the gains a redistributed really depends on the extent of search frictions.
In the more dynamic economy of Sao Paulo this also meant an increase in worlers’
welfare; in Salvador workers loose out, but only very marginally.
   If we go as far as abolishing informality we obtain increases in welfare in all
markets we consider, so long as we allow the arrival rates of job offers to adjust
endogenously. In addition thorkers’ welfare also always uncreases and unemploy-
ment declines. While the details of how the gains are distributed and what precisely
happens to wages differ by market the main result that informality decreases wel-
fare, given the costs structure, remains. Viewing informality in the light of search
frictions, can alter fundamentally our views of its role: rather than being a benign
regulation busting mechanism it acts to redistribute welfare to firms and to reduce
overall welfare. Of course the result is predicated on the assumption that informal
firms incur detection costs.

A      Equilibrium Offer and Accepted Contract Distri-
       butions
In this section, we derive G1 and G2 from F1 and F2 .
    By equation (4), for any W ∈ [W 1 ,W 1 ],

                                               = λ01 uF1 (W ) + λ21 m2                [F1 (W ) − F1 (x)] dG2 (x).
                                                                                 W2

Making use of the identities (integration by parts):
                          ˆ   W                                               ˆ   W
                                  F 2 (x) dG1 (x) = F 2 (W )G1 (W ) +                 G1 (x) dF2 (x),
                            W1                                                   W1

               W2                                        W2

we can rewrite this equation as
                                          m1
                              d1 (W )        G1 (W ) = λ01 F1 (W ) − Φ(W ),                                  (A.1)
                                          u
where d1 (W ) = λ10 + λ11 F 1 (W ) + λ12 F 2 (W ), and
                                      W                                   W

                                  ˆ                                   ˆ
                 Φ(W ) = λ12                 G1 (x) dF2 (x) − λ21                G2 (x) dF1 (x).             (A.2)

    Turning to the informal sector, equation (5) indicates that for W ∈ [W 2 ,W 2 ],

  �                  �
                                                 ˆ   W

                                                   W2
                                                                              ˆ   W
                                               = λ02 uF2 (W ) + λ12 m1                [F2 (W ) − F2 (x)] dG1 (x).
                                                                                 W1

Using the same integrations by part, we obtain that
                                          m2
                              d2 (W )        G2 (W ) = λ02 F2 (W ) + Φ(W ),                                  (A.3)
                                          u
where d2 (W ) = λ20 + λ21 F 1 (W ) + λ22 F 2 (W ).
   Next, multiplying equation (A.1) by λ12d1f(W    2 (W )             �
                                                      ) (with f 2 = F2 ) and equation (A.3) by



                                                         51
− λ21d2f(W
         1 (W )
            ) , and adding the two resulting equations, we obtain the first-order differential equa-
tion
                                            Φ� = A − BΦ,                                       (A.4)
where
                                   A = λ01 F1 λ12d1f2 − λ02 F2 λ21d2f1 ,
                                        B = λ12d1f2 + λ21d2f1 ,
with boundary condition Φ(U) = 0 (in fact Φ(W ) = 0, ∀W ≤ max{W 1 ,W 2 }).
    The solution of differential equation (A.4) is given by
                                             ´W    ´x
                                                          B(x� )dx�
                                              U   e   U               A(x) dx
                                  Φ(W ) =                 ´W                    .                                     (A.5)
                                                               B(x) dx
                                                      e   U


Substituting this solution back into equations (A.1) and (A.3) we obtain the equilibrium
relationship between the distribution of offered (F) and accepted (G).


B       Computing the Equilibrium
In this section we describe the computation of the equilibrium.
    1. Define contract value offer distribution F1 and F2 , with supports bounds W 2 = U <
       W 1 < W 2 < W 1 . Note that. from equation (3),

                                                      b + λ01 µ1 + λ02 µ2
                                      W2 = U =                            .
                                                         r + λ01 + λ02
        Define the numbers of firms in each sector n1 , n2 , with n1 + n2 ≤ 1.
    2. Use steady-state flow condition (see Appendix (A)) to derive m1 , m2 , u and G1 , G2
       from F1 , F2 .
    3. Profit maximization then implies that optimal decision rules satisfy

                                                                                            �1 (W )

                                                                      �2 (W )
                       p = K2−1 (W ) = w2 (W ) + w�2 (W )                      +C1 γ�2 (W )γ−1 ,

        with
                                                                            ˆ       W1                      ˆ   W2

                                                   52
       with similar expressions for the informal section.

    4. Then calculate productivity distributions

                                      Γ1 (K1−1 (W )) = n1 F1 (W ),
                                      Γ2 (K2−1 (W )) = n2 F2 (W ).

    5. Consistency with the predetermined distribution of productivity Γ0 requires that
                               
                               Γ0 (p2 ) + Γ2 (p),
                                                            ∀p ∈ [p2 , p1 ],
                      Γ0 (p) = Γ0 (p2 ) + Γ1 (p) + Γ2 (p), ∀p ∈ [p1 , p2 ],
                               
                               
                                  Γ0 (p2 ) + n2 + Γ1 (p),    ∀p ∈ [p2 , p1 ],

       with Γ0 (p2 ) + n1 + n2 = 1.

    6. If this consistency restriction is not satisfied, reiterate that sequence with another
       guess of F1 , F2 and n1 , n2 .
In practice we discretise functions and approximate integrals as described in the estimation
section, and we search for discrete approximations of F1 and F2 , as well as shares n1 , n1 so as
to minimize a distance between Γ0 and its prediction. The dimensionality of the optimization
problem can be reduced by using simple parametric approximations for F1 , F2 such as the
beta distribution used in the estimation section.


C      Estimation
Let F1 and F2 be two candidate offer distributions, defined on the spaces of contract present
values. Although we could implement this procedure nonparametrically, we use non stan-
dard beta distributions as approximations:
                                  �                     �
                                     x −W j
               Fj (x) = betacdf              ; α j , β j j = 1, 2; W j ≤ x ≤ W j
                                    W j −W j


where betacdf(·; α, β ) is the CDF of a beta distribution with parameters α and β . An im-
portant practical reason why a (flexible) parametric specification is useful is that, in order to
calculate the function Φ and other transition rates (see below) we need to calculate offer den-
sities f1 = F1� and f2 = F2� . Assuming a parametric specification guarantees the smoothness
of both the distribution function and its derivative.
     To estimate the parameters we use the method of moments. We match the distribution
of wages for each sector and the transition rates implied by the model to those observed
in the data. Given the above specification, we need to estimate the six arrival rates and
the two job destruction rates all denoted by λ = (λi j )i, j=0,1,2 and six further parameters
θ = (W 1 ,W 1 ,W 2 ,W 2 , α1 , β1 , α2 , β2 ) characterizing the offer distribution. Our algorithm
estimates θ given the λ , then λ given θ , and iterates until convergence. Although we could

estimate all parameters at the same time, this turned out to be a very quick procedure in
practice.


C.1     Contract Offer Distributions
We start by taking the arrival rates λ as given to estimate θ as follows. Let zk = cos(kπ/M), k =
0, ..., M, be M + 1 Chebychev nodes on [−1, 1]. These nodes allow to define grids on
[W 1 ,W 1 ] and [W 2 ,W 2 ] as

                            W j +W j W j −W j
                   W jk =           +         zk , j = 1, 2, k = 0, ..., M.
                                2        2
For each point on the grids, one can calculate a corresponding wage w jk using equations (15)
and (16), and replacing integrals by quadrature approximations. The appropriate quadrature
for Chebychev nodes is the Clenshaw-Curtis (CC) quadrature, whose weights ωk can be
easily calculated using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) (see Waldvogel, 2006). For example,
we have

  (1 + λ10 s)w1k = (r + λ10 )W1k − λ10 (W 2 +UI)
                                    W 1 −W 1 N
                            − λ11
                                        2    ∑ ωn 1 (W1n >W1k ) F 1 (W1n )
                                            n=0
                                                                 W 2 −W 2 N
                                                         − λ12
                                                                     2    ∑ ωn 1 (W2n >W1k ) F 2 (W2n ),
                                                                         n=0

where 1(·) is the indicator function. A similar expression can be obtained to determine wage
nodes for the informal sector, w2k .
   Then we search for θ minimising

                                        j=1,2 k=0

where G j (W jk ) is calculated using equations (6) and (7), and replacing integrals by CC-
quadrature approximations, and G   �∗ is an estimate of wage distribution functions,.

   Note that, assuming that U = W 2 ≤ W 1 and W 2 ≤ W 1 , we have

                                                                                   W1

where [w1 , w1 ] and [w2 , w2 ] are the observed wage supports in the formal and informal sec-


                                                    54
tors, respectively, and with
                                                            α1
                                   µ1 = W 1 + (W 1 −W 1 )         ,
                                                          α1 + β1
                                                            α2
                                   µ2 = W 2 + (W 2 −W 2 )         .
                                                          α2 + β2
Hence, we can simplify the estimation problem slightly by using equations (C.2) and (C.3)
to substitute observed wage bounds w2 and w1 for W 2 = U and W 1 (given the α, β and
W 1 ,W 2 ).


C.2      Transition Rates
In a similar way as we estimate θ given λ , we can estimate λ given θ . Natural counterparts
to the theoretical transition rates can be calculated from observed flows between states (0:
unemployment; 1: working in the formal sector; and 2: working in the informal sector).
     From the labour force survey, we calculate the intensity of transitions from unemploy-
ment to job (D� 0 j ; j = 1, 2), from a formal sector job to unemployment, to another job in the
same sector or to the informal sector (D       � 1 j ; j = 0, 1, 2) and similar ones for a workers initially
in the informal sector (D  � 2 j ; j = 0, 1, 2). We then estimate our transition parameters using the
method of moments. We choose the parameters so as to match the observed transition rates
between sectors.
     Consider first the workers who are unemployed at the date of the first interview, that we
follow over T periods. Workers are not heterogeneous in this model and hence the remaining
unemployment duration is exponentially distributed. Thus the implied proportion of those
who move out of unemployment and into a job in sector j over the time period of observation
T is
                                          λ0 j
                            D0 j =                 (1 − e−(λ01 +λ02 )T ), j = 1, 2                    (C.5)
                                      λ01 + λ02
    Now consider workers in the formal sector. Over T periods the proportion making a
transition to an alternative job in the same sector, to a job in the informal sector or to unem-
ployment is, respectively

allowing to replace the derivative of G1 by that of F1 inside the integral. This is useful as we
have parametrised F1 , F2 using a continuous distribution. Then CC-quadrature can be used
to approximate the integral.
    Similarly the corresponding transition rates for those observed working initially in the

    These are the model counterparts for these empirical moments as functions of the arrival
rates, the job destruction rates, the offers distributions Fi and as a function of the equilibrium
contract values distributions Gi (i = 1, 2). Contract offers and equilibrium distributions are
related by a complex function as explained in Appendix A.
    We can thus estimate λ given θ by minimising the criterion
                                                                 �                  �2

where D� i j is the empirical counterpart of Di j .
    We could minimize the two criteria Q1 and Q2 jointly but it is numerically faster to use
a nested algorithm.


C.3     Productivity Distribution
Up to this point, there has been no need to use the firm profit functions, or indeed the dis-
tribution of productivities. To complete estimation we need to estimate the cost function of
informality. This will allow us to characterize the choice of firms to locate in either sector
and ultimately to carry out counterfactual simulations.
     We specify the cost function as C = c�2 (W )γ , with C1 and γ being the parameters to
be estimated. Given values for c and γ, and for n1 and n2 such that n1 + n2 = 1, we solve
for the labour force size in the formal sector (�1 (W ) = n11 hd11 (W )
                                                                   (W ) ) and in the informal sector
             1 h2 (W )
(�2 (W ) =   n2 d2 (W ) ).   From the firm’s maximization problem in each sector, we next derive
the support of the distribution of formal and informal productivities, i.e. p1 = K1−1 (W ) and
p2 = K2−1 (W ) respectively. The first order conditions for the firm’s optimization problem

where the expressions for w�1 (W ), i = 1, 2, are given by

                             r + λ10 + λ11 F 1 (W1 (w)) + λ12 F 2 (W1 (w))
                  w�1 (W ) =                                               ,
                                                1 + λ10 s
                  w�2 (W ) = r + λ20 + λ21 F 1 (W2 (w)) + λ22 F 2 (W2 (w)),

and where firm sizes can be differentiated using

                         h�1 (W ) = λ11 m1 G�1 (W ) + λ21 m2 G�2 (W )
                                 = λ11 n1 �1 (W )F1� (W ) + λ21 n2 �2 (W )F2� (W ),

with a similar expression for h�2 (W ).
     For each point of the contract grids, W jk , one can thus calculate a point p jk on a produc-
tivity grid, with p2 = p20 , p1 = p10 , p2 = p2N and p1 = p1N . This in turn allows to tabulate
productivity distributions as

                            Γ j (p jk ) = n j · Fj (W jk ), j = 1, 2, k = 0, ..., N.

   Equilibrium conditions require that π2 (p2 ) = 0, and π1 (p) = π2 (p) > 0 for p ∈ [p1 , p2 ].
We thus estimate C1 and γ, and n1 and n2 such that n1 + n2 ≤ 1, so as to minimize
                                       M
                    π2 (p20 )2 +      ∑       K (p1k − p2k� )[π1 (p1k ) − π2 (p2k� )]2 ,
                                    k,k� =0

where K is a kernel density.
   Lastly, the unconditional productivity distribution Γ0 follows as
                                 
                                 Γ2 (p),

                                  n2 + Γ1 (p),        ∀p ∈ [p2 , p1 ],

with the additional restriction: Γ0 (p2 ) = 0.
