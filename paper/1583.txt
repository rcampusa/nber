     This paper studies the optimal use of distortive policies aimed at

raising a given real revenue, in a general equilibrium framework in which

lump—suni taxes are absent, The policies analyzed are an inflation tax,

commercial policy, and an implicit tax on capital inflows implemented by

capital controls. It is shown that we would tend to avoid activating an

inflation tax for small revenue needs. Furthermore, if the
                                                               policy target were
allocative, we would tend to use only one policy instrument.    Thus, each

policy has its own comparative advantage, and their combined use is justified

when the target is raising government revenue. As a by-product of the paper,

we study the determinants of exchange rates, prices, and quantities in an

economy subject to capital controls and commercial policy.

 1. Introduction

     Open economies frequently restrict trade in goods and assets, and

occasionally follow inflationary policies. As is well known, such policies

are inefficient for small economies, provided that they find lump—sum policies

feasible. Thus, the frequent application of distortive policies suggests that

lump-sum policies are not feasible. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate

the implications of the absence of lump-sum policies for the complementarity

of distortive policies used as a means of raising government revenue, In the

absence of lump-sum taxes the policy maker should attempt to use an optimal

mixture of other taxes in an attempt to raise a given revenue at the lowest

possible social cost. Identifying that mixture will generate predictions

regarding the optimal associations between distortive policies and the size of

government revenue. This paper solves this problem for a small open economy

in which commercial policies, capital controls, and an inflation tax are the

feasible means of raising revenue.1 It applies general equilibrium analysis

for the case in which cash balances are needed to facilitate the exchange of

goods, and capital controls introduce a wedge between domestic and foreign

rates of' return. The analysis proceeds by deriving a welfare measure for a

marginal change in the policies and in government revenue. Such a measure

implies that whenever the revenue requirements of the government are small, we

would not impose an inflation tax. This reflects the fact that equilibrium

with zero government revenue is distorted due to the lack of appropriate

interest payments in the money market, whereas all other markets are free from

distortions. Thus, at the margin, raising government revenue by tariffs or

capital controls would be associated with a small deadweight loss relative to

                                               loss At some stage, however,

the resultant distortion would equate the marginal deadweight losses caused by

using either tariffs or capital controls or an inflation tax as alternative

means of revenue sources. Thus, a further expansion in government demand

would be associated with the simultaneous use of an inflation tax and other

distortive policies. Although the discussion does not include such

alternative policies as a labor tax, it can be readily extended to cover a

     To focus on issues related to financing government activity, the paper

considers a perfect foresight model. Thus, it neglects the potential

motivation for applying restrictive policies in order to affect the degree of

exposure of domestic agents and domestic policies to foreign unanticipated

 shocks. •To formulate the ipflation tax, we assume a flexible exchange rate

 system (a similar analysis can be conducted for a gliding parities system).

 Capital controls are modeled in the context of' a modified dual exchange rate,

 under which the controls generate a wedge between the exchange rates applied

 for current and capital account transactions.    An alternative interpretation

 of capital controls would be as a policy of imposing a tax on purchases of

 foreign assets. Commercial policy is modeled as a tariff. While the details

 function. This allows us to find the closed—form solution of all prices and

 quantities and thus to assess the effects of capital controls and tariffs on

 both the exchange rate and on the wedge between the exchange rates applied for

 vrious transactions. One can use this framework to assess the desired

 combination of policies to be implemented to achieve specific targets. The

paper demonstrates that if the target is to reduce consumption of imports

only, a tariff policy should be implemented, whereas if the target is to

change the intertemporal allocation of consumption, only capital controls

should be implemented. Thus, each policy has its own comparative advantege,

and their combined use is justified when the target is raising government

revenue.

     The plan of the paper is to introduce in section 2 the problem for the

case of a general periods separable utility, deriving the welfare measure for

marginal policy and revenue changes. Section 3 specializes the discussion for

a specific utility, deriving closed-form solutions for all prices and all

quantities. Section 14 applies the model to derive optimal policies to be

implemented for the attainment of specific targets. Appendix A provides the

detailed derivation of some of the steps in section 2, and appendix B

summarizes the notation applied in the paper.


2. The Model

     Let us consider the minimal framework needed to obtain a measure of the

welfare cost associated with raising government revenue using either tariffs,

capital controls, or an inflation tax. For a tariff, we consider a model with

two goods, exportables and importables. For capital controls, we assume the

existence of a traded bond, whose domestic trade might be subject to

restrictions. For intertemporal considerations needed to generate a demand

for the bond, and the opportunity cost of holding money, we should consider at

a minimum a two-period model. To simplify notation we take the case of

Our consumer finances consumption and the use of money balances from his

that all restrictive policies are applied in period zero.5 Because period 1

is the "end" of our consumer's horizon, he does not purchase new bonds to

carry wealth into the future.                   In a general k periods model we will find

that a typical budget constraint in period n < k will look like equation 6,

and only the terminal period budget constraint will look like equation 7.

k ÷    , the     relevance of period k lies only in generating the tranversality

condition equating the consumption net present value to the endowment net

present value. Our model can be readily extended for a general k, without

altering the main results.

        We denote by             the discount factor that is applied for discounting

nominal units from period one to period zero. The presence of the traded bond

permits the trading of the purchasing power of                                       +   r*)    in terms of

         Met present value of consumption is equal to net present value of the

 endowment (the first three terms on the right-hand side) adjusted by the

 opportunity cost of using money balances in period zero,                                 M(1 — c), and the

           The government has three revenue sources: an inflation tax, tariffs, and

revenue from sales of foreign bonds at a premium. The revenue is used to

finance governmental activities. We assume that the authorities effectively

control trade in bonds. Agents can trade those bonds among themselves freely,

but they can make transactions with foreign agents only via the financial

authorities, which control the quantity of traded bonds sold to domestic

agents.6 Thus, capital control takes the form of quantity control, which

manifests itself in the premium f - 1.                          This premium is market determined,

corresponding to B. A net sale of B bonds by the authorities in period 0

will generate revenue of f P0B. The cost for the authorities of purchasing

the bonds is given by P,QB. The net income from the wedge

(f - 1)           generated by the controls is                (1' —                  Notice that the same

outcome would occur if the authorities imposed a tax at a rate of

(f -       1)     on capital inflows, allowing quantities to be market determined.8

Thus, in the absence of uncertainty, one can view the capital controls defined

in the paper as a policy that sets a quota B, under which the government

collects the quota rents, or alternatively as a policy that sets a tax

f —    1        on capital inflows. In the first case, prices are market determined;

in the second, quantities. As in the case of commercial policy, the

equivalence between the two policies would break down in the presence of

uncertainty.

       The result of the restrictive policies is to introduce various

distortions, and thus to blur the underlying intertemporal budget

constraint. In this connection it is useful to evaluate all budget

 constraints in real terms, using international, distortion-free prices.                                        For

                                       consumption equals to the net present
present value of private plus public

value of the endowment, where both are evaluated using distortion—free,

international prices.

        The private budget constraint is given by equation 9, which takes

government policies as given. Private agents maximize their utility subject

to this constraint. For the resultant optimal behavior of the private sector

the fundamental budget constraint, given by equation 18, implies the

corresponding government revenue. Government policy is summarized by the

vector CM0, H1, B, t). For a given goverment policy the corresponding

revenue g is a function of both the prices and quantities set by the private

agents' behavior. Let          (M0, H1, B, t) be the resultant revenue

corresponding to a utility level of private agents given by U(M0, M1, B, t).

The problem facing the government is to choose policies that will maximize

 private sector welfare subject to a given real revenue target (g0):

         Because our system is homogeneous, real revenue and real equilibrium will

 not be affected by an anticipated equa-proportiofl
                                                      rise in (M1, M0). To fix

 ideas, consider the case in which the value of M0 is given (M0= ) ,
                                                                               and

 the government sets H1. In such a case money balances will increase by

  H1 - M      in period 1. The increase is implemented by financing part of

 government purchases of goods and services by issuing new money. Thus, the

 solution to the government's problem, as described in equation 19, is reduced

 to a choice of (M1, B, t). For a given, known governemnt policy, private

 agents maximize utility U subject to equation 9, resulting in the following

It is useful to apply the first-order conditions (equation 20, 20') into

equations 21, 22 in order to derive the welfare change in terms of observable

variables. We can simplify further by using the various budget constraints.

The details of this lengthy process are given in Appendix A, where it is shown

that the final approximation of the marginal welfare change around initial

equilibrium with g                      0       is   given by

inflation in terms of good y (defined using the price net of tariff), and

       is real balances in period zero.

       Equation 23 is the key step in our present discussion.                                                     It describes the

net welfare effect of raising government revenue Ag by a corresponding

marginal change in policies A (H1, B, t). It can be decomposed in terms

 involving the marginal deadweight loss in the three distorted activities

 induced by the change in policies (the first three terms), minus a term that

 corresponds to the direct income effect induced by transferring Ag
                                                 —13-




resources. The deadweight loss in each activity equals the change in the

relevant activity times the distortion (given in the bracket of the first

three terms). Those distortions are proportional to the tariff rate, the

premium in the assets market (f — 1)                 induced by capital controls, and the

nominal interest rates, when the factors of proportionality convert the

various terms into real units (in terms of X0). Notice that the relevant

quantity change in the money market is the change in real balances Am,

which in our analysis is implemented by a change in the price level9 (F)

     Suppose that we start with initial equilibrium with no revenue needs

(g   o). In such a case t         o        f -   1    and       M1. Consequently,
we start with no distortions related to trade in goods and assets, and with

initial distortion in the money market proportional to the money interest

rate. The source of this distortion is the absence of interest payments on

money, resulting in positive opportunity cost of using an asset whose

"production" is free. Thus, we expect a marginal deadweight loss associated

with raising revenue via small tariffs and the effective use of' tax on capital

inflows, because initial distortions are absent in those markets.° This does

not hold, however, if revenue is raised via an inflation tax, because of the

presence of the initial distortion. Any further increase in revenue needs

 (A g >   0) is associated with a further rise in taxes on trade in goods and
assets (A t > 0, A (f - 1)    >   0)   ,   raising      the marginal deadweight loss

associated with the revenue. At some positive revenue level, we will reach a

point at which the marginal deadweight loss of a tariff or a tax on capital

will match that associated with activating the inflation tax. From that stage

on, we will make use of all means of taxation. Consequently, for large enough

revenue needs, we expect to observe a positive correlation between government

revenue and all sources of taxation. For small revenue needs, we will not use

the inflation tax, or a tax on activities that are distorted in the initial
zero revenue equilibrium (g                         o).

        If we assume zero cross elasticities, we obtain a version of the Ramsey

rule for small levels of revenue needs:



             T1Y0t                 f-i
(2U)                                t
             B,f-i


where      n corresponds to the elasticities of demand with respect to the tax

rate (See Appendix A for derivation of eq. 24) This result implies that the

tax rate in each market will be positively associated with the elasticity of

demand in the other market, and negatively associated with its own elasticity

3.     Restrictive Policies and Exchange Rates

        The purpose of' this section is to study the effects of the various

policies on the path of the exchange rate, on the premium associated with

financial rates, and on goods prices. Let us first specialize the discussion

by looking at the Cobb—Douglas utility:

We denote by               the aggregate resource constraint imposed on the economy:

Equations 28 a—b tie the demand for goods to expenditure in a Cobb-Douglas

fashion. We denote by R the implicit nominal interest rate defined by the

traded bond: one monetary unit purchases                                                         bonds in period o, which
                                                                                  jD

where p denotes the rate of monetary expansion (1 + p                                M1/M0)          Equations 30

a - b correspond to the velocity of circulation. The velocity in period zero

depends positively on the nominal interest rate, which measures the

opportunity cost of using money balances.             It depends negatively on the

relative importance of leisure, (y) ,          reflecting               the underlying trade-off

between real balances and leisure.12 The money interest rate, in turn, is

proportional to the anticipated rate of monetary expansion (30c). The

 intertemporal distribution of consumption, given by 30d, is determined by the

subjective discount factor, p

        Consumers are price takers, and in order to solve for equilibrium prices

 we should apply equilibrium quantities to the various budget constraints. We

 proceed by solving first for the premium f-i.                     Let us denote by 01 the

 private sector's real income in period 1; 0 q1 ÷                                B(1+r)   .   This   is the


 sum of the endowment and the bonds purchased in period zero. Notice that from

 eq. 7 we obtain:



                                              — M
 (31)                                 I÷ M                    01         1




 Using first-order conditions one can rewrite 31 as:

        Aggregate budget constraint (equation 18) can be written as:

of resources faced by the private sector. Authorities affect that allocation

by their revenue target g and the allowed net purchase of foreign bonds.

For a given revenue target, a larger B is associated with a consumption

profile more tilted to the future. To better understand the determination

of f , note that a policy of no capital control will generate f1

Equation 33 can be applied to solve for the corresponding value of z in

the absence of capital controls (denoted by z1):

        In the absence of capital controls, the higher the subjective weight of

future consumption (p)         the more consumption tilts towards the future A
higher nominal interest rate increases the cost of present consumption,

because it increases the cost of using the money balances needed to support

that consumption. Consequently, a higher nominal interest rate encourages

future consumption.      Anticipated liberalization of commercial policy

(higher t in period zero) is associated with a larger consumption bias

towards the future (z /at)                        Combining equation 33 and 34 we find that, in

the presence of capital controls

(35)                                    _     fi   z
                                                    z

        The premium of the financial exchange rate is proportional to the degree

to which capital controls introduces a bias towards present consumption

(relative to the case of no capital controls). The factor of proportionality

rises with the weight attached to future consumption (q)                               and with the

magnitude of the anticipated commercial liberalization which is equal to the

tariff rate at period zero (t). Notice that the effect of increasing capital

inflows (dB>o) is to reduce the premium, due to their positive effect on z

It is useful to obtain a measure of real interest rates from the following

definitions:

y and x .            Notice                    that real interest rates are negatively related to the

financial premium, and that anticipated commercial liberalization would

increase the relevant interest rate. We can solve now for all prices.

with a higher rate of printing money, (dLl>o) would increase prices in period

zero. This reflects the drop in the demand for money consequent upon the

higher opportunity cost of using money. Next, by applying equations 8 and 30,

we obtain that inflation in terms of goods y is
                                                                   -20-

                     y,o


        Inflation rises with the anticipated rate of money growth, and drops with

the real interest rate From Eq. 39b. We find that the exchange rate in

period zero is:


                                           *
                           M p    (1+r         )   CR— —f-)

                           yfel    P0              (1+R)




        The financial exchange rate is                                        fe0 .   Inspection   of equation

39d reveals that tighter capital controls (dB<o)                                  would have opposite effects

on the commercial and financial exchange rates. Their imposition would
                                                                                                      de
appreciate the commercial rate, and depreciate the financial rate (>O

 dfe
       dB<O) This is because tighter capital controls would tilt the consumption

profile towards that of period zero, thereby raising the demand for money, and

consequently would appreciate the commercial exchange rate. The direct effect

of tight capital controls is to increase the premium on foreign assets (df>o)

 consequently depreciating the financial rate.

         To clarify the determinations of prices and the exchange rate, it is

 useful to represent P                             and     e         in terms of the net wealth of the private

 sector, 2       -          .     We   do so by applying the first—order conditions given by

                      q0


 equations 28c, 30a to Eq. 32', yielding:


 (39a')                                              (1+t)          [1 -       + —--J/ [ — _g1

                and



 (39d') e                              [1 —          + —f"

           Equation 39a' implies that higher private real wealth would reduce prices
and appreciate the exchange rate, because it would increase the demand for

money. For a given private real wealth policies that tilts the consumption

profile towards the present would have a similar effect, i.e., a lower tariff

 (dt<o) and tighter capital controls in period zero (df>o) would reduce

 P          .   Note that a lower tariff would affect P        via two distinct

channels: direct price effect, and intertemporal consumption reallocation

effect. Both effects, however, are working in the same direction, reducing

4. Commercial Policy and Capital Controls as Alternative Means of Achieving

Policy Targets.

        In the previous sections we analyzed the case in which distortive

policies were used as a means of raising taxes. Consider now an environment

in which the only policy objective is to affect the allocation of

consumption. The purpose of this section is to assess the comparative

advantages of commercial policy versus capital controls in achieving the

allocative target. In order to focus on those issues, it is useful to proceed

by assuming that there is zero net government revenue, and that the government

distributes its revenue from the various policies in a lump-sum manner.

Contrasting this section to section 3 will provide useful insight into the

effect of non—lump-sum policies. As we shall show, prices and quantities are

affected considerably when we assume redistribution of government gross

proceeds.                                                                -
                                                                               -22-




        We preserve the assumptions regarding preferences given by equation 25.
                                                                                        constraints so as to reflect the
We should adjust, however, all the budget

presence of lump-sum distribution. First, we should add to the private budget

constraints (equations 6 and 7) the proceeds from transfers, given for the

aggregate by:


(140)         To M 0— 0÷                         t    Y
                                                          0 F'
                                                            y,O
                                                                          +   (f-1)BP'y,O

(141)        T1            H1 —H0.

        By their nature, lump—sums transfers do not affect marginal behavior.

Thus, equations 27-30 still hold. The aggregate budget constraints, however,

change. Thus we add the net present value of transfers to equation 9:



                       +   ci 1              P                    +       +c    P        — H (1—c)   H c + Ta÷ cT 1
(142)              o                             x,o 0                o          x,11       o         1



          Applying equations 110-4l we get




 (J42')       Io +cI Px,o÷cP ÷t  YP' ÷(f—1)BP'
                              x,1 1
                                 1   0 ,O    y,O          1




          Thus, the aggregate private budget constraint is free now from monetary

 terms, because monetary terms represent transfers that cancel out. Following

 steps similar to those in section 2, we find that



                                                      *
                                         *           q0                             *

                                                     q1 (1÷r )

                                                  *
                             I

                  -;
                                     *
                            1÷r


          The "distortion free" intertemporal budget constraint is not affected,
only now go .               Following               the steps described in section 3 we find that the

premium f is now given by:

                                                                    0
(33 )         f
                        z   ( t\
                        p(l—z)
                                            ,       where    z =
                                                                        1


                                                                   (1÷r )c
                                                                            *



         Comparison of the case of no revenue needs (33') to the case of revenue

needs (33) reveals that the main difference is that f is now free from terms

that relate to the demand for money (such as y and )                                        Notice that

equation 33 collapses to 33' for y + o                                   The reason is that once all

seigniorage is transferred back, inflation does not affect the goods endowment

of the private sector. In section 3 higher inflation was a tax that affected

net endowment. Those effects were responsible for the presence of y and

in equation 33.             In the absence of capital controls z is given by

(314')
              z1= 1 -
                                        +   p




         Again eq. 314' can be obtained from eq. 314 when y ÷ o                         .
                                                                                             Following    the

process described in section 3, we find that prices are now given by:



                            M
              P
                                1 (1—y)

        Notice that the effect of the absence of net tax revenue is that prices

in period two are now independent of the inflation in period zero. In section
3, past inflation entered prices in period 1 via its negative effect on net

endowment. This effect is absent in the case where g                       o

        For a given set of policies, one can apply all the first-order conditions

and equation 33' to equation 25, yielding a measure of the welfare level of a

typical consumer:

             U       C (c2) -       y log (i-c) + (1+p)   log
                                                                1 - Z       -   log (1+t) - p       log   f

                                                                1---1 +t



        C is a constant term, that depends on the level of the initial endowment

()
        We can use U tp assess the optimal design of policies aimed at

achieving a given policy target. Without the presence of such policy targets,

welfare is optimized by f1, to. Thus, in the absence of revenue or other

policy objectives, free trade in assets and goods is optimal. We will

consider two types of policy targets. First let us suppose that the policy

maker wishes to restrict imports in period zero. Next, let us consider the

case in which the policy maker wishes to affect the intertemporal allocation

of consumption.

        Case a Imports target:

          In the absence of restrictions on free trade, imports are equal to:


 (J4)         F  o
                            B10
                            P

                                           14-Q




          This equation makes use of the aggregate budget constraint corresponding

 to free trade:

          Suppose the policy maker wishes to lower imports to c0                      ,
                                                                                          c0<

 Let us find the optimal combination of tariffs Ct)                        and capital tax (f—i)

capable of achieving such a target. Notice that because inflation does not

affect the allocation of consumption of goods, we cannot reach the imports

target by changing the inflation rate. Thus, our optimization should be

carried out only for f and t .                              Let   us now derive the implication of our

policy target. First, application of' Eq. 28b yields that, subject to

 0        00
           , F,


(145)             (1÷t) P'         c
                             y,o ol÷q              0

          We   can go on to apply a modified version of Eq. 32 yielding:


(146)                             !.I[1


         Using equation 28c, we find that:


                                          P 2          I [1               +

          Combining equations 145 and 46' we obtain that following a policy of


limiting imports to c0y0F imposes the following restriction:

                      -    (1—z)        (l+p)

         Optimal policies are chosen by:

               f,t

               s.t. equations 33' and 47

         which yield:
               -   (1—c ) (l+p)
                              0                             -

         where -          refers   to optimal policies.

          Thus, to achieve the import target we would use a tariff alone. Notice

5. Concluding Remarks

    This paper demonstrates the complementary of capital controls, commercial

policy, and inflation taxes as means of revenue collecting It demonstrates

that we would tend to avoid activating an inflation tax for small revenue

needs. Capital controls considered in the paper are in the form of' an
                                            consistent with either a version of a
implicit tax on capital inflow, which is

two—tier exchange rate or a direct tax on capital inflow. It should be noted

that the practical application of the various distortive policies would depend

upon the spectrum of alternative revenue raising tools. In the absence of a

well-developed tax structure, (including, for instance, income and consumption

taxes) a country might make intensive use of commercial policy, capital

controls, and inflation taxes as revenue devices.     In an economy with a well

developed tax system, we would expect more extensive application of more

traditional taxes. 13

     Alternative forms of complementarity between inflation taxes and capital

controls would occur in the presence of currency substitution, thus eroding

the inflation tax base.   In such a case, capital controls would also be

applied in an attempt to reduce the use of for2ign currency as a menas of

payment.
     While the details of the analysis described in this paper are model

 specific, the general point should be model-free:    The absence of lump-sum

 taxes generates complementarity between various distortive policies applied to

 generate a given revenue at the lowest welfare cost. This complementarity

 would not hold, in general, if the purpose of the distortive policies were to

 achieve a given allocative goal.

       The purpose of' this appendix is to describe the steps leading to the

 reduced-form equation of the welfare loss that results from marginal change in

 government policies {d(M1, B, t)] .                                                  We   start by applying the various first..

order conditions (equations 20, 20' and 22') to the expression for the change

 in utility (equation 21). We do so in order to express all changes in terms

of observable prices:

        Starting with initial equilibrium with                       g       o, Section 2 demonstrates

that we will raise revenue by activating tariff and capital controls. Let

 g      o (where f1 and tzo). Assuming no cross effects, we find that small

f—i and t would raise revenues of

 1. For a related study, see Helpman and Sadka (1979). They analyze the

      optimal finance of a government budget in a closed economy

      considering taxation, bond issuance and money creation as alternative

      means of financing.

2. For a related study, see Dornbusch and Frenkel (1973), They model

      the exchange activity to highlight the issue of inflation and growth,

      where the exchange of goods is facilitated by money balances, labor

      and capital. Such a model was applied in an open economy context by

      Greenwood (1983).

3. Such a specification was applied by Aizenman (1983) to describe a

      theory of a current account and exchange rate determination in a

      distortion -   free   economy. Alternative formulations of the

      transaction use of money are applied by using Clower's constraint.

      In the context of an open economy, see for example Helpman 11981],

      Helpman and Razin [1982], Greenwood and Kimbraugh (19814).

14.   We assume that only domestic money is used in co-ordinating domestic

      transactions. The underlying structure of the economy described here

      is that of a centralized market only in the case of financial

      transactions (bonds) and for the exchange of goods and bonds across

      borders. There is no centralized exchange of goods among domestic

      consumers. The asymmetry between financial transactions and the

      domestic exchange of goods among consumers is reflected in the

      specification of velocity of money, which is defined only for

      transactions that involve consumption.

5. We consider the case of a temporary tariff to allow us evaluation of

     the intertemporal substitution introduced by anticipation of a tariff

     liberalization. Allowing for a uniform tariff in both periods would

     eliminate this effect, without affecting the results of our analysis

     regarding the nature of the complementarity of the various policies.

6. It should be noted that in the context of capital controls the forms

     of the technology of exchange is of crucial importance. For example,

     the work by Greenwood and Kimbrough (1981) assumes a Clower

     constraint applied separately to domestic and foreign goods when

     foreign currency is needed to purchase foreign goods. They show that

     under these conditions foreign exchange controls act like quota on

     imports. This result would not hold in our case. Here we assume

     that capital controls are applied to purchases of traded bonds, and

     that there is a centralized exchange of goods across borders, and

     that domestic exchange is using only domestic money.

7. In general, if the initial endowment includes B0 bonds, net income

     would be calculated on the net inflow of capital

      (f—i) P'      (B — B   ).
             y,o       0
8.   Our economy is a modified flexible two-tier regime, under which

     authorities have the flexibility to alter the existing stock of

     foreign assets available to the public. This process is similiar to

     an open market operation in traded bonds.

9. As is shown in Appendix A, there is another term that corresponds to

            using standard specifications for the demand for money this
      Am1
      term is insignificant.

 10. We assume also that the cross effects of    AB or At on in0    are

      negligible.

11. This assumption simplifies exposition, Assuming a general L would

   not affect the results (assuming an internal solution).

12. Notice that v1 does not depend on the interest rate, because 1 is

   the terminal period. In a general k-period model, a typical

   velocity would have the form v v. (R1), --       0, where
    R.   R. (i)   }>     0.


13. This suggests that liberlization attempts should be approached in

   the context of the capacity of the government to replace restrictive

   trade policies used as means of collecting revenue with alternative

   sources of funds (oralternatively, liberalization attempts should

   accompany a drop in government activities). For a related discussion

   see Frenkel (1983).

14. Similiar forms have been applied in the context of real models for

   the analysis of distortive policies, See, for example Jones (1979)

   and Bhagwati and Ramaswami (1963).
