            Money and Price Dispersion in the United States


                                  ABSTRACT


    This paper reports an empirical test of a price dispersion equation, using

data on the U.S. after World War II. The equation, derived elsewhere from a

version of the partial information—localized market models, relates price dis-

persion to the magnitude of changes in the aggregate disturbances. In order to

test the model a series on price dispersion is computed using annual wholesale

price indexes for the period 1948—76. The data on money shocks are the unanti-

cipated money growth series estimated by Barro. The tests also include a measure

of aggregate—real disturbances.


     From the theoretical point of view the results are negative. They reject

the hypothesis that unexpected money shocks, as measured by Barro, affect price

dispersion in the way predicted by the model. In a previous paper, a similar

model was tested with data from the German hyperinflation and found supported to

a considerable extent. The difference in the results may be related to the ex—

treme magnitude of the monetary disturbances during that period, and to the apparent-

ly important effect of unincluded relative disturbances in the United States.

     This paper reports an empirical test of a price dispersion equation,

using data on the U.S. after World War II. The equation is derived in

Hercowitz (1979) from a theoretical framework that is a version of Lucas's

(1973) and Barro's (1976) partial information—localized market models,

     In this extension, which is briefly summarized in section I, each commodity

is characterized by a particular excess demand elasticity, The different

reactions to money shocks across markets t.ipiy a testable dispersion equation

in which the explanatory variables are the magnitude of changes in the aggre-

gate disturbances. The data on money shocks used in the tests are the unantici-

pated money growth series estimated by Barro (1978). The series on price

dispersion is computed using annual wholesale price indexes for the period

1948/76. Vining and Elwertowski (1976) have performed similar computations

with a more extensive disaggregation, but using the unweighted price changes,

The procedure adopted here in the calculations is reported in section II.

     Using these figures, the dispersion equation is tested in section III

From the theoretical point of view the results are negative, They reject

the hypothesis that unexpected money shocks   ,   as measured by Barro (1978),

affect price dispersion via the channel described in section I.      In my pre-

vious paper, a similar model was tested with data from the German hyperinfla-

tion and found supported to a considerable extent. The difference in the

results may be related to the extreme magnitude of the monetary disturbances

during that period, arid to the apparently important effect of real factors--

which directly affect relative excess demands-—in the United States.

     The results in this paper are also not in line with previous findings

related to price dispersion in the U.S.   Vining and Elwertowski (1976)

show that the variance of relative prices tends to increase with the magni-

tude of changes in the rate of inflation.1 Parks (1978) tested a model in
                                       —2—




whIch price change dispersion depends on the magnitude of changes in real

 income and unexpected inflation, which is measured by the changes In the

 inflation rate (minus a constant).2 Parks' empirical results strongly support

his model,,

      In the theoretical framework used here, unanticipated inflation is generated

by unexpected money or aggregate-real shocks. These disvrbances also effect

relative prices and thus this model offers a rationalization of the previous

findings in terms of the effects of exogenous shocks. Since,
                                                                 empirically,

the link between money disturbances and price dispersion is found absent, the

explanation offered bythe model is not supported by the data. The additional

variable considered, the magnitude of changes in a measure of aggregate-real

shocks, seems to have a positive correlation with price dispersion,

      In any   event, the apparent regularity of the phenomenon that price dis—

persion is related to the magnitude of changes in the inflation rate still

lacks a satisfactory explanation in terms of the effects of exogenous shocks

or policy variables.


T,   Review of the model.

     This section contains a short outline of the model described in Section I

of my previous paper. The only difference introduced here is an aggregate

supply shock that affects equally all markets.

     The central feature in the localized market models of the type used here,

is the combination of competitive markets--in which demand and supply are

functions of the perceived relative price-—and partial current information.

Agents lack knowledge about prices prevailing contemporaneously in other markets,

and observe only the local price. The information set available to the agents

contains-also lagged variables and some incomplete knowledge about factors govern-

ing the current   period money   growth.

      ia-this mcde1 each location is interpreted as the market of a specific

commodity, d. it is characterized by a particular relative price elasticity

of excess demand. With different elasticities across. markets, unperceived

aggregate disturbances have a different impact on each commodity price, and

thus generate dispersion of prices. The supply and demand for a particular

commodity are aggregations of individual supplies and deiands by a large

number of agents located in period t                   in   marke z.        These functions are given

production process of commodity z. v represents real aggregate supply shocks.

This term can be thought of as, for example, changes in technology or in the

availability of resources such as energy. v is assumed to be normally

Barro (1976), that real shocks follow a random walk; then, the innovation

in the process would have the same effect as                            here.

        At the beginning of the period, new money is introduced into the economy,

equally dispersed across markets. Within each market, however, it is randomly

distributed among the large number of agents located there. The money stock

grows according to m M -                  M        =       g        + m         •       g       is known economy wide, and

markets, X(z) has the average value of X and the "variance"

the price response. This is the channel by which aggregate shocks disperse

individual prices. On the other hand, monetary movements that are fully per-

ceived,            are not confused for relative shifts, and therefore they inflate

equally all prices.

          The variance of relative prices can be calculated by averaging (5)

across markets. However, it is empirically more useful to use the variance

of the rate of change in individual prices Prices may disperse over time

according to different long-run trends. Since this model focuses on short

run distortions caused by imperfect information, one can minimize the

effects of these secular price movements by looking at the variance of the

rate   of change. This variance is defined here as           (1/N) E [P(z) - Pi(z)

parity in elasticities, represented by o              ,   equation (6) predicts a posiive
effect of the magnitude of changes in money and real-aggregate shocks on

price change dispersion.


Section II. Computation of the price dispersion measure: U.S. 1948-1976


       A price dispersion series is constructed using annual average wholesale

price data contained in the Bureau of Labor Statistics WPI subfile taoe. The

computation       has three steps: 1) calculation of the rates of changes                 in individ-

ual prices between each pair of           consecutive     years in the sample, 2)     calculation
of the weight that each commodity has in the total value of sales in primary
                                      -6—



markets, and 3) computation of the average and    variance   of the price changes

using the Individual rates of change and weigfits calculated in 1) and 2).

The computed values are shown   in   columns (1) and 2) of table I.

     Individual commodities are defined here as the subgroups of items

comprising the WPI. There are 86 of thtc subgroups at the beginning

of the sample in 1948, and 97 of them at its end in 1976. This disaggre—

gation is obtained using the three digit code Indexes in the WPI subfile

tape, A report of the procedure adopted in the computations is given in

more detail in the appendix.

     ?Qhereas the problem of the WPI data--discussed by Stigler and Kindahi

(1970)-—that they do not always reflect discounts from list prices and other

terms of trade, it seems that the use of rates of changes in annual average

data diminishes considerably this possible error of measurement. The dis-

crepancy between the WPI indexes and those constructed by Stigler and Kindahi

is, in general, materially less pronounced when the time unit is a year

than when it is shorter. This discrepancy is particularly small in the

rates of price change of metals and fuels, which, in terms of their relative

importance, are the bulk of the commodities that they consider.



Section III. Empirical Results


     This section reports an attempt to test equation (6) using U.S. data

for the period 1948-1976. The          and v series employed in the tests are

the residuals in money growth and output equations respectively, as estimated

by Barro (1978). In that study, money growth was regressed on a number of

current and lagged variables that were considered relevant to predict it

Accordingly, the residuals in the equation were interpreted as the unexpected

money growth shocks. The inclusion of a contemporaneous variable--related

to govement spending--suggests that the residuals could also be interpreted
                                                           —7—



as currently unperceived money, which is the monetary variable that is theo-

retically relevant here.4

      Barro then regressed output on current and past values of the estimated

money shocks. The residuals in this equation are considered here as the

nonnionetary or real disturbances, and are used as values of the v variable.5

In general, however, these residuals are not equal but proportional to

In the framework of this model, the coeffii,.nt of v in the aggregate out-

put equation is computed by solving for output in z and then averaging across

markets. The resulting expression for the (log of the) geometric average

output in the economy is:


              = (1 - 8) (1 —
                                     A)m          +       [0 +    X(l — eflvt
      The coefficient of v is positive and less than one since dx <

It   can be observed that this inequality also implies that monetary shocks

have a positive effect on output. According to this equation, the residuals

in the regression of output on money shocks are interpreted as the real aggre-

gate shocks times the coefficient                                +   d1           -   0).   Note that this interpretation

relies on an implicit assumption made in the specification of the model that

real aggregate shocks affecting the demand side are of minor importance rela-

tive to the supply shocks, and therefore can be neglected..

        Now we can proceed to test equation (6). For convenience it is rewritten

here in the following form

The variances included in the coefficients are considered constant during

 the sample period. Shifts in these variances could be another source of

variation in y. Some reference to thi.s possibility is made below.

        As expressed in equation (7), the model predicts that the absolute value

of the changes in both monetary and real shocks will positively affect dis-

persion. This effect is attributable to unequal quantity and price response

to unexpected shocks across markets. From the point of view of this hypothesis,

the empirical results are in general unsatisfactory and especially negative

with respect to the monetary disturbances. The coefficient of the (m -

variable      has the 'wrong' sign in all the equations estimated, although the

estimated coefficients are also insignificantly different from zero. On

the other hand, the real shock variable appears significantly to affect

dispersion in the way predicted by the model.

The results here are essentially similar to those obtained in the first

regression.

     The additional two measures of price change dispersion used are the

ones computed by Vining and Elwertowski (1976). From the individual items

indexes comprising the tho1esale Price Index, they constructed series of

the sample standard deviations of the unweighted individual price changes

for the period 1948-1974. This series is denoted here by (Y).p The

number of items entering each year in the computation ranges from 1159 to

2033. They performed also similar computations using the Consumer Price

Index components. The number of items considered for each year ranges

from 110 to 311. The symbol used here for this series is

     All the equations estimated yield approximately the same results

although with differences in the goodness of fit. These results amount to a

rejection of the hypothesis, that the magnitude of changes in monetary

shocks, as measured by Barro (1978), positively affects dispersion of

relative prices through the particular channel described in section I.

From the standpoint of this hypothesis, a particularly negative piece

of evidence is the monetary contraction in 1960. In this year, the value

of (m -
          rni)2      is the highest in the sample, at the time that price

dispersion is extremely low-—as it continues to be during the early six-ties.

     With respect to the real shocks                   ,       the   evidence seem. to some extent to

support the hypothesis implied bythe model. However, even with this result

some caution is in order. If one believes that real shocks hit different

markets unequally, they could cause dispersion also or perhaps only by,

shifting the current 2• For example, the oil price shock in late 1973

and 1974 affects sonie sectors of the economy more than others. Namely,

the heavier the use of energy in the production of a particular commodity,
                                     —l 1-.




the   greater the effect of the oil price increase on that industry. There-

fore, besIdes the aggregate impact of this disturbance, It also represents

an intensification of the relative differences of excess demand among the

markets, with the result of a larger price change dispersion.8

      The importance   of   real-relative disturbances that directly affect the

magnitudes of relative excess demands is suggested by the observations cor-

responding to 1974 and the years that follcw, by 1973-—a year of a sharp

foreign demand increase for food products--and by the Korean 1ar. These

types of factors are considered neither in the theoretical model nor directly

in the empirical analysis. However, if the constructed monetary shock series

is independent of these factors, the present procedure for estimating monetary

effects on dispersion would still be satisfactory.



IV. Summary and Conclusions:


      The aim of this paper was to test with U.S. data a model of price dis-

persion in which monetary and real-aggregate shocks are the explanatory variables

However, the effect of money shocks that the model predicts—-on which this

paper is mainly concerned--is not found in the data. Possibly, this effect

is of small magnitude relative to that of apparently important excluded vari-

ables, and thus is difficult to detect in the present empirical framework.

This conjecture is based on a comparison of these results with those from

the German hyperinflation, as reported in Hercowitz (1979). In that period,

in which   money growth is    a predominant factor, a dispersion model of the type

used here receives substantial support.

       In this version of Lucas's (1973) and Barro's (1976) models, money

shocks affect both relative prices and aggregate output. The effect on
                                    —12—



output, well known from those models, occurs because of incomplete inforina-

tion. The additional effect on price dispersion, results from the interaction

between incomplete information and different supply elasticities across

markets. Empirically, Barro (1977, 1978) found that unariticiapted money

has a strong effect on unemployment and output. Using the same monetary

variable, the additional hypothesis derived from this extension is rejected.

This result is reconciled with Barro's if all markets have the same price

elasticity, In this case, the effect on output remains, but that on price

dispersion is absent. However, the assumption of equal short run price

elasticities in all sectors seems fairly strong.

     The empirical   result that unanticipated money is not important for price
dispersion   contrasts with findings of Mills (1927), Vining and Elwertowski
(1976),and Parks (1978), which can be summarized as isolating a positive

correlation between price dispersion and the magnitude of changes in the

inflation   rate. A variable of this type   interpreted in Parks model as
                                            is

the magnitude of unexpected inflation.9 In the model used here, a correla-
tion between price dispersion and   unexpected inflation   follows from the
effects   of money (and real-aggregate) shocks on both. However, since the

hypothesis about the effect of money shocks on dispersion is rejected, a

link between the theoretical model used here and the previous studies fails

to be established.

*Thjs column shows the total number of commodities for which the price
 indexes of year t, year t-1 and the corresponding weight, are all
 available.

      Th procedure adapted.in the calculation               of the prIce disperaion series
is   descrihed here in more detail.

1) Calculation of individual price rates of change.

       The indexes used are annual averages. Their rates of change are computed

by the first difference in the logarithms of the indexes, namely


                               log                                   are the price indexes
             =   log       -         1'lt-l' where P.. ri    P11
of commodity I at time t and             t-l.

2) Calculation of the weights assigned to each commodity.

       Here I am refering briefly to the methodology of the computation of

the WPI. For details see Wholesale Prices and                Price   tndexes (1973). The

weights assigned to the commodities comprising the WPI are the percentages

of   the   primary     sales   of the various commodities in the total of primary          sales.
The values of these weights are not available for each year. During the

sample period, Industrial Censuses were carried on in 1952/53, 1954, 1958,

1963, and     1972.     Major    revisions      of the weights were performed a few years

after each census, in January of the years 1955, 1958, 1961, 1967, and                    1976,
when these data became available. From one year to the next between two

major revisions, the weights were updated by the rate of change in the com-

modity price, and         then   normalized to get their sum      equal   to one. This

procedure implies the assumption that the quantities are constant between

two major revisions and           that   only the differential price changes affect

the share of each commodity in the total sales.

       Since I did riot find available the computed weights for each year in

the sample, I used the same procedure and the published weights data for

December 1954, 1957, 1960, 1966, and 1975 to calculate the intermediate

years figures. More concisely, having the weights for T                     1955, 1958,
                                           figures for the intermediate years
1q61, 1967, and 1976, the corresponding

are computed as follows



       wit    wit



       jt it'       it

where w. is the normalized weight and T <     t< T   +   1.   For the period 1948-


1954, T = 1955.

       A likely minor additional point is that the weights assigned to each
                                          the month of December in the previous
       are the figures corresponding to

       and it-l would correspond to a pair of points
                                               Therefore it seems a good approxi-
 of each one of the two concecutiVe years.

 mation to weight         with weights corresponding to December t-l, which

 presumably lies between those two points.

              Related evidence was obtained by Cukierman and Wachtel (l978) They

found a positive cbrrelation between price dispersion and the variance of

inflationary expectations across individus.

         4However, Ba.rro and Hercowitz (1979) found that this measure of unanti-

cipated money is uncorrelated with the amounts of the revisLons in the published

money stock data, which can be considered as unperceived money at the time of

the first publication.


         5The output equation in Barro (1978) contains also a military conscrip-.

tion variable, which could also be considered as a real shock. However, the

v variable values are theoretically considered unperceived as such during

period t.         The military conscription hardly can be thought of as being

currently unperceived and therefore,                it   is not taken into account for Vt.

         7The results are also unchanged if              actual money growth, rather than        its

unexpected component, is used in the equation.


         8The    equation was   also estimated using the sample 1948-1972. This

regression showed a much poorer fit. There was no change in the effect of

insignificant for this sample.

as Parks: specifies, the change      in the   inflation rate represents not only
unexpected     inflation (plus a constant), but also    the change in expected
inflation .      Obviously,   a rationalizatjcn of the observed correlation
under   the   second interpretation, would be based on rather different consid-
erat ions.

     10Particularly,    I   was not able to find relative importance data based
on the 1947 Census, which the BLS used
                                       as basic weights for computing the

corresponding figures until December 1953. Therefore, the weights for the

period 1948-1953 are constructed backwards using the data from the 1952-

1953 Census.
