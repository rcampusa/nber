The elasticity of substitution between goods from different countries---the Armington elasticity---is
important for many questions in international economics, but its magnitude is subject to debate: the
"macro" elasticity between home and import goods is often found to be smaller than the "micro" elasticity
between foreign sources of imports. We investigate these two elasticities in a model using a nested
CES preference structure. We explore estimation techniques for the macro and micro elasticities using
both simulated data from a Melitz-style model, and highly disaggregate U.S. production data matched
to Harmonized System trade data. We find that in up to one-half of goods there is no significant difference
between the macro and micro elasticities, but in the other half of goods the macro elasticity is significantly
lower than the micro elasticity, even when they are estimated at the same level of disaggregation.

1     Introduction


The elasticity of substitution between goods produced in di¤erent countries – or the Armington
(1969) elasticity – has long been one of the key parameters in international economics. Because
it governs the strength of the relative demand response to relative international prices, this elas-
ticity is central to understanding many features of the global economy. These include the role
of international prices in trade balance adjustment, the optimal extent of international portfolio
diversi…cation, the e¤ects of regional trade agreements, and the welfare bene…ts of expanding world
trade.
    Since at least the 1940s, economists have used both aggregate and disaggregate trade data in
attempts to estimate the responsiveness of demand to international prices. Periodic comprehensive
surveys by Cheng (1959), Leamer and Stern (1970), Magee (1975), Stern, Francis, and Schumacher
(1976), Goldstein and Khan (1985), Shiells, Stern, and Deardor¤ (1986), Marquez (2002), and
McDaniel and Balistreri (2003), among others, document the growth over time in the supply of
econometric studies on larger and increasingly detailed data sets. Yet despite an ever-expanding
body of empirical study, there remains substantial uncertainty about the appropriate elasticity
values to apply to di¤erent research and policy questions.
    That uncertainty is re‡ected, in particular, in the elasticities that are used in computable
general equilibrium models (CGE). Traditionally (for example, Harrison, Rutherford and Tarr 1997;
Balstreri and Rutherford 2013; Hillberry and Hummels 2013), CGE models applied to international
trade have used a nested CES structure on preferences, with an upper-level “macro” elasticity
governing the substitution between home a foreign goods, and a lower-level “micro” elasticity
governing the substitution between varieties of foreign goods. The calibrated values of the macro
elasticity were lower than those of the micro elasticity, as justi…ed by the di¤ering elasticities
estimated from data at various levels of aggregation.1 Recently, however, work of Dekle, Eaton and
Kortum (2007, 2008) has spawned a new generation of computable models that do not allow for
any di¤erence between the macro and micro elasticities, but have a single elasticity in preferences
between all product varieties, home or foreign. Calibration of these models instead relies on “trade
costs” that di¤er for international versus domestic sales. We believe the absence of any di¤erence
between the micro and macro elasticities in this new generation of models can lead to substantial
di¤erences in results compared to those of the earlier CGE models.2
    To evaluate the di¤erence between the elasticity of substitution between home and foreign
   1
     Goldstein and Khan (1985) survey a large body of research on empirical aggregate import equations and endorse a
much earlier judgment by Harberger (1957) that for a typical country the price elasticity of import demand “lies in or
above the range of 0:5 to 1:0....”More recent macro studies such as Heathcote and Perri (2002) and Bergin (2006)
estimate aggregate substitution elasticities around unity. In apparently sharp contrast, recent studies of individual
product groups such as Feenstra (1994), Lai and Tre‡er (2002), Broda and Weinstein (2006), Romalis (2007), and
Imbs and Méjean (2013) tend to identify much stronger price responses.

     For example, contrast the results from the CGE models of China’s growth and trade with the rest of the world
in Tokarick (2012) and di Giovanni, Levchenko, and Zhang (2012).

goods, and between varieties of foreign goods, requires two ingredients: a model that allows for
such a nested CES structure and a dataset that has both home and foreign supplies at exactly the
same level of disaggregation. We provide both these ingredients here. We build upon the general-
equilibrium trade model growing out of work by Melitz (2003) and Chaney (2008), while allowing
the Armington substitution elasticity between domestic and foreign suppliers to di¤er from that
between alternative foreign suppliers, using a nested CES preference structure.3
    Section 2 develops the disaggregate (by good and country) import demand equation implied by
the model. Endogeneity of the terms in this equation, along with measurement error due to the use
of unit values rather than ideal price indexes in the estimation, introduces statistical biases that
can be signi…cant in magnitude: there is not just bias in small samples, but inconsistency in large
samples. We illustrate this bias/inconsistency in section 3 through OLS estimation using simulated
as well as U.S. data. The simulated dataset incorporates shocks to tastes and technologies that
are calibrated from the literature, and results in downward-biased estimates of both the micro and
macro Armington elasticities. The U.S. dataset matches data on imports (by source country) and
exports for about 100 goods with product-level data on U.S. production, and therefore implied
apparent consumption. The U.S. production data are obtained from Current Industrial Reports,
and our estimation is the …rst time that such data have been matched to the highly-disaggregate
(Harmonized System, or HS) level for imports.
    In section 4 we draw on Feenstra (1994) to propose a generalized method of moments (GMM)
estimation strategy that – in large samples at least – corrects for the statistical biases implied by
our model. The moment condition we rely on is that the demand error is uncorrelated with the
supply error for each country. Soderbury (2010, 2012) has recently identi…ed small-sample biases in
this estimator using simulated data.4 That concern is ampli…ed by our extension of this estimator
to the nested CES framework in this paper, where the estimating equation is considerably more
complicated than in Feenstra (1994). We apply the GMM estimator to our simulated data and …nd
that this small-sample bias persists even for sample sizes considerably larger than what we have in
our U.S. data. We then suggest a possible solution: adding an additional moment condition to the
estimation.
    In general, GMM estimation is improved by adding additional moment conditions. But as
noted by Wooldridge (2001, p.91), extra conditions can add noise unless they are conceptually well-
founded. Our nested CES framework allows for a natural condition by aggregating the demand
equation over foreign countries, to obtain an alternative equation for total imports relative to
domestic demand, which only involves the macro Armington elasticity. We naturally refer to this
   3
     Ardelean and Lugovskyy (2010) also introduce a nested CES structure into a monopolistic competition and trade
model, but do not allow for heteregeneous …rms as in the Melitz-Chaney model. Ideally, the di¤erence between the
“micro” and “macro” elasticities should be derived from an underlying micro-structure, but we do not attempt to
solve that problem here. See the recent paper by Cosar et al. (2011) for empirical evidence on home bias (which
they describe as “border frictions”) in the wind turbine industry in Europe. One relevant factor might be the per-
ceived security of supply. Blonigen and Wilson (1999) identify some structural determinants of empirical Armington
substitution elasticities between U.S. goods and imports.
   4
     The potential for small-sample bias in the GMM estimator applied to other datasets was found earlier by Altonji
and Segal (1996).


                                                         2
as the “macro” demand equation. The corresponding moment condition is that the error of the
macro demand equation is uncorrelated with the error of the macro supply equation. As we discuss
in section 4, this moment condition adds new information. We …nd that after using this extra
condition, the sectoral macro elasticities estimates in our U.S. data rise in all sectors, becoming
greater than unity in most cases. Still, the macro elasticity is found to below micro elasticities for
about half of the nearly 100 goods.
        The key feature of our data and results is that the macro and micro elasticities are estimated
at the same level of disaggregation, that is, close to the HS level. In section 5 we brie‡y explore the
theoretical implications of aggregation across goods. We …nd that there exists an aggregate import
demand equation with the same macro elasticity that applies at more disaggregate levels. In other
words, aggregation itself need not lead to a lower value of the macro elasticity.5 This result is at
…rst sight surprising: the nested CES utility function that we assume is not weakly separable across
imports of all goods and domestic consumption of all goods, so it does not obviously allow one to
treat imports as a separate aggregate with a well-de…ned price index. However, drawing an analogy
to the “latent separability”concept of Blundell and Robin (2000), we show that our utility function
allows for consistent aggregation across goods even when conventional weak separability does not
hold. Section 6 applies out model and empirical estimates to the classic question of calculating the
impact on imports of currency devaluation. Our discussion of devaluation e¤ects highlights the key
role of the macro Armington elasticity.
        In summary, our paper gives a nuanced answer to the question of whether the micro and
macro elasticites di¤er. For at least one-half of the goods in our sample, the elasticities are not
signi…cantly di¤erent. That result gives limited support to the new computable models initiated by
Dekle, Eaton and Kortum (2007, 2008), which do not introduce allow di¤erences between the micro
and macro elasticities of substitution. For the remaining sectors, however, the macro elasticity is
signi…cantly lower, albeit not as low as the estimates around unity often found using macro time-
series methods. For many policy questions, such as gauging the e¤ect of a currency devaluation on
aggregate imports, it therefore remains important to take account of potential di¤erences between
the micro and macro elasticities. Further conclusions are given in section 7, and various technical
results are gathered in two appendices.


2        The Model
2.1       Preferences and Prices
There are J countries in the world and a …xed number G of di¤erent goods. Each country produces a
range of distinct varieties of each good g 2 f1; :::; Gg, the set of varieties produced to be determined
endogenously within our model.
    5
    This theoretical result would be o¤set, however, if the macro elasticity di¤ers across goods in a way that is
correlated with the residual in the estimating equation. These circumstances would lead to "heterogeneity bias" or
"aggregation bias" in the elasticity estimate, as analyzed by Dekle, Jeong, and Ryoo (2013) and Imbs and Méjean
(2013). That source of bias is not the focus here. The classic treatment is Orcutt (1950).

ences in their characteristics, but also by their place of production. In the “home country” j, the

to country j. Let ' denote a producer-speci…c productivity factor. In our model, Ngij will be the
size of an interval of producer-speci…c productivity factors and …rms can be indexed by ' in that

interval. For a …rm ' in i that exports the amount ygij (') to country j, the unit labor requirement
is
                                                                    ygij (')

                                                   g (') =                   + fgij ;

where Ag is a global good-speci…c productivity shock, Ai is a country-speci…c productivity shock,
and fgij is a …xed labor cost of exporting g from i to j.
       The distribution of producer-speci…c productivity factors ' among varieties follows the cumu-

available are a panel of one destination country j; multiple source countries i = 1; :::; J; i 6= j; and
multiple time periods t = 1; :::; T:6 We allow the random taste and productivity parameters to vary
over time, which implies that all endogenous variables are time-varying, too.

    Having multiple destination countries is straightforward in the theory, but since that is not the case in our U.S.
data, we do not pursue that generalization here.

Notice that this import demand equation includes the multilateral import price index relative to the
             Fj   jj
home price, Pgt =Pgt ; on the right, from which the elasticity ! g is identi…ed, whereas the elasticity
                                                             ij   Fj 7
 g   is identi…ed from the relative bilateral import price, Pgt =Pgt .
         This import demand equation di¤ers from the form in which it would be estimated, however,
                              ij
because the CES price index, Pgt , is rarely if ever measured in practice by o¢ cial statistical agencies.
                           ij                                                                   ij
As it is speci…ed in (6), Pgt will fall whenever there is an expansion in the set of varieties Ngt , because
such an expansion provides a utility gain for consumers and therefore lowers the “true”price index.
                                    ij      ij
This negative relationship between Pgt and Ngt can be seen from (8), for example. Price indexes
used in practice, such as the Laspeyres import and export prices used by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS), do not make such a correction for variety. The same is true for unit values, which
we shall use in our empirical application and which are in fact adversely a¤ected by expansions in
variety.

second equality follows from (8). It is apparent from (13) that the unit value is positively associated
                                     ij
with an increase in product variety Ngt , in contrast to the CES price index in (8). Another way to
                                           ij
state this result is that product variety Ngt is the measurement error in the unit value as compared
to the exact price index. The reason for this is that an expansion of demand in country j for the
goods from i will lead to entry in country i, thereby driving up the average price as less e¢ cient
…rms enter. The rate at which the average price rises as compared to the relative wage depends on
the inverse of the Pareto parameter, 1=              i,    which appears in (13). Note that this expression holds
                                                     g
equally well for the home county j unit value U Vgtjj :

       The true import demand equation involves the overall import price index Pgt , which is a CES
                                             ij
function of the underlying bilateral prices Pgt according to equation (3). The intertemporal ratio
of CES import price indexes can be measured by the exact index due to Sato (1976) and Vartia
(1976). In this case the taste coe¢ cients appearing in (3) are random, so they also need to be
included in the Sato-Vartia index, which is:8

The special formula for these weights in (15) is needed for the geometric mean in (14) precisely to

3    Data and OLS estimation
We have every reason to expect that the error term is correlated with the relative prices that appear
                                                                                                                                                                            ij
on the right of (17). For example, a taste shock toward goods from foreign country i (a rise in                                                                             g )
would raise imports Vgtij but would also tend to raise the unit value U Vgtij , because wages in country
i would increase. This correlation will tend to create a downward bias in the OLS estimates of the
price elasticity      g.   A further bias occurs because the unit values measure the true price indexes with
error, so that the error term incorporates relative variety, which is itself changing endogenously.
Similar sources of bias due to taste shocks and due to variety occur in the OLS estimates of the
macro elasticity ! g :
    There is an interesting di¤erence in the micro and macro biases, however. Notice that macro


                                                                                      10
coe¢ cient (1    ! g ) applies to the …nal variable in (17) and also applies – with a minus sign – to
the …nal source of error in (18). That pattern is exactly the structure of classical measurement
error, where the term x in a regression equation becomes (x + u)                 u when x is measured with
the error u. The term       u is of course added to the error in the regression model, and a familiar
calculation show that this classical measurement error leads to a bias toward zero in : We cannot
claim that the measurement error in our model is classical (i.e. uncorrelated with other variables),
because the …nal source of error in (18) is endogenous within our model. Neverthless, the similarity
in structure to classical error –with (1 ! g ) applying to both the …nal variable in (17) and the …nal
source of error in (18) –means that we can still expect a bias towards zero in the OLS estimate of
(1    ! g ) so that the macro elasticity ! g is biased towards unity.
     That result does not apply to the micro elasticity    g,   however, because the measurement error
in (13) itself depends on the micro elasticity, appearing there as 1=(       g     1). As a result, the …rst
two terms in (18) do not depend on any coe¢ cients. We have argued above that                g   is downward
biased, but there is not necessarily a bias towards zero in (      g    1): Rather, it can be shown more
formally that the downward bias in        g   can easily lead to OLS estimates below unity (or even
below zero). For both the micro and macro elasticity estimates, we should not expect their OLS
biases to diminish in large samples: the simultaneity and measurement error biases also lead to
inconsistency. We demonstrate this bias/inconsistency in the micro and macro elasticities in the
next two subsections: …rst using simulated data, and then using a new U.S. dataset containing
disaggregate data for both imports and domestic production.

3.1    Simulated Data
We simulate a small-scale example of our theoretical model to demonstrate that the shocks to
productivity and preferences can generate the observed downward bias in OLS estimates. To
minimize computational requirements, we use …ve countries and ten goods in the simulation. The
goods di¤er in the way we calibrate their relevant productivity and taste shocks, as described in
this section, which is intended to satisfy the assumptions necessary for identi…cation, speci…ed in
section 4. To re‡ect the short sample for most goods in the actual data, there are 10 observations
for each simulated country-pair-good combination.          We calibrate the model using variances of
shocks taken from plant-level and macroeconomic studies, as follows. Appendix A shows how we
solve for the model’s equilibrium.
     We assume that all productivity and taste shocks are covarying and log-normally distributed.
To this end, we draw random numbers for each from a multivariate normal distribution, then
exponentiate them such that they form covarying log-normal random variables. We calibrate the
standard deviation of the log of country-wide productivity shocks Ai and industry-level productivity
shocks Ag using estimates by Basu, Fernald and Kimball (2006, hereafter BFK) as 0.015 and
0.02, respectively. These industries are disaggregated only at the 2-digit SIC level, but have the
advantage of being perfectly matched in methodology and source to the aggregate productivity
shock measure. While the value from BFK serves as the baseline standard deviation of country-


                                                    11
speci…c shocks (applied to the largest country), we make the productivity and preference shocks
heteroskedastic to be in accordance with identifying conditions for the GMM method that we will
use later and that is discussed below. We scale the BFK values for the standard deviations (0.015
for log(Ai ) and 0.02 for log(Ag )) along the diagonal of the portion of the variance-covariance matrix
corresponding to log productivity shocks across countries by a constant that is equally spaced along
the interval [0.95, 1.05]. The same is done for the standard deviation of log productivity shocks
across goods, using a constant equally spaced along the interval [0.4, 1]. Thus, these scaled values
make up the diagonals of our variance-covariance matrix for the portion corresponding to the log
of productivity shocks Ai and Ag .
         As a guide to calibrate the standard deviations for our taste shocks, we use the standard
deviation of demand shocks (in logs, demeaned by year and product and controlling for income)
estimated by Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008), for which industries are characterized
by 7-digit SIC codes. Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson …nd that the standard deviation of log
preference shocks is …ve times as large as that of log productivity shocks using plant-level data.
We apply the same proportion to the relative size of the standard deviation of the log taste shocks
here for a median good and the industry-level productivity shocks calibrated using Basu, Fernald,
                                                                                     j                                    ij
and Kimball (2006). That is, half of the good-country (log(                          g ))   and good-country-pair (log(   g ))
taste shocks have standard deviations below the standard deviation of log(Ag ) and half greater.
                                                                                                                          j
We scale the diagonal values of the variance-covariance matrix corresponding to taste shocks                              g   by
a constant spaced over the interval [0.1, 20].
                                   ij                                                                                         ij )
         For the taste shocks      g    applying to bilateral country pairs, we include both a country-pair (
                                                                     ij
and a country-pair-good (^ ij
                           g ) component, setting                    g    = 0:5   ij +0:5^ ij .
                                                                                           g      We do this because bilateral
taste shocks that apply equally across goods are key to dampening OLS estimates of , but taste
shocks that are heteroskedastic across goods are key to identifying ! g in the GMM estimation.9
Because there is little empirical guidance to calibrate the variances, we give the log of these shocks
a mean of zero and a minimum variance of 0.25, scaling the diagonal values of the portion of the
variance-covariance matrix corresponding to ^ ij
                                              g by a constant equally spaced over the interval [0.5,
1] and the diagonal values of the portion of the variance-covariance matrix corresponding to ^ ij
                                                                                               g by
a constant equally spaced over the interval [0.1, 10]. Again, the median good has log taste shocks
 j             ij
 g       and   g    roughly …ve times the size of the variance of its corresponding productivity shocks,
                                                                                                                               ij
which is in line with the estimates by Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008).10 Because the                                 g
taste shocks are shares that must sum to one, we divide each one by their sum.
                                   j
         We set the mean of        g    equal to 0.5 for all countries and goods, allowing home bias to emerge
from trade costs rather than a presumed preference weight. There are no obvious estimates of
                         j
the variance of          g,   so we set the standard deviation of these shocks to be 1.5 percent of the size

productivity shocks – to give them macroeconomic signi…cance without allowing them to exceed

the size of other shocks that have more precise estimates in the literature.11
       There is little evidence in the literature measuring the correlation between productivity shocks
and taste shocks. We set the mean covariances for all log variables (the o¤-diagonals of the mul-
tivariate normal distribution’s variance-covariance matrix) equal to 0.75. Being agnostic as to the
sign or relative size of these covariances, we shock them each period, multiplying the mean 0.75
by a normally distributed random variable with mean zero and standard deviation 0.25. So the
o¤-diagonals of the variance-covariance matrix for the normal draws are given by 0.75 multiplied
by these normally distributed shocks.
       We vary country size (Lj ) so that the largest country is …ve times as large as the smallest
country and the size of the median country is normalized to equal 1.12 The variable trade cost
  is 1.15, about halfway between the minimum and maximum values for trade costs estimated
by Hummels (2007). The …xed cost of production fgij is set to 0.05.13 We set ! g equal to 2, in
accord with Ruhl (2008), and set            g   equal to 3, within the range of estimates of the elasticity of
substitution between imported varieties identi…ed by Feenstra (1994) and Broda and Weinstein
(2006). The Pareto shape parameter               g   is set equal to 3:5 so that the distribution of …rm size has
a fat tail (di Giovanni, Levchenko, and Rancière 2010).14
       Using this simulated dataset, we estimate (17) using panel OLS over all export sources i and
goods g. We identify the median estimate from 1,000 simulations for both                            and ! separately
and then use a bootstrap on the associated dataset to obtain con…dence intervals.15 The median
estimate of      for the 1,000 simulated datasets with T = 10 is 0.369, as shown in the …rst row of
Table 1, with a 95% con…dence interval of (0:12; 1:95). The true value of , which is 3, does not
lie within the con…dence interval, demonstrating a very large downward bias in the OLS estimate.
That …nding is in line with our discussion above, where we expected a bias in the OLS estimate
that is downward and not necessarily towards unity. The median estimate of 0.369 is obtained with
only T = 10 time periods in the simulated data, but when we use more time periods such as 50
and 100 as reported in Table 1, the bias does not noticeably lessen. As we expected, the OLS bias
becomes inconsistency in large samples.
  11
      We also experimented with giving all shocks an autocorrelation coe¢ cient of between 0 and 0.9, correspond-
ing to the measured behavior of productivity shocks in the macroeconomics literature. Since GMM corrects for
autocorrelation issues, our results are unchanged, and so shocks are not autocorrelated in our baseline analysis.
   12
      Note that our assumption of a …xed labor supply corresponds to the common assumption in the macroeconomics
literature that (dis)utility is quadratic in labor. Our results are robust to allowing small shocks to the labor supply,
analogous to shocks in the elasticity of labor supply.
   13
      We calibrate the …xed cost to roughly match the percentage of the U.S. working-age population that are business
owners, as reported by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor. The GEM reports that 15.5% of the working-age
population owned a nascent, new, or established business in 2007 (Phinisee et al. 2008). It is di¢ cult for us to target
this level precisely due to the endogenous number of …rms Ngij . The fraction Ngij fgij =Li averages 15.1% for the largest
country in our simulations. The results are robust to increases the size of the …xed costs.
   14
      In addition to ensuring su¢ cient mass in the tail of the …rm size distribution, choice of 3.5 for the Pareto shape
parameter is broadly consistent with the literature. See Simonovska and Waugh (2011, 2012) for the most recent
estimates.
   15
      In the bootstrap we do not redraw observations for entire countries, as sometimes used in panel work, because
the number of countries is too small. Instead, we hold the sample of countries …xed and redraw observations by year.
This bootstrap method is used to obtain standard errors for all OLS and GMM estimation.

Table 1: Median OLS Estimates of the Micro and Macro Elasticities from Simulated and U.S. Data

                                  T 15           (0.89, 1.23)   (0.54, 1.24)


Note: The …rst three rows report the median estimate from 1,000 simulated datasets, where the
true value of is 3, the true value of ! is 2, and T indicates the length of the time series. The …nal
row reports the median estimate over 109 U.S. goods. For both the simulated and U.S. data, the
con…dence intervals shown in parentheses are computed by bootstrapping the dataset corresponding
to the median estimate.



       The median estimate for ! is 1.35, with a 95% con…dence interval of [0.607, 2.101] obtained
through the same bootstrap process. Because the true value 2 for this macro elasticity is contained
within the con…dence interval, we are …nding less downward bias than was the case for the micro
elasticity. Once again, the median estimates of the macro elasticity do not vary much as we expand
the number of time periods in the simulation, falling from 1.35 to 1.34 and then rising to 1.40 as
T expand s from 10 to 50 to 100. These results suggest a bias/inconsistency towards unity in the
OLS estimates of the macro elasticity, which is in line with our expectations.



3.2        U.S. Data
We run analagous OLS regressions to investigate U.S. import supply for multiple foreign countries at
the most disaggregate level possible. The import data at 10-digit Harmonized System (HS) level are
readily available, along with the associated unit values, but it is di¢ cult to match these imports to
the associated U.S. supply. We make use of a unique data source called Current Industrial Reports
(CIR), which is published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census and reports imports, exports and
U.S. production at a disaggregate “product code” level. Recent years are available online,16 and
 16
      http://www.census.gov/manufacturing/cir/index.html.



                                                      14
past years were obtained from an online archive, so the dataset spans 1992-2007. The data are in
readable PDF or similar format, so we laboriously transcribed these to machine-readable datasets.
   Limitations of the CIR data are that: (i) it is only a subset of U.S. manufacturing industries;
(ii) the list of industries changes over time, especially with the shift from SIC (Standard Industrial
Classi…cation) to NAICS (North American Industry Classi…cation System) in 1997; (iii) not all
industries include import, export and U.S. domestic supply data for both values and quantities (as
needed to compute unit values); (iv) while a concordance from HS to the “product codes” used to
track industries in CIR is provided, a given HS is sometimes associated with more than one product
code. In the latter case, we needed to aggregate U.S. shipments across multiple product codes to
obtain a correspondence to the import and export data.
   After this aggregation procedure, the resulting dataset has 191 goods, by which we mean an
SIC-based product code (up to 7 digits) or a NAICS-based product code (up to 10 digits). Of
these, 80 goods are based on a single 10-digit Harmonized System (HS) commodity, and another
42 goods are based on two or three 10-digit HS commodities. So the majority of the dataset is at
a highly disaggregate level: this is the …rst time we are aware of that U.S. production data have
been matched to imports and exports at such a disaggregate level (although there are earlier e¤orts
at higher levels of aggregation, such as Reinert and Roland-Holst 1992 and Gallaway, McDaniel ,
and Rivera 2003). Since we have the matching exports and imports for these 191 goods, we can
also compute U.S. apparent consumption, and consumption from U.S. supply, as appears in the
denominator of the dependent variable in (17). When estimating this equation we pool across
goods when they share some common HS commodities: this happens frequently for a SIC and
NAICS-based product pair spanning 1992-1996 and 1997-2007, but sometimes a product code in
one period will correspond to two codes in the other period, or there may be no correspondence
over time. So after this pooling we end up with 109 slightly broader “goods”used in the estimation
rather than 191. Each of these 109 goods is available for at most 16 years, giving T = 15 when the
data are …rst di¤erenced, but very often less than that.
   Using this dataset, we estimate (17) using panel OLS over all export sources i for each good. At
the bottom of Table 1 we report the median estimate of the micro elasticity    g   obtained over the 109
goods, which is 1:06: Once again, its con…dence interval is obtained by bootstrapping the dataset
for the product corresponding to that median estimate. The kernel density of the estimates of       g   is
graphed in Figure 1, along with the kernel densities of the lower and upper 95% con…dence bounds.
Approximately 90% of the estimates of      g   are below 1:5, which indicates rather low estimates for
this micro Armington elasticity as compared with other estimates in the literature (e.g. Broda and
Weinstein, 2006). So the median estimates of the micro elasticities from our U.S. data appear to
be low, though not as low as those those from the simulated data, where the median estimates are
0.37. The fact that our estimates of the micro elasticity from U.S. data have a median so close to
unity, and a sizable mass of the kernel density around that point, suggests to us that there is a
good deal of classical measurement error in the U.S. unit values. That is not a surprising result
when considering the erratic nature of import unit values at the Harmonized System level. The


                                                   15
errors in our simulated model, by contrast, do not give rise to classical measurement error in the
estimation of   g:
    At the bottom of Table 1 we also report the median OLS estimate of the macro elasticity ! g ,
which is 0:89. The kernel density of the estimates of ! g is graphed in Figure 2. The bias in this
OLS estimate of the macro elasticity is unknown because we do not have more reliable estimates
from the literature –at the same level of disaggregation –to compare it to. But the fact that the
median estimate of the macro elasticity is so close to unity, again with a sizable mass of the kernel
density around this point, suggests to us again that classical measurement error applies to the OLS
estimate of the macro elasticity, too.


4    Estimating with Moment Conditions
We turn now to an improved estimation technique that will allow us to estimate the micro and
macro elasticities with less bias, and test whether these two elasticities di¤er. The nested CES
preferences allow us to estimate the micro and macro elasticities from several inter-related moment
conditions. The …rst of these conditions is obtained from relative demand for imports, together
with a reduced-form supply equation. Feenstra (1994) assumed that the errors in these import
demand and supply equations are uncorrelated, which gives a moment condition that is used to
obtain the micro elasticity   g   and corrects for simultaneous equation bias and measurement error.
This procedure is described as “step 1” below.
    To also obtain the macro elasticity, we begin with the demand for imports relative to home
demand. That demand equation involves both the micro and macro elasticities, and likewise, we
work with a reduced-form supply equation that has two supply-side parameters. Assuming again
that the error terms in the demand and supply equations are uncorrelated gives us a second moment
condition that can be used to obtain the micro and macro elasticities, in “step 2.”We will …nd from
our simulated dataset that there is still some small-sample bias in the estimation of the micro and
macro elasticities. We can o¤set this bias by increasing the number of years in our simulation, but
cannot do so with our U.S. data, which has a quite limited time span. So instead, we investigate
adding an additional equation to help o¤set the bias in the elasticities.
    In particular, by aggregating over source countries, we can work with total import demand
relative to home demand, in what we call “step 3.” That demand equation only involves the macro
Armington elasticity — not the micro elasticity from step 1. But we will …nd that the corresponding
reduced-form supply equation involves the supply parameters estimated in steps 1 and 2. So this
extra equation — at the level of total import demand — can help to identify the macro elasticity
without introducing an extra parameters on the supply side. We will …nd that estimation of these
three stages provides us with estimates of the Armington elasticities that are close to unbiased in
our simulated data. This is the estimation method that we then use on the U.S. data.

4.1     Step 1: The Micro Elasticities
For the micro elasticity, we can start with a simpli…ed demand equation that only relies on import
                                                                              ij
data. Sum (17) across foreign countries i 6= j using the Sato-Vartia weights wgt ; and then take
the di¤erence between (17) and the resulting equation. The terms involved home demand Vgtjj and
unit value U Vgtjj cancel out when we take the di¤erence, and we obtain the simple import demand
equation:

    Shifting the unit-values to the left and dividing by (                                 g        1), we obtain:

The error on the right are shocks to the relative demand for imports due to changes in tastes
or variety – both of which appear in the error term "ijF                   ij   Fj
                                                     gt : We expect that Vgt =Vgt will increase
with a positive shock to "iF
                          g , thereby dampening the response of the relative import unit value.
Accordingly, we will suppose that a linear projection of the relative import unit value on the
demand shocks pooled over all import sources i takes the form,

                          gt   which we expect to be between 0 and 1, as a result of the dampening
discussed above. The presumed positive sign for this coe¢ cient means that we interpret (21) as a
reduced-form supply curve.
                                                                                                                                 iF
    As it is stated, equation (21) is without loss of generality and the residual                                                gt   in this supply
curve is uncorrelated with the variables on the right of (21) over all import sources i by construction.
That is, conditional on the data on the right of (21), the OLS coe¢ cient                                                1g   is chosen so that the
following condition holds:

We will, however, make the stronger assumption that this moment condition holds in expectation
for each individual source country i:
                               P      iF iF
    Assumption 1: E                t "gt gt       = 0 for i = 1; : : : ; J, i 6= j:

    The same assumption was made in Feenstra (1994) in a simpler system that used a partial
equilibrium supply curve. The motivation for Assumption 1 in Feenstra (1994) was that di¤erent
factors are shifting demand and supply, and it is these unmeasured factors that are entering the
error terms in each equation, making it reasonable to treat these errors as uncorrelated.17 In this
paper we do not assume such a partial equilibrium supply curve because we are using the Melitz
model, where wages and prices are determined in general equilibrium. So the reduced form (21)
plays the role of a supply curve.
    Assumption 1 gives us J               1 moment conditions for each good that we can use to estimate the
two parameters       g   and   1g .   To see this, we proceed as in Feenstra (1994), by isolating the error
terms in the demand equation (20) and supply equation (21):

Here, the second line of (24) follows by substituting for "iF
                                                           g from (23). Multiplying these two
equations together and dividing by 1                           1g    (    g         1), we obtain the estimating equation:

                                                                 (    g        1)(1              1g )

    Summing over time, the expectation of the error term in (27) is zero from Assumption 1, so
that gives us J       1 moment conditions that we can use for estimation. Formally, we can proceed
  17
     This logic does not go through, however, when an unmeasured factor in‡uences both demand and supply. An
example is unmeasured quality, which would a¤ect both demand and supply costs, so that the demand and supply
errors would be correlated with each other. The solution in that case is to explicitly model the choice of quality by
…rms, and introduce that variable into both the demand and supply equations, as done by Feenstra and Romalis
(2012). They show how the GMM estimates of g are a¤ected by introducing quality in this manner.


                                                                              18
by using source-country indicator variables as instrumental variables (IV) in non-linear estimation.
The inner-product of the error term with the indicator variable for country i is just the average
value of (27) over time, for that i. From Assumption 1, this magnitude has expected value of
zero, so that the source-country indicator variables are not correlated with the error term and are
therefore valid IV, so that (25) can be estimated with two-stage least squares (TSLS).
    To see the e¤ect of using these IV in practice, suppose that country i appears for Tgi periods
in (25). If we regress the left and right-hand side variables on country indicators, we obtain the
following equation:
                               iF           iF            iF
                             Yg =      1g X 1g   +   2g X 2g   + uiF
                                                                  g ; i = 1; :::; J; i 6= j;                       (28)

where the bar indicates the average value of each variable over time. Because country i appeared
for Tgi periods in the original equation (25), then likewise that country appears for Tgi periods in
(28), i.e. just repeating the averaged obervation for that country Tgi times. So the TSLS procedure
it equivalent to estimating (28) over countries while weighting each country-observation by Tgi (i.e.
                                                    q
multiplying each country-observation in (28) by Tgi ): We will still refer to these estimates as
TSLS, even when the averaging and weighting of the country-observations is done manually.18
    In order for the source-country indicators to be valid instruments, we also need to check that
a rank condition holds: namely, that the matrix of right-hand side variables regressed on the
instruments has full rank. Feenstra (1994) argues that the rank condition holds in this system if
and only if there is su¢ cient heteroskedasticity in the error terms for demand and supply.19 That
requirement is an example of “identi…cation through heteroskedasticity,” as labeled by Rigobon
(2003), and applied here in a panel context.20
   Using initial estimates of ^1g and ^2g , we obtain ^ g , along with ^1g by a quadratic equation
arising from (26) (see Feenstra 1994). We can improve e¢ ciency by using weighting estimates,
obtained from the errors:


                                       biF
                                       u       iF        ^1g X iF      ^2g X iF :
                                        gt = Ygt                 1gt         2gt

We weight the estimating equation (25) by the inverse of the variance of these errors over time,
for each country i, and then re-estimate (25) to obtained e¢ cient estimates of                   g   and   1g :   This
procedure corresponds to the weighting matrix that is optimally used in 2-step GMM estimation,
which can be programmed manually or automatically in STATA (Baum, Scha¤er and Stillman
2007).
    There are two other GMM estimators available from STATA. The …rst is limited information
maximum likelihood (LIML). In that case, the variance of the true errors uiF     iF
                                                                          gt = Ygt
                                                                                                                iF
                                                                                                            1g X1gt

  18
     Under conventional TSLS, we would estimate 1g and 2g ; and then solve a quadratic equation to obtain g
and 1g : One reason to prefer the manual approach is that we can instead use nonlinear least squares (NLS) to
obtain g and 1g directly. The manual approach using NLS will be useful when estimating several equations with
cross-equation restrictions, as done later.
  19
     Feenstra (1994) treats those variances as constant over time. See Feenstra (2010, appendix to Chapter 2) for the
derivation of this result.
  20
     Rigobon (2003) gives many examples of identi…cation through heterscedasticity in …nance and other …elds.

 2g X2gt is computed over all exporting countries i and time periods. Denoting that variance by
 2F ; LIML is equivalent to manually weighting the estimating equation(28) by T i = 2F and min-
 gu                                                                             g   gu
imizing the sum of squared residuals over countries. This estimation is nonlinear because 2F gu
itself depends on the parameters      1g   and   2g :   It can be interpreted as maximum likelihood only
if the true errors are normally distributed and homoskedastic across countries (which we have al-
ready ruled out for identi…cation). Another estimator, introduced by Hansen, Heaton and Yaron
(1996), is the "continously-updated estimator" (CUE). In that estimator, the standard deviation
of the true errors u2iF
                    gt is computed over time for each exporting country i, therefore allowing for
heteroscedasticity. Denoting that variance by           2iF ;   CUE is equivalent to manually weighting the

                                    gu    and minimizing the sum of squared residuals over countries.
This estimation is again nonlinear because       2iF    depends on the parameters             and
                                                 gu                                      1g         2g ;   and as we
shall …nd, has more di¢ culty converging than LIML.

     Estimating the Micro Elasticities in Simulated and U.S. Data
     The estimation of (25) can sometimes lead to values for ^ g less than unity. Broda and Weinstein
(2006) implemented a grid search procedure to avoid that outcome. We do not implement that
procedure here, because we are interested in comparing the estimates of the micro and macro
elasticities without constraining either estimate. Instead, we allow the estimates of ^ g to be less
than unity. We isolated a small number of goods in our dataset, however, where the estimates of ^ g
are most frequently negative, i.e. in more than 75% of the bootstrap estimates, so that we conclude
that these data are faulty or incompatible with our model. There are 6 such goods out of the 109
used in the OLS estimates, and another 5 goods had imaginary point estimates ^ g when solving
the quadratic equation arising from (26), so in the GMM estimation we work with the remaining
98 goods.
     In all estimators, we include a constant term in (25). Feenstra (1994) argued that this term
can control for classical measurement error – that is, error uncorrelated with other variables – in
                                                                                    iF
the unit values. That result can be seen from the dependent variable Y g in (28), which is the
second moment of the unit values and will therefore equal the second moment of prices plus the
second moment of measurement error in the unit values, plus twice their cross-moment. If the
cross-moment has expected value of zero and the variance of measurement error is constant across
countries, then that variance appears as a constant term in (28), which we wish to capture.
     In the simulated dataset with a true value of               = 3; applying the above TSLS and GMM
procedures to equation (25) gives the median results shown in Table 2 using 1,000 simulations. We
…nd that both TSLS and 2-step GMM result in estimates of the micro elasticity that are about
10    15% above the true value of     = 3: That bias is surprisingly persistent as the number of time
periods T in the simulation is increased 10 to 50 to 100. (Recall that the number of years for each
product in our …rst-di¤erenced U.S. data is at most 15, but often much less.) We can compare
these results to Soderbery (2010), who performs a Monte Carlo analysis on the estimation of the
micro elasticity, where the data generating process uses CES demand and a partial equilibrium
supply curve. In the presence of measurement error in prices, he …nds that the upward bias fall

from about 10     15% with T = 10; like we have found, to about 5% with T = 50 or 100: While we
do not see this fall in bias from T = 10 to 50; both his results and ours have a quite persistent bias
from T = 50 to 100:
   The median estimates from 1,000 simulations using LIML and CUE are shown in the …nal two
columns of Table 2. We …nd that both estimates are downward biased by roughly 20%. Once again,
we …nd no evidence that this bias is reduced when longer time periods are used in the simulation.
In contrast, Soderbury (2010) does not …nd a downward bias when using LIML in his Monte Carlo
analysis (he did not estimate with CUE). But he does …nd a large downward di¤erence –often of
50% or more – from using LIML as compared to the TSLS estimates for the …ve U.S. imported
products that he analyzes. Likewise, we shall …nd that the LIML and CUE estimates in our U.S.
data –reported below –tend to be lower that the TSLS and 2-step GMM estimates. So we believe
that the downward bias of LIML and CUE reported in Table 2 are consistent with the results from
our U.S. data and those of Soderbery.
   Turning to the U.S. data, the kernel density of the TSLS estimates for        g   over the 98 goods
is graphed in Figure 3. The median estimate is 3:24 from the TSLS estimates, as reported at the
bottom of Table 2. That median is close to the median estimate of 3:1 from Broda and Weinstein
(2006), computed over some 10,000 HS categories of imports, so our much more limited sample of
98 goods is similar in this respect. Comparing the density of estimates in Figure 3 and Figure 1
makes it clear that the OLS estimates for    g   are strongly downward biased. To obtain con…dence
intervals on the GMM estimates we perform the same bootstrap used on the OLS estimates. That
is, we randomly re-draw observations each year and re-estimate (25). The lower and upper 95%


                                                   21
con…dence bounds are also graphed in Figure 3, and the median of the con…dence intervals across
goods for TSLS is (1.34, 20.75), as reported in Table 2.
       Turning to other results from the U.S. data, the median 2-step GMM estimate is 4:12, which is
somewhat higher than the median TSLS estimate. That higher estimate from 2-step GMM is not
found consistently in our simulated data, but occurs for 62% of our U.S. products and is persistent
in this sense. On the other hand, both the median LIML and CUE estimates reported at the
bottom of Table 2 are lower than found for TSLS. These medians are taken over slightly di¤erent
sets of goods because LIML and especially CUE fail to converge in some cases.21 If we focus on the
85 goods where convergence is always achieved, then in 66 of these cases the LIML estimate is less
than TSLS, and in 49 cases the CUE estimate is less than TSLS. We conclude that there is a quite
persistent downward bias in the LIML and CUE estimates, as we also found using our simulated
data. Understanding the source of this downward bias in LIML and CUE when estimating the
micro Armington elasticity is a topic for further research.22 For the remainder of the paper we
shall focus on TSLS and 2-step GMM as the preferred estimation methods, in part due to the
persistent downward bias in LIML and CUE, and also because the equations will become nonlinear
in the coe¢ cients below when we use multiple moment conditions in our estimation.



4.2      Step 2: The Macro Elasticity
To estimate the macro elasticities, we now consider the complete demand equation (17), which we
re-write slightly so that the unit values appear on the left and the import values on the right:
                                  !                                                        !
                        U Vgtij           ln(Vgtij =Vgtjj )    (! g   1)        U VgtF j               "ij
                                                                                                        gt
                  ln                  =                                    ln                  +                  :
                       U VgtF j           ( g 1)               ( g    1)        U Vgtjj            (   g     1)

This speci…cation unpacks (20), as it now shows the multilateral unit value U VgtF j relative to the
home unit value, U Vgtjj ; on the right. But, similar to our discussion of (20), the error term on the
right includes shocks to the relative demand for imports due to changes in tastes or variety. If
there were no response at all in relative demand Vgtij =Vgtjj , then the relative import unit value on
the left-hand side would rise by the full amount of the term involving U VgtF j =U Vgtjj . In addition, we
once again expect that Vgtij =Vgtjj will increase with a positive shock to "ij
                                                                            g , thereby dampening the
response of the relative import unit value. The amount of dampening could very well depend on
the source of the shock, however. Accordingly, we will suppose that the relative import unit values
are related to the demand shocks by the reduced-form equation,
  21
     Of the 103 potential goods TSLS provides real estimates in 100 cases, 2-step GMM 99, LIML 85 and CUE 100.
There are 12 cases where LIML converges and CUE does not. Going forward we focus only on the 98 goods for which
both TSLS and 2-step GMM both provide real estimates.
  22
     LIML and CUE both have the desirable property that the estimates are independent of the normalization of
the estimating equation, i.e. which variable in (28) is used on the left-hand side. It is surprising that a persistent
downward bias is found despite this desirable property.

    We regard (29) as the natural extension of the reduced-form supply curve (21), one that now
incorporates the relative multilateral unit value U VgtF j =U Vgtjj , appearing on the right. We expect
that     1g ; 2g   > 0 represent the possibly dampened impact of the demand shock "ij
                                                                                   gt =(                                                               g   1) and a
shock to the relative multilateral unit value, respectively. We shall give a more formal justi…cation
for this reduced-form supply equation in the next sub-section. As before, we assume that error
         ij
term     gt   in this supply equation is uncorrelated with the error term in demand for each source
country:
                                      P
    Assumption 2: E                          "ij

                                                   gt     = 0 for i = 1; : : : ; J, i 6= j.
                                         t

    Whereas Assumption 1 referred to the correlation of errors in a supply and demand system that
di¤erences out home demand, Assumption 2 now refers to the correlation of errors in a system that
retains home demand and its unit value. It again give us J                                               1 moment conditions that can be used
to estimate the model parameters, which now are                                        g;   !g ;   1g    and       2g .   We now argue, however, that
the macro demand and supply elasticities, ! g and                                           2g ,   cannot be identi…ed separately for every
good.

on the micro demand elasticity                      g     and supply elasticity                      1g ;   as well as the macro demand elasticity
! g and supply elasticity               2g :
       As in the earlier estimation of (25), we can use source-country indicator variables as IV, in
which case the dependent variables are averaged over time. A di¢ culty, however, is that the macro
elasticity ! g appears in (30) on variables that have little variation over the source countries i: This is

most obvious for X5gt ; which after running on the IV becomes the second moment of (U VgtF j =U Vgtjj )
                                                                                              ij
and does not di¤er over the source countries at all. But this di¢ culty is also evident from X3gt and
 ij
X4gt , which become cross-moments between a relative unit-value or value that does di¤er across i
and the relative unit-value (U VgtF j =U Vgtjj ) that does not depend on i: After averaging over time and
                                                                 ij       ij
allowing Tgi ! 1, we would not expect the probability limits of X3gt and X4gt to have meaningful
variation across source countries i:
       To address this di¢ culty, we shall pool the observations in (30) over a set of goods g for which
we assume that the macro demand and supply elasticities are the same:


                                               ! g =! and                 2g      =    2       for g = 1; :::; G:                                                (32)

       When estimating (30), we shall rely on heteroscedasticity across goods rather than across coun-
                                      ij       ij
tries to identify the coe¢ cients of X3gt and X4gt , from which we obtain the macro elasticity. The
IV used are indicator variables across source countries i interacted with indicator variables across
goods g within broad sectors. For convenience, we shall estimate (30) in a sequential method by
substituting the estimated values of the micro elasticities bg and the supply elasticities b1g obtained
from the import data into (30), and then estimating this equation using nonlinear TSLS to obtain
the macro demand ! and supply                             2    elasticities.23
       Because of the nonlinear structure of the coe¢ cients in (30), in practice we perform IV estima-
tion manually by averaging (30) over time for each source country and good. As in our discussion
of the micro elasticities, the averaged-over-time equation appears Tgi times for each source country
and good. Therefore, we weight the averaged-over-time equation by Tgi and then apply NLS to
estimate the the macro demand ! and supply                                            2    elasticities. These are referred to as the TSLS
estimates. Given these initial estimates, we can construct more e¢ cient estimates by weighting
  23
    Alternatively, we can estimate (25) and (30) simultaneously to obtain the micro and macro elasticities. It turns
out that our estimates in simulated data – with a single micro elasticity and a single macro elasticity ! – do not
di¤er much whether we adopt a sequential or a simultaneous strategy. But for U.S. data we allow for di¤ering g
across goods as well as di¤ering 1g , and in that case the simultaneous estimation of g ; 1g and ! is computationally
di¢ cult; the sequential procedure is therefore preferred.

to obtain the 2-step GMM estimates. In both cases, we include a constant in (30) to control for
measurement error in the relative unit-value within YgtiF .
       Estimating the Macro Elasticities in Simulated and U.S. Data
       We begin by reporting results from simulated data in Table 3. We show median estimates of the
macro elasticity from 1,000 simulations of our model, together with the 95% con…dence intervals
obtained by bootstrapping the data for that median estimate. Column (1) presents the median
TSLS estimate of the macro elasticity !
                                      ^ from (30), in step 2, that rely on the micro elasticity
estimates ^ g from (25), in step 1. The true value of the macro elasticity ! is 2, and in comparison,
we …nd that the median TSLS estimates in column (1) are biased downwards by 12 31%; depending
on the sample size.
       A small sample bias is a common feature of GMM estimates described by Cameron and Trivedi
(2005, p.177).24 The median estimate moves closer to the true value of ! as our time period
increases from 10 to 50 to 100, however, and the con…dence interval in the large sample includes
the true value of 2. So in contrast to the OLS estimates in Table 1, we …nd that the TSLS bias
  24
    Cameron and Trivedi (2005) describe this problem in the context of results from Altonji and Segal (1996), adding
that “in the literature their results are interpreted as being relevant to GMM estimation with cross-section data or
short panels,” which is the case for our U.S. data where T is no greater than 15.

Notes: Same as Table 3, except that the Table 3 assumed value of ! = 2 does not apply in this

from the nested CES equation is in large part a small sample issue. Similar results hold for the
2-step GMM estimates reported in column (2), which again move closer to the true value of 2 as
the sample size increases. Still, even with T = 100 the median estimate of 1.76 or 1.73 in columns
(1) and (2), respectively, is still quite far from the true value of ! = 2:
    Turning to the U.S. data, We divide the 98 goods in our dataset into eight sectors with the
number of goods in each sector as shown in Table 4.25 In column (1) we report TSLS estimates of
the macro elasticity, and in column (2) we report 2-step GMM estimates. For each sector there is
a single estimate of !, since we have constrained this macro elasticity to be the same for all goods
within a sector. The TSLS and 2-step GMM estimators give similar results except for the chemical
manufacturing and electronics sectors, for which TSLS results in negative estimates of ! whereas
2-step GMM gives positive estimates. For either estimator, the con…dence intervals obtained by
  25
     We chose the sectors so that they would have no fewer then 5 or more than 25 goods, and so that reasonable
additions or substractions to the goods included in each did not strongly a¤ect the estimated macro elasticity.


                                                      26
bootstrapping the micro and macro estimates from (25) and (30) are quite large: the value ! = 1
is within the con…dence intervals for all sectors, and the 2-step GMM point estimates are not that
far from unity in most sectors. So if we were to view these results as reliable, we would not be able
to reject the hypothesis that the macro Armington elasticity equals unity.26
    We believe such a conclusion is premature, however, in view of the small-sample bias shown in
columns (1) and (2) of Table 3 using simulated data. The U.S. data have at most T = 15 annual
observations in …rst di¤erences, so we could expect that our TSLS and 2-step GMM estimates using
the U.S. data are subject to the same small sample bias as we see in the simulated data. We have
no way of increasing the time span to o¤set this bias because information from Current Industrial
Reports is not available in earlier years. So instead, we propose to o¤set the small-sample bias by
adding an additional moment condition which comes from the macro structure of our model, as
described in the next section.

4.3    Step 3: Aggregation over Countries
To reduce the bias in the macro elasticities, we consider a further moment condition obtained by
aggregating across countries. To achieve this, we start from (9), which gives country j’s spending
on imports of good g from country i. Summing over all trade partners i 6= j yields country j
spending on imports of good g from all foreign sources, denoted VgtF j :

so that the home-foreign Armington elasticity ! can be identi…ed from a multilaterally aggregated
equation for imports of good g.27 We refer to (34) as the “macro” import demand equation.

     Indeed, in earlier seminar presentations we made that conclusion based on estimates like those shown in columns
(1) and (2) of Table 4.

     This estimating equation is closely related to those that Reinert and Roland-Holst (1992), Blonigen and Wilson
(1999), and Gallaway, McDaniel, and Rivera (2003) use. They match Unites States consumption to import data as
we do, but at a higher aggregation level than in our data. At the same time, their estimation method aggregates
across di¤erent foreign suppliers to the United States.



                                                                      27
    Of course, when estimating this equation we use unit value rather than the true price indexes,
as shown in (13) (for i = j) and (16). It follows that the aggregate equation for estimation is:
                                                         !                                               !

    The properties of (35) are quite similar to those of the disaggregate equation (17), and we can
similarly adapt the technique of Feenstra (1994) to estimate the macro elasticity. We begin by
re-writing the demand equation (35) slightly as:
                                                  !                                                  !
                                        U VgF j                        1                   VgF j                  1
                               ln                      =                            ln                   +                 "Fg j
                                        U Vgjj                    (!       1)              Vgjj              (!       1)

Again, we expect that VgtF j =Vgtjj will increase with a positive shock to "Fg j , thereby dampening the
response of the relative import unit value. Accordingly, we take a linear projection across goods
and time of the relative unit-value on the error term to obtain:
                                                                       !
                                                         U VgtF j               F
                                                                                       "Fgtj             Fj

                                                         U Vgtjj                     (! 1)

for g = 1; :::; G; and t = 1; :::; Tg : The coe¢ cient                          F   denote the impact of the demand error "Fgtj on
the relative unit-value, and we expect that 0 <                            F    < 1, so that (37) is interpreted as a reduced-form
"macro" supply curve.
                                                             Fj
    By construction, the supply error                        gt   is uncorrelated with the demand error "Fgtj in (37) when
taken over all observations g = 1; :::; G; and t = 1; :::; Tg : We make the stronger assumption that
these errors are uncorrelated for each good:
                               P       Fj Fj
    Assumption 3: E                 t "gt gt          = 0 for g = 1; :::; G:

    Notice that the error term "ij                               iF    Fj
                                gt in equation (18) is equal to "gt + "gt , the sum of the micro and
macro errors de…ned in (19) and (36), respectively. It follows that the reduced-form supply relation
(21) can be re-written as:

   Like equation (29), the form of which we simply assumed, the preceding reduced-form supply
equation is an aternative representation of the supply equation (21) –a representation that allows
econometric identi…cation of ! g . The new equation above justi…es our use of (29) in the last sub-
section, and it does so by making use of the macro supply equation (37), which allows us to deduce
the cross-equation restrictions      2g     =   1g = F :     This additional structure is a potential advantage for
estimation purposes. Imposition of the restrictions                  2g   =     1g = F   is one way that the macro equation
adds information to our estimating system, and this extra information allows the parameter                                  2g   to
di¤er across goods.
   Why do equations (21) and (37) jointly lead to an equation isomorphic to (29)? For any good
g, equation (21) shows how a relative demand shock "iF
                                                    gt in favor of imports from i, and at the
expense of the aggregate of country-j imports of g, raises the relative (unit-value) price of those
two goods, U Vgtij =U VgtF j , along their relative supply curve. But equation (29), like our new equation
above for    ln U Vgtij =U VgtF j , shows how the same relative price is a¤ected by the di¤ erent shock
"ij
 gt governing relative demand between imports from country i and domestic goods. That shock
                                  Fj
adds to "iF
         gt the additional shock "gt a¤ecting the relative demand for aggregate imports of g
as compared to domestic goods; compare equation (18) with (19) and (26). Thus, to make our
alternative representation valid, we need to control for the extra additive shock component "Fgtj .
Equation (37) implies that we can do so by controlling for the relative price                              ln U VgtF j =U Vgtjj .
   We further note that Assumption 3 adds extra information to Assumption 2. To see this, recall
                                    P
that the demand shock "Fgtj equals i6=j wgt
                                          ij ij
                                            "gt ; and the reduced-form supply shock 2g !g 11 Fgtj
       P     ij ij
equals i6=j wgt gt ; which follows from (38). For 2g 6= 0 and ! 6= 1;we can re-write the expection
in Assumption 3 as:

                      0                                              1

                 0 = E@   wgt "gt wgt                             gt
                                 t   i6=j             k6=j
                         0                                    1    0                                       1
                          X X ij ij                        ij A
                                                                    X X X ij kj ij                       kj A
                      = E@   (wgt )2 "gt                   gt   +E @     wgt wgt "gt                     gt   :              (39)
                                 t   i6=j                                   t   i6=j k6=i;j


The …rst summation in (39) equals zero in its unweighted form from Assumption 2, and we could
expect it to be close to zero even in its weighted form. But the second summation involves the
(weighted) cross-correlation of the terms "ij
                                           gt and
                                                                  kj
                                                                  gt ,   which refer to di¤erent source countries i 6= k:
Assumption 3 imposes that the sum of these two complex summations equals zero. For that reason,
the moment condition for the macro import demand equation is adding information to what we
have used in Assumption 2 for the nested-CES demand equations. Accordingly, we will exploit

                                                               29
both moment conditions in the estimation.
    To make use of the macro demand and supply equations, we now proceed in the same manner
as with the estimating equation (25) for the micro elasticities. Multiply the errors in the macro
demand and supply equations, we can obtain:

of the micro elasticities and          1g   that come from           (25).28         As noted above in the estimation of the
nested CES equation, we can use indicator variables for source countries interacted with indicator
variables for goods as IV when estimating (30). Equivalently, we can perform the IV estimation
manually by averaging (30) over time for each source country and good and then using weighted
NLS to obtain the macro demand and supply elasticities. In this manual approach the averaged-
over-time equation is weighted by Tgi ; the number of years that each country and good appears.
Taking a similar approach to the macro equation (40), we …rst average this equation across goods
within each broad sector. It would not make any sense to have the macro equation (30) appearing
with a weight of unity, since in that case it would have little impact on the results. Instead, we
                                                                                 P
weight each good-observation within the averaged-over-time macro equation by i Tgi , so that it
essentially receives the same weight in total as the nested CES equations. We refer to this approach
as TSLS.
    Using these initial estimates of the macro elasticities, we compute the variance of the residuals
for each country and good in (30) and use Tgi divided by the inverse of these variances as weights
when re-estimating the averaged-over-time nested CES equation (30). Likewise, we average the
                                                                                P
variance of the residuals from the nested CES equation for each good, and divide i Tgi by the

     The estimates of the macro elasticity from (40) alone are available on request. Those estimates tend to be
downward biased in the simulated data and rather high in the U.S. data, but with large con…dence intervals that
often include zero. We interpret those estimates as lacking precision on their own, but improving the power of the
macro elasticity that comes from the nested CES equation (30) when the cross-equation restriction 2g = 1g = F is
also used.



                                                                    30
average of these variances to obtain the weight that is applied to each good-observation in the
averaged-over-time macro equation (40). Then estimating the nested CES and macro equations
simultaneously using             =          F,
                            2g       1g =        we obtain the 2-step GMM estimates.

      Estimating the Macro Elasticities Once Again
      Starting with the simulated data, the results from simultaneous estimation of the nested CES
equation (30) and the macro equation (40) are shown in columns (3) and (4) of Table 3. Once
again, we show median estimates of the macro elasticity from 1,000 simulations of our model,
together with the 95% con…dence intervals obtained by bootstrapping the data for that median
estimate. The estimation proceeds by …rst obtaining micro elasticity estimates ^ g from (25), or
step 1, and substituting these into (30) and (40), or steps 2 and 3 estimated as a system. For the
TSLS estimates in column (3), we see that the median point estimates of the macro elasticity all
move slightly closer to their true value of 2 as compared to the TSLS estimates in column (1), that
do not make use of the macro equation. Evidently, the extra moment condition obtained from the
macro side of the model is adding useful information to the estimation.
      The reduced bias that arises from using the macro moment condition shows through more
strongly when applying 2-step GMM, shown in column (4) of Table 3. For values of T = 100; the
median estimate of the macro elasticity is 1.93, only slightly lower than its true value of ! = 2: For
lower values of T the downard bias is more noticable, but it still an improvement over the 2-step
GMM estimates obtained by using the nested CES equation alone, in column (2). We conclude that
making use of the macro moment condition in conjunction with the nested CES moment condition
always gives less bias than using the nested CES moment condition alone.
      Turning to the U.S. data, our estimates of the macro elasticity obtained from simultaneous
estimation of the nested CES equation (30) and the macro equation (40) are shown in columns (3)
and (4) of Table 4. As we found in the simulations, the estimates of the macro elasticity are pulled
up by adding the macro moment condition: TSLS estimates in column (3) exceed those in column
(1), and the 2-step GMM estimates in column (4) generally exceed those in column (2). The point
estimates of the macro elasticity are signi…cantly less than unity in only one sector (Metals) and
are signi…cantly greater than unity in two other sectors (electronics, as well as primary metals for
the TSLS estimate). The …nding that the con…dence intervals are quite large–including the values
of unity and values of 2 or higher in most other cases –re‡ects the fact that we are bootstrapping
the standard errors using all three estimating equations, so there is a high degree of coe¢ cient
variation across bootstrapped samples. Still, a judicious interpretation of the results is that the
macro elasticity is often found to be greater than unity when the estimation uses all three moment
conditions.
      To investigate the size of the macro elasticity more formally, in Table 5 we report the results of
tests for the null hypothesis that           g     !. To perform these one-sided tests we use the bootstrapped
data from the three estimating equations: (25), (30) and (40).29 Each bootstrap results in estimates
of the micro elasticity ^ g for each of the goods in a sector and the single macro elasticity !
                                                                                              ^ for

      The use of boostrapping to test hypotheses is discussed in MacKinnon (2006).

that sector. We then count the proportion of 500 bootstrap samples (as we use) where ^ g                      !
                                                                                                              ^ is
found for each good. With a 5% signi…cance level, if there are fewer than 25 bootstrap samples
where ^ g      !
               ^ then we reject the null hypothesis that         g    !. From this result we conclude that
the macro elasticity ! is signi…cantly less than the micro elasticity           g.
       Within Table 5 we report three sets of hypothesis tests. The …rst test, in columns (1)-(3), uses
the TSLS estimates of both the micro and macro elasticities. We found earlier in Table 2 that
the 2-step GMM estimate of the micro elasticity are noticeably higher than the TSLS estimates,
and that both elasticities are upward biased in the simulations. In contrast, the median macro
elasticities reported in Table 3 are always downward biased in the simulations. So we might be
concerned that these biases will make it more likely that !
                                                          ^ < ^ g in the bootstrap samples. That
concern is particularly valid when using the 2-step GMM estimates of the micro elasticity, which
had the greatest upward bias in Table 2. So we also consider a second version of the hypothesis
test in columns (4)-(6) where we substitute the TSLS estimates of the micro elasticity into (30)
and (40) to obtain new 2-step GMM estimates of the macro elasticity. The third version of the
hypothesis test, in columns (7)-(9), uses the 2-step GMM estimates for both elasticities.
       Looking …rst at the hypothesis test using TSLS estimates, in column (1) we repeat the sectoral
estimates of the macro elasticities !
                                    ^ from Table 4. In column (2) we show how many goods in each
sector have estimates of the macro elasticity !
                                              ^ less than that of the micro elasticities ^ g . Out of
98 goods, fully 73 of then have !
                                ^ < ^ g in the point estimates. Then in column (3) we report the
number of goods for which we reject the null hypothesis that ^ g            !
                                                                            ^ , meaning that ! is signi…cantly
less than     g:   Looking at the total reported in the …nal row of column (3), there are only 22 out of
the 73 goods where the lower point estimate of the macro elasticity means that it is signi…cantly
below the micro elasticity. In other words, less than one-quarter of the total number of goods lead
to a signi…cant di¤erence in the elasticities. This inability to statistically distinguish the elasticities
re‡ects somewhat large standard errors in the TSLS estimates, and we obtain sharper results using
2-step GMM estimates.
       The increased precision of 2-step GMM is reinforced by the second set of tests we report, in
columns (4)-(6), where now we mix the TSLS estimates of the micro elasticity with new 2-step
GMM estimates of the macro elasticity from (30) and (40). The number of goods for which !
                                                                                        ^ < ^g
in the point estimates falls to 68 (see column 5), but the number where ! is signi…cantly less than
 g   increases to 29 (see column 6). In column (7) we again repeat the sectoral macro elasticities !
                                                                                                   ^
from Table 4. In column (8) we show how many goods in each sector have estimates of the macro
elasticity !
           ^ less than that of the micro elasticities ^ g , obtaining 73 goods, the same as the count
with TSLS estimates. But now when we test the null hypothesis that ^ g                  !
                                                                                        ^ , we are able to reject
it for 50 of the goods. In other words, for one-half of the total number of goods, we …nd that the
macro elasticity is signi…cantly below the micro elasticity.30
  30
    In lieu of reliable estimates of both the macro and micro elasticities some researchers have employed an ad hoc
assumption known as the "Rule of Two," which states that the macro elasticity should be roughly one half the micro
elasticity (see Hillberry and Hummels 2013 for a discussion). We test how well the "Rule of Two" …ts our data
using the bootstrap methodology described previously, testing the null hypothesis g = 2! for each of our 98 goods.

    While our results are somewhat sensitive to using the TSLS versus 2-step GMM estimates, if
we focus on the latter estimates then we conclude that for between one-quarter and one-half of the
goods the macro elasticity is signi…cantly less that the micro elasticities, but not as low as the value
of unity sometimes found using macro time-series methods. In the remaining one-half (or more) of
the goods there is no signi…cant di¤erence between the macro and micro elasticities.


5     Aggregation over Goods
Earlier sections have developed a model of international trade ‡ows and estimated the implied
import demand equations using United States data at a highly disaggregated level. Much previous
literature focuses on estimation of aggregate import demand equations, in an attempt to ascertain
directly the average relationship between aggregate measures of international competitiveness and
aggregate national imports. Furthermore, many studies, while using data that are disaggregated
to some degree, still combine potentially disparate goods into composite categories. In this section,
we explore the performance of aggregate import demand equations within our framework in order
to clarify the conditions under which estimates derived from aggregate data will be accurate.
    At …rst glance, aggregation over goods would seem to be impossible with the nested CES
functions speci…ed in (1)-(2), because it is not possible to de…ne CES aggregates of “total import
goods”and “total domestic goods”that cut across these nests. But it turns out that, surprisingly,
an aggregate of imports and domestic goods can be consistently achieved using the concept of latent
separability (Blundell and Robin 2000).
    For convenience we now drop the time subscript t, which is no longer needed. We start from the
(33), which gives import demand aggregated across source countries. The next step is to sum these
imports across all available goods g. Observe that the parameter                                g    — the possibly good-speci…c
substitution elasticity between varieties of g purchased from the same source (domestic or foreign)
— enters the preceding equations only through its role in constructing the price indexes. Given
those indexes, the parameter         g   does not appear in the aggregate demand for imports of good g.
While we will not assume that              g   is the same across goods, we will make the assumption that
! g = ! is invariant across di¤erent goods.
    From (33), total country j expenditure on imports is:

When estimating both g and ! with 2-step GMM we can only reject the “Rule of Two” for 31 of our 98 goods.
Additionally, of the 50 goods for which we reject g < ! (reported in column 9 of Table 5), we also fail to reject the
“Rule of Two” for 36.

For the case ! = , consumers substitute between domestic and foreign varieties just as readily as
between di¤erent goods. In that case, therefore, the utility function can be written as a weakly
separable function of import consumption and domestic-product consumption, and P F j is simply
a standard CES price-index of the good-speci…c foreign price indexes PgF j :

on PgF j in the overall index P F j depends on the variation in country j’s comprehensive price index

assumption, the aggregate import share is simply a function of the latter index and the overall CPI.

subject to P H D + P F M = P C, where D stands for aggregate real domestic consumption and
M stands for aggregate real imports.31 In this sense, the model of import demand admits exact
aggregation across goods, with ! as the substitution elasticity between aggregate imports and
domestic consumption. Because P H and P F both depend on all prices, however, the aggregation
is less straightforward than it would be in the case of weakly separable utility (! = ). Instead,
aggregation is possible because of the property of latent separability analyzed by Blundell and Robin
(2000). Whereas weak separability requires that the utility or expenditure function is partitioned
into mutually exclusive sets of goods, the more general concept of latent separability allows the set
of goods to be overlapping: some goods can appear in many of the sub-groups.32


6        Impact of a Devaluation
Imbs and Méjean (2013) argue that there are grounds for “elasticity optimism” regarding the re-
sponsiveness of imports to a change in the terms of trade. To make this argument, they contrast
two approaches to the estimation of                      g:      …rst, estimating this elasticity separately for 56 sectors
using a modi…cation of the GMM method in Feenstra (1994); and second, pooling the data across
all sectors and estimating a single elasticity. They show that if the sectoral estimates are weighted
by their shares in expenditure and summed, a theoretically consistent aggregate elasticity results.33
That aggregate elasticity of substitution is found to be signi…cantly larger than the single estimate
obtained by pooling the data. Therefore, they conclude, a pooled estimate that ignores heterogene-
ity across sectors is downward biased and gives too pessimistic a view of the impact of a devaluation
on the value of imports.
    31
     This formulation is the starting point for many empirical studies, for example, Reinert and Roland-Holst (1992),
Blonigen and Wilson (1999), Gallaway, McDaniel, and Rivera (2003), and Broda and Weinstein (2006). Our analysis
shows the exact form of the price indexes under which their approach would be valid.
  32
     To see how this concept applies in our case, consider the aggregate P F j de…ned in (42). It is a summation over
the import price indexes PgF j , which depend on the import prices of good g from all source countries. But in addition,
                            !
                 j    Pgj
the “weights”    g    Pj
                                 appear in the formula. When ! 6=                 these weights depend on the prices for all imported
and domestic goods.
  33
     More general versions of this formula were derived and discussed by Barker (1970) and Magee (1975).


                                                                          36
       We have repeated the exercise of Imbs and Méjean on our own data by pooling across the
industries and estimating a single value for                . Estimating equation (25) with TSLS, we obtain
^ = 2:67, while using 2-step GMM, we obtain ^ = 4:98. The …rst of these is 18% below the median
TSLS estimate across all goods, 3:24, whereas the second is 21% above the median 2-step GMM
estimate across all goods, 4:12. So in contrast to Imbs and Méjean, we do not …nd that pooling
across goods in our sample necessarily gives a substantial downward bias to the estimate of .34
       However, the more important message of our paper is that the aggregate elasticity they compute
by taking a weighted average of the sectoral estimates does not indicate the impact of a devaluation
on aggregate imports. The reason for this is that the data Imbs and Méjean (2013) use in their
estimation is for imports only, without any matching domestic production data. Therefore, they
are estimating the micro Armington elasticity. But in order to understand the impact of exchange
rate changes on imports, as shown in (43), we need to use the macro Armington elasticity, about
which they have no information. Therefore, their results cannot be interpreted as supporting either
“elasticity optimism” or “elasticity pessimism,” at least in regard to the impact of a devaluation
on imports.35
       When the macro Armington elasticity ! g di¤ers across goods g, then the impact of a devaluation
cannot be obtained from the simple aggregate demand equation (43). Rather, we should instead
compute the total derivatives of imports while adding up across sectors. This yields a weighted
average formula that is broadly similar to that found in Imbs and Méjean (2013), but now using
the macro Armington elasticities ! g rather than the micro elasticities                          g.   For simplicity, we omit
the home country j superscript in this calculation, as well as the time subscript t.
       Total imports of the home country are given by

                      G             G                 G
                                                            "                           !   !g                #
                      X             X                 X                           PgF                 Pg
               VF =         VgF =         PgF CgF =             PgF   g (1   g)                             C :
                                                                                  Pg                  P
                      g=1           g=1               g=1


Assume that PgF = EPgF ; with PgF …xed, implying full immediate pass-through from the exchange
rate E to import prices. Assume also that domestic producers’prices do not respond to changes
in E. For a given level of consumption C; the aggregate import demand elasticity with respect to
  34
     Pooling across goods appears to result in a downward bias in the estimation of !. Estimating ! using only eq.
(30) and constraining ! to be constant across goods yield estimates of 0.62 and 0.67 for TSLS and 2-step GMM
respectively. Estimating ! using eq. (30) and eq. (40) yields 0.04 and 2.61 for TSLS and 2-step GMM respectively.
Comparing these constrained estimates to the unconstrained estimates reported in Table (4) we see that 75% of the
time the unconstrained ! is greater than the constrained !.
  35
     As we note in the concluding section, the impact of a devluation on exports will depend on both the "micro" and
"macro" elasticities found in foreign countries. So Imbs and Méjean (2013) are providing some optimism regarding
the elasticity of exports with respect to terms of trade.

                                         X                             G
                                                                       X
                          d ln V F
                                   =1          (1    mg )wgF ! g             wgF (mg         m) ;              (45)
                           d ln E
                                         g=1                           g=1


where wgF       VgF =V F is the share of good g in total imports, mg                 VgF =Vg is the import share of
good g, and m        V F =V is the share of imports (of all goods) in total consumption spending.
    The intuition for (45) is as follows. The …rst term of unity is the valuation e¤ect on import
spending, which the other e¤ects must o¤set for a devaluation to reduce the value of imports. The
                                                                              !g
second term re‡ects the impact of the rise in E on PgF =Pg                          : this negative e¤ect is smaller
when a bigger share of good g is imported, because the percent rise in Pg will then be closer to that
in PgF . The third and last term re‡ects the impact on (Pg =P )                    : the negative in‡uence of lower
demand for good g is larger when good g has a higher than average import share (Pg will then rise
relative to P ). An alternative way to group the preceding terms would be as

                                               G
                                               X
                              d ln V F
                                       =1            wgF [! g     mg (! g      )] + m :
                               d ln E
                                               g=1


Given estimates of        and data on import shares, it is straightforward to calculate the preceding
devaluation elasticity. We see from this formula that if goods with higher macro Armington elastic-
ities –or more precisely a higher value of [! g          mg (! g       )] –also have a higher share of imports
wgF ,   then they will contribute more towards obtaining a negative value for this devaluation elastic-
ity. In this respect we agree with Imbs and Méjean (2013); but contrary to them, the Armington
elasticities appearing in the formula are the macro and not the micro elasticities, which in general
seem likely to be relatively smaller in general.




7       Conclusions

In this paper, we distinguish between the substitution elasticity among alternative foreign import
sources and the substitution elasticity between domestic and foreign import sources. These two

                                                         38
elasticities are conceptually quite distinct, except within the two-country models that predominate
in macroeconomic discussion. They are in some cases empirically quite distinct, as we demonstrate
using a new data set of highly disaggregated and concorded domestic production and import data
for the United States. We …nd evidence in our data that the former elasticity – which we call
the “micro” Armington elasticity – is larger than the latter elasticity – the “macro” Armington
elasticity. Our median estimates of the micro elasticity across individual industries are 3.24 and
4.12 for TSLS and 2-step GMM respectively, whereas the macro elasticities are signi…cantly lower in
up to one-half of the goods we analyze, as in the approach to calibration in traditional CGE policy
analysis. The fact that the micro and macro elasticities are not signi…cantly di¤erent from each
other in the other half of cases o¤ers some limited support for the newer generation of computable
structural models, which do not allow for any di¤erence between them.
       Our results also have important implications for quantitative welfare assessments of trade policy.
In their comprehensive recent survey, Costinot and Rodríguez-Clare (2013) argue within a simple
gravity model that the "trade elasticity" " relevant for welfare analysis is !, the elasticity of
substitution between foreign and domestic goods. However, they note that the formula for " is
more complicated in other models, including ours. In our model, if                is equal to !; then the trade
elasticity " is simply the Pareto shape parameter            > , as in the Melitz-Chaney model. (There is
a corresponding result for the Fréchet parameter             in the Ricardian model of Eaton and Kortum
2002.) However, if       6= !, as we found in many cases, then the trade elasticity " is a function of             ,
!; and , and is increasing in !. Moreover, one can show that " <                 if ! < : Since our results are
often consistent with ! <        and trade gains are inversely proportional to ", our results also imply
quantitatively bigger trade gains than one might have surmised based on the typical parameter
assumption that        = !.36
       Regardless of whether the macro elasticity emerges as lower than its micro counterpart, we …nd
point estimates for the macro elasticity that exceed unity in almost all sectors. Values around unity
are common in the various studies of substitution between domestic and imported goods carried out
over decades by researchers who generally applied OLS to datasets more highly aggregated than
ours. In contrast to these earlier works, ours is the …rst to estimate the micro and macro elasticities
simultaneously at a disaggregate level for a number of products. Our econometric methodology,
based on Feenstra (1994), corrects for potential biases in OLS estimation, including the errors
introduced by reliance on unit-value price indexes rather than the exact indexes implied by theory.
Like the earlier studies, we also …nd macro elasticity values near unity in U.S. and simulated
data, until we add an additional moment condition to overcome small-sample bias. We frame the
emprical analysis within a theoretical general-equilibrium trade model, based on Melitz (2003) and
Chaney (2008), as a guide to both econometric speci…cation and simulation analysis of alternative
  36
    In our model the elasticity of trade (elasticity of the aggregate import/domestic consumption ratio with respect
to relative trade costs for imports) is:
                                                            (! 1)
                                            "=
                                                     1+       1
                                                                  1 (    !)
We are grateful to Andrés Rodríguez-Clare for supplying this calculation.

estimation approaches.
       Our empirical …ndings raise the question of why substitution between home goods and imports
are often lower than substitution between di¤erent foreign supply sources. Blonigen and Wilson
(1999) documented several factors in‡uencing the size of macro Armington elasticities across sectors,
but to our knowledge there has been no corresponding study comparing macro to micro elasticities.
One theoretical answer might come from the theory of discrete choice under uncertainty. Anderson,
de Palma, and Thisse (1992), shows that a CES indirect utility function for the aggregate consumer
can be derived from certain discrete choice models with random utility. In that framework, a
relatively smaller elasticity for the macro Armington elasticity is obtained if the variance of the
random utility component between home and foreign goods in general is greater than the variance
of the random utility component between two foreign varieties.37
       Alternatively, low existing estimates of the macro elasticity may very well be due to di¤erences
between short-run and long-run elasticities. Gallaway, McDaniel, and Rivera (2003) have recently
estimated short-run U.S. macro elasticities on monthly data that average 0.95, but long-run elas-
ticities that are twice as large on average and in some cases up to …ve times larger. Our estimation
is performed on annual data, so the elasticity estimates are not exactly short-run; but because we
do not introduce lags in the adjustment of demand, we might view our estimates as applying to
the “medium run.”Introducing such an adjustment process in the theory and the estimation is an
important avenue for future work.38
       We close by emphasizing that while the macro Armington elasticity, which we have labeled !, is
the prime determinant of the aggregate import response to a terms of trade change, the overall trade
balance sensitivity may depend powerfully on the micro elasticity governing substitution between
alternative foreign suppliers. Once one moves beyond the unrealistic assumption of a two-country
world, it is evident that the export response to a terms of trade change depends not only on !, but
also on the foreign-foreign substitution elasticities that we labeled           above.
       As an example, suppose that the Korean won depreciates against all trading-partner currencies.
Three things will happen. First, Korean residents will switch consumption from imports to domestic
import-competing …rms with elasticity !. Second, consumers and …rms outside Korea will switch
from domestic goods competing with Korean exports to Korean exports with elasticity !. But third,
consumers and …rms outside Korea will switch their demand from Korea’s export competitors to
Korea with elasticity      . (For example, United States residents will import more ships and steel
from Korea, less from China.) Thus, the overall e¤ect of currency depreciation on Korea’s net
exports depends on both          and !. Because         could be quite a bit larger than !, there may be
grounds for some degree of “elasticity optimism” after all.

  38
    Ruhl (2008) and Kehoe and Ruhl (2009) argue that due to supply-side responses, the expected permanence of
a tari¤ cut gives it a much greater impact on trade ‡ows than an equivalent temporary change in exchange rates.
Theirs is one mechanism generating di¤erences in the elasticity of trade with respect to temporary versus permanent
price relative changes.

A     Equilibrium of the Model
This appendix shows how to solve for the model’s general equilibrium. To review the model: There
are J countries and G tradable goods. The elasticity of substitution between any two goods g and
g 0 is , a constant. Each country j can produce multiple varieties of every good g. The constant
elasticity of substitution between any two varieties of the same tradable good g is                                                                  g   – regardless
of the foreign country i 6= j producing the variety of good g. However, the elasticity of substitution
between the domestic basket of good g varieties, Cgjj , and the composite foreign basket, CgF j is ! g ;
see equation (2).
    Recall that Ngij is the measure of varieties of good g that country i produces for export to
country j: The extensive margin is limited by …xed costs and a zero-pro…t condition, such that
                                                            ^ ij
the …rm-speci…c productivity of the marginal exporting …rm, ' g , entails zero pro…ts, as shown by

    Without assuming that       i   =       i   or              =         for all goods g, we can compute the equilibrium as
                                g                     g
follows. Use equation (50) to eliminate              Ci         in equation (46); then use the GJ 2 resulting productivity
cuto¤ equations plus the J equations of (51), together with the price-level equations, to solve for
the (GJ + 1)                ^ ij
