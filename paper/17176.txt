                                              ABSTRACT

Researchers and policymakers often assume that teacher turnover harms student achievement, but
recent evidence calls into question this assumption. Using a unique identification strategy that employs
grade-level turnover and two classes of fixed-effects models, this study estimates the effects of teacher
turnover on over 600,000 New York City 4th and 5th grade student observations over 5 years. The
results indicate that students in grade-levels with higher turnover score lower in both ELA and math
and that this effect is particularly strong in schools with more low-performing and black students.
Moreover, the results suggest that there is a disruptive effect of turnover beyond changing the composition
in teacher quality.

                                          INTRODUCTION

        Teacher turnover rates are high, particularly in schools serving low-income, non-white and

low-achieving student populations. Nationally, about 30 percent of new teachers leave the

profession after five years, and the turnover rate is 50 percent higher in high-poverty schools as

compared to more affluent ones (Ingersoll, 2001). Teacher turnover rates also tend to be higher in

urban and lower-performing schools (Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin, 1999). As an example, in New

York City approximately 18 percent of teachers leave their school each year.

        Researchers and policy makers often assume that teacher turnover harms student learning.

There are many reasons to think it would, as institutional memory is lost and resources are spent on

the hiring process. Yet, there exists little empirical evidence for a direct effect of teacher turnover

on student achievement (Guin, 2004). Moreover, the organizational management literature has

demonstrated that some amount of turnover may in fact be beneficial to institutions and individuals.

Institutional turnover can, for example, result in better person-job matches and infusion of new

ideas into organizations (Abelson & Baysinger, 1984). These benefits of turnover can be enhanced

if it is the less effective employees who leave.

        A growing body of evidence indicates that teachers who produce higher student

achievement gains are at least as likely, and sometimes more likely, to stay in schools than their less

effective peers (Boyd et al, 2010; Goldhaber, D., Gross, B., and Player, D., 2007; Hanushek &

Rivkin, 2010). For example, Boyd et al. (2010) studied data on teachers’ applications for transfer to

uncover which teachers are more likely to want to transfer from NYC schools. They discovered that

teachers who produced higher achievement gains and those with more experience were less likely to


                                                                                                          1
apply for transfer.1 This reduced interest in moving held true even for teachers in the lowest-

performing schools. Similarly, Hanushek and Rivkin (2010) found that, in Texas, those who left a

given school tended to be less effective than those who stayed. Contrary to common assumptions,

the relative effectiveness of stayers as compared to leavers was actually highest in schools with more

low-achieving and black students. Because neither Boyd et al. (2010) nor Hanushek and Rivkin

(2010) directly tested whether the teachers who filled vacancies in a given school were more

effective on average than those they replaced, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the overall

impact of turnover. However, Hanushek and Rivkin did simulate the impact were only “rookie”

teachers to replace exiting ones, and found no overall effect of turnover on student achievement.

         The results of the Hanushek and Rivkin (2010) simulation are an important challenge to the

commonly held assumption that teacher turnover harms student achievement, especially that of low-

performing, poor, and minority students. However, their findings have important limitations, even

aside from being simulated, rather than observed, effects of new hires. Namely, the results assume

that the only lever by which teacher turnover harms or helps student achievement is by adjusting the

average effectiveness of individual teachers on the school’s faculty. Students are thought to benefit

when they get teachers who are more effective than the ones that left the school. But turnover may

impact student achievement beyond the relative effectiveness of those who stay as compared to

those who leave.

         When teachers leave schools, for example, previously held relationships and collaborations

are lost, and new ones form. Bryk & Schneider (2002) argue that the quality of relationships (trust)

between teachers, and between teachers and students, is related to student achievement. To the

degree that turnover disrupts the formation or maintenance of these relationships, it may also harm



1On the other hand, they found that teachers with better pre-service qualifications (LAST scores, competitiveness of
undergraduate institution) were more likely to apply for transfer.


                                                                                                                       2
student achievement. On the other hand, turnover may result in the infusion of new ideas into the

organization which might help raise student achievement.

        Although it is important to consider and study the separate mechanisms by which turnover

may impact student achievement – relational trust, infusion of new ideas, changes in average teacher

effectiveness - we still know very little about the overall effect of attrition on students. Guin (2004)

studied 66 elementary schools in a large urban district to look at relationships between school-level

turnover and the proportion of students meeting standards on statewide assessments in reading and

math. Pearson correlations were significant and negative, demonstrating that schools with higher

turnover also had lower achievement. However, the findings are clearly not causal as low

achievement may cause teachers to leave, teachers leaving may cause low achievement, or a third

factor (e.g. poverty, crime, or poor school leadership) may simultaneously cause both low

achievement and higher turnover.

        Using a unique identification strategy, and two classes of fixed-effects regression models, this

study presents the cleanest estimates to date of a direct effect of teacher turnover on student

achievement. Three research questions guide the investigation: What is the average effect of teacher

turnover on student achievement? Are the effects different for different kinds of schools? What

explains the relationship between teacher turnover and student achievement? The paper proceeds as

follows. We first describe the data and methodological approach. We then present the results and

conclude with a discussion of the implications of the findings.



                                                 DATA

        This study draws on extensive administrative data from the New York City Department of

Education and the New York State Education Department. Analyses focus on approximately

625,000 observations of 4th and 5th grade students across all New York City elementary schools over



                                                                                                           3
five academic years (2000-2002; 2004-2007).2 We were able to link student test scores in math and

ELA to student, class, school, and teacher characteristics.

         Table 1 describes student, teacher, and school-by-grade characteristics. About 70 percent of

students in 4th and 5th grades in NYC were either black or Hispanic. Over one-third of students had

a home language other than English, and 61 percent were on free or reduced priced lunch. The 4th

and 5th grade teachers in the district had, on average, six years of experience. Approximately 2

percent of students had been suspended in the previous year, while 9 percent had switched schools

since the prior year. Finally, students were absent for an average of approximately 11 days in the

previous year.

         On average, 82 percent of teachers each year had stayed in the same school from the prior

year (stayers). Approximately four percent of 4th and 5th grade teachers had transferred schools

(movers), while 12 percent were first year teachers. Each 4th and 5th grade within each NYC school

had, on average, six teachers, with a range from one to as many as 22 teachers. Figure A plots the

distribution of teachers per grade in the sample schools.

         Our identification strategy requires measuring school-by-grade level turnover in each year.

Such measurement is not entirely straightforward. To illustrate, imagine a 4th grade within School A

that had six teachers in year 0. Due to increasing enrollments, in year 1 there were seven 4th grade

teachers. Of these, five were stayers, one a mover, and one a first year teacher. Teacher turnover

could be estimated as the proportion of year 0 teachers that were no longer in the 4th grade in School

A in year 1 (1/6=16.7 percent). On the other hand, turnover could be measured as the proportion

of teachers that were new to the school-by-grade in year 1 -- either first year teachers or movers

(2/7=28.6 percent). The first measure -- “lagged attrition” -- defines turnover as the proportion of


2 Due to peculiarities in the NYC administrative data collected in 2002-2003, we were unable to identify the grade levels

of all teachers in NYC. Since our analyses depend upon grade-level information across the district, we focused our study
on the years we had data prior to and following the 2002-2003 academic year.


                                                                                                                        4
teachers in a given grade level in year t-1 who left the school by year t. The second measure --

“proportion new” -- defines turnover as the proportion of teachers in a given grade level who are

new (movers or first year teachers) to the school in year t. We used both measures in all analyses to

test whether results were robust across them; the distributions for lagged attrition can be seen in

Figure B and for proportion new in Figure C. The measures have similarly shaped distributions, bell

shaped with a right skew.

         The average teacher turnover rate in each grade in each school in each year was similar for

both of the measures we developed: 0.20 for the lagged attrition measure and 0.21 for the

proportion new measure. Thus, each year, approximately one out of every five 4th and 5th grade

teachers in NYC left or came to a given grade level in a given school. Lagged attrition could result

from teachers leaving the profession altogether or transferring to another school. This measure does

not include the transfer of teachers from one grade to another within the same school. We chose

not to include this behavior because, in such cases, the expertise of teachers would remain within the

same school.3 More than one-third of school-by-grades experienced no teacher turnover each year

(between 36 percent and 37 percent). On the other hand, between two and three percent of 4th and

5th grade level teams had turnover rates of 100 percent each year.4



                                                    METHODS

         As described above, our analyses are driven by three questions: What is the average effect of

teacher turnover on student achievement? Are the effects different for different kinds of schools?

And what explains the relationship between teacher turnover and student achievement?



3 We also ran models that included indicators for whether teachers switched grade levels. Results were similar suggesting

the grade-level switching does not account for the effects of grade-level turnover on student achievement.
4 We use many classroom and school-level characteristics as controls in the regression models described below.

Appendix Table 1 describes these variables used as school and classroom controls in analyses.


                                                                                                                        5
        What is the average effect of teacher turnover on student achievement? Typically teacher

turnover is measured at the school level. However, high turnover rates in the 6th grade may have

little impact on incoming 4th grade students, especially when the 4th grade level team stays intact. To

get a more precise estimate of the effects of turnover, this study examines turnover at the school-by-

grade-by-year level, rather than at the school or school-by-year level. Another benefit of examining

school-by-grade-by-year level turnover is that we can adjust for school-by-grade or school-by-year

level factors that could influence both student achievement and turnover. For example, if the

school’s principal leaves the transition could simultaneously affect both turnover and achievement.

If we do not measure this effect then our results would be biased, showing an association between

turnover and achievement even if no causal relationship exists. Focusing on school-by-grade-by-

year level turnover allows us to adjust for school-by-year level factors, both observed and not

observed.

        For each analysis we use two different estimation strategies to study the effects of school-by

grade level teacher turnover on student achievement. First, we use regression models with school-

by-grade fixed effects to leverage variation in turnover across years within the same grade level and

school. This allows us to examine whether students within the same grade level and within the same

school had better or worse test score gains in a given year, as compared to other years when teacher

turnover was at different rates. All models control for prior student achievement, but we also

control for other student, class, school, grade, and teacher characteristics depending on the analysis.

Equation 1 summarizes the regression model used for these analyses:



Aitgsy = β0 + β1Aitgs(y-1) + β2OtherAitgs(y-1) + β3Χitgsy + β4Ctgsy + β5Ssy +ɸy + νgs + β6Tgsy + εitgsy (1)




                                                                                                              6
The test performance of individual, i, with teacher, t, in grade, g, in school, s, in time, y, is a function

of his/her test performance in that subject, A, and the other subject, AOther, in the prior year,

student background characteristics, X, time varying classroom characteristics, C, time varying school

characteristics, S, year fixed effects, ɸ, grade-by-school fixed effects, ν, the grade-by-school-by-year

turnover measure, T, and an error term, ε.

        In our second method of analyses, we use school-by-year, instead of school-by-grade, fixed

effects to capitalize on turnover variation across grades within the same year and school. The

advantage of the second method is that year-to-year variations cannot explain observed effects;

however, the disadvantage is that it assumes turnover rates have comparable effects on student

achievement at different grade levels. All models control for prior student achievement, but we also

control for other student, class, school, grade, and teacher characteristics depending on the analysis.

Equation 2 describes the second method of analysis:



Aitgsy = β0 + β1Aitgs(y-1) + β2OtherAitgs(y-1) + β3Χitgsy + β4Ctgsy + β5Ssy +ɸg + νsy + β6Tgsy + εitgsy (2)



The test performance of individual, i, with teacher, t, in grade, g, in school, s, in time, y, is a function

of his/her test performance in that subject, A, and the other subject, AOther, in the prior year,

student background characteristics, X, time varying classroom characteristics, C, time varying school

characteristics, S, grade fixed effects, ɸ, year-by-school fixed effects, ν, the grade-by-school-by-year

turnover measure, T, and an error term, ε.

        What explains the relationship between teacher turnover and student achievement? There

are multiple potential mechanisms leading to the effects of turnover that we estimate in Equations 1

and 2. For example, turnover may affect achievement because the teachers who replaced those who




                                                                                                               7
left were either more or less effective (we refer to this as the “compositional” effect). Alternatively,

even where the arriving and leaving teachers were equally effective, the turnover itself may cause a

broader disruption that impacts all students, even students of teachers who did not transition (we

refer to this as the “disruption” effect).

        To examine the effect of differentially effective teachers we add teacher experience indictor

variables to see whether any observed turnover effects are driven by changes in experience of the

teachers; we then add an indicator variable for being a new teacher in the school to see whether any

observed effects are driven by teachers who are new to the school being worse. We also run

separately models that control for teachers’ average prior value-added to see if the effect is driven by

changes in the effectiveness of teachers leaving and entering grade level teams.

        The drawback to this approach of controlling for measured teacher characteristics is that

there may be unmeasured characteristics of teachers that differ between new and remaining teachers

that affect student performance. In order to further distinguish the disruption effect from the

compositional effect, we rerun our analyses but only for students who had teachers who were in the

same grade-by-school group in the prior year (i.e. students of “stayers”). If there were no disruption

effects, we should not see an effect of turnover for students in this group. We run these analyses for

the models in both Equation 1 and Equation 2.

        Another approach we used to dissect the relationship between teacher turnover and student

achievement was to look at whether the relationship varied in different kinds of schools. For

example, during the period of this study, NYC opened a number of new schools, many of which

were small and expanding. To see whether our results were driven by these new schools we ran

models separately for large versus small schools, and for new versus old schools. Additionally, many

have suggested that the effects of turnover will be most harmful in schools with more low-

performing and minority students, especially given that the turnover rates tend to be higher in these



                                                                                                           8
kinds of settings. To test whether the effects of turnover are different in schools with these

populations of students we ran models separately in low versus high performing schools, and in low

versus high percentage black schools.



                                                    RESULTS

What is the average effect of teacher turnover on student achievement?

         Table 2 describes the results for our estimates of the effects of teacher turnover on student

achievement when comparing students within the same grade within the same school but in

different years (grade-by-school fixed effects models). Model 1 includes year fixed effects as well as

school-by-grade fixed effects, while Model 2 adds in student, class, and school-level controls.5 Note

that each estimate in Table 2 comes from a separate estimation. The estimations vary in their

outcome variable (math or ELA) and in their measure of turnover (proportion of new teachers or

lagged attrition). The estimated coefficients are negative and significant for test scores in both ELA

and math and for all model specifications, suggesting that the students of teachers in the same grade

level team in the same school do worse in years where teacher turnover rates are higher, as

compared to years with less teacher turnover. Student math scores are six to seven percent of a

standard deviation lower in years when there was 100 percent turnover as compared to years where

there was no turnover at all. Effect sizes are somewhat smaller in ELA than in math, estimated at

between three and six percent of a standard deviation decrease.

         Across models, estimates were somewhat larger when signaling teacher turnover using the

proportion of new teachers to a grade level team as compared to the proportion of teachers who left

a grade level team in the prior year. We are not certain why this is the case, but we suspect it may be

the result of differences in the sensitivity of measures to variation in turnover across years where

5Table 1 describes the student controls used in these models; Appendix Table 1 describes the classroom and school
controls.


                                                                                                                    9
there was growth or decline in the number of teachers within a particular grade-by-school. To

illustrate, Table 3 includes three different scenarios – when there is an increase in the number of

teachers in a hypothetical 4th grade in a hypothetical School A; when there is a decline in the number

of teachers; and when the number of teachers stays the same. As the table demonstrates, the lagged

attrition measure may be less sensitive to changes caused by turnover in growth years. On the other

hand, in decline years, the proportion new measure may fail to detect changes due to turnover. In

the five-year period we studied in NYC, we found that grade-by-school teams experienced average

increases in faculty size in grades 4 and 5;6 this average growth may explain why the lagged attrition

estimates were relatively lower.

         Table 4 describes the estimates for models using school-by-year fixed effects instead of

school-by-grade fixed effects. Looking across models and measures, the results are similar. The

consistently negative and statistically significant estimates again suggest that teacher turnover harms

student achievement. More specifically, the results indicate that within the same school and within

the same year, students in grade levels that experience100 percent turnover had lower test scores by

four to seven percent of a standard deviation in math and by three to seven percent of a standard

deviation in ELA, as compared to grade levels with no turnover at all. As with models using school-

by-grade fixed effects, estimates were consistently lower when signaling turnover with lagged

attrition as compared to the proportion of new faculty.

         To get a better sense about the magnitude of the effects, we examined the effects at different

quartiles of teacher turnover. Table 5 describes grade-by-school-by-year-level characteristics at

different quartiles of teacher turnover. The bottom quartile (least turnover) is comprised of only

grade levels in schools that experienced no teacher turnover; in the second quartile an average of 13

6 We examined grade-by-school level growth by creating measure for the difference between years in the number of

teachers per grade level per school: Difference = Number of teachers (n) – Number of teachers (n-1). By averaging
difference scores across years and school-by-grade levels we calculated a mean difference score of about 0.3 for our
sample. This suggests an average yearly growth of 0.3 teachers within a grade level within a school.


                                                                                                                       10
percent of teachers left, in the third quartile approximately one-quarter left, and in the fourth

quartile over one-half left. As compared to school-by-grades in the top quartile of turnover, those in

the bottom quartile had more high-achieving and Asian students, fewer poor, black, and Hispanic

students, and fewer student absences and suspensions.

        Table 6 shows the estimates for the effects of teacher turnover on student achievement by

quartile of turnover. The first column displays estimates for models employing school-by-year fixed

effects, while estimates in the second column come from models with school-by-grade fixed effects.

All models control for student, classroom, and school characteristics. Depending on the model and

signal for turnover, students experiencing rates of teacher turnover in the second quartile have

statistically similar to 1 percent of a standard deviation higher math achievement as compared to

students experiencing the least (bottom quartile) teacher turnover. Students in the third quartile are

scoring 1.5 to 2 percent of a standard deviation lower, while those in the fourth quartile are scoring

about 3 percent of a standard deviation lower. This suggests that reducing teacher attrition rates

from one-quarter of teachers leaving to none corresponds with an increase in student math

achievement of about 2 percent of a standard deviation. Reducing teacher attrition rates from

approximately one-half to none corresponds with an increase of about 3 percent of a standard

deviation, an amount that other researchers have suggested to be meaningful. Given there are about

6 teachers per every grade-by-school, in an average grade level in an average school this would be

the difference between a year (or grade) where three teachers left and one where none left. We are

likely underestimating the true effect since we are really identifying idiosyncratic turnover – across

grades (within a school and year) or across years (within a grade and school). If being in a

systematically high turnover grade level and school has additional negative effects we are missing

these additional effects with our identification strategy.




                                                                                                         11
Are the effects different for different kinds of schools?

         Prior literature suggests that the turnover rates are especially high in schools with more low-

performing and minority students (Scafidi, Stinebrickner, and Sjoquist, 2003; Hanushek, Kain and

Rivkin, 2004; Boyd et al., 2010; Boyd, Lankford, Loeb and Wyckoff, 2005). Moreover, it is typically

more challenging to fill vacancies in these kinds of schools with qualified teachers (Boyd et al.,

2011). Thus, many have argued that the effects of teacher turnover are probably most harmful to

students in schools with underserved student populations. However, estimates in the recent study by

Hanushek and Rivkin (2010) suggest the opposite to be true -- that turnover may exert a lower cost

on schools with higher populations of low-achieving and black students as compared to schools

with fewer of these student populations.

         In order to examine this matter further, we analyzed whether the effects of teacher turnover

were similar or different in schools with more low-achieving and black students as compared to

schools with fewer of these student populations. We did this by re-running analyses separately only

with schools whose students averaged below the test score mean and then only with schools that

had at least 20 percent black students.7 For comparison’s sake, we also examined schools with

students scoring at or above the mean on test scores, and with black student populations of less than

or equal to 20 percent.

         Table 7a presents results for models using school-by-grade fixed effects, while Table 7b

presents results for models using school-by-year fixed effects. Across math and ELA, and across

measures for teacher turnover, the negative effect of teacher turnover on student achievement was

larger in schools with higher proportions of low-achieving and black students. The results were


7 We used 20 percent as the cutoff score as this was close to the median value. This assured we had similar number of

observations in each group: 314,000 in schools with 20 percent or more and 309,000 in schools with less than 20 percent
of students that were black.


                                                                                                                    12
particularly striking in relation to ELA test scores. Regardless of the model specification, the harmful

effects of turnover on ELA achievement were generally two to four times stronger in schools with

larger proportions of black and low-achieving students, as compared to schools with smaller

proportions of these typically underserved populations. ELA estimates did not even reach

statistically significant levels in schools with few low-achieving and black students.

        In math, estimates were negative and significant in both low and high achieving schools, but

were larger in low-achieving schools. In models using school-by-grade fixed effects, estimates were

about twice as big. However, in models using school-by-year fixed effects, the estimates were only

marginally bigger in math. Similarly, estimates for the effect of turnover on math achievement were

consistently negative and significant in schools with large and small proportions of black students.

Again, effects sizes were consistently larger in schools with large proportions of black students.

        Tables 8a and 8b compare estimates for old (more than 10 years old) versus new (10 or

fewer years old) schools and for big (8 or more teachers per grade level) versus small schools (fewer

than 8 teachers per grade level). Across models, estimates are negative and mostly significant,

suggesting that turnover has a harmful effect of on student achievement across kinds of schools.

While the estimated turnover effects are negative and generally significant in new and small schools,

they are larger in magnitude in old and big schools. These results indicate that new school reforms in

NYC are not driving the negative effects of turnover described above.



What explains the relationship between teacher turnover and student achievement?

        There are many possible mechanisms by which teacher turnover can harm student

achievement. As described in the introduction, prior literature often focuses on the relationships

between teacher turnover and teacher quality to explain this effect. The assumed theory of action is

that teacher turnover changes the average effectiveness of teachers in the schools that, in turn,



                                                                                                       13
changes student outcomes. More specifically, the effect of turnover is driven by the relative

effectiveness of the teachers who leave a school, as compared to those who replace them. We test

this by including in our models two signals for teacher quality – experience and lagged value-added –

to test whether changes in teaching experience or prior effectiveness at raising test scores explain the

harmful effects of turnover on student achievement that we observe. To measure experience we

used indicators variables for each year of experience up to 20 years. Because the first year in a

school may be especially difficult, even for experienced teachers, we also added a control for

whether the teacher moved from a different school.

        Tables 9a and 9b show estimates for models examining whether teaching experience and

migration explain the effects of teacher turnover on student achievement. We begin with the base

model in Model 1, add experience indicators in Model 2, and then add an indicator for whether a

teacher is new to the school (mover or first year teacher) in Model 3. Table 7a describes results for

models using school-by-grade fixed effects; Table 7b describes models using school-by-year fixed

effects. In both tables, Model 2 estimates are consistently lower than those in Model 1 but still

statistically significant. These results indicate that changes in teacher experience explain some of the

effect teacher turnover on student achievement, although a significant amount of the effect remains

unexplained. Compared to Model 2, Model 3 estimates are also somewhat smaller but still

statistically significant. These results suggest that teachers who migrated from other schools were, on

average, less effective, and that this accounted for some of the harmful effects of teacher turnover

on student achievement. However, Model 3 estimates remained statistically significant indicating

other factors, beyond teaching experience and migration, also explain the effects of teacher turnover

on student achievement.

        One of the most likely remaining explanatory factors is teachers’ prior effectiveness at

improving student achievement (Hanushek and Rivkin, 2010). While there is no perfect way of



                                                                                                       14
measuring teacher effectiveness, regression-based, value-added measures are the current standard.

We can calculate value-added measures for a subsample of teachers in the sample.8 As a result of

missing data, our overall sample sizes were reduced by almost half – for math, student observations

reduced from about 625,000 to about 382,000; for ELA, observations reduced from 515,707 to

302,072. Tables 10a and 10b show estimates for models using only the subsample of teachers for

whom we have data on prior value-added. Model 1 include estimates for the effect of teacher

turnover on student achievement for this subsample; Model 2 controls for teachers’ average prior

value-added9 to see if prior effectiveness explains any observed effects in Model 1. These tables

show that, even with the reduced sample of teachers for whom we have data on prior value-added,

the estimates of the effects of teacher turnover on student achievement remain negative and mostly

significant, though were somewhat smaller. After controlling for teachers’ average prior value-added,

estimate sizes reduce substantially and are generally no longer statistically significant. These results

suggest that changes in teachers’ effectiveness explain much of the observed relationship between

teacher turnover and student achievement, although the substantially diminished power as a result of

the reduced sample may have driven these results.

         Because we found the effects of teacher turnover to be especially deleterious in lower-

achieving schools, we reproduce the value-added analyses separately in lower-achieving and higher-

achieving schools. Tables 10a and 10b shows that, with the reduced sample, the turnover effect is

negative and significant in lower-achieving schools, but that there is no significant effect in higher-

achieving schools. Moreover, the effect of teacher turnover remains negative and, in most cases,

statistically significant even after controlling for prior value-added. Thus, teachers’ prior



8 All first year teachers are dropped from this analysis because we do not have student test score data in prior years. For

experienced teachers we were unable to estimate value-added for all prior years. To keep our sample as large as possible
we decided to use the average of all prior value added estimates as a signal for prior effectiveness.
9 A teacher’s average prior value added is the mean of all of his/her prior value added scores.




                                                                                                                         15
effectiveness does not appear to explain fully the harmful effects of turnover on student

achievement in lower-achieving schools.

        If not teacher experience, migration, or prior effectiveness, then what else might account for

the harmful effects of teacher turnover on student achievement, particularly in low-achieving

schools? It is beyond the scope of this study to identify and test all possible mechanisms by which

turnover may harm student achievement. However, one way to begin to identify how turnover

impacts student achievement is to examine whether the effects of teacher turnover accrue only to

students who have teachers who are new to the grade-level team in their school or whether the

effects of turnover are also felt by students whose teachers had remained. If the students of stayers

are harmed by teacher turnover, it would cast further doubt on the hypothesis that turnover harms

student achievement only through the relative effectiveness of the teachers who leave as compared

to those that replace them. It would suggest that the rotation of teachers has an influence beyond

just those students of teachers who were coming and going, to somehow negatively impact even the

students who were assigned to teachers who stayed in the same school from year to year. To test

this, we examined the effects of turnover separately for teachers who were stayers, movers, and

rookies (first year) to see the extent to which the students of these groups of teachers experienced

the effects of turnover differently. Given prior evidence that the effect of turnover manifests

primarily in lower-achieving schools, we continued to analyze low and high achieving schools

separately.

        Table 11a shows the results for models using school-by-grade fixed effects while Table 11b

shows results for models using school-by-year fixed effects. There is a consistent pattern for stayers

– in lower achieving schools, their students perform significantly worse when turnover is greater;

while in higher-achieving schools there is no effect. For movers, the effects of turnover vary

according to model specifications, and there is no clear pattern as to whether turnover is more or



                                                                                                       16
less harmful in lower or higher achieving settings. In general, there is a negative relationship between

turnover and achievement for students of movers, although the effect is not always significant.

Lastly, there are no significant effects of turnover on the student achievement of first year teachers,

regardless of model or kind of school. This result suggests that first year teachers do equally well at

improving student achievement regardless of the turnover rate in their grade.



                                            DISCUSSION

        This study finds some of the first empirical evidence for a direct effect of teacher turnover

on student achievement. Results demonstrate that teacher turnover has a significant and negative

effect on student achievement in both math and ELA. Moreover, teacher turnover is particularly

harmful to students in schools with large populations of low-performing and black students.

        Much of the existing literature assumes that teacher turnover impacts student achievement

by changing the average quality of teachers in schools. That is, if the teachers who leave a school are

worse than those who replace them, then turnover will have a net positive effect. In this view,

stayers are merely bystanders who do not affect and are not affected by turnover.

        Although this study finds evidence that changes in teacher quality explain some of the effect

of turnover on student achievement, the results suggest there may be disruptional effects of

turnover beyond these compositional effects. First, results show that turnover has a harmful effect

on student achievement, even after controlling for different indicators of teacher quality, especially

in lower-performing schools. Also, we find that turnover negatively affects the students of stayers –

those who remain in the same school from one year to the next as well the students in the

classrooms of new teachers. Thus, turnover must have an impact beyond simply whether incoming

teachers are better than those they replaced – even the teachers outside of this redistribution were

somehow harmed by it. Although this study does not identify the specific mechanism by which



                                                                                                        17
turnover harms students, it provides guidance on where to look. The findings indicate that turnover

has a broader, harmful influence on student achievement since it can reach beyond just those

students of teachers who left or of those that replaced them. Any explanation for the effect of

turnover must possess these characteristics. One possibility is that turnover negatively affects

collegiality or relational trust among faculty; or perhaps turnover results in loss of institutional

knowledge among faculty that is critical for supporting all student learning. More research is needed

to identify the specific mechanism.

        This study also makes methodological contributions. Often the effects of turnover are

analyzed at the school-level, an approach that makes the questionable assumption that the effects of

turnover are comparable across different kinds of schools. Instead, we utilize two innovative

modeling approaches that do not make this assumption. The first identifies turnover variation across

years within the same grade level and within the same school to examine whether students had better or worse

test score gains in a given year, as compared to other years when teacher turnover was at different

rates. The second identifies turnover variation across grade levels within the same year and within the same

school to examine whether students in grade levels with higher or lower turnover rates also had higher

or lower achievement gains. Though an improvement over school-level analyses, both of these

methods also make questionable assumptions. The former assumes the effects of turnover rates

within the same grade and school are comparable across years; the latter assumes that turnover

effects within the same school and year are comparable across grade levels. Despite concerns over

potential bias introduced by these assumptions, that findings were similar across methodological

approaches suggests that we may have detected a true effect.

        Finally, the findings of this study also have policy implications. Though there may be cases

where turnover is actually helpful to student achievement, on average, it is harmful. One possibility

might be to introduce incentive structures to retain teachers that might leave otherwise.



                                                                                                               18
Implementing such policies may be especially important in schools with large populations of low-

performing and black students, where turnover has the strongest negative effect on student

achievement.
