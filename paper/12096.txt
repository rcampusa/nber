                                        ABSTRACT

Estimating the value of medical innovation is a continual challenge. In this research, we quantify
the impact of antihypertensive therapy on U.S. blood pressures, risk and number of heart attacks,
strokes, and deaths. We also consider the potential for further improvements. We estimate the
value of innovation using equations relating blood pressure to adverse outcomes from the
Framingham Heart Study. Our results show that without antihypertensive therapy, 1999-2000
average blood pressure for the U.S. population age 40 plus would have been 10-13 percent higher.
86,000 excess premature deaths from cardiovascular disease (2001), and 833,000 hospital discharges
for stroke and heart attacks (2002) would have occurred. Life expectancy would be 0.5 (men) and
0.4 (women) years lower. At guideline care, there would have been 89,000 fewer premature deaths
(2001) and 420,000 fewer hospital discharges for stroke and heart attack (2002) than observed. Our
analysis suggests that antihypertensive therapy has had a significant impact on cardiovascular health
outcomes but that mortality gains would have been approximately twice as high if guideline care had
been achieved for all.

        Hypertension is an established risk factor for conditions including coronary heart

disease (CHD), myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. Over 50 million adults were

hypertensive in 1999-2000, including 43 percent of adults age 40 and over (i.e., had Stage

I or II blood pressures, or reported taking antihypertensive medicine). The risk of

developing hypertension increases with age; lifetime risk is estimated at approximately

90 percent for individuals with normal blood pressures at age 55 or 65 and who survive to

age 80 to 85.1 The economic burden of CHD and stroke is substantial. Applying the

methodologies of Rice et al. and Hodgson and Cohen to 2002 data, the total economic

burden of CHD and stroke is estimated at $120.6 and $48.9 billion, respectively.2,3

       Drug therapy for hypertension has improved over the past four decades. Only

limited drug therapy existed in the late 1950s and early 1960s; the only FDA-approved

drug therapies for hypertension were vasodilators (approved in 1946), peripherally acting

agents (1953) and diuretics (1958).4 Most patients who would be treated immediately

today with effective drug therapy were untreated, or treated less effectively. For

example, while Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine (1962) found that diastolic

blood pressure was important in determining mortality, it justified treatment only in

properly selected cases, stating, “A woman who has tolerated her diastolic pressure of

120 for 10 years without symptoms or deterioration does not need specific treatment for

hypertension.”5 As late as 1971-75, only nine percent of the population age 40 and over

with hypertension reported in NHANES taking medication for it, and blood pressures

were poorly controlled; 79 percent of this treated group still had Stage I or II blood

pressures. Thus, the earlier time period could be called “drug-naïve” with regard to

widespread use of a range of effective drug therapies.




                                                                                          4
       Over time, additional antihypertensive drugs became available – calcium channel

blockers and beta blockers (1970s and 1980s), and ACE inhibitors and angiotensin

receptor antagonists (1980s and 1990s). In 1999-2000, we calculate that 61 percent of

the population age 40 and over with hypertension reported in NHANES taking

medication.

       Our objective is to estimate the actual impact of antihypertensive therapy on the

U.S. population over the past four decades and identify potential further improvements if

guideline care were achieved. Despite documented major strides in cardiovascular

disease management, there has been no systematic estimate of the total impact of

antihypertensive therapy on health outcomes. We use national survey data to estimate the

impact of drug treatment on average blood pressures, and the best-available published

risk equations to estimate the impact on the risk and number of MI, strokes, and deaths.

Because the objective is to estimate the “real world” impact of antihypertensive therapy

on outcomes for the entire population, representative national survey data were used,

rather than estimates derived from highly controlled clinical trials.




                                                                                           5
METHODS



Data Sources



We use data on 5,046 individuals age 30-79 from the 1959-62 National Health

Examination Survey (NHES) and 2,284 individuals age 40-79 from the 1999-2000

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES); U.S. life expectancy

tables from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS); hospital discharge figures

from the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS); and published risk equations from

the Framingham Heart Study. All observations from NHES and NHANES populated

with the required data were included in calculations, which were performed using SAS,

release 9.1.



Statistical Analysis



Determinants of hypertension, including body mass index (BMI), diabetes, family

history, excessive alcohol use, high salt diet, exercise, race, age and sex were identified

from literature searches. Data on BMI, diabetes, race, age and sex were used to model

observed blood pressure among a drug-naïve sample (the 1959-62 NHES sample).

       The relationship between blood pressure (BP) and these explanatory factors was

estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, with separate equations for

systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and for men and women.




                                                                                              6
The explanatory variables are race (BLACK, OTHER, with white being the omitted

category), AGE (nine variables corresponding to five-year cohorts beginning with age 35,

age 30-34 being the omitted category), BMI, BMI2 (to account for possible non-

linearities in the effect of BMI on BP), and DIABETES (either reporting taking insulin or

having a blood glucose level>140 mg/dL) DIABETES, BMI, and BMI2 terms control for

the impact of secular population changes in the levels of diabetes and obesity.

       To predict BP in the absence of antihypertensive drug therapy, the estimated

structural relationship based on data from 1959-62 is applied to observed values of the

explanatory variables for individuals in the 1999-2000 NHANES sample. Following

JNC-V definitions, predicted and observed systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) BPs for

each individual are assigned to five categories: Optimal, Normal, High Normal, Stage I

and Stage II Hypertension.6 The resulting distribution of predicted BPs for 1999-2000 is

compared to the distribution of observed BPs. Controlling for other identified risk factors

for which data are available, the difference between the two distributions is attributed to

antihypertensive therapy. Two risk factors – sodium intake and exercise – could not be

included in the predictive model because data are available only for 1999-2000. A

sensitivity analysis of the impact of these variables on BP, using 1999-2000 data, was

conducted.

       The impact of antihypertensive therapy on risk of death and total deaths from

CHD is estimated using Framingham Heart Study risk equations estimated by Wilson et

al.7, together with NCHS population life tables and cause of death statistics. The impact

of antihypertensive therapy on risk of stroke and MI, and hospital discharges for stroke




                                                                                              7
and MI is estimated using Framingham Heart Study risk equations estimated by

Anderson et al.8, and NHDS hospital discharge statistics.

       The Wilson et al. risk equations are generated from a hazard model predicting the

probability of a CHD event (angina, MI, or death from CHD) within the next 10 years,

and include variables for age, total cholesterol, HDL-C, BP, diabetes and smoking.

These equations are applied to each individual in the NHANES sample based on the

individual’s observed characteristics. For each individual, the probability of a CHD

event within 10 years is calculated based on (1) observed BP and (2) predicted BP in the

absence of antihypertensive therapy, and a relative risk ratio calculated by dividing the

two. The calculated relative risks are averaged across individuals within each sex-age

cohort, according to sample population weights. Since the variable of interest is death

from major cardiovascular disease, average risks are combined with the probabilities for

men and women of a given age, n, surviving to age n+1 (from the NCHS life tables),9 and

with the share of deaths due to major cardiovascular disease (ICD/10 I00-I78) by sex-age

cohort (from NCHS cause of death tables by sex and age).10 By adjusting for the share of

total mortality due to death from major cardiovascular disease, increases in the risk of a

CHD event in the next 10 years are assumed to increase the risk of death from major

cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years proportionally. Improvement in life

expectancy attributable to antihypertensive therapy is calculated as the difference

between life expectancy at birth reported by NCHS (with observed BPs) and calculated

with predicted BPs. Predicted life expectancy is derived by adjusting the risk of death in

each year for men and women age 40 and above by the relative risk described for the

corresponding sex-age cohort, and summing over all ages.




                                                                                             8
       The Anderson et al. risk equations are generated from separate parametric models

predicting the probability of stroke and MI for men and women of given characteristics

(age, BP, smoking, ratio of total cholesterol to HDL-C, diabetes and ECG-LVH) over the

next 4 to 12 years. The recommended specification incorporating SBP is used. For each

individual, the risk of stroke and MI, respectively, in the next five years is calculated

based on (1) observed BP and (2) predicted BP in the absence of antihypertensive

therapy, and a relative risk ratio calculated by dividing the two. The number of avoided

hospital discharges is calculated by applying the relative risk ratio to hospital discharge

statistics for stroke (ICD/9 430-438) and MI (ICD/9 410) by sex and age from the NHDS

for 2002. These risk equations allow us to isolate the effect of BP from other factors such

as secular changes in serum cholesterol levels, diabetes rates and smoking, which also

affect CHD risk.




                                                                                              9
RESULTS



Predictive Structural Model of Untreated Blood Pressure



OLS multivariate regression relating SBP and DBP to risk factors was used with a sample

of 2,382 men and 2,664 women age 30-79 from the 1959-62 NHES. Results appear in

Table 1.



Table 1



       Figure 1 is derived by applying the structural relationship from the untreated BP

model for men and women, respectively, to observed characteristics of individuals in the

1999-2000 NHANES sample. The predicted SBPs and DBPs without antihypertensive

drug therapy and observed BPs for each individual are assigned to five categories:

Optimal, Normal, High Normal, Stage I and Stage II Hypertension. If an individual’s

predicted systolic and diastolic BPs are in different categories, the more hypertensive

category is assigned.



Figure 1



       For example, observed BPs for men age 40-49, treated or not, were: 36 percent

Optimal, 26 percent Normal, 21 percent High Normal, 14 percent Stage I and 3 percent

Stage II Hypertensive. For the same cohort, predicted BPs without treatment were: 22




                                                                                          10
percent Optimal, 22 percent Normal, 19 percent High Normal, 27 percent Stage I and 10

percent Stage II Hypertensive.

       Calculating weighted average BPs for each sample, we find that in the absence of

antihypertensive drug therapy, average BPs for the population over 40 would be 10-13

percent higher (10.0 to 10.7 percent for men and 10.4 to 12.9 percent for women for SBP

and DBP, respectively). Women age 70-79 exhibited the greatest difference between

predicted and observed BPs, with 61 percent predicted and 29 percent observed with

Stage II hypertension, compared to 41 and 12 percent, respectively, for men age 70-79.

However, these women also experienced rates of Stage II hypertension 2.5 times higher

than their male counterparts.



Statistical Sensitivity Analyses



To allow for nonlinearities, the continuous BMI variables in the BP prediction equation

were replaced by six categories from the literature: “less than or within normal BMI

range”, “marginally overweight”, “overweight”, “very overweight”, “severely obese”,

and “morbidly/super obese”.11 The relationship between BP and BMI is linear for

women and weakly concave for men.

       Variables measuring reported sodium intake and exercise habits (available only

for 1999-2000) were also included in the model. Both have been identified as

hypertension risk factors in the literature. Neither increased the explanatory power of the

model significantly; the predicted BP distributions were nearly identical with or without

these variables. Variables for sodium intake were never statistically significant and often




                                                                                         11
had incorrect signs, while the exercise variable was occasionally significant. They had

no significant impact on BMI or BMI2coefficients, and increased the R2 measure only at

the third decimal point. To assess possible non-normality in the model’s error terms, a

log-transformation of the dependent variable was regressed on the same variables. This

specification did not increase the model’s explanatory power nor the precision of the

estimated coefficients significantly.



Impact of Blood Pressure on Life Expectancy and Total Deaths from Major

Cardiovascular Disease



Applying the Wilson et al. risk equation for CHD events within the next 10 years to each

individual in the 1999-2000 sample, and averaging the effect over the entire population,

the total increase in life expectancy associated with antihypertensive drug therapy is 0.5

years (men) 0.4 years (women). Averaged over only the population with predicted Stage

I or Stage II hypertension, the values are 0.9 years (men) and 0.6 years (women).

Applying the change in risk of death to total deaths for each sex-age cohort, an estimated

86,000 excess premature deaths from cardiovascular disease (50,000 men, 36,000

women) would have occurred in 2001 among the U.S. population age 40 plus in the

absence of antihypertensive drug therapy. For adults age 40 plus, observed 2001 total

deaths and deaths from major cardiovascular disease are four and nine percent lower,

respectively, than predicted levels with untreated BPs. Due to potential competitive

mortality, these estimates represent reductions in premature deaths due to cardiovascular

disease; reductions in total mortality from all causes in a given year may be lower.




                                                                                          12
       If all patients with Stage I or Stage II hypertension who reported being untreated

had been treated, as recommended in JNC 712(p 1211), and all treated patients achieved

normal BPs, we calculate an additional 89,000 fewer premature deaths from major

cardiovascular disease in 2001 than actually occurred. This is likely an underestimate

because it assumes that those dying are no more likely to have high BP than the general

population.



Impact of Blood Pressure on MI and Stroke



Similarly, for each individual in the NHANES 1999-2000 sample, we calculate the

separate risks of stroke or MI within the next five years, applying the Anderson et al.

equations. In the absence of antihypertensive drug therapy, there would have been

572,000 more hospital discharges for stroke in 2002 (162,000 men, 410,000 women), and

261,000 more discharges for MI (87,000 men, 174,000 women). This is a 38 percent

reduction in discharges for stroke and a 25 percent reduction for MI, compared to

predictions with untreated BPs. Most of this improvement represents stroke and MI

avoided altogether, rather than delayed. Even if all the predicted reduction in discharges

were for patients with predicted Stage II hypertension (those most likely to have a stroke

in the future), we calculate only seven percent of discharges for stroke and five percent

for MI would have occurred in the future; the remainder were avoided altogether.

       We also calculate considerable improvements if guideline care were achieved. If

all untreated patients with Stage I or Stage II hypertension had been treated, and all

treated patients achieved normal BPs, there would have been an additional 278,000




                                                                                            13
(stroke) and 142,000 (MI) fewer hospital discharges in 2002 than actually occurred. This

is likely an underestimate because it assumes that those discharged for stroke and MI are

no more likely to have high BP than the general population.

DISCUSSION



       By many measures, hypertension is much better treated now than in the past.

Although further efforts are still needed to bring health benefits to all, awareness,

treatment, and control of hypertension have shown considerable improvement since

NHANES II (1976-80)12(p 1207). The estimated impact of antihypertensive therapy on BP

is substantial: approximately 10 percent (SBP) and 13 percent (DBP) for both men and

women age 40 plus, compared to predicted untreated BP. Better-controlled BP translated

into nine percent fewer deaths from major cardiovascular disease in 2001, and 38 percent

and 25 percent fewer hospital discharges for stroke and MI in 2002, respectively,

compared to predicted levels in the absence of drug therapy. Placing the estimated

reduction of approximately 86,000 deaths in context, U.S. deaths from motor vehicle

accidents totaled approximately 42,000 in 2001.13



Figure 2


       This study quantifies the impact of antihypertensive drugs in terms of avoided

premature deaths from cardiovascular disease and excess hospitalizations for stroke and

MI. Assigning a monetary value to these outcomes and drawing on figures from the

literature for 1998, we calculate a benefit-cost ratio of over 12:1 for men and 11:1 for

women by comparing life expectancy benefits to antihypertensive drug expenditures. We

assume each year of additional life in good health is valued at $90,000 (a generally

accepted value of $100,000, less $10,000 in average support costs during non-working

years paid by government),14 and expenditures on antihypertensive drugs average $2,600



                                                                                           15
for men (over a 73.8-year expected lifespan) and $3,248 for women (over a 79.5-year

expected lifespan).15 We discount both costs and benefits at three percent a year, the

inflation-adjusted U.S. Treasury bond yield.

       Previous studies have concluded that antihypertensive treatment is cost-effective;

Weinstein reports estimates of the number of quality-adjusted life years achieved with

each $1 million spent on antihypertensive drug therapy as between 20-50

(antihypertensive treatment, DBP 95-104) to more than 200 (beta-blockade post-

myocardial infarction, high risk). As a benchmark, $1 million spent for dialysis for end-

stage renal disease is estimated to yield 10-20 quality-adjusted life years.16

       Reduced hospitalizations for stroke and MI increase calculated net benefits

further. Dividing figures from the literature for total hospital costs for CHD and

cerebrovascular disease17, 18 by corresponding hospital discharges, and assuming hospital

costs represent 70 percent of direct medical costs in the year following stroke and MI,19

we estimate 2002 total direct medical costs avoided due to fewer strokes and MI of $10.7

billion and $5.8 billion, respectively. Including the impact of antihypertensive drugs on

quality of life and work productivity would increase the benefit–cost ratio further.

       While the benefits have been substantial, significant opportunities remain to

extend drug treatment to more who could benefit. We estimate life expectancy could

increase an additional 0.3 years (men) and 0.1 years (women) if therapy were extended to

all with Stage I or Stage II hypertension not currently treated with medication, and an

additional 0.2 years for both men and women if those treated achieved normal BP. These

figures translate into an additional 89,000 avoided premature deaths from major




                                                                                          16
cardiovascular disease, and an additional 278,000 (stroke) and 142,000 (MI) avoided

hospital discharges, compared with actual 2002 levels.



Study Limitations



The methodology used is a residual analysis. It controls for all risk factors for which data

are available, and confirms that omitted sodium and exercise variables are unlikely to

have a significant impact. There remains, however, the possibility that unknown factors

may have contributed to differences between observed and predicted BPs. In particular,

some researchers suggest a downward cohort effect due to unknown, population-level

factors. Using the same datasets, Goff et al. find that the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile

levels of observed BP by age were lower for more recent birth cohorts. However,

because observed BPs include both treated and untreated BPs, the observed cohort effect

is confounded by the impact of treatment. Even in lowest-decile SBPs, where

“pharmacologic management is unlikely to have had any impact,”20 1999-2000 NHANES

data show nine percent age 40 plus reported taking hypertension medication (increasing

to 29 percent age 60 plus). We adjust for this confounding treatment effect by calculating

the ratio of untreated to all lowest-decile SBPs in the 1999-2000 sample (by age), and

adjusting the authors’ estimates thereby. Assuming the improvement in the lowest decile,

as adjusted, to be entirely due to a cohort effect would reduce our estimate of the impact

of BP improvements modestly, from a nine- to an eight-percent reduction in 2001

premature deaths from cardiovascular disease.




                                                                                              17
        Our calculations assume the 1959-62 data provide a reliable predictive basis for

calculating the structural relationship between BP and explanatory variables, notably

BMI and BMI2, and that the sample is “drug-naïve.” While NHANES data are available

for subsequent time periods (1971-75, 1976-80, 1988-94, and 1999-2000), their

suitability for estimating this relationship is compromised by the increasing proportion

being treated with antihypertensive drugs, thereby rendering the remaining untreated

population increasingly unrepresentative. When similar equations are estimated in later

years with only the remaining untreated individuals, the predicted impact of a change in

BMI (and BMI2) on BP was always positive, but generally became smaller over time,

consistent with an increasingly selective untreated population. While treatment rates

were low in 1959-62 and few effective clinical options were available, to the degree that

some individuals were treated effectively, predicted untreated BPs for 1999-2000, and

therefore the estimated impact of treatment on mortality and morbidity, would be

understated. The study design may also overestimate strokes and MI avoided due to a

“survival bias”; specifically, in the absence of effective BP control, the total population

with hypertension would have been smaller and some individuals who had a stroke or MI

in 2002 would have died previously. However, there is a likely countervailing

underestimation effect, in that those discharged for stroke and MI are assumed to be no

more likely to have high BP than the general population. The net impact of these effects

is unknown.

       Finally, the study design relies on Framingham Heart Study risk equations. To

the degree that these equations were estimated on an essentially all-white population, and

that cardiovascular risk for the same level of BP may be higher for non-white




                                                                                              18
populations, all other factors held constant, we have underestimated the impact of

treatment.
