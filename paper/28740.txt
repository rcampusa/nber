                                          ABSTRACT

This paper examines the association between episodes of large fiscal impulses (expansions and
adjustments) and sustainable development indicators (prosperity, resilience, and inclusivity). We
provide country studies of Chile, Poland, South Africa, and Thailand, examining the components
of government expenses and tax revenues, and reporting four stylized patterns from the analysis.
(i) Fiscal expansions led to higher growth rates and reduced negative trade-offs, e.g., pollution
and poor-health mortalities associated with economic growth. (ii) Fiscal adjustments led to a
more inclusive economy, lowered poverty headcounts, improved sanitation, and cleaner
technology access. (iii) Fiscal expansions followed an increase in direct taxes (especially
corporate taxes) and a decline in social contributions, and preceded a decline in other direct taxes
and an increase in wage bills. (iv) Fiscal adjustments followed a decline in other direct taxes and
social contributions, an increase in wage bills, and preceded a decline in government
consumption expenditure and transfers. In light of these findings, the domestic resource
mobilization should consider the time paths of the taxes and expenditure components to
understand their empirical linkages with the sustainable development outcomes in the respective
countries.

                                         I.     INTRODUCTION

This paper studies the intertemporal feedbacks between fiscal policy and sustainable development. We
focus on the inclusivity of economic growth and domestic revenue mobilization around large fiscal
mobilization episodes, including reforms of indirect taxes and exemptions, tax administration, and
transfer programs. Inclusive growth reduces poverty, improves health and education, among others, and
may enhance the tax capacity, spending efficiency, and resource mobilization (e.g., greater compliance,
higher income, lower informality). In turn, higher tax mobilization may fund pressing social policies and
redistribution, thereby deepening inclusive growth and better social infrastructure. Such associations
are subject to structural factors, including governance, polarization, civil wars and conflicts, ethnic and
religious fragmentation, quality of institutions, a share of manufacturing, farming, commodity
dependence, and urbanization rates.

To deepen our understanding amid the challenges posed by multidimensional data requirements, we
provide country studies that are combined with a panel estimation of selected emerging markets. We
ask three questions. The first is the relationship between economic structure and the composition of
government revenues and expenses. Second, we address the association between episodes of large
fiscal impulses (expansions and adjustments) and sustainable development outcomes (prosperity,
inclusivity, and resilience). Third, we ask whether past changes in the budget's specific components led
to fiscal expansions and adjustments, which relied on future changes in certain budget items.

After putting together the necessary data, we identify Chile, Poland, South Africa, and Thailand as the
emerging markets that provide sufficient fiscal aggregates and represent a diverse sample set for the
analysis. For these countries, a third of gross domestic product (GDP) is the industry, and more than half
are services (as of 2018; World Bank (2020)). Despite the similarity, there are structural differences.
Chile's largest exports are metals, minerals, and agricultural products; South Africa's largest exports are
stone, minerals, and agricultural products (as of 2018; The Growth Lab at Harvard University (2019)): the
fiscal stance is vulnerable to commodity price fluctuations. Poland's largest exports are machinery,
services, and agricultural products; Thailand's largest exports are services, machinery, electronics,
vehicles, and chemicals: the fiscal conditions are sensitive to global industrial production and related
supply-chain services. Thus, different terms of trade shocks are responsible for large episodes of fiscal
expansions and adjustments across these economies. There are also differences in their politico-
                                                    2
economic structure, i.e., liberal versus conservative tendency and single-party versus coalition
government. These subtleties are beyond the scope of our paper.

The analysis proceeds with the decomposition of fiscal revenues and expenses and their linkages with
sustainable development. The estimation then tests these linkages' strengths, identifying prevalent
useful feedback as the guidelines for dealing with the present and future challenges.

We find some stylized patterns in the sample countries. (i) Fiscal expansions led to higher growth rates
and reduced negative trade-offs, e.g., pollution and poor-health mortalities associated with economic
growth. (ii) Fiscal adjustments led to a more inclusive economy, lowered poverty headcounts, improved
sanitation, and cleaner technology access. (iii) Fiscal expansions followed an increase in direct taxes
(especially corporate taxes) and a decline in social contributions, and preceded a decline in other direct
taxes and an increase in wage bills. (iv) Fiscal adjustments followed a decline in other direct taxes and
social contributions, an increase in wage bills, and preceded a decline in government consumption
expenditure and transfers. In light of these findings, the domestic resource mobilization should consider
the time paths of the taxes and expenditure components to understand their empirical linkages with the
sustainable development outcomes in the respective countries.

The key takeways are (i) Countries have distinct fiscal challenges, underlined by their economic and
institutional structures. Value-added tax revenues have accounted for 30%­60% of total revenues in the
countries sampled. Domestic public resources of commodity-exporting countries are vulnerable to
commodity terms of trade shocks. The fiscal conditions of manufacturing­exporting countries are
dependent on the global value chains, the global business cycle, and supporting services. (ii) The
associations between fiscal expenses, taxes, and sustainable development outcomes differ across
countries. A focal study on fiscal episodes (loose/expansion versus tight/adjustment) is the low-hanging
fruit in understanding the linkages between fiscal aggregates and the role of domestic resource
mobilization (DRM) in inclusive growth and sustainable development. In the country case studies, large
fiscal episodes accounted for 16% of the sample periods. (iii) DRM should consider the time paths of the
taxes and expenditure components to understand their empirical linkages with the sustainable
development outcomes in the respective countries. (iv) It is practically useful to have a template for
tracing the linkages between fiscal stance and the sustainable development outcomes. Future analysis
should adjust to the data available, recognizing the constraints, i.e., if unemployment statistics are not a
suitable indicator for accounting for the economic cycles in some countries, one can look at proxies like

                                                     3
employment, electricity consumption, etc. (v)More data may shed more light on correlations between
the fiscal conditions and DRM for sustainable development in the coming years. Pre-coronavirus disease
(COVID-19), the size of fiscal impulses to gross domestic product in the countries studied was already in
the range of 1.4%­4.8%. Given the larger prospective fiscal stimuli across the developing countries, the
public and private debts and quality of governance stand out as the emergent issues in the post-COVID-
19.

Section II describes the data. Section III discusses fiscal aggregates and sustainable development and
follows with the estimation of the linkages in section IV. The conclusion is in section V.

                                                          II.       DATA


Data on the main components of the general government spending are from Government Finance
Statistics (International Monetary Fund, 2020), including wage bills (Wage), non-wage expenditure (Non-
wage), subsidies to firms (Subsidies), and expenditure on social benefits (Transfers); all in percent of
GDP. Because data on fixed capital consumption are not available for Thailand and only available for
South Africa from 2003, we exclude it from the study. This exclusion should not influence our analysis as
the fixed capital consumption is only a minor part of the general government expenditure (0.93% in Chile
2000­2018, 2.45% in Poland 1995­2018, and 0.7% in South Africa 2003­2018). Following the literature,
we also exclude interest expense to focus on the discretionary change of fiscal impulse. Our data indicate
that the interest expense accounts for a small fraction of the general government expenses (0.76% in
Chile 2000­2018, 2.78% in Poland 1995­2018, 3.81% in South Africa 1996­2018, and 1.1% in Thailand
2000­2018).

We use the ICTD/UNU-WIDER (2020) database for the main components of total tax revenue. The data
include personal income taxes (PIT), corporate taxes (CIT), payroll and workforce taxes and property
taxes (Other), indirect taxes (INDT), and social security contributions (SSC); all in percent of GDP. For
Chile, we interpolate the 1993­2005 non-resource CIT from the total CIT--total income and profit taxes
on corporations, including taxes on resource firms--over the 1993­2005 period, using the 2006­2018
ratio of the non-resource CIT to total CIT. 1

We calculate the primary balance as follows:

       ·       (Total) Tax revenue (% of GDP) = PIT + CIT + Other + INDT + SSC
       ·       Primary expenses (% of GDP) = Wage + Non-wage + Subsidies + Transfer
       ·       Primary deficit (% of GDP) = Primary expenses ­ Total (tax) revenue

Our analysis considers economic growth, taking into account its inclusivity and sustainability. For
comprehensiveness, we use 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicators, covering poverty
headcount ratio (Poverty); population share undernourished (Undernourishment); mortality ratio from
cardiovascular disease (CVD); cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease (CRD) between age 30 and
age 70 (Mortality); enrollment ratio to pre-primary school (Enrollment); proportion of seats held by
women in national parliaments (Women power); population share with access to basic sanitation
services (Sanitation); population share with access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking (Fuel-
tech); youth population share not in education, employment or training (Non-education); fixed
broadband subscriptions (Broadband); mean consumption of bottom 40% of population (Bottom
consumption); exposure to PM2.5 air pollution (Pollution); carbon dioxide damage (Carbon dioxide
damage); number of displaced persons associated with disasters (Displacement); marine-protected
areas (Marine); terrestrial protected areas (Terrestrial); bribery incidence experienced by firms (Bribery);
and personal remittances (Remittances). Details of these indicators are in the Appendix. We collect the
annual data from World Development Indicators (World Bank, 2020) and use linear interpolation for the
missing data. Our final sample of fiscal and sustainable-development variables includes Chile 2000­2018,
Poland 1995­2018, Thailand 2000-2018, and South Africa 1996­2018.



                    III.   FISCAL AGGREGATES AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

Section III looks at the structure of total tax revenue and primary expenses across countries. Figure 1
plots the time paths of fiscal components (as a share of GDP) during 2000­2018 (Poland and South Africa
data went back to 1995). We also compute the variations (changes and standard deviation [s.d.]) of total
tax revenue, primary expenses, and each country's fiscal components over the sample period.

From Figure 1, Chile (Figure 1a) saw the primary expenses decreased (2.8% [s.d. 1.2%]), while the total
tax revenue to GDP increased (1.8% [s.d. 0.8%]) during 2000­2018. The expenditure on subsidies to firms
decreased (3.8% [s.d. 1.2%]), and the wage bills increased (1.1% [s.d. 0.7%]). The shares of non-wage
bills and transfer expenses remained stable over time [s.d. 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively]. The corporate
income taxes to GDP increased (2.6% [s.d. 1.3%]), while the indirect taxes decreased (1% [s.d. 0.8%]).
Other tax components' contributions remained largely unchanged.

Poland (Figure 1b) saw the primary expenses decreased (3.4% [s.d. 1.9%]) and the total tax revenue to
GDP increased (2% [s.d. 1.1%]). The transfer and non-wage bills to GDP decreased (1.3% [s.d. 1%] and
1% [s.d. 0.5%], respectively). The personal income taxes and indirect taxes to GDP increased (1% [s.d.
0.4% - 0.6%]). Other expenses and tax components were relatively stable during the 2000­2018 period.

South Africa (Figure 1c) saw both primary expenses to GDP and tax revenue to GDP increased (7.7% [s.d.
2.9%] and 3.9% [s.d. 1.5%], respectively). Transfer expenses to GDP increased (3.1% [s.d. 0.8%]) and the
non-wage bills increased (2.5% [s.d. 1%]). The indirect taxes and personal income taxes to GDP increased
(1.7% [s.d. 0.8%] and 1% [s.d. 0.8%], respectively.

Thailand (Figure 1d) saw both primary expenses to GDP and total tax revenue to GDP increased (3% [s.d.
1.7%] and 3% [s.d. 1.3%], respectively). The non-wage bills to GDP increased the largest (2% [s.d. 0.9%]),
followed the share of transfer expenditure to GDP (1% [s.d. 0.5%]). The corporate income taxes to GDP
increased most significantly (1.3% [s.d. 0.8%]), followed by indirect taxes to GDP (1.1% [s.d. 0.7%]). The
shares of other expenses elements are largely unchanged.




                                                                 8

Figure 2 reports each tax component's contribution to the total tax revenue and each expenditure
component to the primary expenses. For Chile (Figure 2a), wage bills (34%) account for the largest share
of expenses, followed by expenditure on transfer expense (28%), subsidies to firms (22%), and non-wage
bills (15%). Indirect taxes (60%) and corporate income taxes (20%) account for most of the total tax
revenue.

For Poland (Figure 2b), transfer expense (49%) accounts for the largest share of primary expenses,
followed by wage bills (30%) and non-wage expenditures (17%). Poland's tax structure has a large share
of indirect taxes (37%) and social contributions (36%) in total tax revenue.

For South Africa (Figure 2c), wage bills (47%) and non-wage expenditures (34%) are the main
components of the primary expenses. Indirect taxes (40%) account for the largest share of total tax
revenue, followed by personal income taxes (32%) and corporate income taxes (19%).

For Thailand (Figure 2d), wage bills (44%) are the largest expenditure components, followed by non-
wage expenditures (36%). Indirect taxes (57%) account for the largest share of total tax revenue,
followed by corporate income taxes (25%) and personal income taxes (10%).

Figure 3 shows the correlation coefficients between total tax revenue, primary expenses, primary deficit,
the fiscal components, and 17 SDGs. For Chile (Figure 3a), total tax revenue is negatively associated with
primary expenses and primary deficit. Corporate income taxes and Transfer components represent this
association with the primary deficit. Given that corporate income tax is the second-largest component
of revenue, its association with carbon dioxide damage (neg.), fuel/clean technology (neg.), and bribery
(pos.) are favorable. The association between indirect taxes (the largest component of revenue) with
remittances (neg.), carbon dioxide damage (pos.) and fuel/clean technology (neg.) suggest that a better
understanding of their linkages should be useful for domestic resource mobilization.




                                                                    13
For Poland (Figure 3b), primary expenses are positively associated with total tax revenues and primary
deficit. Transfer and wage-bill components represent this association with the primary deficit. Given that
social security contributions are the second-largest component of revenue, its association with bribery
(neg.), displacement (neg.), and bottom-income consumption (pos.) are favorable. The association
between transfers (the largest component of expenses) with carbon dioxide damage (pos.), broadband
access (neg.), sanitation quality (neg.), enrollment (neg.), and mortality (pos.) suggest that a better
understanding of their linkages should be useful for domestic resource mobilization.

For South Africa (Figure 3c), primary expenses are positively associated with total tax revenues and
primary deficit. Transfers, subsidies, wage-bill, and non-wage components represent this association
with the primary deficit. The association between transfers and broadband access (pos.), non-education
ratio (neg.), fuel/clean technology (pos.), sanitation quality (pos.), women power/gender equity (pos.),
mortality (neg.), and poverty (neg.) are favorable.

For Thailand (Figure 3d), primary expenses are positively associated with total tax revenues and primary
deficit. Indirect-tax, wage-bill, and non-wage components represent this association with the primary
deficit. The association between corporate income taxes (the second-largest revenue component) and
carbon dioxide damage (neg.), fuel/clean technology (pos.), mortality (neg.), undernourishment (neg.),
and poverty (neg.) are favorable. A weak association between indirect taxes (the largest revenue
component) and SDG outcomes suggests their efficient domestic resource mobilization utilization should
be useful.

                  IV.     LINKING FISCAL EPISODES TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

A.     Identifying Fiscal Episodes

Following Alesina and Ardagna (2010) and Alesina and Perotti (1995), we define fiscal episodes using the
significant change in the primary deficit (as a share of GDP) from the previous year. The underlying
assumption is that the unemployment rate remained stable in period t as in period t-1. According to
Blanchard (1993), this approach takes the previous year as the benchmark period (t-1) and estimates the
government expenses and tax revenue in the current year (t), thereby filtering out the variations in fiscal
variables induced by business cycle fluctuations. Subject to data availability, we follow this approach for
simplicity, avoiding the challenges posed by country-specific calculation of potential outputs.

To define the cyclically adjusted variables and episodes of large fiscal impulse:

                                                      14
       ·       Cyclically adjusted Primary expenses (% of GDP) = Cyclically adjusted Transfer + (Wage +
               Non-wage + Subsidies)
       ·       Cyclically adjusted Total tax revenue (% of GDP) = Cyclically adjusted PIT + Cyclically
               adjusted CIT + Other + Cyclically adjusted INDT + Cyclically adjusted SSC
       ·       Cyclically adjusted Primary deficit (% of GDP) = Cyclically adjusted Primary expenses ­
               Cyclically adjusted Total tax revenue
       ·       Fiscal impulset (% of GDP) = Cyclically adjusted Primary deficitt ­ Primary deficitt-1

We correct each of the fiscal variables at period t (denoted as  ) the variations caused by cyclical factors.
For each country in the sample, we first regress each fiscal variable ( ) on a time trend ( ) and
the unemployment rate ( ).

                       = 0 + 1  + 2  +                                                 (1)

Next, we estimate what each fiscal variable would be in period t if the unemployment rate were to
remain the same as in the previous year (-1 ), i.e., the cyclically adjusted fiscal variable.

                       ( -1 ) = 0 + 
                                    1  +  2 -1 +                                       (2)

, where the terms, 0 , 
                       1 , 
                           2 , and  are coefficient estimates.


Having estimated  ( -1 ),  ( -1 ),                                 ( -1 ),              ( -1 ),          and
 ( -1 ), we calculate   ( -1 ),    ( -1 ), and then
  ( -1 ). The Fiscal impulse at period t is the difference between the cyclically
adjusted primary deficit at period t [  ( -1 )] and the actual primary deficit at period
t-1 [ -1 ].

We estimate fiscal impulse using the balanced data of expenses and tax revenue components in each
country: Chile 2000­2018, Poland 1995­2018, South Africa 1996­2018, and Thailand 2000­2018. We
have 81 observations of fiscal impulse in the four sample countries; the mean fiscal impulse is 0.036% of
GDP and a standard deviation of 1.308% of GDP. Appendix Table A1 provides more detailed statistics.
We identify episodes of large fiscal impulse (discretionary fiscal policy): fiscal adjustment and fiscal
stimuli as follows:

       ·       strong fiscal adjustment if Fiscal impulse (% of GDP) is less than - 1.5
       ·       strong fiscal stimuli if Fiscal impulse (% of GDP) is larger than 1.5

                                                     15
Figure 4 plots episodes of large fiscal impulse and GDP growth by country. The identification results in
six episodes of fiscal adjustment and six episodes of fiscal stimuli. The longest episode persisted for 2
years (fiscal stimuli in Poland during 2008­2009 and fiscal adjustment in South Africa during 2005­2006).
Many fiscal stimuli episodes occurred during the 2007­2010 global financial crisis. The time path of GDP
growth suggests some association with the fiscal episodes of stimuli (positive) and adjustment (negative)
in the sample period.

 GDP = gross domestic product.
 Note: Using the cyclically adjusted fiscal aggregates in the analysis, we identify 12 episodes of large fiscal impulses
 (expansions and adjustments), many of which occurred during the global financial crisis in the 1995­2018 sample period.

B.       Fiscal Episodes, Gross Domestic Product Growth, and Development Outcomes

For our baseline estimation, we conduct fixed effects regressions on the four sample countries. First, we
examine the association between GDP growth and large fiscal stimuli/adjustment changes across the
years using the following equations:

                            = 0 + 1  -1 +                                                               (3)

                            = 0 + 1  +1 +                                                               (4)

                            = 0 + 1  -1 +                                                               (5)

                                                                 16
Table 1 reports the estimates of equation (3) in column (1) and equation (4) in column (2), focusing here
on the statistically significant coefficients. 2 We find a positive association between current GDP growth
and lagged fiscal stimuli (column (1)) and between current fiscal stimuli and lead GDP growth (column
(2)). While these findings do not pin down causality, they suggest that GDP growth tends to follow fiscal
stimuli episodes. There is no association between lagged GDP growth and fiscal adjustment (equation
(5)).

Next, we look at the associations of development outcomes, GDP growth, and the interaction between
GDP growth and fiscal impulses (i.e., episodes of fiscal stimuli and adjustment).

We regress equation (6) using both the fiscal stimuli and the fiscal adjustment, one at a time. The total
effect of large fiscal impulses on SDGs are thus (    
                                                  2 + 3    ). Similarly, the total effect of

in regression (6). Having estimated equation (6) on all 17 SDG indicators, Tables 2 and 3 report the
results, focusing on the development outcomes with statistically significant estimates. 3

objectives/persistent issues (i.e., poverty, health, pollution) and the short-term objectives/urgent issues (i.e., disasters). Fiscal
expansions reduced the negative trade-off between GDP growth and some development indicators, e.g., pollution and poor-
health mortalities associating with economic growth. Source: Authors calculation.

    Full estimations for 17 SDGs are in Appendix Tables A3­A4.
                                                                18
From Table 2, the current GDP growth is positively associated with current poverty headcount ratio,
mortality ratio (CVD, cancer, diabetes, CRD for the people aged 30­70), and PM2.5 air pollution. This
finding implies the trade-off between GDP growth and these sustainable development goals in the
country sample. Current fiscal stimuli episodes are positively associated with the current poverty
headcount ratio and PM2.5 air pollution and are negatively associated with the number of newly
displaced people related to disasters. This finding suggests the impacts of fiscal stimuli on sustainable
development goals differ between the long-term/persistent targets (poverty, health, pollution) and the
short-term/pressing issues (disasters). Higher growth associated with the fiscal stimuli is negatively
associated with the mortality rate from poor health conditions. Given the association between current
GDP growth and lagged fiscal stimuli (Table 1), this finding implies that fiscal stimuli help mitigate the
trade-off between GDP growth and some SDG outcomes.

Source: Authors calculation.

From Table 3, the GDP growth rate is positively associated with the poverty headcount ratio and
mortality from CVD, cancer, diabetes, or CRD for the people aged 30­70. However, GDP growth is

                                                            19
negatively correlated with broadband subscriptions. Fiscal adjustment episodes are negatively
associated with the poverty headcount ratio and are positively associated with access to basic sanitation
services and clean fuels and cooking technologies. The association between fiscal adjustment episodes
and poverty headcount ratio declines as GDP grows: the threshold of GDP growth is 5.24%
[12.014/2.294], above which the effect of fiscal adjustment dissipated. The GDP growth coinciding with
fiscal adjustment episodes is negatively associated with access to clean fuels and technologies for
cooking (the GDP growth threshold is 5.96%). It is positively associated with the young population share,
not in education, employment, or training.

We also adjust equation (6) by entering lead (period t+1) and lagged (period t-1) variables of GDP growth,
large fiscal impulses, and the interaction between GDP growth and large fiscal impulses as regressors.
Appendix Tables A5 and A6 report detailed results using lead explanatory variables and Tables A7 and
A8 for lagged variables. The extended results are largely supportive to the baseline findings from
regression (6) for the four sample countries: (i) there is the trade-off between (lagged, current, and lead)
GDP growth rate and the development goals; (ii) the fiscal adjustment (stimuli) episodes are favorable
(unfavorable) to development goals; and (iii) the GDP growth coinciding with fiscal adjustment (stimuli)
episodes deteriorates (improves) the development goals. These findings are not applicable for all SDGs,
however.

C.     Large Fiscal Impulses and Tax-Spending Components

We further test whether fiscal episodes are associated with any components of the fiscal trends by
estimating the following equation of fiscal episode at time t on the fiscal components at time t+1 and t-
1:

               = 0 + 1  ( )+1 +                                                            (7)

               = 0 + 1  ( )-1 +                                                            (8)

We estimate equations (7) and (8) separately for fiscal stimuli and fiscal adjustment episodes. The
independent variables include cyclically adjusted tax (or expense) components as a share of GDP. We
report the significant findings on the tax components' estimates in Table 4 and the expense elements in




                                                    20

not alter the significant findings below. The results are available upon request.

We note that tax components, including personal income tax, corporate income tax, indirect taxes, and
social contributions, are cyclically adjusted but not other direct taxes; all are in GDP percentage.

Columns (1)­(4) in Table 4 show that fiscal stimuli episodes (period t) are negatively associated with lead
and lagged social contributions (periods t+1, t-1), suggesting that the episodes of fiscal stimuli are
associated with trends in the social contributions. Fiscal stimuli episodes are positively associated with
lagged corporate income taxes and negatively associated with lagged other taxes, both of which were
not subject to these tax components' trend.

As an additional test, we aggregate cyclically adjusted direct taxes and re-estimate the equations (7)­
(8). Specifically,

Cyclically adjusted direct tax (% of GDP) = Cyclically adjusted PIT + Cyclically adjusted CIT + Other.

Columns (2) and (4) of Table 4 provide the results, further supporting the negative association between
fiscal stimuli and social contributions. Fiscal stimuli episodes are also positively associated with lagged
direct taxes.

For the fiscal adjustments, we find that they are negatively associated with lagged other direct taxes
(column (5) of Table 4) and lagged social contributions (column (6) of Table 4). Fiscal adjustments are
not associated with any lead tax components.

Table 5 reports the significant estimates of equations (7) and (8) for fiscal adjustment episodes and
expense components. Fiscal stimuli episodes are not associated with any (lead and lagged) expenditure
components. We include four expense components, including wage bills, non-wage bills, subsidies
expenditure, and cyclically adjusted transfer (all as a share of GDP). Columns (1) and (3) of Table 5 show
that fiscal adjustment episodes (period t) are negatively associated with lead transfer expenses (period
t+1) but not with the lagged transfer expense (period t-1). Aggregating government consumption
expenditure:

Government consumption expenditure (% of GDP) = Wage + Non-wage, shown in column (2), we find
that the lead transfer component (period t+1) is still negatively associated with current fiscal adjustment
episodes (period t). Besides, lead government consumption expenditure is negatively associated with
current fiscal adjustment episodes. We also find that current fiscal adjustment episodes (period t) are
positively associated with the lagged expense on wage bills (period t-1), shown in column (3).

We also test whether current tax or expense components (period t) are associated with lagged fiscal
episodes (period t-1) by estimating the following equation:

                ( ) = 0 + 1  -1 +                                                                (9)

As shown in Table 6 column (1), the other direct taxes (period t) are negatively associated with lagged
fiscal stimuli (period t-1); in contrast, wage bills are positively associated with the lagged fiscal stimuli
(column (2)). We also find that cyclically adjusted transfer expense is negatively associated with the
lagged fiscal adjustment (column (3)). Appendix Table A11 provides full estimation results across tax and
expense components.

                                           V.      CONCLUSION

We find stylized patterns on the linkages between large fiscal episodes and sustainable development
outcomes in selected developing countries. The findings suggest that domestic resource mobilization
should consider differences in tax base and expenditure components and their linkages with the
sustainable development outcomes. By focusing on country studies of Chile, Poland, South Africa, and
Thailand, we have gained insights into distinct country challenges. Poland, for instance, benefited
significantly from European Union transfers and the proximity of Germany. This specific circumstance
suggests that Poland's experience is less transferable to other non-European Union countries.

Future studies may consider the case of federal countries controlling for provincial-state heterogeneity,
i.e., provincial states in a federal system in larger states (India, the Philippines, Indonesia, among others.
This approach will require information on the inclusive growth and tax mobilization at the provincial
state level and the transfer of tax revenue and grants between the provincial and the federal levels. The
quality of the data will determine the feasibility and success of such a study. Extensions may incorporate
public debt evolution, examining the paths of fiscal components and development outcomes in times of
fiscal stress vis-à-vis in normal times in the sample countries.
