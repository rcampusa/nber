                                               ABSTRACT



We use the revised estimates of U.S. GNP constructed by Christina Romer (1989) to
assess the time-series properties of U.S. output per capita over the past century. We reject
at conventional significance levels the null that output is a random walk in favor of the
alternative that output is a stationary autoregressive process about a linear deterministic
trend. The difference   between the lack of persistence   of output shocks either before \VWII

or over the entire century, on the one hand, and the strong     signs of persistence of output

shocks   found by Campbell and Mankiw (1987) and by Nelson            and Plosser (1982) for

more recent periods is striking. It suggests to us a Keynesian interpretation of the large

unit root in post-WWII U.S. output: perhaps post-WWII output shocks appear persistent
because automatic stabilizers and other demand-management policies have substantially

damped   the transitory   fluctuations that   made up the pre-WWH Bums-Mitchell business

cycle.

        An important line of macroeconomic research springs from Nelson and Plosser' s (1982) dis-

covery that US GNP possesses a sizeable "unit root." The rejection of the null that GNP was a Sta-
tionary low-order ARMA around a linear trend in favor of the alternative of an integrated process and

stochastic trend was not a surprise: No one believed that the factor supply- and technology-deter-
mined "potential" which GNP attains in booms and falls below in recessions grows at a constant
deterministic rate. In the long run fluctuations in potential growth dominate the sample and lead to

integrated representations.
        What did come as a surprise was the "size" claimed for the unit root in GNP, in the sense of the
large long run impulse response 0 of output to the canonical univailate shock. A Keynesian, seeing

output shocks as a mixture of frequent transitory business cycle fluctuations and rare permanent
accelerations or interruptions of potential growth, would have expected only a small unit root. Yet
Nelson and Plosser estimated 0 to be near to if not greater than one. The stakes in this line of
research are large. Shapiro and Watson (1988) see whether 000 is much less than or near one as
telling if "the data [are].. .closer to the Keynesian view, in which fluctuations are predominantly tran-

sliory, or... closer to the real business cycle view, in which fluctuations are largely the result of per-
manent shocks." Nelson and Plosser believe that their work shows "stochastic variation due to real
factors.. - essential" for any business cycle model. If               is near one there are no transitory fluctua-

tions for business cycle theorist to model.

       Nelson and Plosser (1982) has been followed by a number of related papers some of which try
to establish the Keynesian position that many shocks to output are transitory and that 600—properly

measured—is much less than one. Harvey (1985) argued that low-order ARMA models do not
approximate the long run dynamics of a large class of plausible processes and that Box-Jenkins
identification techniques may be inappropriateJ Watson(1986) and Clark (1987) estimated unob-
served-components models, and Cochrane (1987) constructed non-parametric tests of persistence,
that produced estimates of of 000 below one. Blanchard and Quah (1987) and Shapiro and Watson

(1988) used unemployment as a cofactor to identify a transitory component in output that did not

show up in univariate ARMA models.
      Yet on balance the attempts to upset Lhe conclusions of Nelson and Plosser have been uncon-
vincing. Nelson (1987) argued that unobserved-components models were biased for the reasons that

lead to downward bias in the sum of AR coefficients when the true process is integrated (Fuller
(1976)) and that Watson (1986) and Clark(l987) would find large "transitory" components even if
there were no such in reality. Campbell and Mankiw (l987ab) estimated a range of models and con-
cluded that Nelson and Plosser were if anything conservative: they found a value of O of 1.5 or so
likely. And they argued Lhat Cochiane's statistics (i) led to a high estimate of O over the postwar

period and (ii) were untrustworthy over longer samples because of the excess cyclicality in the data

uncovered by Romer (l9SGab, 1989).
      The prsent state of play seems to be that economists have no difficulty uncovering persistent,

"unit root" components of GM'. By contrast, they have difficulty uncovering transitory business
cycle components. These facts seem to upset Keynesian priors—if most shocks arc transitory
economists should have difficulty identifying the persistent not the transitory component of output.
And if the belief that        near one supports a real business cycle view is justified then such theories

appear at least half right.
       We seek to make two points. First, the ease with which economists detect a "unit root" in GNP

is tied to the focus of attention on the post-WWII period. As a reader of Cochrane (1987) would not
be surprised to learn, considering a longer run of data makes it easier to identify transitory cornpo-

nents even if allowance is made for excess cyclicality in prewar estimates. Second, &ven the large
transitory component of the pre-WWII business cycle, the failure of such components to emerge in
post-WWII data supports not a "real business cycle" but an "old.fashioned Keynesian" view of
macroeconomics. The economy was afflicted by large transitory cycles in the past; it is not afflicted

by such cycles now; a possible inference is that institutions and policies that Keynesians argued
would actually did stabilize the economy.
       The discussion is organized as follows. The first section establishes that examining long output

series makes it harder to uncover persistent and less difficult to uncover transitory components. The
second diseusses the proper interpretation of the Depression and WWII. And the third argues for a

 1. Searching for a Unit Root in GNP
          Anyone assessing the- long mn behavior of the US economy has a menu of GNP series to
choose from; the standard Kuzncts-Kcndrick-Gallman serics (Kuznets (1961), Kendriclc (1961),

Gailman (1966)),' thought by Romer (1989) to overstate cyclical volatility; her suggested alternative;2
and another alternative from Balke and Gordon (1989) which falls between the Romer and the
Kuznets-Kendrick-Gallman series.3 Here we use the Romer series, for it is most hostile to the points
we wish to make. The Romer estimates of GNP divided by population are plotted in figure 1 below,

  None of Kuznets, Kendrick, snd Gslhnsn thought their series a reliable guide to cyclical movements. Their focus of
 attention was long-run growth. Milton Friedman started the pattern of using the series for business cycle research by
 using Kuznets' underlying worksheets for his test of monetary and Keynesian theories of output movements. See
 Fritiman and Mieselrnan (1963).
 2Whieh is likely to be excessively purged or short.run volatility. Romer'a series omits any transitory movements in
 GNP not correlated with contensporaneous commodity production. In the post-WWII period, such movements make up
a quarter of the variance of output around linear bends through Romer's benchmark dates.
        use more indicators than Romer to bsckcsst GNP. The advantage of more information is offset by the fact that
the coefficients of their bactrcasting equation fit our prior beliefs less well.

        The basic sample is the union of the pre-Depression (1889-1929) and post-WWH (1948-87)
periods. Both the 1930-47 Depression/war period, during which output per capita follows a different
law of motion, and the pre-1889 period for which Shaw (1947) lacks confidence in the reliability of
the underlying commodity production data are omitted.t

        Consider, for years since 1889, a test of the null that output per capita is a random walk:

             H&          u=
where   e is a white-noise innovation and where the vilue y of the economy's normal output is not
observed during the Depression/war years 1930-47, against the alternative that output per capita fol-
lows an AR(l) about a linear trend:

             H1:         g yt+py,1e
where t is a white-noise innovation and where the value yt of the economy's normal output is not

observed during the Depression/war years 1930-47. Neither the null nor the alternative can be taken

seriously as a description of the underlyin gprocess. No one believes that output really follows a ran-

dom walk with unchanging drift. And no one believes that the underlying growth of potential on top
of which the business cycle is imposed is linear and deterministic.

        Nevertheless the null and alternative are useful heuristic devices. If the alternative fits the data in

the sense that its estimated residuals exhibit little correlation, and if the data possess sufficient power

to reject the null, then the "permanent" long run component of output is small and is dominated in the

sample by transitory fluctuations that accord with the Keynesian view.

        Performing the simplest possible Diekey-FuLler tests (Fuller (t976)) on the Romer series for
output per eapita does lead to a rejection of the integrated process null:




tlneludtng the 1869-88 period for which annual data exist but are teas reliable does not qualitatively alter the
conclusions. The simple Dickey-Fuller tests still rejeet the random walk null at the Ol tevel. In general, it appesis
that the longer is the U.S. data series the more strongly do the Dickey-Fuller tests speak against the random walk nutl.

Because the sample contains an eighteen-year gap in its middle the test statistic n(p- 1), where p is the

regression coefficient of yt.j, does not have the distribution tabulated by Dickey (Fuller (1976)).
Monte Carlo simulations generated the significance levels reported in the last column of table 1.

         We do not see the proper interpretation of table 1 as that output per capita "is" an AR( I) about a

linear trend. We strongly reject such an inference. We agree that the restrictive parametrizations of
the null and altemaiive—requiring B to be either one or zero but not in between—mask an integrated,

stochastic trend.1 Nevertheless, when given a choice between a stationary AR( I) about a linear trend
and a random walk, the data choose the trend-stationary model. The transitory business cycle corn-

ponént dominates the sample. It is easy to uncover, and the persistent integrated component is hard to

f'tnd.



2. Interpreting the Great Depression
         It would be naive to believe that the 1930-47 period is a realization of the same time-series pro-

cess that generates the surrounding years. The shift in the magnitude of output movements provides
suffident evidence to reject the null of a constant structure. The variance of year-to-year changes in
per capita output over 1930-47 is ten times the variance in the surrounding petiods. Under the main-

tained hypothesis that year-to-year changes are independent and normal, the null of unchanging
structure can be rejected with an asymptotic x2( 1) statistic of 38.

         Since a different law of motion governed output over 1930-47, estimating a single low-order

tSchwert (1987) analyzes spurious rejection of the null of an integrated process (O,.>o) in favor of the stationary
alternative (6O) when moving-average terms are omitted from the integrated specification and the stringent requirement
0,,t is imposed on the null.

univariate process for the entire 1889-1987 period suffers from misspecification and produces coeffi-

cients with no clear interpretation. An incautious economist might, however, ignore the fact that
1930-47 arises from a different structure and test:

              H&        y = y+ u-r
against:
                           =
              I-li:

using the entire 1889-1987 period. As the first line of table 2 reveals, such an economist would find a
tint-order Dickey-Fuller Lest statistic of- 11.7, not significant at even the .2 level, and might conclude

that the long-run data are not inconsistent with the null that almost all output shocks are permanent.

         The 1930-47 pcriod sees fluctuations not only larger hut also more slowly decaying than sur-
rounding periods. 1930-47 fluctuations are certainly transitory—by 1941, before the US had entered

WWII and begun to run large expansionary budget deficits, output per capita is approximately back to
the level one would have forecast in 1929 knowing the 1889-1929 rate of drift. And the wartime
expansion of output was no more permanent: the late I 940's see output per capita once again at the

level one would have forecast in 1929 (Dc Long and Summers (1988)). But although both large
movements in output over 1930-47 were reversed, they took longer to reverse themselves than the
canonical peacetime business cycle did. The coefficient p on lagged output in the first line of table 2

is thus a weighted avenge of the first-order autoregressive coefficients holding during the ordinary
1889-1929 and 1948-87 periods, and the extraordinary 1930-47 period during which fluctuations
decay more slowly. Since fluctuations in 1930-47 are huge, the weight of the anomalous period in
the avenge is high and the joint estimated value of p for the whole 1889-1987 period is relatively

large.
         The eventual return of output approximately to its pre-1929 path suggests that even though the

large 1930-47 fluctuations decay slowly they do decay. Sampling the data at less frequent intervals—

examining the properties of output sampled only every two, every three, or every four years—pro-
vides a natural test of whether the failure in line I of table 2 to reject the random walk null comes from

the misspeeification involved in estimating a single low-order linear model for the entire century. If
output per capita really does follow a random walk, sampling data at less frequent intervals is innocu-

otis. The power of statistical tests against alternatives local to the random walk null is unaffected by
the frequency of sampling, rt

             2(p21 ) z n(p-l)
       The three lower lines of table 2 reveal that sampling the data at less frequent intervals does lead

to rejection of the random walk null. The bottom lines of table 2 are inconsistent with the message
carried by the foist line—that including the Depression and WWII—makes the persistent component

of output more visible. The natural conclusion is that it is not a good idea to impose the same low-
order linear structure to hold forannual data over 1930-47 as over 1889-1929 and l94887.2

3. Interpretation
       As we have argued above, there is little difficulty in detecting a transitory component in GNP
when the lime series is examined in historical perspective. Dickey-Fuller tests with a century of data
at their disposal reject the null that 6=1 in favor of a highly-restricted alternative that 60=0. Specifi-

cation tests do not appear to suggest that the alternative is misspecilied. In light of this, we do not
think that the claim that the canonical output shock is permanent and not transitory—that output fits a

"real business cycle" rather than a aKeesiann description—can be sustained. Anyone in 1929 who

lThs point is made by Shitler and Peron (1955) in the ronteat of tasting efficient-markets modets.
2A natural approach to take to analyze the Depression woutd then be the one advocated by Stock (1987).

projected 1987 output on the basis of the 1889-1929 trcnd would have found herself only 4.5 percent

off; either there have been very few permanent shocks to output in the past sixty years, or the shocks

that there have been have almost miraculously offset one another.
       Given our success at finding a transitory component, the failure of Nelson and Plosser (1982)

and of Campbell and Mankiw (1987ab) to find such a component requires explanation. How can the
stochastic component to trend be (i) hard to find when the sample is a tong period that gives a long
baseline against which to took for stochastic trends and ample room for such trends to compound, and

yet be (ii) easy to find when the sample isa short period that gives a short baseline and little room for
such trends to compound? We suspect that the answe lies in the transformation of the business cycle

after WV/Il. Even according to Romer's data, the pre-Depression period is full of short sharp reces-
sions like 1892-4, 1907-8, 1913-4, and 1920-2- For the most part, the post-WWII period lacks
equivalent sharp transitory contractions. If the magnitude of the transitory component in output has

declined, then the persistent component will become more visible.

           It may be that when Campbell and Marskiw proclaim that absence of transitory dynamics in the

post-WWII period they arc really proclaiming the presence of successful automatic stabilizers. The
post-WWTI FRB and FDIC have together kept the US from experiencing financial panics like those

that occurred on a semi-regular basis before WWII, and the growth of large, progressively-financed
government has played a pan in stabilizing the flow of income to ultimate investors and consumers
(Dc Long and Summers (1986)). And the general awareness that the government will act to prevent
large business cycles may lead to private actions that stabilize spending without explicit intervention

(Baily (1978)). A plausible interpretation of the strong presence of transitory components when long-
run series are examined and the absence of transitory components over the post.WV,TII period is, we

think, an old-fashioned Keynesian one.
        We do not deny that the correct univariate time-series representation for output will possess a
"unit root." We would be incredulous if anyone claimed that long-run potential growth were linear
and deterministic. Moreover, one merely has to glance at output per capita for any of a number of
European nations over the past century to become convinced that the univariate representation of out-

put may have not one but two unit roots (see Maddison (1982)). The approximate constancy of the
rate of growth of potential output is limited to the United States-
        We have presented tests that reject the null that output per capita is a certain very restricted inte-

grated process in favor of an alternative that output per capita follows another tightly-constrained pro-

cess in order to make two points. First, the present debate over whether the long.run impulse
response 0... to a univariate shock is or is not near one could only have arisen in a context that left pre-

WWII data by and large unexamined. Anyone who, following Cochrane (1987), examines the US
business cycle in historical perspective will find it hard to avoid reaching the conclusion that Boo has

been significantly less than one.
        Second, examining US fluctuations in historicai perspective leads to a shift in the interpretation

given to research like that of Campbell and Mankiw. Such studies no longer appear to support theo-

ries that attribute macroeconomic fluctuations in general to permanent shocks. Instead, such studies
spark inquiry into what has reduced the magnitude of recent transitory components of output.
Whether it Is correct to attribute this Suction to Keynesian institutions and polices is an open ques-

tion.
