This note accompanies the Cross-country Historical Adoption of Technology (CHAT) dataset. CHAT
is an unbalanced panel dataset with information on the adoption of over 100 technologies in more
than 150 countries since 1800. The data is available for download at: http://www.nber.org/data/chat
We discuss the main aim of CHAT, its scope and limitations, as well as several ways in which we
have used the data so far and ways to potentially use the data for other research.

The CHAT Dataset




                                      1. INTRODUCTION

There is a wealth of cross‐country data on measures related to national accounts, social indicators,
institutions, etc. One of the stylized facts that come out of the many empirical analyses done with
these data is that most cross‐country differences in standards of living seem due to differences in
Total Factor Productivity, rather than observable inputs.

Because, by nature, TFP is essentially a residual derived from the difference between the level of
output and the contributions of measured inputs, this fact begs the question what factors that are
not included in the TFP calculation underlie these TFP differentials.

The most conventional interpretation of TFP would be that it reflects differences in technologies
used across countries. In addition, there are many other factors, like institutions, climate, policies,
that could also affect relative TFP levels. As for the conventional technology‐centric interpretation,
in order to study what part of cross‐country differentials in productivity levels are due to the
differences in technologies that countries use one would need a dataset that contains information
on the use of many technologies in many countries, as well as, preferably, many years.

The Cross‐country Historical Adoption of Technology (CHAT) dataset that we introduce here is
meant to be such a dataset. It contains information on the diffusion of about 104 technologies in
161 countries during the last 200 years. It extends the data used in Comin and Hobijn (2004) and
Comin, Hobijn, and Rovito (2006).

In the rest of this note we aim to do two things. First, we discuss the goals we strived for in the
collection of CHAT, the scope of the dataset, as well as its limitations. Second, we review some of the
research we have already done with the data and touch on some ideas for future research.


                              2. AIM AND SCOPE OF CHAT

When collecting the data contained in CHAT, we aimed for the following three goals:

    • As long a time series as possible.

    • As large a sample of countries as possible.

    • As many technologies as possible.

                   FREQUENCY OF OBSERVATION AND LENGTH OF SAMPLE
Almost all of our source data is only available at an annual frequency. Because of that and because
our main focus is long‐run economic growth rather than short‐run fluctuations, the dataset uses an
annual frequency of observation. For some of the older technologies, like steamships, data go back
until the early Nineteenth Century. The last year in the sample is 2003. Some data, especially in the
earlier part of the sample, is not available at an annual frequency.

The CHAT Dataset



                                   DEFINITION OF COUNTRIES
Because the CHAT dataset contains data for a very long time period, countries have fragmented and
unified over the sample period. When assembling the data set, we dealt with country
fragmentations and reunification processes in the following way:

   •   When a majority of the territory remained after the fragmentation or a majority of the unified
       territory corresponded to just one of the pre­unification countries we identified the unified
       country with the larger part. In cases of country fragmentation, we identified a successor
       country where a large portion of the territory remained as a single country; in cases of
       unification, we identified a precursor country in a similar manner. For example, Russia and
       the U.S.S.R have been treated as one national entity, as have Germany and West Germany.

   •   In cases where a country divided into or merged from a number of more or less equal pieces,
       we chose to treat the whole and the parts as different countries. Examples of this approach
       include Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Korea.

The resulting sample contains 161 countries.

                                          TECHNOLOGIES
According to Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, technology is

   “a manner of accomplishing a task especially using technical processes, methods, or knowledge”

The technology measures in CHAT capture a similar intuition. They are either: (i) the number of
capital goods specifically related to accomplishing particular tasks, (ii) the amounts of particular
tasks that have been accomplished, (iii) the number of users of a particular manner to accomplish a
task.

These three types of measures are best illustrated with three examples. (i) The number of sail ships
(measured in tonnage) in use in a country; (ii) Metric tons of steel produced using blast‐oxygen
steel furnaces; (iii) the number of households that subscribe to cable tv services.

Throughout the collection of CHAT, our philosophy has been to apply as broad a definition of
technology as possible, allowing the user of the data to decide which (sub‐) sample of technologies
in the data is most appropriate for the specific research question at hand.

The result of this broad interpretation is that the CHAT data set contains information on the
diffusion of 104 technologies. Table 1 lists the technology measures it contains and the source for
each technology.

These technology measures provide a thorough representation of the technologies utilized in eight
major sectors of economic activity (agriculture, finance, health, steel, telecommunications, textiles,
tourism, and transportation). These range from 2 technologies in tourism to 44 in healthcare. Table
2 presents the number of technologies covered by the CHAT data set in each of the eight sectors and
specifies the technology measures that pertain to each sector.

In addition, CHAT also contains information on three, what are commonly considered, general
purpose technologies that cannot be categorized by sector. These three technologies are electricity
production, the number of computers, and the number of internet users.

The CHAT Dataset



For a majority of the variables, CHAT contains the original source data and therefore the data in
CHAT are as comparable across countries and over time as in the original source. In certain
instances the definition of the variable1 changes in the original source data or because we merge
different data sources. In those cases we have applied a merging method that makes the whole
series consistent with the most recent definition of the variable and backward extrapolates that
time series using the pre‐redefinition data.

Beyond technology measures, CHAT also contains information on a few non‐technological variables
such as GDP, enrollment at different education levels and population.


                                        USE OF CHAT DATA

Broadly speaking, measures of individual technologies fall into two categories: extensive and
intensive. Extensive measures of technology adoption capture the fraction of potential adopters
that have adopted a given technology. One example is the fraction of farmers that have adopted
hybrid corn in Griliches’ (1957) classic study. 2 Alternately, intensive measures of technology
adoption capture the number of units of the new technology that each adopter uses. One example is
the number of personal computers per capita. This measure both captures the fraction of
population that uses personal computers as well as the average number of personal computers they
use.

The CHAT data set contains both extensive and intensive measures of technology adoption.

Extensive measures of technology are intuitive and easy to interpret. However, they have three
significant drawbacks. First, they require an assessment of who is in the set of initial adopters. This
might actually vary over time; For example when the use and penetration of the technology lead to
subsequent improvements in the technology which may extend the size of the potential adopters.

Second, they ignore the intensive margin, i.e. the equivalent of capital deepening, variations in
which can be important to understand economic outcomes. For instance, Clark (1987) showed that
the measure explaining the margin of cross‐country variations in labor productivity in the textile
industry was the number of spindles operated per spinner.

Finally, a key drawback of traditional extensive measures is that they are hard to compute because
they require micro data. As a result, 50 years after Griliches (1957) information on the adoption of
technologies is minimal and available for only a few countries for a finite number of years.

CHAT uses two types of intensive measures of technology adoption. These consist in counting
either how many units of capital embodying the technology there are in the economy (i.e. number


1 An example would be the number of steam and sail ships in Denmark. Until 1831 the series excludes ferries

and fishing vessels while after 1831 these vessels are included. For 1831 we have both the number of ships
under both definitions. We use this information to construct a proxy pre‐1831 variable that includes ferries
and fishing ships.

of cell phones) or how many units of a given output have been produced with the technology (i.e.
tons of Bessemer steel produced).

Intensive measures of technology adoption do not suffer from the three drawbacks of extensive
technology measures but they are not perfect either. By definition they also capture how many
units of technology each adopter has adopted in addition to the extensive margin of adoption. To
compute them we do not need to define who is a potential adopter nor do we need micro data. The
drawback of intensive measures of technology adoption is that they can be difficult to interpret.

One possibility is to construct a model with implications for the measures of technology for which
data is available. Then it is possible to estimate structurally the model to obtain information on the
desired parameters. We have taken this approach in Comin and Hobijn (2008) where the curvature
of intensive measures of technology adoption at a given moment depends on the lag with which
these technologies are adopted in the country. This prediction allows us to estimate a (constant)
adoption lag per technology and country.

However, many researchers would like to have technology measures that can be interpreted easily
without the need of a structural model. In Comin and Hobijn (2009) we propose one approach to do
that which consists of the following steps. First, the intensive technology measure is scaled by
population. Then the variable is log transformed to remove the units from the technology measures
and make them more comparable across technologies. Finally, in the regression stage, a full set of
technology‐year dummies is included to remove the average diffusion path for a technology across
countries. This approach basically captures factors such as externalities, sunk costs, etc that affect
the frictionless diffusion path in different ways. 3 Note that this is possible only because CHAT is a
three‐dimensional data set (i.e. time, country and technology).

A different way to transform the intensive technology measures consists of taking a given country
(e.g. the US) as benchmark and measuring how many years behind (or ahead) the US a given is
country in adopting the technology. This approach is utilized by Comin, Hobijn and Rovito (2008).
Specifically, the usage lag of technology x in country c at year t is defined as the answer to the
following question: How many years before year t did the United States last have a usage intensity
of technology x that country c has in year t? One advantage of these time lags is that, naturally, they
are expressed in the same unit (i.e. years) for all technologies.

Finally, there is one important practical consideration to bear in mind when using CHAT to explore
the diffusion process of technologies. Authors that have this goal should be aware that since
technologies typically become dominated at some point in time, CHAT contains information also of
the phase where technologies are substituted. To explore the diffusion phase, it may be desirable to
censor the time series at the point when the technology becomes obsolete or dominated. There are
different approaches that can be followed to do that:


3 Comin and Hobijn (2009) use this approach to estimate the effects of lobbies on technology
adoption. Additionally, Comin and Nanda (2009) use the same method to estimate the effect of
financial market development on technology diffusion.

a. Use information on the invention date of the new technology to censor the data for the dominated
technology. This approach however may not be optimal given that technologies, especially those
that are antiquated, are adopted with very long lags in developing countries.

b. Observe when the distribution of technology across countries becomes stable (i.e. reaches a state
that resembles a balanced growth path). Like the first approach, this may be hard to do when the
study includes both developing and developed economies.

c. Use a different censoring year per technology and country which corresponds to the year when
the technology reaches the maximum adoption level in the country.


                                         CONCLUSION

We hope that this public‐use version of CHAT will contribute to furthering our understanding of
how the diffusion of technologies has contributed and still contributes to the standards of living in
different parts over the world.
