                                         ABSTRACT

We designed and fielded a survey of New York and Pennsylvania firms to study the impacts of
New York's 2018 Paid Family Leave policy on employer outcomes. We match each NY firm to a
comparable PA firm and use difference-in-difference models to analyze within-match-pair
changes in outcomes. We find that PFL leads to an improvement in employers' rating of their
ease of handling long employee absences, concentrated in the first policy year and among firms
with 50-99 employees. We also find an increase in employee leave-taking in the second policy
year, driven by smaller firms.

1         Introduction
The vast majority of Americans are supportive of Paid Family Leave (PFL), a policy that
provides workers with paid time off while they care for newborn children or seriously ill
family members.1 Yet the United States remains the only high-income country without a
national PFL policy, and only eight states and Washington, D.C., have implemented or passed
PFL legislation. Although the economic and health benefits of PFL for workers and their
families have been documented in an expansive literature (see Olivetti and Petrongolo, 2017;
Rossin-Slater, 2018; Rossin-Slater and Uniat, 2019; Rossin-Slater and Stearns, 2020 for some
overviews), the lack of policy action in the U.S. partially reflects concerns about the potential
costs of PFL, especially on employers. While most federal PFL proposals--and nearly all
current state-level policies--use employee payroll taxes as financing mechanisms, employers
may face other costs associated with having to manage their workers' absences, and these
costs may be especially burdensome for small firms.
        Thus, evidence on the impacts of PFL on employers is necessary to inform the policy de-
bate, but this research has been severely limited. Existing survey and administrative data
sets do not contain information about employers' experiences with managing employee ab-
sences, which are key to understanding the potential costs that PFL may impose on firms.2
In this paper, we collect our own survey data on these issues and use a natural experiment
research design to provide some of the first evidence on the causal impacts of PFL on employer
outcomes, focusing specifically on employers' assessments of absence-related challenges.
        We study the introduction of New York's PFL policy, which was the fourth state-level PFL
policy implemented in the U.S. (following California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island), taking
effect in January 2018. We designed and fielded a survey over the years 2016 to 2019, using

      Recent studies using administrative data from California and Rhode Island have examined the impacts
of paid leave policies in these two states on a range of outcomes of the workers and their families (Bana et
al., 2020; Campbell et al., 2017). Another study using California administrative data shows that firms play
an important role in determining the take-up of leave benefits, but does not shed light on the impacts of the
program on employer outcomes (Bana et al., 2018). Related, Kamal et al. (2020) use data from the U.S.
Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) and analyze the impact of a negative
labor demand shock on employee composition for firms that are and are not covered by the provisions of the
federal Family and Medical Leave Act.


                                                   1
a representative sample of firms with 10 to 99 employees in New York and Pennsylvania, a
neighboring state without a PFL policy. Our survey asked employers to rate their employees'
performance, as well as the ease of coordinating work schedules and handling employee ab-
sences of various durations. We also gathered data on the incidence of employee leave-taking
for purposes of caring for newborn children or family members with serious illness; on the rates
of employee quits and absences without advance notice during the past year; on the share of
employees who are female and who work part-time; and on New York employers' attitudes
toward the PFL policy.
   To estimate policy impacts on employer outcomes, we match each NY firm to a comparable
PA firm using the following characteristics: industry sector, location in a metro area, firm
size, county unemployment rate, and the county average weekly wage. Then, we estimate
difference-in-differences and event-study models to compare changes in outcomes in NY firms
from before to after the policy was implemented, relative to the changes in outcomes in PA
firms over the same period. Our specifications include match-pair-by-year fixed effects, so we
obtain within-match-pair differences in outcome changes, controlling flexibly for match-pair-
specific trends.
   Our results show that, in the first year of New York's PFL policy, there is a 0.29 standard
deviation (SD) increase in employers' rating of their ease of handling workers' absences longer
than four weeks in duration, and a 0.33 SD increase in their rating of their ease of handling
absences two to four weeks long. These effects are short-lived and mostly dissipate by the
second policy year.
   We also observe that, in the second year of the policy, there is a 20.8 percentage point (53.3
percent relative to the pre-policy mean) increase in the incidence of employee leave-taking.
This impact reflects increases in both female and male employees taking parental leaves,
as well as male employees taking leaves to care for severely ill family members. Additional
analyses suggest that the improvements in employers' ability to handle long employee absences
materialize among larger firms with 50 or more workers, while the increases in employee leave-
taking take place in firms with 10 to 49 workers. The latter finding is consistent with employers
with fewer than 50 workers not being covered by the federal Family and Medical Leave Act,
which provides 12 weeks of job-protected unpaid leave. Thus, for firms with fewer than 50


                                               2
employees--which constitute about half of the employers in our study--New York's PFL
program provides the first experience of employees being able to use government-provided
job-protected leave.3
       Further, we analyze employer ratings of employee performance in terms of attendance,
commitment, cooperation, productivity, and teamwork, finding no significant impacts on these
outcomes. We note, however, that average employer ratings on these dimensions are already
high in the years before the law, suggesting minimal scope for additional improvements in
them. That said, we also do not find evidence of any adverse effects on these outcomes. We
also find no significant changes in the share of employees who quit or are absent without
advance notice, or who are female or employed part-time. These results suggest that our
estimated impacts on employers are not driven by changes in employee composition.
       Lastly, we examine trends in NY employers' attitudes toward the PFL policy. We document
that more than 50 percent of all NY firms are either very or somewhat supportive of the policy,
in all survey years. At the same time, a small share of firms is opposed to the law, and this
share has grown over time.
       Our paper contributes to a small set of studies that have analyzed employers in the context
of PFL. Eileen Appelbaum and Ruth Milkman pioneered the research on employers with a
survey of 250 California firms, which was conducted four to five years after California's first-in-
the-nation PFL program was implemented. A central finding from this work is that 90 percent
of California employers reported that the PFL policy had either a positive or a neutral effect
on employee productivity, morale, and costs (Milkman and Appelbaum, 2013; Appelbaum and
Milkman, 2011). Another study of 18 employers in New Jersey indicates that businesses do not
report adverse impacts of NJ's second-in-the-nation PFL program on profitability or employee
productivity (Lerner et al., 2014). Most recently, Goodman et al. (2020) examine the impacts
of San Francisco's Paid Parental Leave Ordinance, which was implemented in 2017 and is
the first U.S. policy that mandates that employers provide fully paid leave to workers.4 The
authors surveyed employers in San Francisco and surrounding Bay Area counties in 2018, and
   3
      As we note in Section 2, New York has a Temporary Disability Insurance program, which provides 6
to 8 weeks of partially paid leave to birthing mothers for the purposes of preparing for and recovering from
childbirth. However, this leave is not job protected and the maximum wage payment received during the leave
is low.
    4
      Specifically, the ordinance requires that employers in San Francisco supplement the state-level PFL policy
by providing workers with 100% wage replacement during leave.

                                                       3
show that employers report minimal negative impacts and high support for the policy. While
these studies break new ground in collecting data on employer outcomes, they are limited
by a lack of baseline data on pre-PFL outcomes, do not have control groups that can be
followed over time, and do not use representative samples of firms.5 As mentioned, our survey
indicates that employers have high ratings on these types of outcomes even in the years before
the policy, suggesting limited scope of measurable improvements along these dimensions, and
that pre-PFL data is essential for assessing the impacts that can be attributed to the policy.
        Lastly, four recent studies using administrative data from Europe have analyzed the im-
pacts of employee leave-taking on outcomes among employers. Brenøe et al. (2020) use Danish
data, and find no impacts of a female employee taking parental leave on firm output, prof-
itability, or survival. By contrast, Gallen (2019) indicates that a Danish reform that expanded
fully-compensated parental leave by 22 weeks did have a negative effect on firm survival and
the retention of mothers. Ginja et al. (2020) study a parental leave expansion in Sweden, and
demonstrate that firms respond to this reform by hiring additional workers and increasing
incumbent workers' hours, and thus incur additional wage costs. Huebener et al. (2020) ana-
lyze a German parental leave reform, and find impacts on firms' subsequent hiring decisions.
However, the dramatic differences in statutory leave duration, labor market characteristics,
and broader policy environments between these European countries and the United States
make it challenging to infer lessons from this evidence for the U.S. setting.



2         New York's Paid Family Leave Act
Before 2018, some workers in New York had access to government-provided job-protected
unpaid leave through the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993, which covers
workers who meet various eligibility requirements, such as working at an employer with 50
or more employees. In addition, since the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act, birth mothers
have been eligible for approximately 6 to 8 weeks of partially paid disability leave under NY's
    5
    Bartel et al. (2016) analyze the impact of Rhode Island's third-in-the-nation PFL program on employers
with a survey of small and medium-sized food services and manufacturing businesses in Rhode Island, Con-
necticut, and Massachusetts. They collected data both before and after the program went into effect, and
report no statistically significant impacts on a wide range of outcomes. However, small sample sizes generate
concerns for statistical power, and limit the conclusions that could be drawn from this analysis.



                                                     4
Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) program to prepare for and recover from childbirth.
TDI provides a wage replacement rate of 50 percent of the average weekly wage for the last
eight weeks worked, but only up to a current (as of 2021) maximum benefit of $170 per week,
and the leave is not job protected.6
        In January 2018, New York state implemented the Paid Family Leave Act (PFLA), thus
becoming the fourth state to provide job-protected paid leave for new parents and employees
caring for a severely ill family member. The program covers all private sector workers and has
been implemented gradually over 2018 to 2021. In 2018, workers were able to claim 8 weeks
of leave with a wage replacement rate equal to 50 percent of the employee's average weekly
wage (AWW), up to a maximum benefit set at 50 percent of the state-level AWW. In 2019
and 2020, workers could claim leave for 10 weeks, with wage replacement rates of 55 and 60
percent of their AWW, up to 55 and 60 percent of the state AWW, respectively. In 2021,
the fully phased-in policy provides 12 weeks of leave, with 67 percent of the worker's AWW
replaced, up to 67 percent of the state AWW (corresponding to a $971.61 maximum weekly
benefit). Similar to many other state-level PFL programs, New York's program is funded
through a payroll tax on employees.7



3         Data
We surveyed a representative sample of firms with 10 to 99 employees in NY and PA in each
fall (September to December) of 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019.8 The survey was approved by
the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Columbia University and conducted by the Office
for Survey Research (OSR) at Michigan State University (whose IRB also approved). We
identified employers in each state using data from Survey Sampling Inc., and drew random
samples within three firm size and 16 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)
code categories. Thus, within each state, approximately one third of the surveyed employers
have 10 to 19 employees, a third have 20 to 49 employees, and a third have 50 to 99 employees.
        The initial contact with employers was made by mail, with follow-ups conducted by mail,
    6
    Women who experience childbirth complications are eligible for longer leaves, with doctor certification.
The maximum amount of leave under the TDI program is 26 weeks.

    We also surveyed firms in New Jersey but do not use them in this analysis for reasons discussed below.


                                                     5
e-mail, and phone. The survey was intended to be completed by either the owner or manager of
each firm, who is knowledgeable about employee performance, the ease of managing employee
absences, as well as employee composition and the incidence of employee leave-taking.
       In the first survey year (2016), we had a response rate of 46 percent in both states, resulting
in a sample of 1,207 firms from each state. In Year 2 (2017), we attempted to re-survey as
many firms as possible from the preceding year. We obtained responses from 1,599 of these
firms, and recruited 820 new firms to generate a total of 2,419 firms (1,215 from NY and 1,204
from PA). We repeated this process in subsequent years, generating a final sample of 4,573
unique firms that participated in the survey in at least one year.
       The survey questionnaire covered multiple domains. First, we obtained data on firm size
and employee characteristics, including the share of female employees and the share of em-
ployees who work part-time. We also obtained information on the share of employees who quit
in the last 12 months and who had been absent without providing notice or with less than 24
hours of notice in the prior month.9 Second, we asked employers to rate employees' perfor-
mance on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 1 representing "very poor" and 10 representing "excellent")
along the following dimensions: attendance, commitment to the job, cooperativeness to get
the job done, productivity, and teamwork. Third, we asked employers to rate their ability to
coordinate work schedules and deal with employee absences of various durations (less than two
weeks, two to four weeks, and more than four weeks) on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 1 representing
"very difficult" and 10 representing "very easy"). Fourth, we asked whether employers had
any employee who took time off work in the past year because they had or adopted a child,
or had a family member with a serious illness. We also inquired about the employee's gender
and the reason for leave (i.e., parental or serious family illness). Fifth, we asked employers in
NY to rate their view of the law on a scale of 1 to 5 (with 1 representing "very supportive"
and 5 representing "very opposed").
       As noted previously, Pennsylvania, which has a lengthy border with NY and has never
had a PFL law, serves as a "never treated" control state. We also collected data from another
   9
    We asked employers to report the number of employees who are currently on payroll, including full-time,
part-time, and temporary workers. We also asked them about the number of employees who are female, the
number of employees who work part-time (35 hours or less), the number of employees who voluntarily left the
firm in the past year, and the number of employees who were absent without notice or with less than 24 hours
notice in the past month. We used these variables to calculate the shares.



                                                     6
neighboring state, New Jersey, which we hoped could serve as an "always treated" control state,
since it has had a PFL program since 2009. However, in the middle of our data collection,
New Jersey substantially expanded its PFL program, making it an unsuitable control state.10


Outcomes. To study employer ratings of employee performance and the ease of coordinating
schedules and dealing with absences, we generate standardized z -scores by subtracting the
analysis sample mean and dividing by the sample standard deviation. Thus, coefficients in
regressions that use these outcomes as dependent variables can be interpreted in SD units.
      We also create five indicator variables capturing employee leave-taking. These include
binary variables set to 1 for employers who report that any employee has taken any leave for
any family-related reason in the past year, and 0 otherwise, as well as separate indicators for
employers who report having at least one: female employee take parental leave; male employee
take parental leave; female employee take leave to care for a seriously ill family member; and
male employee take leave to care for a seriously ill family member.
      We study changes in employee composition by using as outcomes the shares of workers
who quit in the past year, who were absent without advance notice in the past month, who
are female, and who work part-time.
      Finally, we analyze how New York employers' views toward the policy have changed over
time. This question was not asked among Pennsylvania firms, since they did not have a PFL
program in place in any year, precluding us from comparing trends across states.



4       Empirical Analysis
Our goal is to estimate the causal effect of the NY PFL policy on employer outcomes. We
use a difference-in-differences (DD) strategy, comparing the change in outcomes of NY firms
to the change in outcomes of PA firms, from before to after the policy went into effect. The
DD approach relies on the standard assumption that outcomes in the treatment and control
states would have followed parallel trends in the absence of program implementation. Since
we only have two pre-policy years of data (2016 and 2017), we are limited in our ability
 10
   New Jersey elected a new Democratic governor in 2018, who had promised to expand the PFL program.
The expansion was signed into law in 2019.



                                                 7
to comprehensively assess the validity of this assumption by analyzing long pre-treatment
trends; however, we do examine changes in outcomes between these two years to obtain some
indication of whether such trends exist.
       We augment the standard DD methodology by first matching each NY firm to a compa-
rable PA firm, using a nearest-neighbor algorithm, which makes an exact match on industry
sector (one of 16 categories) and an indicator for whether the firm is located in a metro area
based on the 2013 Rural-Urban Continuum Code.11 Then, we conduct a "fuzzy" match (with
replacement) using the following variables: number of employees in the firm in the first year
available in the data, the 2016 county unemployment rate, and the 2016 county average weekly
wage.12 This process yields a sample consisting of a total of 2,364 matched pairs of firms (2,364
NY firms and their 682 PA matches).
       Appendix Table A1 reports the means of county-level characteristics used in the matching
process. We report the means for all NY and PA firms in the first two columns, and in the
NY and PA firms in the matched pair sample in the following two columns. We also report
the difference in means of these variables between firms in NY and PA before the match,
along with the mean within-match-pair difference after the match. The table shows that the
magnitudes of the differences in these variables decline after matching, indicating that the
matched firms from PA more closely resemble firms in NY than when using the full sample of
PA firms.
       After constructing our matched pair sample, we estimate DD and event-study models that
include match-pair×year fixed effects. These models compare changes in the outcomes of NY
firms to changes in the outcomes of PA firms within each matched pair. Our DD model takes
the following form:


                Yipst = 0 + 1 N Ys + 2 P ostt + 3 N Ys × P ostt +  Xi + pt +        ipst          (1)

for each firm i in matched pair p in state s observed in year t. N Ys is an indicator for firms
located in New York, and P ostt is an indicator set to 1 in the post-implementation years (2018
and 2019). Xi is a vector of baseline firm-level control variables measured in the first year

     County-level characteristics are obtained from the 2016 Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages.

the firm is observed in the survey that includes the number of employees, the proportion of
employees who: work part-time, are female, have worked for the firm for more than one year,
quit in the past 12 months, and were absent without advanced notice in the past month.13
pt are interactions between matched pair and survey year fixed effects, allowing us to make
comparisons of changes in outcomes within matched pairs of firms. The key coefficient of
interest is 3 , which measures the impact of the NY PFL program on the outcome of interest,
relative to the change in the matched PA firm over the same time period.
       We also estimate event-study models, which replace the single P ostt indicator in equation
(1) with indicators for each survey year (while keeping all of the other variables the same). The
interactions between the N Ys indicator and the survey year indicators in these event-study
models allow us to examine differential trends in outcomes in NY relative to PA firms, both
before and after the law. We omit the 2016×NY interaction term, so the other coefficients
measure differential trends relative to the first survey year.
       Lastly, since we analyze a large set of outcomes, we address concerns with multiple hy-
pothesis testing by using the Romano-Wolf correction. We report the Romano-Wolf p-value
associated with our key coefficients of interest for each outcome.14


Descriptive statistics. Appendix Table A2 reports the means of our key variables in our
sample of matched pairs of firms, separately for PA and NY firms, before and after the policy.
There are several take-aways from this table. First, average employer ratings of employee
performance are consistently high in both states and in all years. In particular, across all
five dimensions, and for firms in all categories (PA, NY, pre- and post-policy), the mean
rating is higher than 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. This suggests that there is not much scope for
improvements to be measured along these dimensions. It is noteworthy that high ratings are
observed in both the pre-policy years and in PA, which does not have a PFL policy, suggesting
that high ratings on these variables are unlikely to be attributed to the PFL policy.

     We exclude these firm-level baseline controls when analyzing employee characteristics (share of employees
who: are female, work part-time, quit in the past year, and were absent without notice in the past month) as
outcomes. We also find that our results for other outcomes are similar if we exclude these controls (results
available upon request).

     The Romano-Wolf correction controls for the familywise error rate, which is the probability of rejecting
at least one true null hypothesis among a family of hypotheses under a test. We treat each set of outcomes in
each table panel as a family. See Romano and Wolf (2005a), Romano and Wolf (2005b), Romano et al. (2010),

    Second, employer ratings of the ease of coordinating work schedules and dealing with
worker absences are considerably lower. Absences longer than four weeks (and to a lesser
extent those between two and four weeks) appear to present particular challenges for many
employers. Third, we observe no large changes in employee composition, quit rates, or rates of
absences without advance notice in either NY or PA firms. Fourth, although the incidence of
leave-taking increases over time in both states, the magnitude of the increase is larger among
NY firms.



5     Results
Table 1 reports results on the impacts of the NY PFL policy on employer ratings of employee
performance. Panel A presents the estimates of the 3 coefficients from equation (1), while
estimates of the coefficients from the event-study models are in Panel B. As noted above,
in addition to reporting heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors, we also display Romano-
Wolf p-values that adjust for multiple hypothesis testing. We find no statistically significant
impacts on any of the five dimensions of employer ratings of employee performance.
    Table 2 presents the analogous results for employer ratings of the ease of coordinating work
schedules and dealing with employee absences of different durations. Panel A, which presents
results from our DD models, shows that the NY PFL policy leads to a 0.25 SD increase in
employers' assessment of the ease of dealing with employee absences longer than 4 weeks. This
result is marginally significant when adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing. The event-study
estimates in Panel B indicate that there are no pre-trends in these outcomes, and that the
positive impacts are large and statistically significant in the first year after implementation,
becoming insignificant in the second year. Specifically, in the first year of the policy, PFL is
estimated to reduce the difficulty of dealing with absences of 4 weeks or more by 0.29 SD and
of dealing with absences 2­4 weeks long by 0.33 SD. There is also some suggestive evidence
of an improvement in the ease of coordinating work schedules in the first year, but we note
that this result is not robust to multiple hypothesis adjustments, and may in part reflect
the continuation of a pre-policy trend (i.e., the coefficient on the interaction term between
NY and 2017, the year immediately before the policy, is also fairly large and positive, albeit


                                               10
insignificant).
   Next, we analyze employee leave-taking variables in Table 3. While none of the coefficients
is statistically significant in the DD models in Panel A, we do find that the effects on leave-
taking materialize in the second year of the policy in the event-study models in Panel B.
Specifically, we find a 20.8 percentage point (53.3 percent at the pre-policy mean) increase
in the likelihood of any employee using any leave in the second year post-law. We also find
11.6, 8.8, and 10.3 percentage point (73.4, 68.6, and 128.8 percent) increases in the likelihoods
of female employees taking parental leave, male employees taking parental leave, and male
employees using leave to care for ill family members.
   In Table 4, we check whether the effects on employers' ratings of the ease of dealing with
employee absences are heterogeneous across firms with and without any recent experience
with workers taking leave by including an interaction with the indicator for whether a firm
has any employee taking any leave in the past 12 months. While the results are not statistically
significant once we account for multiple hypothesis testing, the large positive coefficients on
the interaction terms are consistent with the improvement in the ease of dealing with employee
absences being concentrated among firms that have had at least one employee take leave.
   Lastly, Appendix Table A3 reports the results for the employee attribute outcomes from
our DD and event-study models. We do not see any statistically significant impacts on any
of these outcomes. These results suggest that the previously discussed findings on employer
experiences with dealing with worker absences and on employee leave-taking rates are not
driven by changes in firm composition.
   We explore heterogeneity in our findings by firm size in Appendix Tables A4 through
A6. We split our sample into larger firms with 50 or more employees and smaller firms with
10 to 49 employees, reflecting FMLA eligibility for the former but not the latter sub-group.
Interestingly, the impacts on the ease of dealing with long worker absences appear to be driven
entirely by the larger firms, while the increase in employee leave-taking occurs exclusively
among the smaller firms. Thus, it seems that New York's PFL policy helps larger firms--in
which employees do not change their leave-taking behavior since they likely previously had
access to some type of leave either through the FMLA or through the firm's benefits package--
handle long leaves, at least in the first program year. For smaller firms, any improvement in


                                               11
the ease of handling absences may be outweighed by the fact that there are significantly more
workers taking leaves once the law has been in effect for some time.


5.1      Employer Attitudes Toward Paid Family Leave

Our findings suggest that New York's PFL policy has imposed minimal costs on employers.
If anything, employers are finding it easier to deal with lengthy employee absences, at least
in the first year of the policy. At the same time, employees in small firms, many of whom
previously did not have access to any job-protected leave, are more likely to take leave once
the policy is in effect, potentially raising new challenges for employers.
      How have employers' views about the policy evolved over the four study years? In Figure
1, we present the proportion of NY firms in our sample that report each level of support or
opposition (on a scale of one to five) in each year of the survey. There are two main takeaways
from this graph. First, the majority of firms are either very or somewhat supportive of the
policy, across all survey years. Second, the share of firms very opposed to the law, while very
small, has also grown over time--from 4.1 percent of firms in 2016, to about 9.5 percent in
2019. Additional analyses suggest that being very opposed, although still rare, is somewhat
more pronounced among smaller employers, for whom we also do not find any improvements
in the ease of handling long employee absences. It remains to be seen how views about NY
PFL will continue to evolve in future years, once the policy is fully implemented and employers
have had time to get accustomed to it.



6       Discussion
Opposition to government-provided paid family leave in the United States largely rests on an
argument that this policy will impose large burdens on businesses. Accordingly, business com-
munity leaders, trade groups such as the National Federation of Independent Business, and
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have repeatedly expressed concerns with proposed PFL leg-
islation.15 However, empirical evidence supporting these arguments has been lacking, largely

due to data constraints. To date, we have known very little about how employers navigate
employee absences, and this information is critical for assessing the potential costs of PFL on
firms.
   In this paper, we bring new data and empirical analysis to inform this discussion. We study
New York's PFL program, which went into effect in 2018, and analyze outcomes among firms
with 10--99 employees, using a survey that we conducted over a four-year period from 2016 to
2019. We match each NY firm with a PA firm on observable characteristics, and then estimate
difference-in-differences models within matched pairs to compare changes in outcomes in NY
firms from before to after the policy was implemented relative to changes in similar firms in
PA during the same time period.
   Our analysis generates several key findings. First, we observe high employer ratings of em-
ployee performance along dimensions like attendance, commitment, cooperation, productivity,
and teamwork, even prior to the implementation of PFL in New York and in Pennsylvania,
which does not have a PFL policy. This evidence implies limited scope for measurable im-
provements on these variables that can be attributed to the availability of PFL. That said, we
note that we find no evidence of adverse effects on these outcomes, either.
   Second, employer ratings of their ability to deal with employee absences are considerably
lower on average. Thus, it is notable that the NY PFL program significantly increases em-
ployers' ratings for these outcomes, especially with regard to managing lengthy absences of
four weeks or longer. However, the improvements appear to be short-lived, and dissipate in
the second year following policy implementation.
   Third, we find a large increase in the incidence of employee leave-taking in the second year
post-policy, concentrated among firms whose employees were previously not eligible for FMLA
leave. Fourth, we do not observe any changes in the shares of female or part-time workers,
quit rates, or the rates of absences without advance notice, suggesting that the significant
impacts on employers' ease of dealing with absences and employee leave-taking are not driven
by changes in employee composition.
   Fifth, the majority of New York firms in our data are supportive of the PFL policy, both
before and after it is implemented. At the same time, a small share is very opposed, and this
fraction grows over our study period, particularly among the smallest employers.


                                              13
      While our study delivers some of the first estimates of the causal impacts of PFL on
employer outcomes, important questions remain. As noted above, the New York program
gradually expanded in generosity through 2021, and more research is needed to shed light
on how changes in program parameters influence employers. More generally, our data reflect
a phase-in period when employers (and employees) were still learning about the program.
Qualitative comments from firms in our study indicate that some of them lacked adequate
understanding of program details, a problem likely more significant for smaller firms who may
not have access to professional human resources staff and support. More follow-up, especially
with the smallest firms in our sample, may be necessary to understand how employers learn
about and implement state-level PFL programs. In addition, while our findings suggest largely
positive overall PFL effects on employers, over the period we examine, they also raise the
possibility of less favorable trends along some dimensions in the longer-run effects of PFL
programs on employers.
      It is also important to note that in 2017, the year before NY PFL went into effect, New York
state initiated a gradual minimum wage policy targeting a $15 minimum wage, with the exact
schedule varying by region and firm size.16 This policy may have also influenced employer
outcomes, although it is unlikely to have had a direct impact on their ease of managing
employee absences. That said, the initiation of the minimum wage policy may help explain
some of the "pre-trend" coefficients for employer ratings of employee performance.
      Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted business operations and un-
derscored the urgent need for paid leave for workers who get sick, must take care of ill family
members, or lack childcare due to closures of schools and daycares. Our most recent follow-
up survey from fall 2020 will provide more evidence on the implications of New York's PFL
program for businesses during COVID-19.
      Finally, our pre-PFL period only includes two years of data collection, which limits our
ability to comprehensively assess outcome pre-trends. As a growing number of states are
planning to implement PFL programs in the coming years, researchers may consider collecting
baseline data from other states for future analyses of PFL impacts on employer outcomes.

reports the difference between mean characteristics in NY and PA firms before the match. The last column ("Post-Match
Diff.") provides the mean within-matched-pair difference. County-level characteristics are from the 2016 Quarterly Census
of Employment and Wages. Firms are also matched on exact NAICS industry code and an indicator for whether the firm
is in a metro area.

employer ratings of employee performance, while Panel B presents employer rat-
ings of the ease of coordination and of handling employee absences, on a scale of 1
to 10, with 1 being the most negative rating and 10 being the most positive rating.
Panel C provides the proportion of firms with at least one employee using leave by
gender and type of leave. Panel D provides the proportion of employees in a firm
by attribute.
