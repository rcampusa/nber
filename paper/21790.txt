                                             ABSTRACT

The FDA is considering using its regulatory authority over the tobacco industry to promote public
health by restricting the advertising of menthol cigarettes. In this paper we contribute new empirical
evidence on the effects of magazine advertisements for menthol cigarettes on cigarette demand. Unlike
previous research on cigarette advertising and demand, we use individual-level data and a measure
of advertising exposure based on each consumer’s magazine-reading habits. These data allow us to
control for individual heterogeneity that influences both advertising exposure and cigarette demand.
We exploit quasi-experimental variation in advertising exposure in the 2000s created by sharply different
supply-side variation in menthol and non-menthol advertising. We examine the importance of controlling
for heterogeneity by estimating simple models relating advertising exposure to behavior and then adding
specifications that take advantage of the richness of our individual-level data. We examine advertising
effects on multiple margins of cigarette demand. Our empirical results do not provide any evidence
that menthol advertising in magazines affects cigarette demand at various margins: the probability
of menthol use; smoking participation; the number of cigarettes smoked per day; the probability of
a past-year quit attempt; and anti-smoking attitudes among teens.

I. Introduction

       The 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (TCA) gave the U.S.

Food and Drug Administration new regulatory authority over the tobacco industry. The TCA

banned the use of flavors in cigarettes, except for menthol. About 28 percent of current smokers

choose menthol cigarettes, with the share ranging from 21 percent among white smokers to 74

percent among African American smokers (DeCicca et al 2014). 1 Although the TCA did not

require immediate regulatory actions towards menthol, it required the FDA’s Tobacco Products

Scientific Advisory Committee (TPSAC) to study the impact of menthol cigarettes on public

health. The TPSAC report (2012) and an FDA report (2013) conclude that although menthol per

se is not harmful, the availability and marketing of menthol cigarettes harms public health by

increasing smoking initiation and decreasing smoking cessation. In July 2013 the FDA issued an

advance notice of proposed rulemaking of possible restrictions on the sale and distribution of

menthol cigarettes. The FDA sought public comments on the proposed regulation of menthol

including: “Should FDA consider establishing restrictions on the advertising and promotion of

menthol cigarettes?” The final rulemaking is pending. 2

       FDA regulation of menthol cigarette advertising would be the latest chapter in a long

history of US regulation of cigarette advertising. In the 1940s the Federal Trade Commission

brought forward advertising deception cases including a case against Brown & Williamson for

health-related claims about Kool cigarettes, one of the first menthol brands (Stratton et al. 2001,

p. 61). Ironically, in these early cases the FTC argued that because there was no evidence that

Use Supplements to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS).

  In another legal development, in July 2014 the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia
found that three members of TPSAC had conflicts of interest and prohibited the FDA from using
the findings of the TPSAC menthol report.

any cigarettes are harmful, claims that a brand like Kool is less harmful than other brands are

necessarily false. In the 1950s scientific evidence of the harms of smoking led to the cigarette

industry’s “Tar Derby” where brands competed based on their tar and nicotine content. In 1960

the FTC negotiated a voluntary ban of tar and nicotine claims, then reversed course and in 1966

allowed the claims and in 1970 required tar and nicotine measures in all advertisements (Calfee

1986). In 1970 cigarettes were banned from advertising on television and radio but advertising

in magazines was still allowed and continued. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement between

state attorneys general and the cigarette industry banned the use of cartoon figures and prohibited

advertisements that targeted youth. In addition to establishing the FDA’s regulatory authority

over the tobacco industry, the 2009 TCA includes specific restrictions on marketing and

advertising: a ban on brand sponsorships of sports and entertainment events; and a ban of the use

of misleading descriptors such as “light.” 3

       The possibility of new FDA regulations of menthol cigarette advertising raises questions

with long histories of debate in economics and public health. Different theoretical models

suggest that advertisements can influence consumer demand because they are persuasive,

informative, or are complements to the advertised good (Bagwell 2007). The different theories

have different implications for the impact of advertising on social welfare. The impact of

cigarette advertising on public health hinges on difficult empirical questions: Does advertising

expand the size of the market? Or does advertising mainly change the market shares of

competing brands? Econometric studies provide little evidence that cigarette advertising has a

strong market-expanding impact. 4 In contrast, public health research reaches a consensus that

cigarette advertising encourages youth initiation (Lovato et al. 2011), which is consistent with a

market-expanding impact. However, this consensus has been challenged by advertising

researchers and economists. 5 Heckman et al. (2008) emphasize that studies of the link between

advertising and smoking must take into account “the consequences of human choice for the

validity of their statistical analysis.”(Heckman et al. 2008, p. 42). In addition to consumer

choices, it is crucial that studies of advertising take into account the choices of profit‐maximizing

manufacturers who target their advertising to reach potential consumers (Avery et al. 2007).

       In this paper, we contribute new empirical evidence on the effects of magazine

advertisements for menthol cigarettes on cigarette demand. Unlike previous research on cigarette

advertising and demand, we use individual-level data and a measure of advertising exposure

based on each consumer’s magazine-reading habits. These data allow us to control for individual

heterogeneity that influences both advertising exposure and cigarette demand. We use data from

the 1998-2009 Simmons National Consumer Survey (NCS). We exploit quasi-experimental

variation in advertising exposure in the 2000s created by sharply different supply-side variation

in menthol and non-menthol advertising. We examine the importance of controlling for

  In their extensive review Chaloupka and Warner (2000, p. 1586) conclude that “no consensus
concerning the effects of advertising on smoking has emerged from this research.” In a meta-
analysis of 137 econometric estimates, the median estimates imply that a 10 percent increase in
advertising expenditures results in less than one percent increase in cigarette demand (Gallet and
List 2003).
5
  The fundamental challenge is researchers’ inability, for practical and ethical reasons, to assess
youth smoking rates in clinical trials where some are randomly exposed to cigarette advertising
and others are not. The alternative of relying on correlations between smoking behaviors and
advertisement recall and awareness faces the criticism that smoking or favorable attitudes
towards smoking “drives heightened attention to advertising, smoking portrayals in movies,
and/or ownership of promotional items.” (Taylor and Bonner, 2003, p. 420) Reviews by
economists of this body of research raise similar questions about whether the findings support a
causal link between ads and youth smoking (Geweke and Martin 2002; Heckman et al. 2008;
Nelson 2010).

heterogeneity by estimating simple models relating advertising exposure to behavior and then

adding specifications that take advantage of the richness of our individual-level data. We

examine advertising effects on multiple margins of cigarette demand: smokers’ choices to smoke

menthol versus non-menthol brands; smoking participation; the number of cigarettes smoked per

day; and attempts to quit smoking. We also use data from the 2000-2005 NCS Teens Studies to

examine the effect of menthol advertising on teens’ anti-smoking attitudes.

       After providing some background information in section II, in section III we describe our

empirical approach and data. Sections IV and V present our empirical results and section VI

provides a concluding discussion.

II. Background

       To set the stage for our empirical analysis, in this section we briefly review some of the

recent history of smoking and cigarette advertising in the U.S. The publication of the 1964

Surgeon General’s Report on the health consequences of smoking is widely seen as a landmark

event that helped launch anti-smoking campaigns in the U.S. and many other countries. The

decline in smoking since 1964 has been called “arguably the most successful public health

endeavor in developed nations in the past half century ….” (Warner 2007). Figure 1 shows U.S.

adult smoking prevalence from 1965 to 2011 and teen smoking prevalence from 1977 to 2011.

Adult and teen smoking has shown a mainly steady decline, with adult smoking prevalence

falling from 43 percent in 1965 to 20 percent in 2011. The exception to the mainly steady decline

in smoking is the rise in teen smoking from 1992 to 1997. Our data cover 1998 – 2009, a period

when both adult and teen smoking rates fell.

       Turning to cigarette advertising, Figure 2 shows the trend in the industry’s expenditures

on magazine advertising from 1965-2012. The data are from the FTC (2013) and are adjusted for



                                                4
inflation. Cigarette industry magazine advertising expenditures peaked in 1983 at about $900

million and had fallen to about $300 million per year by the mid-1990s. Advertising

expenditures increased in the late 1990s before dropping to under $50 million per year from

2005 through 2012. During our study period cigarette advertising expenditures are low by

historical standards but include both a brief rise and then a steady drop.

        Figure 3 shows that the drop in magazine advertising of non‐menthol cigarettes was

much steeper than the drop in menthol cigarette advertising. Because the FTC (2013) only

provides industry expenditures, Figure 3 uses the data we describe and use below. It shows the

trends in the number of magazine cigarette advertisements and in average consumer exposure to

these advertisements. The data on the number of advertisements are from Kantar Media

Intelligence and cover all cigarette advertisements that appeared in popular magazines. As

described in more detail below, we combine this information with information on magazine-

reading habits from the NCS to create an individual-level measure of potential advertising

exposure. Around 2000, the average consumer exposure to non‐menthol advertisements was

almost twenty times higher than average exposure to menthol advertisements. Around 2007,

menthol advertising overtook non‐menthol advertising, both in terms of the number of

advertisements and in average consumer exposure.

       We have also analyzed the trends broken down by cigarette manufacturer and brand (not

shown in Figure 3). In the early 2000s Philip Morris and RJR stopped placing advertisements

for their market‐leading non-menthol brands (Marlboro and Camel). Lorillard continued to place

advertisements for Newport, the leading menthol brand. To oversimplify the supply-side

variation somewhat: the different advertising strategies adopted by Philip Morris and RJR on the




                                                 5
one hand, and Lorillard on the other, led to the different trends in magazine advertising for

non‐menthol and menthol cigarettes. 6

       Our empirical study exploits the trends in menthol and non-menthol advertising to

conduct a quasi-experimental analysis of the impact of menthol advertising on cigarette demand.

During our study period various anti-smoking policies were enacted, including state and federal

cigarette excise tax hikes. The average inflation-adjusted price of cigarettes increased from $3.09

in 1998 to $5.87 in 2009. This price increase and other new policies might have contributed to

the decline in smoking shown in Figure 1. 7 One influence moving in the opposite direction is the

cigarette industry’s expenditures on price promotions, promotional allowances, coupons and

retail-value expenditures such as “buy one, get one free.” Expenditures in these categories

increased from $6.7 billion in 1998 to $16.4 billion in 2003, and then decreased to $7.9 billion in

2009 (inflation-adjusted figures from FTC 2013). On a per pack basis, industry expenditures in

these categories increased from $0.29 per pack in 1998 to $0.50 per pack in 2009. The $0.21 per

pack increase in price promotions offsets about eight percent of the $2.78 increase in the average

cigarette price over our study period. 8 Promotional expenditures influence cigarette demand

through retailers and other channels which are independent of magazine advertisements, so this

trend should not pose a threat to the validity of our quasi-experimental research design.



6
  Even for just the major brands, the patterns in the data are complex. There are no Marlboro
advertisements after 2002. The number of Marlboro magazine advertisements drops
substantially from 318 in 2000 to 68 in 2001 to 3 in 2002. RJR continues to advertise Camel
through 2007. RJR advertises its menthol brand Salem somewhat intermittently through 2004.
There are advertisements for the menthol brand Kool through 2007. Kool was made by Brown &
Williamson, which was purchased by RJR in 2003. Some manufacturers used different strategies
for different brands. For example, RJR continues to advertise American Spirit through 2009.

  Warner and Mendez (2012) and DeCicca and Kenkel (2015) show that the demographics of the
smoking population explain most of the decline.

III. Empirical Approach and Data

       We use individual-level data from the 1998-2009 NCS Adult Studies and the 2000-2005

NCS Teens Studies to estimate cigarette demand as a function of exposure to cigarette

advertising, demographic demand shifters, and control variables. The NCS conducts repeated

cross-sectional surveys of consumers with two waves each year (spring and fall). It collects

broad and detailed information on consumer choices, brand preferences, usage of major media,

and attitudes and opinions. The NCS provides sample sizes of: 198,686 adults age 25 and over;

16,455 young adults age 18-24; and 14,361 teens age 12-17. Table 1 provides descriptive

statistics for the key variables we use in our analysis. The Appendix provides more details about

the NCS and the definitions of the key variables.

       We examine several different margins of adult cigarette demand. To explore whether

advertising effects the brand share of menthol cigarettes, we estimate a model of the probability a

current smoker chooses a menthol versus a non-menthol brand. To explore possible market-

expanding impacts of advertising we estimate the standard two part model of current smoking

participation and, conditional upon participation, the number of cigarettes smoked per day. We

also estimate a model of the probability a smoker reports a past-year quit attempt.

       In our sample of adults over the age of 25 about 27 percent of smokers use menthol,

compared to 31 percent in among adults aged 18-25. 18 percent of older adults and 23 percent of

younger adults are current smokers. Smokers over 25 smoke more cigarettes per day than

smokers aged 18-25 (18 cigarettes per day versus 13) and are less likely to have attempted to quit

smoking in the past year (42 percent versus 46 percent). Figure 4 shows the trends in these adult

smoking behaviors over our study period. Menthol use is fairly steady. Similar to the trend in




                                                7
Figure 1, smoking participation and cigarettes smoked per day decline over our study period. 9

The fraction attempting to quit smoking does not show a strong trend; the drop from 2003 to

2004 appears to be due to a change in survey design. 10

       We also estimate a model of teen anti-smoking sentiment. Anti-smoking sentiment is

measured by agreement with the statement “People who smoke are stupid.” 11 Using measures of

smoking attitudes as outcome variables is a well-established approach in public health research.

Some previous research suggests that smoking attitudes are predictors of adolescent smoking

behavior (e.g., Andrews and Duncan 1998, Flay et al. 1998). However, some recent research

raises questions about the direction of causality between smoking attitudes and smoking

behaviors (de Leeuw et al. 2008). But even with reverse causality between sentiment and

smoking, our measure of anti-smoking sentiment can be viewed as a useful proxy for teen

smoking.

       In our sample about two-thirds of teens agree with an anti-smoking statement. Figure 5

shows a slight upward trend in anti-smoking sentiment over our study period.

       We exploit the NCS data on magazine-reading habits to create a measure of each

individual’s potential exposure to cigarette advertisements in magazines. The Kantar Media

Intelligence data includes the date and other information about all cigarette magazine

advertisements that appeared in popular magazines. We distinguish advertisements for menthol

9
  The level and trend in smoking participation in Figure 3 do not match the national level and
trend in Figure 1 because the NCS intentionally over-samples higher-income consumers. Our
econometric models below control for consumer income and other demographics. Based on the
discussion of Solon, Haider and Wooldridge (2014), we do not use sample weights in our
analysis.
10
   Beginning in 2004 the question about attempting to quit smoking was moved to a section of
the survey about smoking cessation products such as nicotine gum.
11
   The 2000-2005 NCS Teens waves ask about the “smokers are stupid” question. The 1998
waves instead ask about agreement with the statement “Smoking should be banned in all public
places.”

from non-menthol cigarettes when the product label contains “Menthol” or the advertisement is

for one of the leading menthol brands (Kool, Newport, and Salem). We measure the individual’s

potential exposure to the advertisements as the number of advertisements that appeared in

magazines a respondent read over the past 12 months weighted by the frequency with which the

respondent reads each magazine.

IV. Main Results

       We first examine the relationship between exposure to menthol advertisements and

demand for menthol versus non-menthol cigarettes, conditional on smoking. Table 2 reports the

results for adults over the age of 25 and Table 3 reports the results for young adults age 18 – 25.

Each Table reports the results of three specifications: a naïve model that does not include any

control variables except indicators for survey wave; a model that includes controls for

demographic characteristics; and our preferred specification that includes a set control variables

for magazine-readership habits.

       The results from the different specifications in Tables 2 and 3 demonstrate the

importance of controlling for industry targeting of advertisements. The results are similar for

older and younger adults. In the naïve specification, exposure to menthol advertisements is

strongly positively associated with menthol use. At the same time, exposure to advertisements

for non-menthol cigarettes is almost as strongly negatively associated with menthol use.

Smokers in the highest menthol advertising exposure category are estimated to be about 30

percentage points more likely to use menthol cigarettes, i.e. about double the sample average.

Smokers in the highest non-menthol exposure category are about 11 to 12 percent less likely to

use menthol. The associations mainly disappear in the second specification that includes

demographic controls. This pattern suggests that the associations in the naïve specification stem



                                                 9
from targeted advertising, where cigarette companies advertise in magazines with higher

readerships of demographic groups who are already more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes.

       To further explore the possible targeting of advertising, we estimate models of

advertising exposure as functions of the demographic variables. The results (reported in the

Appendix) show strong differences across demographic groups. Most notably, African-American

smokers are 12 percentage points less likely to be in the zero menthol advertising exposure

category and are 15 percentage points more likely to be in the highest menthol advertising

exposure category. 12 In the Kantar data we verify that advertisements for menthol cigarettes

appear disproportionately in a few magazines with high African-American readership. Over 10

percent of all menthol advertisements appeared in either Ebony or Jet, magazines read by about

30 percent of African-Americans in our sample but only 0.4 percent of whites. Manufacturers’

apparent decisions to target menthol advertising reflect long-standing differences: the market

share of menthol has been much higher among African-American smokers since at least the

1970s (DeCicca et al. 2014).

       The results from the preferred specifications in Tables 2 and 3 provide no evidence that

exposure to menthol advertisements increases the probability that smokers use menthol. The

estimated coefficients on the indicators for different levels of exposure are small, fairly precisely

estimated, and statistically insignificantly different from zero. Because this specification

controls for the specific magazines each individual reads, identification relies on within-

magazine variation over time in the number of cigarette advertisements. This variation is

plausibly exogenous because it stems from the quasi-experimental supply-side variation created



12
  African-American smokers are not less likely to be in the zero non-menthol advertising
exposure category and are only a little over 1 percentage point more likely to be in the highest
non-menthol advertising exposure category.
                                                 10
by different cigarette manufacturers’ different business strategies over the 2000s. Several recent

studies use similar identification strategies to estimate the effects of advertising on health-related

consumption choices (Avery et al. 2007, Avery et al. 2012, and Dave and Saffer 2013).

         We next turn to explore the relationships between menthol advertising and additional

margins of cigarette demand. The impact of advertising on youth smoking is of special concern.

In Table 4 we report models that use a measure of whether the respondent agrees with an anti-

smoking statement included in the 1998-2005 NCS Teens study. In the naïve specification there

is a strong negative relationship between anti-smoking sentiment and exposure to menthol

advertisements. While 65 percent of the sample agrees with the anti-smoking statement, teens in

the two highest exposure categories are almost 12 percentage points less likely to agree. Similar

to the patterns in Tables 2 and 3, the associations are weaker in the specification that includes

demographic controls. The associations are essentially non-existent in the preferred specification

that controls for magazine-reading.

         Tables 5 and 6 present results from our preferred specification for additional margins of

cigarette demand for older adults and younger adults, respectively. The smoking outcomes

considered are: current smoking participation; the number of cigarettes smoked per day by

current smokers; and whether or not a current smoker attempted to quit in the past year. The

results provide no evidence that menthol advertising increases smoking or discourages quitting.

In general the estimated coefficients on the exposure measures are relatively small and not

statistically significantly different from zero. The results show some statistically significant

associations between exposure to non-menthol advertisements and less smoking and more quit

attempts. These patterns are surprising, but we note that most of the coefficients are relatively

small.



                                                 11
        The results for the other explanatory variables (not shown in Tables 5 and 6 but available

upon request) are generally consistent with previous research on cigarette demand. Statistically

significant demographics include sex, age, race/ethnicity, education and income. As in previous

research, the associations between education and cigarette demand are particularly strong.

Among adults over age 25, higher cigarette prices are associated with lower smoking

participation, fewer cigarettes per day conditional on smoking, and a higher probability of

making a quit attempt. Although the coefficients are not statistically significant at conventional

levels, the implied elasticity of demand is about -0.12. Several recent studies find elasticities in

this range or smaller. 13

V. Additional Results

        In empirical microeconomics it is important to explore whether estimates of causal

treatment effects are credible and robust to alternative specifications, falsification exercises, and

so on. In this section we carry out additional empirical exercises in the same spirit. First, we

explore whether the results from our preferred specification might be due to insufficient variation

in advertising exposure, i.e. whether our quasi-experiment lacks statistical power. Second, we

explore the possibility of omitted variable bias towards zero.

        In the preferred specification, the controls for magazine-reading reduce the extent of

variation in advertising exposure. To explore the degree of the resulting multi-collinearity, we

estimate auxiliary regressions of each advertising exposure measure as a function of the

13
  The models include state fixed effects and the standard errors are clustered by state. The total
elasticity of -0.12 is the sum of the participation elasticity (-0.075) and the conditional demand
elasticity (-0.047). Our elasticity estimates are somewhat smaller than the average participation
elasticity of -0.126 and the average conditional demand elasticity of -0.072 from Tauras (2006).
Callison and Kaestner (2014, p. 158) discuss additional estimates and conclude that: “a relatively
small number of studies have examined the association between tobacco taxes (prices) and adult
smoking and these studies have not produced a consensus finding.” Callison and Kaestner’s
empirical analysis finds very small or nonexistent price effects.
                                                 12
magazine-reading controls and the other explanatory variables. The R2s from the auxiliary

regressions are around 0.75, implying that about 25 percent of variation remains as a source of

identification. A common rule of thumb is that the implied variance inflation factor (VIF) above

10 indicates problematic multi-collinearity; in our models the VIFs are around 4. As a case study

of the within-magazine variation in cigarettes over time, we examine Sports Illustrated, a major

cigarette advertiser. The number of cigarette advertisements per year in the national edition of

Sports Illustrated ranged from 0 to 149, with a median of 25. There is additional variation over

time in cigarette advertising in the regional editions of Sports Illustrated. We interpret the multi-

collinearity diagnostics and the case study as supportive evidence that the identifying variation in

the preferred specification is sufficient to provide meaningful evidence about the impact of

advertising on menthol use.

       We consider several possible sources of omitted variable bias. During our study period

there was a general trend towards less smoking. There were also various anti-smoking policy

initiatives. Because advertising exposure was also trending downward, these influences might

create a bias away from zero towards finding advertising effects. We explore several influences

that might have moved in the opposite direction: coupon use; a proxy for exposure to point-of-

sale advertising; and a proxy for exposure to internet advertising. We do not find that our

measures are strongly associated with cigarette demand or that their omission tends to bias the

advertising effects towards zero (results reported in the Appendix). Although this might due to

measurement error in the proxy variables, we note that our quasi-experimental design relies on

identifying variation in advertising exposure that should be expected to be orthogonal to

influences like these.

VI. Discussion



                                                 13
       Our empirical results do not provide any evidence that menthol advertising in magazines

affects cigarette demand at various margins: the probability of menthol use; smoking

participation; the number of cigarettes smoked per day; the probability of a past-year quit

attempt; and anti-smoking sentiment among teens. We find strong evidence that advertising

manufacturers target their menthol advertising at certain demographic groups. We also find that

failure to control for targeting yields misleading results: for example, we find that a strong

association between teen anti-smoking sentiment and menthol advertising exposure disappears

when we control for magazine-reading habits. This pattern suggests that manufacturers target

menthol advertisements to appear in the magazines read by teens with more favorable attitudes

towards smoking. Studies of advertising and cigarette demand need to use research designs that

control for targeting and other sources of heterogeneity.

       The 2009 TCA provides the FDA with authority to regulate menthol cigarette advertising

if the regulation is “appropriate for public health… determined with respect to the risks and

benefits to the population as a whole, including users and nonusers of the tobacco product….”

Consistent with previous economic research that mainly fails to find a strong market-expanding

impact of cigarette advertising in general, our results provide no evidence that menthol

advertising in magazines harms public health through its effects on users or non-users. Although

it might face First Amendment challenges, the FDA could issue a rule that bans menthol

cigarette advertising in magazines. Because advertising can be expected to have diminishing

marginal productivity, previous econometric estimates that advertising has a small or zero effect

at the margin do not rule out much a larger effect from such a non-marginal change. However,

zero exposure to menthol advertising is well within the range of our data. Our estimates that




                                                 14
menthol advertising has small or zero effects should be relevant for analysis of a range of

regulatory approaches up to and including a ban of magazine advertisements.

       Our study’s limitations suggest caveats for the policy implications. We lack data on teen

smoking behaviors so we are unable to directly examine advertising effects on this very

important group of users and non-users. However, we are able to examine teens’ anti-smoking

sentiment, which other research shows proxies for current smoking and predicts future smoking.

We are also able to examine the effects of menthol advertising on cigarette demand by young

adults age 18 – 24. Although the teenage years are a critical period for smoking initiation, both

initiation and cessation are also common in early adulthood. In longitudinal data, DeCicca,

Kenkel and Mathios (2008) find that about 13 percent of age-18 non-smokers initiated smoking

by age 26, while about one-third of age-18 smokers had quit by age 26. Our results do not

provide any evidence that menthol advertising affects similar transitions in our sample of

younger adults. In addition to lacking data on teen smoking, we note several other limitations to

the scope of our analysis. We cannot address the longer-run effects of magazine advertising over

many years. We also cannot address the effects of other types of cigarette advertising and

promotional efforts.

       Beyond the implications for public health and FDA regulatory policy, our results and

previous research might seem to pose a puzzle for the economics of cigarette advertising. If

advertising does not expand the cigarette market, why do cigarette manufacturers spend millions

of dollars to advertise in magazines? One possible explanation is that manufacturers advertise to

increase their brand’s share of an essentially fixed-size market. If cigarette advertising is the non-

cooperative outcome of a Prisoner’s Dilemma-type game, regulations do not hurt and could even

improve industry profits. Consistent with this possibility, Bulow and Klemperer (1998, p. 368)



                                                 15
observe that when negotiating the 1998 MSA the cigarette manufactures “agreed to give up [the

advertising images] Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man after the very first day of meetings.” This

possibility might also explain why a few years after the MSA Philip Morris and RJR decided to

stop advertising in magazines. Lorillard faced possibly different incentives to continue to

advertise because its market share was about eight percent, compared to Philip Morris’ 48

percent share and RJR’s 25 percent share (USDHHS 2000, p. 307). An interesting direction for

future work is to develop and test this explanation more formally.

NCS Data and Definitions of Key Variables

The NCS sample, drawn independently each wave, is a multistage stratified probability sample
representative of all adults 18 years of age or older living in households in the 48 contiguous
states in the United States (excluding Hawaii and Alaska). In the course of recruiting NCS
respondents, all teenagers age 12-17 in the household were identified and invited to participate in
the NCS Teens Study. Because the NCS is a marketing survey, higher-income households are
intentionally over-sampled. We restrict the sample to non-Hispanics as the NCS began to over-
sample Hispanics in 2004, about the middle of our study period.

We use four measures of smoking behavior as dependent variables in our analysis. We measure
smoking participation based on the question: “Do you currently smoke cigarettes?” We measure
menthol use based on answers to a question about types of cigarettes smokers smoke most often.
Menthol use indicates if a smoker reports any type of menthol cigarettes including “menthol”,
“lights 100s menthol”, “lights, menthol”, “king size menthol”, and “100s menthol.” The NCS
survey asks smokers the average number of cigarettes they smoke each day in six groups: 40 or
more, 30-39, 20-29, 10-19, 5-9 and less than 5. We take the mid-point of each group (40 for the
highest group): 40, 35, 25, 15, 7.5, or 2.5 as the value for the amount of cigarettes smoked daily.
The quit attempt variable is based on answers to the question: “Have you tried to stop smoking in
the last 12 months?”

Our key explanatory variables indicate the individual’s potential exposure to menthol and non-
menthol advertisements in magazines. We measure exposure as the number of advertisements
that appeared in magazines a respondent reports having read over the past 12 months, weighted
by the frequency with which the respondent reads each magazine. The weights are based on
respondent’s reports for each magazine of the average number of issues read or looked into out
of the last four issues.

All of our models include the following demographics: age, sex, race/ethnicity, education,
marital status, employment status, household income, region, county size, and the size of the
respondent’s Designated Market Area (media market, roughly comparable to a Metropolitan
Statistical Area). We also include a measure of the average price of cigarettes (from the Tax
Burden on Tobacco) in the respondent’s state of residence.

Our preferred specification includes controls for the frequency with which the respondent reads
each of 98 consumer magazines.

Additional Results

To explore the targeting of advertisements, Appendix Table 1 presents models of advertising
exposure as functions of the demographic variables.

variables: a measure of cigarette coupon use; the number of times shopped at convenience stores
in the last four weeks (as a proxy for exposure to point-of-sale cigarette advertising); and
indicators of the level of internet use (as a proxy for exposure to internet cigarette advertising).
These variables are only available for 2003-2009. Our main analysis uses data from 1998-2009
to preserve sample size and exploit as much variation in magazine advertising as possible.
