                              VERTICAL RESTRIANTS
                           AND PRODUCERS' COMPETITION

                                   Abstract

      This paper examines the rationale for vertical restraints.
 It shows that there are important circumstances uner which these
 restrictions have significant anti-competitive effects. The paper
 focuses on the consequences of exclusive territorial arrangements
 among   the   retailers of two products which are       imperfect
 substitutes.    Such arrangements are shown to increase consumer
 prices;  under plausible conditions the increase in consumer
 prices is sufficiently large to more than offset the deleterious
 effects    from "double marginalization" resulting from reduced
 competition among retailers,      The  imposition of exclusivity
 provisions is may be part of a Nash equilibrium among producers.
 These results hold whether there are or are not franchise fees.

I.     INTRODUCTION

       Vertical relationships between producers and retailers or
wholesalers        often    involve   more        or     less       complex      contracting

arrangements,         broadly     named          vertical         restraints.            These

arrangements can simply           consist in non-linear tariffs,                       such as

franchise fees, quantity forcing or pricing requirements                            (quotas,

Resale     Price     Maintenance),      but        they       may    also       include     the

assignment of exclusive territories                    or     exclusive dealing,           tie-

ins,    etc         This     paper is   concerned with                   investigating the
rationale for        these    restrictions and               showing that         there    are

important     circumstances under                which       these       restrictions       and

showing    that there       are important circumstances under which these

restrictions have significant anti-competitive effects.
        The legal    status of these restraints differs                    among countries

and has    changed over times.2           From         the economic point of view,

two    main streams of        ideas   have       emerged:           on    one   side is the

argument      that     since      markets' are               competitive         and     since

arrangements would           be   adopted        only        if   they     increase       joint

profits,    they     must    necessarily be efficiency enhancing; on the

        See Slair-Kaserman l983J and Caves [l984J for a general
presentation of vertical restraints,                     s
                                        well as a comprehensive
discussion of their economic incidence.
      2  For instance, RMP is generally considered to be illegal;
however, some States in the US. had for a while adopted "fair
trade" laws, which partially authorized RMP.   Thus, even looking
only at the case of the U.S., RPM, which was originally viewed as
a per se violation of the Sherman act, had been accepted in some
States, till 1975; it is now again illegal in all States.  In the
same way, assigning exclusive territories,     after having been
considered as per se illegal, is now subject to a rule of reason
standard.

                                             1
other side       is       the    contention thet these restraints have anti-

competitive effects at                 the    lower       (retailers'        or    wholesalers')
level

        There have been several recent                       attempts        to    formalize the

efficiency argument (see                    for    example Mathewson-Winter [1983],

[1984])        viewing          the   vertical           relationship as           a     principal-
agent(s)        relationship;           the        emphasis      is     placed          on     control
                 a                                         deals with a set of more or

less comoetirive           retailers,        whose actions (retail prices, selling

efforts,       err.)      affect      the    total profits;            the   problem for the
producer is thus to design                    a    contract in order to achieve the

integrated solution,              i.e. to make the retailers choose                          the right

actions and          to    recover     back the generated profits.                           The   main
conclusion       n        this    framework is            that   vertical restraints are

always privately desirable,                  as they allow a better control of the

retailers.3            Moreover,        as        they    help    in    correcting             certain

problems associated with linear pricing rules, such as the double

msrginalization problem                 (Spengler,          [1950])     or        the    free-rider

problem (Telser,            [1960]),        these vertical restraints are                      usually
thought of as increasing social welfare.
        This    apologetical view has                    already been shaded by                 recent



        For an introduction to this literature on vertical
control, see Rey-Tirole ]l986s].    Indeed, one of the objectives
of this literature is to define the "minimal set of sufficient
tools", which lead to a perfect control of the distributors by
the producer.      (Exclusive territories   plus franchise fees)
generally constitutes an example of such a minimal set:        it
amounts in effect to "selling the firm" (or, more exactly, the
production technology).

work,   which has emphasized,                for instance,      the divergence between

the monopolist's and the consumers' valuations for distributors'

services        (see     Scherer     [1983),     Comanor [1985]         and    Caillaud-Rey

[19871)        or     the   role    of     distributors'      private information in
uncertain            markets       (see     Rey-Tirole      [198Gb)).          The     general
framework        is,    however,      the    same,   and    in particular inter-brand

competition (i.e., competition among producers) is neglected.
        We will argue here that producers' competition is in fact a

crucial    element for the analysis of vertical arrangements.                           As we

will    show,        when there     is imperfect competition among producers,

then vertical restraints                  may serve to facilitate collusion.              The

contractual arrangement may indeed increase joint profits but the

gains     to    the     producers and distributors are at the expense of
consumers.              Vertical      restraints may          thus   not       be     socially
desirable.

        We emphasize here            the interaction between the design of the

internal             (producer/retailer)             contract     and      the       external

competitive situation at the upper (producer)                        level.          A natural
framework within which to examine these issues is provided by the

multi-principal-multi-agents approach (Fershtman and Judd [19841,
[1986)),       which has recently been used by Bernheixs and Whinston

[1986],        for     the case of common agency,             and by Katz [19871,          for

the case of rivalrous agencies.                     This approach, following earlier

work (Stiglitz (1986)) noting the role of such relationships as

entry     deterrents,          stresses in particular the               role   of     internal

principal/agents               contracts       as    a     commitment    for        sustaining

                                                 3
collusion among principals;                    it also emphasizes the importance of

the       definition of            admissible contracts and                the       role   of   each

agent's         information.            This    approach has             already yielded new

insights          in       the     snslysis      of        imperfect           competition       (see

respectively               gernheimWhinston                [1985]        and        Bonanno-Vickets

[1987]).          As we will see! it also constitutes a useful tool for

the       analysis of            the   rationale and the            incidence of            vertical

restraints.




II    -   EXCLUSIVE TERRITORIES AS              A DEVICE      TD REDUCE COMPETITIQII

          We   consider       here a simple model,            borrowed from Rey-Stiglitz

[1985],         which shows how exclusive territories,                              which obviously

reduce         competition at the lower level, may actually be                              a way   of

reducing competition at the uppet level as well.                                     The basic ides

is     that      when retailers enjoy some kind of monopolistic power,

they may put higher mark-ups in the                           retail      price:         this    price

distortion,           in turn, induces         some change on the cross sensitivity

of        this    demand          towards      the       prices     of    the        manufacturer's

competitors.                The    manufacturers may therefore perceive a                         less

elastic demand than when they directly compete against each other
or when they use competitive retailers.                             This effect in turn may

induce         both       producers to assign exclusive territories to their
                      -
                                                                                -
retailers.

                                                     4
        Let           us describe this model.                        There are two manufacturers.

each    producing a simple good with a constant marginal cost                                                         c1

and distributing it via retailers who have no retail costs.                                                          The

two    products are                   imperfect substitutes.                        The    final      demand for

good         i    ,
                       associated            with retail         prices            qi     and     q   ,    is   given

by     D1(q1,q)                       For simplicity,            we assume              Symmetry,         Cl — C2      —



c,    and         V     x    ,    y   e R+     ,
                                                   D1(x,y)       —   D2(y,x)               Consumers have no

search       cost and thus buy from the lowest possible price for each

product.                Lastly,         we    will    suppose in the                     following that              all

profit functions are                          concave,       admit         a       unique--and interior--

maximum,              and we will thus focus on first-order                               conditions.

        We            can        define       two     useful           benchmarks,                corresponding

respectively to perfect collusion and direct competition between
producers:
        -        the collusive outcome                 is defined by                     the maximization of

the aggregate profits:                             (q1-c)D1(q,q)               +    (q2-c)D2(q,q)                ,   and

leads        to the monopolistic price                       q*:



                                                                                        the direct and
where            l          and               respectively denote                                                cross

price elasticities                      of     the   final       demands                (E1—3logD1/3logq)

The monopolistic mark-up is thus                                     the   higher,          the   lower         is   the

sensitivity of the demand for a product with respect to its own
price and the higher is the sensitivity of this demand to the

price        of the other              product4
         -       the outcome associated with direct competition corresponds

                  As the two goods are subatitutes one has:                                       2        0

                                                             5
to the      (Nash) equilibrium of a game where each producer contrcls

rhe consumer price,           q     and where his payoff is                 (q-c)D(q1,q2)
The    "competitive"        price    qc     is characterized by (under                     standard

assumptions on payoff functions):
(2)            (qcc)/qc           l/c1(qt,qt)
       Of    course     the   "competitive"           profits are           lower    than     those

with perfect collusion.               When the two products are substitutes,

retail      prices    also are lower; each producer, when he chooses                              his

own price,         does not take into account the fact                      that his        rival's

gain    from an       increase in his own price.                     Note that indeed,              it

would be in the interest of                the   producers to convince each other
that they would follow up any price increase with a further price

increase

       Let     us     now     make    precise          the     imperfectly           competitive
framework on which we will focus.                      It is supposed that producers

observe the quantity bought by the retailers and possibly whether
or    not    the     retailers distribute their                 products;           they    do    not

observe either          the   quantities sold by the retailers nor                               their

profits or the prices they charge.                         On the other hand,          retailers

have perfect information             and observe the contracts signed by each

producer;       in    particular,         they       can    engage     in    arbitrage if            a

producer tries to discriminate between them.                            Finally,       producers

may assign exclusive territories                      to     their    retailers (in which

case these          territories are         supposed to be             symmetric and              thus




                                                 6
representative of the total market.5                              Given these informational

assumptions,        the admissible contracts between a producer and his

retailers can only include,                    besides the assignment of exclusive

territories,        wholesale tariffs                based on the quantity bought by

the retailers          Tha possibility of arbitrage from the retailers

rules     out   non-constant marginal prices;                        producers may however

impose       franchise       fees       on     the       retailers if       they     effectively
observe      who    sell,    their products.                 W€    have    imposed       a    set    of

informational assumptions intended                          to    rationalize a particular

simple       form     of     contractual                 relationship.             Readers          may
alternatively take               these       contractual          ralationships as            given,

treating our analysis as simply investigating their consequences.
        We   assume   that,       in    those        cases where the        producer imposes
franchise fees,             ft    can        preclude       those    who    do     not       pay    the

franchise fee from, for instance, buying the good from some other
retailer and selling             it.         We will consider both situations wh€.re

there are, and are not franchise                         fees.

        We formalize the competitive                      framework as      a   two-stage game:
in the first        stage,       given some vertical contracting arrangement,

producers simultaneously choose                       their wholesale prices,                i      and


        The following assumptions  are more precisely presented
and discussed in Rey-Stiglitz [19851.   The two main assumptions
are the asymmetry in information between retailers and producers
about retail prices and sales, and the fact that all contracts
are common knowledge. The first assumption may be justified in
several ways, including moral hazard aspects on the retail side
(see Rey-Tirole [l986b]).    The assumption that the retailers
observe all producers' contracts allows producers, as we will
see, to use these contracts in order to achieve higher profits:
they are therefore strongly interested in making them common
knowledge.

P2 (and eventually the franchise                              fees); then in the second stage,

retailers observe all wholesale tariffs and aiaultaneousiy choose
their    retail       prices.            We        will consider in                 the    following the
(subgame)            perfect         equilibria                  of     this         two-stage            game,
corresponding to              two    initial              situations:           in        the    first        one,

retailers are pure price competitors                                 wheteas in the aecond one,

exclusive territories have been assigned to the retailers.

        i)    In absence of vertical arrangement,                               pure        (intra-breod)

price competition leeds                      the retailers            to charge zero mark-upa in

the second stage, and thus equilibrium retail prices are equal                                                  to

the wholesale prices chosen in the first age:                                        qi         P1     (this in

turn    implies       that     franchise               fees,     even    if    they are              available,

must    be equal to           zero)      .         The situation          is    therefore formally
identical       to     the     situation of                    "direct"        competition berween
producers that           we    already characterized.                          Ac    the        end of        this

subgame,       the    wholesale                  and   rerail prices            are        equal        to     the

"competirive"         price         qc       ,    retail       profits are zero and producers

get the "competitive"               profits.

        ii)    Let     us      now           suppose          that     producers           have        assigned
exclusive territories to                          their       retailers.        These arrangements
eliminate intra-brand competition and thus each retailer enjoys

monopolistic power over some fixed fraction of the final demand
for his       product.        Given the producers'                      prices        i         and      P2     at

the second stage some retail price equilibrium will emerge,

                          each retail price is a function of the
(4(p1,p2)     q(p1,p2)):
two producers' prices; note that franchise fees, which should be

                                                          S
viewed as fixed costs, can alter the retailers'                                        decisions about

distributing or not a product, but do not change the price
response function.  For simplicity, we will again assume

symmetry:

                                                    —
                  Vx,yeR÷       ,
                                     q(x,y)                 4(y,x)
        a) Suppose          first that franchise                       fees are not available.

At the first stage producer                             i     chooses a price              i   to maximize:



(3)     l         (p1-c)D1(q(p,p),q (pl.p2))
which    leads to wholesale and retail prices                                  which satisfy:

P1      P2        P       qI —       q         qe   q         (pepe)      ,   and:

(4)     p(ec)/pel/[fl(qe,qe)pl(pe,pe)+ 2(q5,q5)P2(P5,P5fl
where        P1       and       P2       respectively denote                   the elasticities of a

given    retailer's price with respect to his producer's (for                                             pi)

and the rival's (for                     p2)        wholesale prices               (P1 —   alogq/alogp)
        b)    Suppose now that producers can require                                   franchise fees.

Anticipating the                    retail price               equilibrium (which,                 as   already

noticed, is not modified by the introduction                                         of franchise fees),

the producer can recover via the franchise fees                                             the    associated

retail profits.              Thus producer                    i's      profits are given by:
                            r                                  r               r
                      *
(5)                       q1(pl,p2)            -
                                                    c)D1(q1(p1,p),q2(p,p))                     -




        The equilibrium                 condition            becomes:

(6)           (q-c)/q               —
                                        l/(E1(q,q)                 +

        Let   us briefly comment on this analysis.                                     If, as one might

normally          ex.pect,          competitive pressures result in                                P1     being

positive but less than one, and                                P2 being positive but less                  than
       then one obtains:



(7)             qe         me       PC     qC   and     qm     qf     qC



        Thus, wben exclusive territories                        ate   assigned,    equilibriua

retail        pricea are            increased    whether or not franchise fees are

required
        In the caae where franchise faes are not allowed,                              wholesala
                                                                                 ace
prices ate also higher when exclusive territoriea                                      assigned.

This     comes       fcoa       a    change     in    the    elasticity of       the   perceived

demand;       we     can    decompose this change into two effects:                       first,

the reduction of demsnd from a price                           increase is altered by the

fact     that the          retail        price of a product only partially responds
to the corceaponding wholesale price;                          secondly,   the loss of sales

is alao        decreased because the rival's retailers,                          who   then   face

higher competing retail prices, find it optimal to increase their
own prices.            This decrease in the sensitivity of demand to price

increases leads to higher wholesale price response functions and,
thus     to higher wholesale prices                        in the equilibrium.         If double

                                                                                       is if the
marginalization problems are not too important,                              (that

mark-up of retail price over wholesale price                            is not too large)



     6  Retailers that find that their wholesale prices have
increased while their competitors have not, do not simply pass on
the increase with the usual mark-up, but rather absorb some of
the cost increase themselves (i.e. 0       P1   I)     This in turn          .




induces the competitors to increase their own retail prices

then      producers            profits        also      are    higher      when       exclusive

territories         are assigned to retailers.

        In the case where franchise fees are allowed,                          then the above

analysis shows           that        under reasonable assumptions,                producers'

profits       are higher when exclusive territories                    are assigned.         Tins

comes not only from a decrease of the elasticity of the perceived

demand,       but     also    from the        fact     that,    b      assigning exclusive
territories          to their    retailers,         producers generate higher retail

for      q       and    conversely.           The     intersection of the two is the

retailer equilibrium,            which we have denoted by                 qjt(p1,p2
can     easily       trace     out     how    the retail         price     changes      as    the

wholesale       price        changes,        simply by        seeing     how    the    reaction

functions shift,
        Producers take these reactions into account in calculating
their    optimal price, for a given wholesale price of their rival.

        Similar effects are present in the context analyzed by
Bonannon-Vickers l987]. Two situations are there compared:     the
first one corresponds to what we called "direct competition"
between producers; in the second one, each producer delegates to
a single agent the distribution of his good.   Formally, the first
situation is similar to the situation where each product is
distributed via perfectly competitive retailers, while the second
situation (delegation) corresponds to exclusive territories in
our framework.

                                                11.
Thus,    in    figure        2 we    have    plotted the wholesale price                     reaction

function.            The   market equilibrium is                   the      intersection of          the

reaction function.              The market equilibrium is the intersection of

the reaction functions.

        We     can     see     the    effects of          the        alternative contractual

arrangements          in Figure 2.          The solid line represents the reaction

function         without         exclusive          territories,                the    dotted       line

represents the reaction function with exclusive territories,                                         but

without franchise fees, and the dashed line the reaction function

with exclusive territories                    and       franchise fees.                Our   previous

calculations          verify that exclusive territories                         increase wholesale

prices, by shifting the response functions upwards.8



IV.     COMMENTS
        In     the    model just        analyzed,         the producers are                 presumably

better        off     when     exclusive territories                      are    assigned      to    the

distributors.              Tt does     not    a    priori       imply       that      producers will

indeed assign exclusive territories                           to     their      retailers (unless

they     can    cooperatively agree                to    do   so)     .     A    possible way        for

analyzing            the      producers'       choices          of        vertical      arrangements

 consists      in introducing          a new stage at the                 beginning of the game,

where each           producer chooses             between competition and exclusive

 territories          for his retailers.                Rey-Stiglitz [1985] provides an

 example       where         aaaigning exclusive territories                          and    requiring


         Other comparisons  (of profits, retail prices,                                      atc)    are
 dependent upon particular parameter values.

franchise fees      l.a   actually a dominant strategy for each producer,

although    the    corresponding outcome is Pareto                      dominated by       the

outcome associated to the situation where both producers commit

themselves to        assign       exclusive         territories     and    to    require no
franchise fees (there is thus                a   standard "prisoners'            dilemma')

This example highlights the potential role of vertical restraints

for   decreasing          competition between             the     producers       and     also

emphasizes the            divergence between            collective        and    individual

rationality:        two phenomena which were                 ignored      in most of       the

previous analyses of vertical restraints.9
      Indeed in this             analysis,       retailers      can be     considered as

 black boxes" or "response machines:                      by modifying the vertical

arrangements       proposed to          this        retailers,     a    producer        simply
commits himself to respond in                a   given way        to any change of his

rivals'   attitudes.           Of course   if all possible             response machines'
were available,       complete collusion would then be achievable (see
Katz [l9B7J); the question therefore is to define the admissible

"black boxes".             In    this   respect,       vertical restraints can              be

viewed as   a     natural tool for constructing more efficient response

machines,    i.e.    response machines which enable the producers to
decrease competition amongst themselves.                        (In addition, vertical

restraints such           as    exclusive territories             may     be    more    easily


        Telser [l960J and Posner [l977} suggested that RPM could
help producers in sustaining collusion by reducing their interest
in wholesale price cuts.       It has also been suggested that
exclusivity requirements (such as exclusive dealing) can serve to
deter entry, as they compel the potential entrants to set up
their own distribution networks.

      This analysis sheds new tights on the economic effect of                                 the

use of vertical restraints on markets performance and social
welfare.        Till       now,    two        extreme           situations       were    mainly

considered:         the    first     one refers             to    perfectly competitive

markets, where only efficiency arguments can explain the use of
these restraints; the second situation corresponds to the case of

a    monopolistic         producer      and,           although     private       and     social

interests may conflict,           at least from the .private point of view

efficiency arguments may still, to some extent, be relevant.                                   But

if one considers a situation where there is isperfect competition

among producers (which is generally true in the widely discussed
cases involving the use of vertical restraints),                                  then a new

motivation Ippears:          vertical restraints may be used to decrease

                                              14
competition between producers;         this usually has a negative impact

on   social     welfare,    the   gain       in   additional        profits    beLng
overwhelmed by the loss of consumers' surplua.                     While   the above

snalysia   ia   very partial,     it   auggests     a   new    approach for the
economic      theory   of   vertical        restraints,       an    approach    with

important policy implications.
