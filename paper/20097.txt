                                             ABSTRACT

In this paper we estimate the causal income elasticity of smoking participation, cessation, and cigarette
demand conditional upon participation. Using an instrumental variables (IV) estimation strategy we
find that smoking appears to be a normal good among low-income adults: higher instrumented income
is associated with an increase in the number of cigarettes consumed and a decrease in smoking cessation.
 The magnitude and direction of the changes in the income coefficients from our OLS to IV estimates
are consistent with the hypothesis that correlational estimates between income and smoking related
outcomes are biased by unobservable characteristics that differentiate higher income smokers from
lower income smokers.

       I. Introduction

       Prices and income are central to the standard economic model of consumer demand.

Estimates of the price-elasticity of cigarette demand continue to attract a great deal of

attention because of their relevance to the role of excise taxes in tobacco control. In

contrast, estimates of the income-elasticity of cigarette demand currently seem to attract

much less attention from either economists or policy makers, and income is often considered

only tangentially as a control variable or in the context of the regressivity of cigarette

taxation.1 In this paper, we focus on estimating the ‘causal income-elasticity,’ that is, the

causal effect of income on smoking, for lower-income adults. We use data from multiple

waves between 1993 and 2007 of the Current Population Survey (CPS) Tobacco Use

Supplements (TUS) matched to the CPS Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC).

To address the potential endogeneity between income and smoking we adopt an instrumental

variables (IV) identification strategy, where our IV is based on changes in the benefit

parameters of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).

       The income-elasticity of cigarette demand deserves more attention in its own right as

an interesting example of the basic economics of health behaviors. Existing evidence seems

to suggest that whether the income elasticity is positive or negative varies systematically

across time periods, countries, and demographic groups. For high-income countries like the

U.S. the sign appears to have reversed over time, so that cigarettes appear to have switched

from being a normal good to an inferior good (Wasserman et al. 1991; Cheng and Kenkel

2010). Across the world the prevalence of smoking tends to be higher in low- and

middle-income countries than in high-income countries, but within low- and middle-income

countries, cigarettes might still be a normal good (Bobak et al. 2000; Peck 2011). In the

Grossman (1972) model, the demand for a good like cigarettes is partly derived from the

demand for health, so these patterns might reflect the relative income elasticities of the
                                                               Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 3



demand for smoking as a pleasurable activity versus the income elasticity of the demand for

health. Alternatively, the empirical patterns might reflect endogeneity bias. Studies that

estimate the income-elasticity of smoking typically treat income as exogenous, but sometimes

note their skepticism about this assumption. For example, after reporting their estimate that

cigarettes are an inferior good, Colman and Remler (2008) immediately mention possible

omitted variable biases and admit that it might seem unlikely that smoking would really

decline if income were exogenously increased. The focus of our paper is on the fundamental

empirical question: Do the observed patterns reflect the causal impact of an exogenous

increase of income on smoking?

       The income-elasticity of cigarette demand also deserves more attention because of its

policy relevance. The association between low-income and smoking in the U.S. is strong: in

2010 33 percent of adults earning less than $15,000 per year smoked, compared to only 11

percent of adults earning more than $50,000 per year.2 If this association at least in part

reflects causation, anti-poverty programs could help reduce smoking and prevent

smoking-related diseases. Knowing the impact of an exogenous increase of income on

cigarette demand thus allows more complete policy analysis of anti-poverty programs that

takes into account smoking-related changes in health. The causal income-elasticity of

cigarette demand is also related to policy concerns about disparities in health associated with

socioeconomic status more broadly. In an influential paper in medical sociology and public

health, Link and Phelan (1995) argue that social conditions are indeed the “fundamental

causes of disease.” The direct implication is that a wide range of policies from the minimum

wage laws to head-start programs intended to reduce socioeconomic disparities can also help

reduce health disparities (Phelan, Link, and Tehranifar 2010). Of course, income differences

are only one aspect of socioeconomic status, and as Deaton (2002) points out: “Quite

different policies are called for to deal with health in relation to income, education, or social
                                                              Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 4



class.” However, whether the focus is narrowly on income or more broadly on

socioeconomic status, the policy implications hinge crucially on whether the observed

associations with health-related behaviors like smoking are causal. An alternative

explanation is that unobserved individual-level heterogeneity, such as differences in risk- and

time-preference, might be the true underlying cause of the individual’s income and smoking.

Unless anti-poverty programs also change these preferences, other public health policies will

be needed to reduce smoking among the low-income population.3

       Our study of the causal effect of income on smoking parallels research on the causal

nature of the schooling-smoking gradient (Kenkel, Lillard, and Mathios 2006; Currie and

Moretti 2003; de Walque 2007; Aizer and Stroud 2010), the schooling-health gradient more

broadly (Cutler and Lleras-Muney 2010; Grossman 2006), and the income-health gradient

(Deaton 2004). Our new estimates of the causal effects of income on smoking also

complement research on the impact of the business cycle on health behaviors and outcomes

(Ruhm 2005, 2000). Moreover, our estimates quantify the potential of income maintenance

and anti-poverty programs as policy tools to reduce smoking.

       In order to identify the causal effect of income on smoking, we implement an

instrumental variable identification strategy that exploits exogenous changes in income

generated by changes in the parameters of federal and state EITC programs. Targeted at

low-income working families, the EITC is the nation’s second largest antipoverty program

for the non-elderly, with federal expenditures of $57.9 billion and 25.9 million recipients in

tax year 2009 (IRS 2011). Over our study time period (1993 – 2007), the federal government

significantly expanded the EITC program. For example, the maximum federal EITC benefit

available to taxpayers with two or more children increased in real terms from $1,678 in 1993

to $3,650 in 2007.4 Over our study period a number of states also launched their own EITC

programs, and many state programs adjusted their credits both upward and downward. As a
                                                               Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 5



result, the instrument we use –the state/year maximum value of EITC benefits – shows

substantial variation. Our IV strategy is similar to the strategy employed by Schmeiser (2009,

2012) to examine the effect of income and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,

respectively, on obesity.

       Our IV estimates differ substantially from Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimates.

Broadly similar to previous research, our OLS estimates suggest that smoking is inferior: the

total elasticity of demand with respect to income is -0.078, and the income elasticity of

smoking cessation is positive. In contrast, our IV estimates imply that smoking is a normal

good: the total elasticity of cigarette demand with respect to income is 5.62, and the income

elasticity of smoking cessation is negative. The direction of the changes in the coefficients

supports the argument that OLS estimates of the effect of income on smoking are

substantially biased by the unobservable characteristics of higher-income smokers.



       II. Background

       To set the stage for our empirical study, it is useful to briefly go back to the basics of

the standard model of consumer demand. One of the most basic comparative static exercises

is the income expansion path and the related Engel curves that trace out how the consumption

bundle changes as income increases (for example,Varian 1978, pp.87-88). Under homothetic

preferences the income expansion path is a straight line and all income-elasticities are unitary.

Under more general preferences, the income expansion path can bend towards one good or

another, or in the case of an inferior good, it can even bend backwards. The comparative

static exercise is a thought experiment about what we can learn about an individual’s

preferences by observing consumption choices at different incomes. In other words, the

standard model focuses on the causal income-elasticity that shows how consumption changes

in response to an exogenous change in income.
                                                               Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 6



       However, empirical demand studies do not typically use data that correspond to the

thought experiment just described. Cross-sectional surveys, such as the CPS, provide data on

the smoking behaviors of different consumers who have different levels of income.

Heterogeneity makes it difficult to use these data to learn about an individual consumer’s

preferences for smoking at exogenously different income levels. For example, as mentioned

above, higher-income consumers might tend to have different risk- and time-preferences,

which play central roles in more complete models of health-related and addictive

consumption (Grossman 1972; Becker and Murphy 1988). Higher-income individuals may

associate a social stigma with smoking based on their peer groups, whereas lower income

individuals are less likely to stigmatize smoking (Bell et al. 2010). This differential stigma

by income may further bias the OLS estimates found in previous studies. Another possibility

is that the smoking behaviors of different consumers who have different levels of income

simply reflect differences in tastes for smoking as a pleasurable activity. Economic theory

does not provide much guidance as to why tastes for smoking might vary with income, so a

priori it is hard to predict how this might bias estimates of the causal income-elasticity.

       To the best of our knowledge, few previous empirical studies make serious efforts to

control for individual heterogeneity or other sources of endogeneity bias, when estimating the

income-elasticity of smoking behaviors. The exceptions are three recent papers studying the

effect of the EITC expansion on women’s smoking behavior exclusively. The first, Averett

and Wang (forthcoming), use a difference-in-difference-in-differences with fixed effects

estimation procedure, exploiting variation in EITC credits of mothers with two and more than

two children, before and after the 1993 EITC expansion, and amongst mothers with high and

low education levels. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979, they find that the

probability of smoking for mothers with two or more children declined relative to those with

only one child. Second, Cowan and Tefft (2012) use a difference-in-differences strategy
                                                              Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 7



before and after the 1993 EITC expansion with data from the Behavioral Risk Factor

Surveillance System to show that the expansion decreased the likelihood of smoking for

young, single, low-educated women. Third, Hoynes, Miller, and Simon (2012) also employs

a difference-in-differences strategy for two EITC expansions with data from the U.S. Vital

Statistics to find that an increase in EITC income lowers the incidence of low birth weights

for single, low-educated mothers. This operates largely through an increase in pre-natal care

and a decrease in smoking for low-educated mothers.

       The following analysis differentiates itself from the previous work along four

dimensions. First, this study uses an IV identification strategy to investigate the impact of

income on smoking behaviors, exploiting intensive margin shifts in state-year EITC

maximum payments. Second, we are the first to examine smoking behavior of all

low-income individuals. Third, this paper explores three dependent variables: probability of

cessation, propensity to smoke, and the number of cigarettes consumed, allowing us to

estimate the elasticity of income for multiple smoking behaviors. Fourth, we are the first to

document a causal relationship between income and smoking using the pairing of the Current

Population Survey (CPS) Tobacco Use Supplement (TUS) and the CPS Annual Social and

Economic Supplement (ASEC).


A. The Earned Income Tax Credit Program

       To address potential endogeneity bias in estimates of the income-elasticity of

smoking, we use an IV approach, where the EITC provides an exogenous source of variation

in income. The EITC is a wage supplement program for low-income workers administered

through the tax system. The EITC is the second largest antipoverty program for the

non-elderly, having only recently been surpassed in annual expenditures by the Supplemental

Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The EITC functions as a wage supplement, accruing

only to households with eligible labor earnings. The precise benefit amounts depend on
                                                              Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 8



earnings, marital status, and the number of eligible children in the tax unit. The program has

three earnings ranges used to calculate benefits: the phase-in, plateau, and phase-out ranges.

Total benefits rise at a fixed rate with additional wage earnings in the phase-in range of the

credit. Once the maximum benefit amount is reached, benefits remain constant for wage

earnings in the plateau region, and then decline at a fixed rate for earnings in the phase-out

region until the benefit reaches a value of zero.

       The benefit amount varies substantially by the number of eligible children in the tax

unit, and the relative value of benefits by number of children has also varied substantially

over the past 25 years. As the EITC has evolved, the schedules for families without children,

families with one child, and families with two or more children have changed at different

times. In addition to the federal EITC, 22 states and the District of Columbia provide their

own supplemental EITC programs for tax year 2011. Their credits are set at a percentage of

the federal EITC benefit and vary in their refund-ability. For example, New York State has a

credit set at 30 percent of the federal EITC that is fully refundable. Thus a family earning the

maximum federal benefit of $5,751 for tax year 2011 would also receive $1,725 from New

York State.5 Since the first state EITC supplement was implemented in 1986 these programs

have been implemented in 24 states at varying times, with varying credits, and varying

changes in the credit rate. Figure 1 shows how the average real combined maximum of state

and federal benefits by number of children varies over our study period.

       Expansions of the state and federal EITC provide a plausibly exogenous source of

variation in income through their effect on labor supply incentives and have been used in

previous studies as instruments for income and program participation (Schmeiser 2009,

2012). The theoretical effect of the EITC on the decision to work for unmarried individuals

is unambiguously positive. For married women the effect of the EITC on their decision to

enter or exit the labor force is more ambiguous given the interaction with their husband’s
                                                              Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 9



labor supply. For those already in the labor force the theoretical effect of the EITC on hours

worked depends on the region of the EITC into which the worker’s labor earnings place them.

The three distinct credit regions of the federal EITC program — the phase-in, plateau, and

phase-out — each yield their own labor supply incentives for workers already in the labor

force. In the phase-in region the EITC supplements wages, so as long as the substitution

effect from higher effective wages dominates the income effect, people will desire to increase

hours worked. In the plateau region the EITC simply increases income without altering the

wage rate and thus only the income effect exists, resulting in a desire to reduce hours worked.

In the phase-out region of the EITC both the income and substitution effect induce workers to

desire fewer hours as the credit is reduced for every additional dollar of labor earnings.

       The different regions of the EITC, with their differential effects on desired hours of

work, raise the theoretical possibility that the use of the EITC as an instrument violates the

monotonicity assumption required of an IV. With a sufficiently high elasticity of labor

supply and the ability to choose the number of hours worked it is possible that an expansion

of the EITC could actually reduce overall income. For example, an individual who becomes

eligible for the EITC through an expansion of the credit and is in the phase-out range could

potentially be induced to reduce hours sufficiently to reduce their total income. However, the

empirical research into the effect of the EITC on labor supply provides little evidence that the

credit has much effect on the intensive margin of labor supply (hours worked) and no

evidence of an elasticity of labor supply sufficiently high to induce a reduction in overall

income.6

       A wide range of studies that have evaluated past EITC expansions using a variety of

econometric techniques conclude that the credit is an effective means of increasing the labor

supply and thus the income of low-wage workers (Liebman 1998; Eissa and Liebman 1996;

Meyer and Rosenbaum 2001; Hotz and Scholz 2006). The majority of these studies find that
                                                             Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 10



the effect of the EITC on income is driven by changes along the extensive margin

(individuals entering or exiting the labor market), with large increases in the labor force

participation of single women with children. However, there is some evidence that the EITC

reduces participation by married women (Eissa and Hoynes 2006). The EITC has also been

found in some studies to generate variation in labor supply at the intensive margin (number of

hours worked by those currently in the labor force). For example, Eissa and Hoynes (2006)

find a modest one to four percent reduction in annual hours worked amongst married women;

however, they find no evidence of a reduction in hours for single women, even those in the

phase-out region of the credit. Eissa and Liebman (1996) find that the 1986 EITC expansion

resulted in a small increase in the hours worked for single women already in the labor force.

When the effect on hours worked is dissagregated by region of the EITC they find no

reduction in hours worked for women in the phase-out region. When individuals have greater

control over their hours worked and total earnings there is more evidence of responsiveness:

Saez (2009) finds bunching at the first EITC kink-point by the self-employed. As with all

IVs, our results represent a local average treatment effect (LATE) specific to these

low-income families that respond to the EITC.


       III. Data

       We use data from multiple waves of the Current Population Survey (CPS) Tobacco

Use Supplement (TUS) which we then match to the CPS Annual Social and Economic

Supplement (ASEC). The TUS contains detailed information on current and previous year

smoking status, smoking cessation, and tobacco consumption. The ASEC contains detailed

information on income, employment, and family demographics. This gives us the ability to

both include specifics of individuals' smoking behavior and specific information regarding all

individuals' incomes and demographics in determining how income affects smoking

decisions. Additionally, we construct a database of average cigarette prices by state and year
                                                            Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 11



from Orzechowski and Walker’s The Tax Burden on Tobacco: Historical Compilation

(2006). To create our IV, we use information from the University of Kentucky’s Center for

Poverty Research on state and federal maximum EITC benefits for families with zero, one, or

two or more children (University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research 2011).7 We use

state and year variation in EITC benefits by number of children as our instrumental variable

for income. We match the appropriate maximum benefit value to the individuals in our

sample by state of residence, survey year, and the number of own children in their family.

We further recognize that by using the EITC as an instrument, we look specifically at

transitory income, and thus are limited to estimating short-run income elasticities.

       Pairing TUS and ASEC data gives us eight years of repeated cross sections, covering

all 50 states and the District of Columbia for the following years: 1993, 1996, 1999, 2001,

2002, 2003, 2006, and 2007. In order to obtain respondents from this vast geography across

the United States, the CPS oversamples individuals in small states. In addition, there are

systematic differences in response rates amongst different populations. Thus, we use sample

weights throughout our study in order to control for the complex sampling and stratification

used in the collection of the CPS data.

       Because the EITC is only a useful IV for potentially eligible individuals, we limit our

sample to low-income adults, defined as adults who have a family income under $45,000 in

2011 dollars. This value is just beyond the end of the EITC phase-out region for families

with two or more eligible children.8 Because our sample is restricted to adults, we focus on

smoking participation, the number of cigarettes smoked per day conditional upon

participation, and cessation, but not smoking initiation because most individuals who are

smokers start smoking by age 21 (DeCicca, Kenkel, and Mathios 2008). Moreover, since

additional benefit programs exist for retirees, and their health incentives and behaviors may
                                                             Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 12



differ from younger persons, we restrict the sample to those individuals less than 60 years of

age.

       Table 1 shows the trends over our study period for our dependent variables smoking

participation, daily cigarette consumption, and cessation using the weighted sample. The first

variable, smoker, indicates whether or not any individual sampled ever smoked in the given

year. This includes casual and infrequent smokers, as well as daily smokers. Over our study

period, the probability that anyone smoked in a given year ranges between 26.8 and 33.1

percent. Limiting the sample to only those who smoked in a given year, the average number

of cigarettes smoked decreased steadily from over 16 cigarettes per day in 1993 to just over

13 cigarettes per day in 2007. The probability that a daily smoker quit ranged from about 6.5

to 9.5 percent a year. There is a spike in the cessation rate in 1999, which we speculate might

be related to the nicotine patch becoming available over-the-counter (Avery et al. 2007), or

the anti-smoking publicity and price hike associated with the 1998 Master Settlement

Agreement between the tobacco industry and the states.9

       Table 2 displays the sample-weighted descriptive statistics for the control variables

used in the analysis, which account for race, gender, age, marital status, education, and the

number of young children in the household. In addition to showing the demographics for the

individuals in the dataset as a whole, we disaggregate the data by income group—the lowest

tercile, the middle tercile, and those with incomes in the top tercile of the income distribution

within our sample—in order to observe the differences in what we call “low," “middle," and

“high" income.10 We see that within the sample, higher income individuals are less likely to

have a female head of household and less likely be a minority household than lower income

households. At the same time, these higher income households are more educated and more

likely to have a married head of the household. There are no systematic differences by

whether or not a household has a child under age six, though we do see that the higher
                                                             Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 13



income group is less likely to have multiple children under age six. On average, the highest

income tercile receives the highest amount of EITC benefits.11 This distribution of likely

EITC eligibility in our sample suggests that those affected by our IV are likely to fall into the

phase-in region of the EITC, where higher benefits result in increased labor force

participation and additional hours worked amongst eligible individuals. We provide further

analysis of the labor supply response to changes in the maximum EITC benefits within our

sample below.

        In Table 3, we present the averages of the dependent variables based on these three

income groups.12 Amongst the low-income families that comprise our sample, those with the

lowest income have the highest probability of smoking and the lowest probability of cessation

when compared to the other two income groups. Table 3 thus shows that the correlation

between income and cessation is positive even when restricting the sample to those with

income below $45,000 per year. However, we do see that the higher income groups have a

higher average daily consumption of cigarettes.


        IV. Methods

        As discussed above, the relationship between income and smoking may be

endogenous. In order to identify the causal effect of income on smoking, we implement an

instrumental variable identification strategy. Specifically, we estimate an equation of the

form:

(1)                                                                       ,

where      is a dependent variable that explains individual smoking decisions.        contains

observable individual, state, and time covariates such as socioeconomic status, ethnicity,

marital status, education, and other important demographics. In our baseline OLS models, we

use        to capture the family income of individual i at time t, indexed to 1997 dollars. We

take the log of income to address the skewness. To address the endogeneity of income and

smoking we use the maximum EITC benefit amount as an instrument in the first stage of our

two-staged least squares specification. Equation 1 also contains the real price of cigarettes in

each state and year,    . In addition, we include a linear time trend, as well as state level

fixed effects,   , to capture any time invariant state level unobservables that may affect

income and smoking behavior simultaneously. We are careful to again weight all of our

observations in order to provide estimates that are nationally representative and account for

the complex survey design of the CPS.13

        While unobserved state-level characteristics may influence smoking behavior, these

characteristics may not be correlated with individual-level income. These state-level

unobservables are even less likely to drive the variation in individual level income created by

cross-state and cross-year variation in the EITC. We therefore provide estimates where we

remove the state fixed effects and instead include the measure of state anti-smoking sentiment

from DeCicca et al (2008) to control for state-level variation in public attitudes about

smoking, where this variable varies across states and within a state over time. By removing

the state fixed effects we are able to exploit the cross-state variation in the maximum value of

EITC benefits rather than simply relying on within-state variation in maximum EITC

benefits.

        We focus on three different dependent variables to characterize smoking behavior:

whether or not an individual has smoked in the last year, cessation, and average daily

consumption of cigarettes. Smoking participation and cessation are both binary variables.

Cessation is conditional on the individual being a daily smoker in the last year. The number

of cigarettes is treated as a continuous variable, as it ranges from one to 99 per day, with a

mean of 16.5 cigarettes (a little less than a pack a day) for smokers. When using the number

of cigarettes as a dependent variable, we limit the sample to smokers, and we take the natural

log of this variable in our analysis. Given the inclusion of state and year fixed effects in most
                                                             Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 15



of our models, as well as the continuous nature of our dependent variable in the first stage of

our IV model, we estimate Equation (1) as a Linear Probability Model (LPM) for ease of

calculation and interpretation (Angrist and Pischke 2008).14,15 While the elasticity is easily

defined for the log-log specification regarding the number of cigarettes, we calculate the

income elasticity for the remaining specifications as ɛ    = ̅ , where ̅ is alternatively the

average rate of smoking in the sample and the average cessation rate.16


       V. Results

       As a baseline, we first estimate the standard naïve OLS specification for the effect of

family income on smoking, where income is assumed to be econometrically exogenous.17

The models include controls for minority, age, gender, education (high school graduate or

attended college at some point, or no high school degree), marital status, and number of

children under six, as well as a linear time trend. Table 4 reports the coefficient estimates

from the standard OLS specification with state fixed effects in Columns (1) through (3) and

without state fixed effects, but controlling for the state anti-smoking sentiment (SASS) in

Columns (4) through (6). The second last row of Table 4 shows the income elasticity

calculated from the coefficient on family income. The three columns for each of the two

groups in Table 4 correspond to the dependent variables: current smoking status; the log of

the number of cigarettes smoked per day conditional on being a smoker; and smoking

cessation, conditional on smoking the previous year.

       The coefficient estimate on income presented in Column (1) indicates that increases in

an individual's income are associated with a decreased probability of being a smoker. If we

naïvely interpret this as a causal income elasticity, as shown at the bottom of Column (1), we

obtain an income elasticity estimate of -0.078 for being a smoker, significant at the 1 percent

level. The estimated income elasticity of the number of cigarettes smoked per day

conditional on being a smoker is extremely small and statistically indistinguishable from
                                                                 Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 16



zero. The total elasticity of the demand for cigarettes with respect to income is the sum of the

participation elasticity from Column (1) and the conditional demand elasticity from Column

(2), which in this case is effectively just the participation elasticity of -0.078. In Column (3),

the positive coefficient indicates that the income elasticity of smoking cessation is positive,

meaning that an increase in income is associated with an increase the probability that an

individual will quit smoking. The estimated income elasticity of cessation is 0.051,

significant at the 1 percent level.

        Next, in Columns (4) through (6) of Table 4 we present the estimates where we drop

the state fixed effects and instead include the DeCicca et al (2008) measure of state

anti-smoking sentiment.18 The coefficient estimates on income for each specification are

very similar to those estimated with fixed effects, and the statistical significance remains

consistent as well. In Column (4) income elasticity for being a smoker is -0.079, significant

at the 1 percent level. The estimated income elasticity of the number of cigarettes smoked

per day conditional on being a smoker presented in Column (5) is again statistically

indistinguishable from zero, but has increased in magnitude ten times to 0.001. Lastly, in

Column (6), the estimate for the income elasticity of smoking cessation is effectively

identical to that found in Column (3).19 Although not the focus of this paper, broadly in line

with previous estimates, we also find that higher prices reduce smoking participation and

increase smoking cessation.

        Our baseline results are broadly in line with previous estimates suggesting that

smoking is an inferior good in the U.S. over our sample time period. For example, Colman

and Remler (2008) estimate that the elasticity of smoking participation with respect to income

is -0.18 and the conditional elasticity is -0.02, for a total elasticity of -0.2.20

        In our preferred specification, we treat income as an endogenous determinant of

smoking. We instrument for income using the maximum value of federal and state EITC
                                                              Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 17



benefits. Before turning to our new estimates of the causal income elasticity, it is important to

consider evidence on the strength and validity of our IV. In Table 5, we report the first-stage

results and all the F-statistics. The samples differ across the various first-stage estimates,

corresponding to the different dependent variables used in the second stage. The F-statistics

in the first stage of the IV exceed the Stock and Yogo (2002) 10 percent critical value in

Columns (1), (2), (4), and (5). In the sample restricted to individuals who self-identified as

smokers in the last year, the F-statistics are somewhat lower, closer to 8.4. A standard rule of

thumb for detecting weak IVs is that the first-stage F-statistic should exceed 10. Given

evidence of a border-line weak IV in some specifications, we choose a just-identified

specification as an approach to address any potential weak IV problem. This choice is

consistent with Angrist and Pischke’s recommendation: "Just-identified IV is median

unbiased and therefore unlikely subject to a weak instruments critique" (Angrist and Pischke

2008). The sign of the coefficient on the IV is in the expected positive direction and suggests

that a higher EITC tends to increase family income. The magnitude of the EITC effect on

income is small. This is not unexpected, because the EITC effect on income is through labor

supply. 21

       To further corroborate the validity of our first-stage results, we estimate an auxiliary

regression of the effect of our IV on labor force participation. This allows us to test whether

we see the same extensive margin response to changes in the state and federal maximum

EITC as found in previous literature. The results presented in Table 6 show that with both

state fixed effects (exploiting within state, cross-year variation) and without state fixed effects

(exploiting cross-state and cross-year variation), an increase in the maximum EITC benefit

amount increases an individual’s probability of labor force participation. We expect that

some of our identification will come from individuals who work more hours in response to
                                                             Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 18



changes in the EITC schedule, but the majority of the first stage identification will come from

an extensive margin response to the EITC.

       We note that our specification assumes that labor force participation only affects

cigarette demand through its effect on income. That is, using the EITC as an IV we are

unable to separately identify an income effect versus a labor force participation effect on

cigarette demand. Our results could therefore be interpreted as an estimate of the

combination of the income effect and the labor force participation effect, to the extent that

labor force participation affects cigarette demand. Labor force participation might have an

independent effect on cigarette demand if, for example, it exposes the smoker to a worksite

smoking ban or otherwise limits their ability to smoke, and the reduction in smoking during

work is not offset by an increase in smoking when not at work. Although the main goal of a

worksite smoking ban is to reduce secondhand smoke, some studies suggest that they also

reduce cigarette demand (Evans, Farrelly, and Montgomery 1999). Thus our IV estimate

might somewhat understate the income elasticity of demand for cigarettes if increased labor

supply reduces cigarette consumption.

       Table 7 presents the second stage IV estimates of the impact of income on smoking.

In sharp contrast with the OLS results in Table 4, the IV estimates imply that smoking is a

normal good. In Column (1) additional income is estimated to increase the probability of

being a smoker, with an income elasticity of 3.58, significant at the 1 percent level. In

Column (2), income also has a positive effect on the log number of cigarettes smoked daily

and is now significant at the 1 percent level. The total elasticity of demand with respect to

income (the sum of the participation elasticity and the conditional demand elasticity) is now

estimated to be 5.62, so in standard terminology smoking is not only a normal good but is

also a luxury good, at least in our low-income sample. Consistent with smoking being a
                                                              Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 19



normal good, in Column (3) we estimate that the income elasticity of smoking cessation is

negative and statistically significant.

        We again estimate the IV without state fixed effects and controlling for the SASS.

These results are presented in Columns (4) through (6) of Table 7. Each of these estimates

and their statistical significance are similar to those found when state fixed effects are

included. In Column (4) we estimate the income elasticity of being a smoker to be 3.80,

significant at the 1 percent level. In Column (5), we again find that income has a positive

effect on the number of cigarettes consumed; although the estimated elasticity is somewhat

smaller at 1.90, statistically significant at the 1 percent level. The total elasticity of demand

with respect to income is 5.70, which is extremely close to the 5.62 found in the fixed effects

specification. Lastly, in Column (6) we again find that the income elasticity of smoking

cessation is negative and similar in magnitude and statistical significance to Column (3).

        To judge the plausibility of the elasticity of demand for cigarettes generated from our

IV estimates we calculate the implied marginal propensity to consume (MPC) from an

additional dollar of income. The average smoker in our sample has a family income of

$22,532.87 in 1997 dollars and consumes 16.5 cigarettes per day at a cost of $0.113 per

cigarette. This yields total annual expenditures on cigarettes of $680.54, or 3.02 percent of

family income. Using a conditional demand elasticity of 2.041 from our model with state

fixed effects, the higher of our elasticity estimates, a 10 percent increase in income

($2,253.29) would yield a 20.41 percent increase in cigarette consumption amongst smokers,

or 3.37 additional cigarettes per day. The average smoker would then spend $139.00 more

per year on cigarettes (3.37*$0.113*365) out of their additional $2,253.29 in income for a

MPC of 0.061, or six cents per additional dollar of income. We believe that a smoker

spending six cents of any additional dollar earned on cigarettes is a perfectly reasonable
                                                               Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 20



estimate, particularly given that smoking consumes three percent of the average smoker’s

family income.

        There is a significant body of literature demonstrating that education is endogenous

with respect to smoking intensity (Bratti and Miranda 2010) and smoking status (Kenkel,

Lillard, and Mathios 2006; de Walque 2007; Tenn, Herman, and Wendling 2010). While

simultaneously addressing the endogeneity of both income and education to smoking

behavior is beyond the scope of this paper, we are sensitive to the possibility that there may

be some interaction between the unobserved correlates of income, educational attainment,

and smoking behaviors. While we see no reason why the potential endogeneity of education

would bias the estimates from our IV specification, we none the less re-estimate our models

on a sample restricted to the educationally homogenous group of individuals who are high

school graduates only. Doing so, we find results highly comparable to those found for the

full sample, with our IV coefficients on income not statistically different at the 5 percent

level. The one exception occurs with the average daily consumption dependent variable,

where we no longer find a statistically significant effect, and the magnitude of the income

elasticity (0.47) is smaller than that of the full sample (2.1). We attribute this difference to a

heterogeneous treatment effect for this homogenous sample, as well as a lack of power

resulting from cutting the sample in half. These results are available upon request.

        Across our various specifications, the differences between the OLS and IV results are

in the expected direction and suggest that the OLS estimates are biased downward by

unobservable heterogeneity associated with higher incomes. As in the income-health and

schooling-health gradients, the bias might reflect systematic differences in time- and

risk-preferences, differences in social networks or other factors.

       VI. Conclusions

       In this paper we examine the relationship between income and smoking, focusing on

the potential endogeneity of income. While our baseline OLS results are consistent with

previous estimates that smoking is now an inferior good in the U.S., our IV results imply that

smoking is a normal or even a luxury good. Our results are partly consistent with Ruhm

(2005), who finds that smoking declines during temporary economic downturns and increases

during economic expansions. However, Ruhm suggests that that this might mainly reflect

changes in non-market time available for healthy lifestyle investments. Although virtually

any IV can be criticized, we believe that our IV based on the EITC is plausibly exogenous,

and our first-stage results show no signs of a weak IV problem for the full sample. We also

note that the difference between the OLS and IV results is in the direction predicted ex ante,

and is similar to biases discussed in research on the income-health and schooling-health

gradients. These lines of argument suggest that our results should be viewed as credible

evidence that for the low-income population we study, smoking is still a normal good.

        One implication of our results is that increasing the income of low-income families

through government transfers may have the unintended health consequence of increasing

smoking and decreasing smoking cessation. Because recipients can spend cash transfers as

they like, by their nature such transfers are prone to such unintended consequences. For

example, Dobkin and Puller (2007) find that recipients of Supplemental Security Income

increase their consumption of illegal drugs when their checks arrive at the beginning of the

month, leading to increases in drug-related hospitalizations and deaths. On the other hand,

several recent studies estimate that the EITC expansions reduced maternal smoking and thus

improved infant health (Averett and Wang forthcoming; Cowan and Tefft 2012; Hoynes,

Miller, and Simon 2012). Because we study all low-income individuals and not just mothers,

our results are not necessarily consistent with these estimates; future work could explore the
                                                             Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 22



differences in more depth. Hoynes, Miller, and Simon (2012) stress that health improvements

and related external benefits should be taken into account when discussing the value of

anti-poverty programs that make up the safety net. By the same token, a complete policy

analysis of the safety net should also account for the health losses and related social costs that

could result from possible increases in smoking. In light of the unintended health

consequences, it might also make sense to couple anti-poverty programs with anti-smoking

programs targeted at low-income populations. Our results provide a cautionary tale that at

least in some circumstances, reducing socioeconomic disparities via income transfers might

not go hand-in-hand with reducing health disparities.

1. The 89 page chapter on the economics of smoking in the Handbook of Health Economics

provides a 3-sentence discussion of income-elasticity estimates (Chaloupka and Warner
                                                             Kenkel, Schmeiser, and Urban | 43




2000), compared to a 19-page section on the role of price (pp. 1546 – 1565). Recent studies

of the regressivity of cigarette taxes include Colman and Remler (2008) and Gospodinov and

Irvine (2009).

2. Author calculations using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2010

data.

3. Under the medical sociology theory that social conditions are the fundamental cause of

disease, risk- and time-preference might be viewed as factors that mediate the link between

lack of resources and unhealthy behaviors.

4. All figures used in our analysis are adjusted to 1997 constant dollars.

5. Values are 2011 nominal dollars.

6. See Eissa and Hoynes (2006) for a summary of findings on changes in hours worked in

response to the EITC and a detailed discussion of possible explanations for the limited change

along the intensive margin.

7. These data can be downloaded at: http://www.ukcpr.org/AvailableData.aspx.

8. We account for inflation and index all estimates to 1997 dollars for our analysis.

9. Levy and Meara (2006) find that the Master Settlement Agreement had a relatively small

effect on smoking; although their results are specific to women smoking during pregnancy.

10. In the CPS-ASEC, the specific question regarding income is: “How much did (name/you)

earn from employment before taxes and other deductions (last calendar year)?” This is

intended to be pre- tax/transfer income and should NOT include the EITC payments received.

11. The EITC variable is measured by our IV, which represents the maximum of state/federal

EITC credit for the number of children in the household in the given state of residence.

12. We again provide these descriptive statistics using sample weights.

13. Our results are robust to not using the sample weights both qualitatively and in terms of

statistical significance.

14. The qualitative results and statistical significance are robust to using an instrumental

variable probit specification instead of the linear probability model with our two dependent

binary variables. These are included in the Appendix. Since the daily consumption dependent

variable is approximately normally distributed, we only run a least squares specification for

this variable.

15. We find that in all specifications, nearly every within sample prediction from the linear

probability models fall between 0 and 1, validating the model selection.

16. The calculation is as follows:

17. We additionally estimate logit and probit specifications for our two dependent binary

variables to ensure that the functional form is not driving the results. The marginal effects

and statistical significance are substantively similar in these specifications. The logit results

comparable to the OLS specification, and the results from an IV probit comparable to the

2SLS specification are included in the Appendix.

18. Our results remain consistent if we exclude both the SASS variable and state fixed effects.

These are available upon request.

19. DeCicca, Kenkel and Mathios (2008) discuss the relationship between the elasticity of

smoking participation and the elasticities of cessation and initiation.

20. The Colman and Remler (2008) estimate is derived from a sample covering the full range

of income as opposed to just those earning less than $45,000 per year as done here. Our

somewhat smaller baseline elasticity of -0.078 may suggest that the income-smoking gradient

is stronger at high incomes, so in our sample with a more restricted range of incomes the

average association with income is weaker.

21. Our measure of family income is pre-tax and thus should not directly include the dollar

value of the EITC.
