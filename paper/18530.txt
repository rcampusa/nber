                                              ABSTRACT

We present new evidence on the effects of merit aid scholarship programs on residential migration
and educational attainment using Census data on 24 to 32 year olds in the U.S. from 1990 to 2010.
Eligibility for merit aid programs slightly increases the propensity of state natives to live in-state, while
also extending in-state enrollment into the late twenties. These patterns notwithstanding, the magnitude
of merit aid effects is of an order of magnitude smaller than the population treated, suggesting that
nearly all of the spending on these programs is transferred to individuals who do not alter educational
or migration behavior.

1         Introduction

Merit-based scholarships given to residents for in-state college attendance have become in-
creasingly popular. These scholarships reward students who perform above a minimum
academic level with grants, provided that they attend an in-state, postsecondary institution
– often either private or public. One of the earliest and most prominent merit aid scholar-
ships was the Georgia HOPE scholarship, which began in 1993.1 Since then, more than a
dozen other states have introduced similar programs on a large scale, with aims ranging from
incentivizing greater preparedness among high school students to increasing enrollment at
in-state institutions of postsecondary education to retaining a high skill labor force. In the
2010-2011 academic year, 28 states offered some sort of merit program, totaling $3.9 billion
in spending (NASSGAP, 2011). The expansion and popularity of these programs has driven
an extensive body of research, but the majority of it has focused on individual states or
on the short-term outcome of enrollment (Dynarski, 2000; Cornwell, Mustard and Sridhar,
2006; Orsuwan and Heck, 2008; Zhang and Ness, 2010). Since the time of the initial stud-
ies, merit-based scholarship programs have become widespread and have been in effect long
enough to impact longer-term outcomes such as lifetime schooling and migration decisions.
        In this paper, we utilize the broader geographic scope these programs now command and
their extended time horizon to build a comprehensive picture of how merit aid scholarships
affect residential migration and completed schooling levels among residents old enough to
have potentially completed their college educations. To do this, we incorporate data on the
introduction of merit aid programs for fifteen states and Decennial Census and American
Community Survey data on 24 to 32 year olds in the U.S. from 1990 to 2010 in a difference-
in-difference framework. Our identification of the programs’ effects on residential mobility
and educational attainment stems from differences in these outcomes for cohorts of residents
in states with and without merit-based scholarships before and after the programs were
    1
    We adopt the focus of Dynarski (2000, 2004) on merit aid programs with academic performance require-
ments that make them accessible to a large portion (30 percent) of residents, i.e. broad-based merit aid
programs. For more information on this classification, see Section II of Dynarski (2000, 2004).


                                                   1
introduced.
       As mentioned, much of the existing research focuses on the effect of broad-based merit
aid on overall college enrollment and enrollment specifically at in-state postsecondary in-
stitutions. By lowering the price of in-state college attendance, the merit aid scholarships
may induce some students to attend college who otherwise would not have and may also
induce students who would have out-migrated to stay in the state for college. However, if
the state aid merely crowds out federal assistance such as the Pell grant (Cornwell, Mus-
tard and Sridhar, 2006) or if tuition and fees increase with merit scholarship introduction
(Long, 2004), then enrollment increases may be offset, particularly of low-income college
attendees. That is, if supply of higher education is not perfectly elastic (Bound and Turner,
2007), the retention of students who would have otherwise migrated out of the state may
serve to crowd other students out of postsecondary institutions. Previous studies typically
find a positive effect on overall college enrollment of 18 and 19 year olds (Dynarski, 2000;
Cornwell, Mustard and Sridhar, 2006; Conley and Taber, 2011) and a concurrent increase in
in-state college attendance, particularly at four-year public postsecondary institutions (Dy-
narski, 2000; Cornwell, Mustard and Sridhar, 2006; Orsuwan and Heck, 2008; Zhang and
Ness, 2010).2
       Of equal importance is whether changes in college enrollment are translated into changes
in college completion. This will depend in part on whether the marginal student induced
to change her college-going behavior by the scholarship has the ability to complete college.
Along those lines, some states condition the scholarships on satisfactory academic perfor-
mance while in college, which may increase persistence. On the other hand, if merit aid
introduces mismatch between students and institutions (Cohodes and Goodman, 2012) or if
students are crowded out of classes by increased in-state enrollment, students may be less
likely to persist. In addition, the incidence of merit aid on non-scholarship students may
   2
    Goodman (2008) also finds that a merit-based scholarship provided only for attendance at public post-
secondary institutions of higher education increased the propensity of high school students in Massachusetts
to attend these schools.



                                                     2
be manifested in higher tuition (Long, 2004) and, as a result, may lower completion rates
among credit-constrained students. Here the results have been more mixed. Some studies
find increases in educational attainment (Dynarski, 2008; Scott-Clayton, 2011) while others
find little effect (Sjoquist and Winters, 2012a; Cohodes and Goodman, 2012). Most of these
studies have focused on one or two states, making it difficult to know whether the results
generalize to other settings.3
       Another important research question that has received less attention is whether or not the
increased likelihood of attending an in-state postsecondary institution as a result of merit-
based scholarships in turn leads to an increased likelihood of a student remaining in the home
state after graduation. If college provides location-specific human or social capital, students
who are induced to remain in their home state for college may remain in the state after
graduation. On the other hand, if the skills acquired during college are relatively portable
geographically, states with merit aid policies may find themselves paying to train the future
workforces of other states.4 Finally, educational attainment, regardless of location, has been
shown to directly increase mobility (Malamud and Wozniak, 2012). Thus, the ambiguous
effects of merit aid on attainment discussed above likewise renders the net effect of merit
aid on migration ambiguous. In two recent exceptions, Sjoquist and Winters (2012c) find
little effect of the Georgia HOPE scholarship on migration using administrative data on
enrollment and employment in Georgia, while Hickman (2009) finds a significant positive
effect of merit aid on the retention of college graduates in Florida as a result of the Florida’s
                                              5
Bright Futures Scholarship Program.               In both cases, the analysis is limited to the context
   3
     One recent exception is a contemporaneous working paper by Sjoquist and Winters (2012b) who look at
educational attainment using census data in a fashion similar to our current research design. They similarly
find no positive effect of merit aid programs on college completion.
   4
     There is a broader literature focused on the effects of attending college in a state on the probability of
remaining in the state for employment after graduation. Of particular note is Groen (2004), who addresses
the issue of selection into in-state colleges using college application choices to create comparison groups.
Groen (2004) finds modest effects of college location choice on future residential decisions. Also, see Groen
(2011) for a review of how this evidence might speak to the effect of merit aid on migration.
   5
     In Sjoquist and Winters (2012c) the comparison is of migration patterns in their Georgia administrative
data to those in other states in the Current Population Survey for cohorts of residents before and after merit
aid introduction. In Hickman (2009), the comparison is of migration patterns in the Census and ACS among
Florida-born college graduates before and after merit aid introduction.


                                                       3
of a particular state. To the extent that the Georgia or Florida programs differ from other
broad-based merit aid programs, these results may not generalize.
   Our contribution to this literature is threefold. First, the long horizon over which some
of these programs have been operating allows us to focus our analysis on a larger set of life-
cycle outcomes than previously available, most prominently residential migration. Second,
as mentioned, we expand the scope of our analysis to include fifteen states with broad based
merit aid programs. Third, the extended time horizon we use allows us check whether dif-
ferential, pre-treatment trends in migration and educational patterns among merit-adopting
states drive our difference-in-difference results.
   We have three main findings. First, we find that residents born in a merit aid state
in a cohort eligible for the scholarships are 1 percentage point (1.5 percent) more likely to
live in the state at ages 24 to 32 than those born in cohorts ineligible for such scholarships.
Second, eligible cohorts are no more likely to have ever attended college or to have received
a bachelor’s degree. In fact, our point estimates for BA attainment are negative, though
not consistently significant. Third, we find that merit-aid-eligible 24 to 32 year old residents
are 0.4 percentage points (3 percent) more likely to be currently enrolled in college without
having yet obtained a BA degree. This increased college enrollment in later years seems
entirely driven by increases in enrollment at in-state institutions. Importantly, while previous
studies have documented increased enrollment among the college-aged (e.g. 18 to 19 year
olds), ours is the first study we know of to recover a slight increase in college enrollment
among older students, aged 24 to 32 year olds.
   Unfortunately, the Census data do not allow us to definitively say whether newly retained
residents remained in-state for college or simply relocated back to the home state after
attending college elsewhere. Previous studies have found that merit aid availability at the
time of college attendance changes students’ location of college enrollment, making them
more likely to remain in their home state (Dynarski, 2000; Cornwell, Mustard and Sridhar,
2006; Orsuwan and Heck, 2008; Zhang and Ness, 2010). Therefore, it is most likely that


                                                4
the increased retention of state residents is driven by changing the decision about where to
enroll in college.
    While our estimates do suggest some scope for merit aid programs to impact outcomes,
the extent of their impact is strikingly limited. The magnitude of our effects (≤ 3 percent) is
of an order of magnitude smaller than the target population (≥ 30 percent). This suggests
that nearly all of the spending on merit aid represents a transfer to inframarginal residents
who ultimately do not alter their educational or migration decisions.
    In the next section, we briefly summarize the history and characteristics of merit-based
scholarship programs. In Section 3, we present our empirical methodology. In Section 4, we
describe our data. This is followed in Section 5 with our estimates of the program effects on
each of the aforementioned outcomes and additional robustness checks in Section 6. Finally,
we conclude in Section 7 with a synthesis of the programs’ overall effects and a discussion of
their economic significance.



2     Merit Aid Programs

Although financial aid for college that is based on a student’s achievement has been around
in some form for many decades (e.g. National Merit Scholars are often awarded scholarships
based on their performance on standardized tests), Arkansas was the first state to adopt a
state-wide merit-based scholarship in 1991. Since then, dozens of other states have followed,
spending a total of $3.9 billion during the 2010-2011 academic year (NASSGAP, 2011).
    Merit aid programs vary in their standards for award receipt. For example, in some states,
scholarship receipt requires only the maintenance of a minimum grade point average in high
school and college (e.g. Georgia) while other states also place restrictions on the minimum
standardized test scores needed in order to qualify (e.g. Tennessee). The stringency of the
requirements will alter the impact of a merit aid program. If the standards are so high
that the marginal college student in a state is unable to meet them, they are unlikely to



                                              5
change educational choices. Furthermore, programs limited in scope may prove harder to
detect if they only affect a very small fraction of the population. For this reason, we adopt
a convention of the existing literature and focus on states where the merit-based scholarship
program was lenient enough to include at least 30 percent of high school students (Dynarski,
2004).6 This leads us to focus on the 15 states that have broad-based merit aid programs.
In our most recent year of data, these states spent more than $1.4 billion per year, or $2,191
per recipient per year on merit aid.7
        Table 1 delineates the expansion of these programs over time and details their grant
limits. The programs usually, though not always, grant aid to students attending either
public or private institutions of higher education in the state. The amount of the scholarship
varies from $100 to the full cost of both tuition and fees. In eight of the 15 broad-based merit
aid states the full scholarship during the time of our data would have covered average tuition
at four-year public colleges in the state in 1999. In this way, many of these scholarships can
be considered potentially full-tuition scholarships even if they are not explicitly labeled as
such.



3         Empirical Strategy

To investigate whether merit aid scholarships affect the residential migration, college enroll-
ment, or college completion of eligible residents, we estimate the following:


                            ysct = βM eritsct + ηs + δc + γt + ΓXsct + sct                               (1)
    6
     We therefore include the states listed in Table 1, which includes all of the states in Dynarski (2004)
and two additional states that introduced programs since 2002, South Dakota and Wyoming. There are a
number of programs we do not include because of known lower eligibility levels: e.g. Massachusetts (capped
at 25%), New Jersey (15%), Texas (10%), and Washington (up to 15%). Note that much of the previous
work has focused on the merit aid programs in Georgia and Arkansas, perhaps because they were the first
states to have such programs (e.g. Dynarski, 2000, 2004; Sjoquist and Winters, 2012c). In Appendix 6.5, we
examine the pattern of results using just these early adopters and find that the patterns described here hold.
   7
     These figures are generated by the authors’ calculation of merit aid data collected from the NASSGAP
annual report (NASSGAP, 2011) and additional contact with individual state administrative offices. Data
are only available for 11 of our 15 broad-based merit aid programs



                                                      6
where ysct is the fraction of people in the cohort born in year c in state s interviewed at
the time of the survey, t, who have attained one of our outcome characteristics. Our set
of outcomes includes the following: living in one’s state of birth, BA degree attainment,
current enrollment in college, and combinations of the above outcomes (e.g. living in one’s
state of birth and having a BA degree). M eritsct is a dummy variable that equals one if an
individual born in year c in state s would have been eligible for a merit aid scholarship in
the year she turned 18, i.e. the year she would most likely have entered college.
       The fixed effects, ηs , δc and γt are state of birth, cohort and survey-year fixed effects
respectively. The vector Xsct consists of additional demographic characteristics of a cohort,
age controls, economic conditions facing the cohort in a particular survey-year and lagged
economic conditions facing the cohort at age 18, when the college-going decision was likely to
be made.8 We estimate these state-by-cohort-by-year level specifications using cell averages
over respondents, where the cell averages are computed using the person weights provided
by the Census Bureau. The cell averages in the regressions are then weighted by the number
of survey respondents represented in the cell. Standard errors are clustered at the state
level and additional inference is performed using nonparametric bootstrap and wild boot-
strap procedures (Cameron, Gelbach and Miller, 2008) as well as randomization inference
(Bertrand, Duflo and Mullainathan, 2002).
       The coefficient of interest in (1) is β, which gives the probability that a person aged
24 to 32 was induced to change their behavior because of her merit aid eligibility. The
underlying assumption in this interpretation of β is that there were not other changes in
policy or environment concurrent with the introduction of merit aid programs that affected
the college attendance, college completion and residential decisions of 24 to 32 year olds.
   8
     In most specifications, we additionally control for age patterns in our outcomes by including age fixed
effects. Obviously, the full set of cohort, survey year and age fixed effects are collinear and cannot all be
estimated. On the other hand, solely including cohort and survey year fixed effects is not sufficient for
absorbing constant differences across age groups. We therefore include a combination of cohort, survey year
and age fixed effects that, while not immediately interpretable, do absorb variation in outcomes across ages.
In Table 2, we present results with and without age fixed effects to show that the inclusion of the age fixed
effects barely changes our estimates.



                                                     7
While we are not able to directly test this assumption, we can make use of our pre-treatment
data to explore whether merit aid programs are passed in response to pre-existing trends
in outcomes across cohorts. To do so, we present results using a more flexible, event study
specification also conduct placebo tests using only pre-treatment data. In addition, we
examine the robustness of our results to including a linear trend in the number of years
between a cohort and the first treated cohort for states that introduce merit aid programs to
control for patterns that may not be captured by our observable characteristics (see Wolfers,
2006).9 Finally, we include time-varying demographic controls to mitigate concerns about
other possible changes occurring simultaneously with program introduction.
       Beyond the endogenous timing of program adoption, there is a concern that families may
sort residentially based on the availability of merit aid scholarships. For example, if families
of college-bound students move to Georgia in part because of the HOPE scholarship program,
there would be an upward bias the effect of merit aid on college attendance. For this reason,
we use a person’s state of birth rather than her state of high school attendance to determine
treatment eligibility. Though this is not how true merit aid eligibility is defined, it allows us
to avoid the bias that emigrational selection into merit aid states might cause. For example,
consider two families in Georgia giving birth to children in 1974 and 1975 respectively. We
do not expect the second family to differ from the first based on the expectation that their
child will be eligible for the HOPE scholarship in 1993. One implication of this approach is
that our estimates measure an intent-to-treat effect, given that not all residents born in a
state remain in the state until age 18. Our results will therefore understate the treatment
effect of merit aid, a point we return to in the conclusion.
   9
    Since the patterns in our event study figures we show later appear linear, we expect a linear trend to
provide the best fit. We tested this assumption by experimenting with quadratic trends as well. F-tests for
the joint significance of higher ordered polynomial terms in the cohort relative to the last treated failed to
reject the null of zero.




                                                      8
4        Data

We use public-use data on respondents ages 24 to 32 from the 1990 and 2000 Decennial
Censuses and the 2001 to 2010 American Community Survey (Ruggles et al., 2010). The
Decennial Census data we use are 5 percent samples, which are a 1-in-20 nationally repre-
sentative sampling of the U.S. population. The 2001 to 2004 American Community Surveys
(ACS) are nationally representative samples of between 1-in-232 to 1-in-261 of the U.S. pop-
ulation. The later ACS samples, from 2005 to 2010, are 1-in-100 nationally representative
samples. We select a lower bound age of 24, as a majority (85 percent) of BAs are received
by this age in our sample, and an upper bound age of 32, which ensures that at least three
treatment states are contributed to estimates for all age groups.10
       In each of the surveys, the Census Bureau collects information on place of residence,
place of birth, current enrollment in school and educational attainment, which we use to
create our three sets of dependent variables of interest.11 Specifically, we are interested in
i) residential migration, ii) degree completion, and iii) current college attendance. First,
we investigate whether merit aid eligibility makes it more likely for residents to remain in
the state in which they were born and whether high skilled people (those with who have
completed at least some college attendance and those with BAs) are more likely to live in
their state of birth. We are also interested in whether merit aid makes it more likely that
a person obtains at least a college degree (BA) or has at least some college attendance,
regardless of their place of residence.12 In addition, we examine both whether individuals
  10
      In 2010, 32 year olds in Arkanas, Georgia and Mississippi had been eligible for merit aid at age 18. In
the 2010 sample, the oldest cohorts to have been eligible for merit aid are the 37 year olds in Arkansas,
followed 35 year olds in Georgia who were the first eligible cohort in 1993. Results using 24 to 37 year olds
lead to the same conclusions and are presented in Appendix D.
   11
      In our analysis samples, we include individuals with allocated values of these key variables. If place
of birth is allocated, it could attenuate our estimates. If any of our outcomes are allocated, it will reduce
our power. Our results are generally robust to leaving out those respondents with allocated characteris-
tics, though the resulting smaller samples lead to a slight decrease in statistical power. Results excluding
individuals with allocated observations from the sample are in Appendix C.
   12
      To create educational attainment measures, we use the public-use-file variable EDUCD. A person is
categorized as having a BA degree if EDUCD is at least 101 and as having a graduate or professional degree
if EDUCD is at least 114. We would have also liked to include measures of Associates Degree attainment,
but the 2003 ACS questionnaire included a rewording of the measurement of Associate Degree attainment


                                                     9
have ever attended any college and whether they are enrolled in college at the time of the
survey. That is, we measure college enrollment during the ages of 24 to 32 in any state and,
furthermore, in the state of birth. We define college enrollment as enrollment at any level,
including both undergraduate and graduate enrollment.13
    The Decennial Census and ACS also include gender and race information that we use to
control for demographic differences across observations. To these data, we add information on
state unemployment levels from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Because economic conditions
at the point of high school graduation may affect the probability of going to college overall
and affect families’ ability to finance different types of college attendance, we control for
the unemployment rate in a cohort’s state of birth at the time of high school graduation.
Since contemporary economic conditions also affect educational investment and residential
decisions, we also control for the unemployment rate in a cohort’s state of birth at the time
of the survey.14
    Before turning to our estimates, it is worth noting that the roll out of merit aid programs
across states over time coupled with the timing of the Census data implies that the treated
states do not all contribute to our estimated effects in the same way. To illustrate, in
Figure 1 we present counts of the number of states with data for each cohort relative to
the last untreated cohort. The peak in the figure indicates that 15 states in our sample
have introduced merit aid. One state, Wyoming, introduced merit aid in 2006, too early
for anyone in our sample of people ages 24 or older in 2010 to have actually been eligible.
Therefore, only 14 states have at least one treated cohort. Note, however, that in the figure
the number of states for which we have at least five treated cohorts drops to ten and the
in way that precludes consistent comparisons across time.
   13
      Our estimates of the effects of the program on enrollment therefore include any effects on either under-
graduate or graduate enrollment. However, in results not reported here, we have separately estimated the
effects of merit aid on graduate enrollment and they were zero. So, we attribute any merit aid effect on
enrollment to its effect on undergraduate enrollment. Results are available from the authors upon request.
   14
      Contemporaneous unemployment rates may be endogenous to the policy in question, and therefore,
controlling for this may absorb some of the meaningful variation created by the policy. However, our results
are not sensitive to omitting contemporaneous unemployment as a control variable. Results are available
from the authors upon request.



                                                     10
number of states for which we have ten treated cohorts is only two. This illustrates the
unbalanced nature of our treated panel and the relative importance of the contributions of
early adopting states to our estimates.
       Panel B of Figure 1 presents counts of the number of states with data for each cohort
relative to the last untreated cohort, separately for ages 24 and 32. Here, we see the relative
importance of early adopting states for the older members of our sample in particular. While
there are at least ten states for each of the five first merit-aid-eligible cohorts of 24 year olds,
there are at most three states with eligible 32 year olds. It is for this reason that we restrict
analysis to 24 to 32 year olds in order to minimize the problem of too few treatment clusters
(Conley and Taber, 2011).15
       In Table 2, we present descriptive statistics that summarize the characteristics of our
state-cohort-year cells.16 The average demographic composition and economic conditions
are as expected given the time period studied. The average rate of migration out of one’s
state-of-birth for this sample is approximately 34 percent. The probability of receiving a BA
degree is between 23 and 27 percent. Of these, about half, or 12 to 15 percent of individuals
have a BA degree and are living in their state of birth. Meanwhile, current college enrollment
among our sample of people ages 24 to 32 is 13 percent, 8 percentage points of which is in
their state of birth.



5        Effects of Merit Aid Eligibility

5.1       Residential Migration

Our first set of estimates of the effects of merit aid eligibility focuses on the residential
migration of people of an age at which they are likely to have completed their undergraduate
schooling. Specifically, we investigate whether merit aid eligibility had any effect on the
  15
    Results using a wider range of ages are available in Appendix D,
  16
    We present data at the state-cohort-year cell, as this is the level of variation used in our subsequent
regression analysis.


                                                    11
probability that people ages 24 to 32 live in their state of birth. To answer this question,
in Table 3, we present estimates of equation (1) using various sets of comparison groups
for the states that introduce merit aid programs. In column (1), we report estimates using
all non-merit states to simulate counterfactual residential migration patterns in the absence
of the merit aid program. The estimate is positive, suggesting that merit aid eligibility for
in-state college attendance increases the probability that 24 to 32 year olds will live in their
states of birth by 0.9 percentage points. However, the estimate is not statistically significant.
In the second column, we again estimate equation (1) on the sample of all 24 to 32 year olds
in the U.S., but include a linear trend in event time to capture the differential trend in
college attendance in states with merit aid programs and those without.17 The inclusion of
the trend changes the estimate to 0.4 percentage points, although it is also not statistically
different from the estimate in the first column.
       The rest of the columns in Table 3 contain estimates of the effect of merit aid eligibility
on residential mobility using alternative sets of states as the comparison group for merit
aid states. Most states that have introduced merit aid programs have been geographically
concentrated in the southern U.S. Following Dynarski (2008), the samples in columns (3)
and (4) include merit states and any non-merit aid, Southern U.S. states, with and without
the control for the trend, respectively.18 With this comparison group, the estimated effect
increases to between 1.5 and 1.9 percentage points and is now statistically significant.
       It still may be the case that states that introduce merit aid programs are somehow
different than those that do not. To be sure that our estimates are not biased by these
types of differences, in column (5) we present estimates including only merit aid states in
the sample.19 The estimate is similar in magnitude to that in the first column, though it is
  17
     We include a linear trend in number of years between each cohort in our sample and the last cohort
ineligible for merit aid in each merit state. Note that this trend in year of birth is set to zero for the last
ineligible cohort in merit states and for all cohorts in states without merit aid programs. Henceforth, for
simplicity we will refer to this as simply the trend.
  18
     We use the set of states defined as the South region by the Census Bureau. In addition to the merit
aid states, this also includes Alabama, Delaware, Washington D.C., North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas and
Virginia.
  19
     In these specifications we do not estimate a model with a trend because with only merit states in the


                                                      12
now statistically significant. Our estimate in column (5) suggests that merit aid eligibility
increases the probability of people between the ages of 24 and 32 living in the same state in
which they were born by 1 percentage point.20 Given that about 66 percent of 24 to 32 year
olds live in their home states, this represents a decrease in mobility of about 1.5 percent.
    In Panel B of Table 3, we repeat each of the analyses described above adding age fixed
effects. This controls for any patterns of migration that differ across people of different ages.
The results are virtually unchanged from those just described. Since this remains the case in
our subsequent specifications, we henceforth only report estimates that include these fixed
effects.


5.2        Residential Migration of High Skill Workers

One major goal of merit aid programs as described by policymakers is to increase the reten-
tion of high-skilled workers in the state. To determine whether the increased retention of
residents seen in Table 3 is indeed increased retention of high-skilled residents, we examine
whether merit-aid-eligible cohorts are more likely to both live in the state and have at least
a BA degree or at least some college attendance. These results are presented in Table 4,
which has a similar structure to Table 3. In Panel A, the dependent variable represents
the outcome of both living in one’s state of birth and having a BA degree; in Panel B, it
corresponds to living in one’s state of birth and having attended at least some college.
    Looking across the columns of Panel A of Table 4, we see that merit aid generally does
not have an effect on the probability of living in the state and holding at least a BA degree.
With the exception of the first column specification, the estimated effect is nearly zero and
is not statistically significant. For example, in column (5), the estimate is -0.1 percentage
point and the standard error suggests the estimate is between -0.3 and 0.1 percentage points.
sample the trend is not separately identified from time fixed effects.
  20
     Since the estimate in column (5) comes from a specification that includes only merit aid adopting states
and controls for possible differences across states in both time-invariant and time-variant characteristics we
will, in the interest of brevity, focus on interpreting estimates from it in the following sections. However,
throughout the paper, we present all five models discussed here; generally, they produce a similar pattern of
results.

                                                     13
Overall, the results provide little evidence of an effect on the retention of BA degree holders
in-state.
   In Panel B, we see that merit aid eligibility actually had a positive effect on the likelihood
of state residents remaining in their state of birth and having completed at least some college
by ages 24 to 32. In column (5), the estimate suggests that the probability increased by 0.7
percentage points, an estimate that is statistically significant at the five percent level. Given
that the average propensity of 24 to 32 year olds to live in their state of birth and have
attended college for at least a short period of time is 35 percent, this represents a 2 percent
increase.


5.3    College Completion in Any State

Thus far, we have showed that merit aid eligibility increased the probability of living in the
state one was born in, but it did little to change the probability of both living in the state
and having a BA degree. This raises the question of whether merit-based scholarships affect
overall BA attainment for a treated cohort, regardless of current residence. To investigate
the effects of merit aid eligibility further, we present results in Panel A of Table 5 where the
dependent variable of interest is attainment of at least a BA degree. Across all five columns,
the estimated effects of merit aid eligibility are negative. The results, however, are not
consistently statistically significant and, therefore, offer moderate evidence that merit aid
may reduce degree attainment. Focusing on the result in column (5) that includes only merit
states, the estimate suggests that merit aid eligibility decreased BA degree attainment by
0.7 percentage points and is statistically significant at the ten percent level. Given baseline
rates of degree receipt, this represents a 3 percent decrease in BA degree attainment.
   In order for the probability of living in-state as a BA degree holder to stay the same
while the overall probability of degree receipt among a cohort decreases, some degree holders
who would have lived elsewhere between the ages of 24 to 32 must have been induced to




                                               14
live in their home state.21 Unfortunately, we cannot determine with this data whom the
marginal degree recipient is nor where the marginal degree is earned.22 The estimates are
consistent with a story where ex-ante mobile college students now stay in-state to take
advantage of merit aid and, in the process, crowd out ex-ante home state students from
getting a degree. However, there are alternative stories that are equally consistent with the
findings. For example, the reduction in degrees may be concentrated among those students
now induced to remain in-state, perhaps due to a poorer match with an in-state school
relative to the counterfactual, out-of-state school. Such a mismatch could be driven by lower
school quality (Cohodes and Goodman, 2012) or general features of attending an in-state
school, e.g. distractions stemming from a closer proximity to one’s home.
       To further understand a potential decrease in BA degree attainment, we present results
in Panel B of Table 5 where the dependent variable is having completed any amount of
college, not just degree receipt. Our estimate in column (5) suggests that merit aid did little
to change the probability of some college attendance for those ages 24 to 32. The point
estimate is -0.001 and it is not statistically significant. To the extent that BA attainment
decreases, the reduction appears to occur somewhere between enrollment and graduation.23
       The possible decrease in BA degree attainment is a bit surprising given the rest of the
literature, which suggests that merit aid introduction increases enrollment in college and
graduation, particularly at in-state postsecondary institutions (Dynarski, 2004; Zhang and
  21
      This assumes that the differential mortality has not also changed the denominator used in calculating
these shares.
   22
      With the Census data it is not possible to know where respondents attended college once they are no
longer enrolled. Two data issues prevent us from using Census data on 18 to 23 year olds. First, because
from 2001 to 2005 the ACS did not include residents of group quarters (e.g. dorms), we are limited to
ACS data in only the years from 2006 to 2010, which severely limits the number of post-treatment cohorts
available in each state. Second, since most programs were introduced in the 1990s, our only pre-treatment
data would have come from the 1990 Decennial. Given the rapidly changing patterns of college enrollment
over this period (Fitzpatrick and Turner, 2007), we thought it imprudent to use data in which we could not
be sure pre-treatment trend differences in treated states drove our results.
   23
      Our definitions of college enrollment are conditional on having received a high school diploma (or the
equivalent). If broad-based merit aid scholarship introduction caused or was driven by declining high school
graduation rates, we might find merit aid programs had a negative effect on BA attainment. In results
reported in Panel C of Table 5, we check to be sure high school graduation rates did not change, estimating
equation 1 using graduation from high school as the dependent variable of interest. The coefficient is negative
but not statistically significant in the models using only the sample of states that introduced merit aid.


                                                      15
Ness, 2010; Dynarski, 2008). However, our results do not necessarily represent a complete
departure from earlier work. First, our work does not speak to the location of college
enrollment for ages younger than 24 and thus have no bearing on previous results regarding
the location of enrollment. In fact, our finding of no change in having attended some college
can be reconciled with finding increased in-state enrollment if the new in-state enrollment
comes from students who would have attended college elsewhere.24 Similarly, previous work
has found increased enrollment in college in any location of merit-eligible 18 and 19 year
olds (Dynarski, 2004). This finding would be consistent with ours if merit aid accelerates
the timing of college entry. Given that many states condition merit aid receipt on enrollment
within one or two years of high school graduation, a shift in timing does not seem implausible,
though are results are not dispositive of this phenomenon.
       With respect to BA attainment, there have been a number of studies that focus on the
effects of merit aid on degree attainment of eligible residents. The first of these was the
Dynarski (2008), who used the one-percent samples from the 1990 and 2000 Decennial in a
difference-in-difference strategy analogous to the one we use here. This study focused on the
only two states that had programs available at the time, Arkansas and Georgia. Dynarski
found that merit aid eligibility increased the probability of 22 to 34 year olds obtaining at
least a Bachelor’s degree by 2.5 percentage points (and at least an Associate’s by 3 percentage
points). In a replication exercise, Sjoquist and Winters (2012a) show that the result is not
robust to the use of five percent Census samples in place of the one percent samples.
       The availability of the 2001-2010 ACS make it possible to extend the previous analyses
to additional merit aid states and to additional treated cohorts in Arkansas and Georgia. In
Appendix Table A.1, we replicate this previous work in Columns 1 - 3, and show in Column 4
that when we use the same sample definitions and specification choices as the earlier studies,
but with the 5 percent samples for the period from 1990 to 2000, the result is consistent
  24
    Indeed Cornwell, Mustard and Sridhar (2006) find that in the case of the Georgia HOPE program the
increase in in-state, 4-year college enrollment is driven by students who would have attended college out of
state and students who would have attended 2-year institutions. This pattern is consistent with our finding
of no overall change in ever have enrolled in any college.


                                                    16
with that presented in our Table 5. We show in Columns 5 and 6 that the additional
differences in our approach (e.g. expanding the sample to 2010, using new merit states, etc.)
have little further effect on the estimates. Thus, roughly half of the difference between ours
and previous estimates can be attributed to a difference between the 1 and 5 percent 2000
Decennial samples, and the rest can be explained by including the 1990 Decennial.25


5.4     College Attendance

The lack of a change in the probability of having started college combined with a possible
decrease in degree attainment leads naturally to the question of whether these 24 to 32 year
olds have indeed finished their schooling or whether they might still be currently enrolled in
college. In Table 6, we re-estimate equation (1) using two measures of college enrollment:
i) enrollment anywhere in the U.S. at the time of the survey (Panel A) and ii) enrollment
in one’s home state at the time of the survey (Panel B). Focusing on our specification in
column (5), we find that cohorts eligible for merit aid have an increased likelihood of college
enrollment that is driven by increased enrollment in their home states. College enrollment
in any state went up by 0.4 percentage points, while in-state college attendance went up by
0.5 percentage points. Both estimates are statistically significant at the one percent level
in column (5), but the two estimates are not statistically different from each other. This is
consistent with about 70 percent of the extra 0.7 percentage points of 24 to 32 year olds who
have not yet graduated college still being enrolled.26 However, available data do not allow
us to determine whether the people who are no longer holding degrees and those who are
now enrolled at these ages are in fact one in the same.
  25
     Note that even when we omit the 1990 Census in row 5 of Table B.1 we still find negative point estimates,
albeit statistically indistinguishable from 0.
  26
     We calculated this estimate by dividing the increase in college enrollment (0.5 percentage points) by the
decrease in degree attainment (0.7) percentage points

6        Robustness Checks

6.1       Event Study Analysis

To explore the extent to which our results may be confounded by pre-treatment trends in
merit aid states, we now use a more flexible specification to determine whether there may
be patterns in our outcomes of interest that predate the introduction of merit aid. To do
this, we employ the following specification:

                                    16
                                    X
                                                k
                           ysct =           βk Dsct + ηs + δc + γt + ΓXsct + sct                           (2)
                                    k=−11

                                                                  k
       In equation (2), we include a set of new dummy variables, Dsct . These variables take a
value of one if cohort c is k cohorts removed from the last cohort not eligible for merit aid
in state s and zero otherwise. In our estimation of (2) we include a dummy variable for each
of the possible cohorts before and after treatment. Figure 2 plots the coefficient estimates
and 95 percent confidence intervals from estimating equation 2 for each of our outcomes in
turn. In each panel, the solid line presents estimates of βk . The dashed lines present the
confidence intervals for each of the coefficient estimates.27
       Three observations are worth mentioning. First, our identification strategy relies on the
assumption that there were no pre-treatment trends in educational attainment and residential
migration for cohorts in states that introduce merit aid programs relative to those that do
not. The evidence in Figure 2 generally supports this notion. There is no statistically
significant pattern of a pre-treatment trend in any of the outcomes. However, the point
estimates suggest a slight upward trend in the case of living in-state (Panel a) and living in-
state with some college attendance (Panel d), and a more pronounced trend for some college
attendance (Panel b). These trends appear to be driven by extreme cohorts, in excess of 10
years before the introduction of the merit programs. As indicated in Figure 1, these cohorts
  27
    Because the omitted category is the last ineligible cohort, its coefficient is constrained to be zero, which
is why there are no confidence interval bounds at time zero in the graph.



                                                      18
comprise a relatively small share of our sample. Our analysis below in Section 6.2 provides
additional evidence that the pre-treatment trends are not driving our results.28
       Second, in estimating individual effects for each cohort, we sacrifice a good deal of power.
As a result, our confidence intervals in these figures are fairly wide. Finally, our estimates
become much more erratic as we trace out the effects to those later cohorts in states where
the programs have been in existence the longest. As we have pointed out in Figure 1, these
later cohorts tend to be dominated by a select few early adopting states. For this reason,
we focus on the patterns among cohorts closer to the inception of the program, which are
comprised of a more balanced sample of merit aid states. In general, the patterns in Figure
2 reinforce those described earlier using the traditional difference-in-difference specification.


6.2       Placebo Tests

We can further assess the validity of our identification strategy by conducting placebo tests.
In this case, we use only the pre-treatment data on merit states. We define a placebo
treatment date equal to three, four, five or six years before the actual date of merit aid intro-
duction. With each different placebo treatment date, the sample is defined to have the same
number of pre- and post-treatment cohorts. We then estimate equation 1 on each sample.
The results of our placebo exercise are in Table 7. Only two of the twenty estimates have
p-values lower than 10 percent. This evidence further supports the assumptions underlying
our difference-in-difference estimation strategy.29
  28
     We present results in Appendix B that omit data from 1990, i.e. cohorts more than 10 years before merit
aid program introduction. In this case, the visual evidence of any pre-treatment trends is no longer apparent.
The results we estimate are also attenuated in this subsample. This may suggest that our patterns are driven
by pre-existing trends. However, it is not clear that the data omitting 1990 should directly correspond to
the full sample, as dropping 1990 restricts the within state variation in merit aid eligibility to be more
concentrated among later adopting states.
  29
     Note that even in cases where find no effect of merit aid, it is still important to verify that there are no
pre-treatment trends, so as not to mistake the flattening of an existing trend for a zero effect.




                                                       19
6.3    Sensitivity to the Set of Merit States Included

To be sure our results are not driven by any one outlier merit aid state, we now examine
how the results change when we leave out each merit state in turn in Table 8. Panels A
and B contain the results with the probability of living in-state and BA degree attainment,
respectively. For living in one’s state of birth, the results range from 0.7 to 1.2 percentage
point increases and none are statistically differentiable from the others. The negative effect
on degree attainment ranges from 0.4 to 0.8 percentage points. Again, the results are not
statistically distinguishable from one another. The results in Table 8 reassure us that there is
no single state driving the decreases in residential mobility and degree attainment apparent
in the full sample.


6.4    Addressing Intra-Cluster Correlation of Errors

Thus far, we have clustered our standard errors at the state level in order to deal with the
possible correlation in the error terms among the members of a cohort and across cohorts
within each state. However, this approach typically relies on the number of clusters being
large. To be sure our inference is conservative, here we consider three leading methods
for addressing intra-cluster correlation in the presence of a small number of clusters: the
non-parametric, cluster bootstrap-t technique, the wild cluster bootstrap-t technique and
randomization inference.
   We implement our non-parametric cluster bootstrap-t and wild cluster bootstrap-t fol-
lowing the prescriptions of Cameron, Gelbach and Miller (2008). In the first case, clusters of
cohorts, grouped by state, are resampled with replacement from our data. Our specifications
are then rerun, generating a Wald statistic. After many draws, our original t-statistic is com-
pared the empirical distribution of bootstrapped t-statistics. The wild bootstrap-t procedure
generates pseudo-samples using clustered residuals from a regression imposing the null hy-
pothesis. We then relate our true Wald statistic to an empirical distribution of bootstrapped
t-statistics. Further details are available in Cameron, Gelbach and Miller (2008).

                                              20
       Randomization inference involves a permutation method proposed by Bertrand, Duflo
and Mullainathan (2002).30 In this case, we generate placebo treatments by randomly reas-
signing merit status and timing of merit aid at the state level. The timing is drawn from
the empirical distribution of merit introduction dates. We then estimate our regressions
under these reassigned policies and generate a Wald statistic, simulating effects under the
null hypothesis. Our original t-statistic is again compared to this distribution of placebo
statistics.
       Table 9 presents the results of these alternative methods of inference. Each column
represents a different outcome, where we focus on the specification with only merit states, i.e.
column (5) in Tables 3 – 6. In the first row, we remind the reader of the point estimate, and
in the final four rows, we present p-values for each of the four inference methods discussed
above. In general, the results are in accord with each other, with statistical significance
slightly decreasing as we move from clustered standard errors to the nonparametric bootstrap
to the wild bootstrap and finally to randomization inference. In our most conservative case,
randomization inference renders two of our effects, that of BA attainment and living in-
state with some college attendance, insignificant. These results generally indicate that our
estimates are not overly reliant on a failure to account for a small number of clusters.


6.5       Heterogeneous and Continuous Treatment Effects

In Table 10 we consider alternative specifications that explore differences in treatment effects
by program type. We also present results that incorporate the variation in tuition generosity
across merit aid programs. All of the samples include only merit aid states and the specifica-
tions correspond to column (5) of Tables 3 to 6. Columns (1) and (2) report coefficients from
a regression with treatment indicator for merit aid eligibility and an interaction between this
indicator and only allowing use of the merit aid at public institutions, respectively. With
respect to migration, the states that only allow merit aid to be used at public institutions
  30
    Note, this method is described in the working paper version of this paper, but not in the published
version.

                                                  21
appear to be associated with a higher level of retention, but a lower likelihood of both living
in-state and having attained a BA degree. With respect to general educational attainment,
these states appear to experience a larger decrease in BA attainment and college attendance
than other merit states. Finally, these programs do not appear to have any significantly
different effects on current college enrollment.
    Columns (3) and (4) report coefficients from a regression with a treatment indicator for
merit aid eligibility and an interaction between this indicator and being an early adopting
state, i.e. Georgia or Arkansas. In general, we do not find any significant differences in
outcomes between the early adopting and later adopting states. Finally, in column (5),
we report an alternative specification where instead of an indicator for merit aid eligibility,
we regress outcomes on the fraction of the average tuition and fees at four-year public
insitutions in the state that is covered by the merit aid scholarship. This fraction ranges
from 0 for ineligible cohorts to 0.13 in Michigan to 1.11 in Arkansas. The coefficient should
be interpreted as the change in the outcome associated with going from no merit aid to full
tuition coverage. In general, we arrive at results similar to our specifications that only use
merit aid eligibility as the treatment variable.



7     Conclusion

We have shown that merit aid programs modestly increase the probability that residents
live in their state of birth after they are old enough to have graduated from college. We
additionally show that the share of the treated cohort both living in state and having at-
tended college modestly increases. The share of a cohort both living in-state and having
obtained a BA degree, however, does not appear to increase. Thus, merit aid programs have
the potential to retain a larger workforce of state-born individuals who are more likely to
have attended college.
    This retention of high skilled workers might come at a price, however, as overall rates



                                              22
of degree attainment among a treated cohort may decrease slightly with the introduction
of merit aid programs, at least in the short run. This is despite the fact that there are no
changes in high school diploma receipt or the probability of ever having attended college.
Although the statistical significance of this result is not consistent, an overall decrease in
BA attainment combined with the aforementioned constant share of a cohort living in-state
with a BA suggest that some residents who would have obtained their college degrees and
lived elsewhere are induced by their merit aid eligibility to live in-state. Interestingly, we
also find increased rates of college enrollment among residents older than traditional college
ages, which may indicate that some of the reduction in BA attainment is explained by a
delay in degree receipt.
   There are at least three interpretations of the possible reduction or delay in BA degree
attainment. First, the merit aid may attract previously out-migrating college enrollees to
in-state schools, which in turn crowds out in-state students who would have never migrated.
This may be especially true if in-state education supply is inelastic and if the would-be
outmigrants are of higher ability or income, allowing them to outbid non-migrants. With
more in-state college attendance among traditional college age students, some may find it
hard to fulfill requirements for graduation in a timely manner or at all. Alternatively, the
marginal migrants and degree recipients may be one-in-the-same. That is, merit aid may
cause price-sensitive students to remain in-state, resulting in mismatches in institution or
location. Such a mismatch may be due to differences in quality (Cohodes and Goodman,
2012) or general location-specific factors. Note, these explanations require in-state enroll-
ment during collage-age years to respond to merit aid, which we cannot directly show, but
which has been demonstrated in other contexts (Dynarski, 2000; Cornwell, Mustard and
Sridhar, 2006; Orsuwan and Heck, 2008; Zhang and Ness, 2010). A final interpretation is
that merit-aid induces students to switch from 2-year institutions to 4-year institutions in a
way that ultimately reduces the probability of graduation: a mismatch story of a different
sort.


                                             23
       Each of these mechanisms may also generate the reduction in ultimate out-migration that
we observe. In the ”crowd-out” case, those students who are newly induced to remain in-state
for college may remain in-state due to location specific human or social capital. Alternatively,
those non-migrants now crowded out of a BA degree may experience a reduction in mobility,
which would likewise increase the share of state-born residents remaining in-state. In this
case, however, at least some of the out-migrants now enrolling in-state would have to remain
in-state in order for the share of the cohort both living in-state and having a BA to remain
constant. The case where the marginal out-migrant remains in-state to take advantage
of merit aid but in the process endures a mismatch might also generate a reduction in out-
migration. In this case, the mis-matched student may experience a reduction in mobility due
to less educational attainment. Similarly, the case where would-be 2-year students substitute
to 4-year institutions prematurely and as a result do not graduate may likewise generate a
reduction in mobility for this group and likewise requires the retention of out-migrants with
BAs to hold constant the share of the cohort both living in-state and having a BA.31
       More importantly, the magnitude of our results suggest that only a small fraction of
the eligible population responds to merit aid eligibility by changing educational or migration
decisions. We find that programs targeted to at least 30 percent of a cohort alter the behavior
of at most 2 percent of a cohort at the margin. Even after adjusting for the fact we obtain
intent-to-treat estimates, merit aid programs appear to alter outcomes for less than 3 percent
of a cohort.32 Indeed, when we exclude data from 1990 (see Appendix B), the merit program
effects appear to be even smaller, though the estimates in that sample tend to rely more
heavily on later-adopting states. In any event, nearly all of the $1.4 billion in spending among
our broad-based merit states appears to represent a transfer to inframarginal college-going
  31
     Technically, the marginal in-state enrollee and the marginal residential migrant need not be as intercon-
nected as these stories suggest. We cannot rule out a general pattern of separate and independent effects of
merit aid on educational attainment and residential migration.
  32
     The 1 percent of individuals who have altered their migration, the 0.7 percent who have decreased BA
attainment and the 0.4 percent delaying graduation comprise at most 2.1 percent of the population, in the
case where they are mutually exclusive sets of individuals. Furthermore, 70% of a cohort born in a given
state is predicted to still live in that state at age 18 in our sample. A crude adjustment scales up the 2.1
percent of the population to 2.1/0.7 = 3.

   Our results present a mixed picture regarding the evaluation of merit-based scholarships.
In most cases, the stated aims of the programs are to subsidize the cost of attending college,
increase educational attainment and help maintain a highly educated labor force. In fact, it
seems that these programs do retain more residents in-state, albeit a small fraction compared
to the targeted population. Furthermore, the net effect on the skill composition of the labor
force is ambiguous. The number of degrees may have actually decreased in the short-run,
but the resulting effect on the average quality of degree holders in these states may yet
have increased depending on how the characteristics of the marginal degree recipient and
out-migrant have been affected. Finally, better data and more work are needed to determine
whether the increased retention of high skilled workers leads to increased economic growth for
the state. Even if it does, further research will also be required to determine how distorting
migration between states affects economic growth at a national level.

Note: Estimates use 1990 Decennial, 2000 Decennial and 2001-2010 ACS survey data at the state-cohort-
year level. The dependent variable is the share of a cohort born in a state and aged 24 to 32 at the time
of the survey who have obtained a BA degree, some college or high school degree, regardless of current
residence. Each regression includes state, year, cohort and age fixed effects. Where indicated, the regression
also includes a trend in year of birth relative to the year the first treated cohort was born for states with merit
aid programs. Regressions are weighted by the number of observations in the given state-cohort-year cell.
Standard errors are clustered at the state level. ***, ** and * indicate statistically significant coefficients at
the one, five and ten percent levels respectively.

Note: Estimates use 1990 Decennial, 2000 Decennial and 2001-2010 ACS survey data at the state-cohort-year
level. The dependent variable is the share of a cohort born in a state and aged 24 to 37 at the time of the
survey for whom the designated outcome in the row header is true. Columns (1) and (2) present results from
a specification with a general merit indicator and an indicator for those merit states allowing enrollment
only at public institutions of higher education. Columns (3) and (4) present results from a specification
with a general merit indicator and an indicator for just Arkansas and Georgia. Column (3) presents results
using a merit variable defined by the fraction of average tuition and fees at 4-year public institutions in
the state that are covered by the merit program. Each regression includes state, year, cohort and age fixed
effects and a trend in year of birth relative to the year the first treated cohort was born for states with merit
aid programs. Regressions are weighted by the number of observations in the given state-cohort-year cell.
Standard errors are clustered at the state level. ***, ** and * indicate statistically significant coefficients at
the one, five and ten percent levels respectively.

     Note: Estimates use 1990 Decennial, 2000 Decennial and 2001-2010 ACS survey data at the state-cohort-year level. Solid lines plot coefficients on
     dummy variables for each cohort relative to the last cohort ineligible for merit aid. Sample includes all states and the regressions also include cohort,
     state and year of survey fixed effects as well as time-varying state characteristics as described in the text. Regressions are weighted by the number of
     observations in the given state-cohort-year cell. Standard errors are clustered at the state level. Dotted lines represent upper and lower 95 percent
     confidence intervals. Each panel reports information from a separate regression with the dependent variable indicated by the panel label.

     Note: Estimates use 1990 and 2000 Decennial and 2001-2010 ACS data at the state-cohort-year level. The dependent variable is the share of a cohort
     born in a state and aged 22 to 34 at the time of the survey who have obtained a BA degree. Each regression includes state, year and age fixed effects.
     Where indicated, age by year fixed effects are also included, data is not weighted by Census, observations with allocated information on state of birth,
     date of birth or educational attainment are omitted. Observations from Mississippi are also omitted. When the coefficient of interest is the effect of
     merit aid in Arkansas and Georgia only and the data extend past 2000, other merit aid states are dropped from the analysis. Standard errors are
     clustered at the state level. ***, ** and * indicate statistically significant coefficients at the one, five and ten percent levels respectively.

Note: Estimates use 2000 Decennial and 2001-2010 ACS survey data at the state-cohort-year level. The
dependent variable is the share of a cohort born in a state and aged 24 to 32 at the time of the survey for
whom the designated outcome is true. Each regression includes state, year, cohort and age fixed effects.
Where indicated, the regression also includes a trend in year of birth relative to the year the first treated
cohort was born for states with merit aid programs. Regressions are weighted by the number of observations
in the given state-cohort-year cell. Standard errors are clustered at the state level. ***, ** and * indicate
statistically significant coefficients at the one, five and ten percent levels respectively.

     Note: Estimates use 2000 Decennial and 2001-2010 ACS survey data at the state-cohort-year level. Solid lines plot coefficients on dummy variables
     for each cohort relative to the last cohort ineligible for merit aid. Sample includes all states and the regressions also include cohort, state and year
     of survey fixed effects as well as time-varying state characteristics as described in the text. Regressions are weighted by the number of observations
     in the given state-cohort-year cell. Standard errors are clustered at the state level. Dotted lines represent upper and lower 95 percent confidence
     intervals. Each panel reports information from a separate regression with the dependent variable indicated by the panel label.
