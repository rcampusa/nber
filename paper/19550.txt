                                            ABSTRACT

We measure the effect of an anti-predatory pilot program (Chicago, 2006) on mortgage default rates
to test whether predatory lending was a key element in fueling the subprime crisis. Under the program,
risky borrowers and/or risky mortgage contracts triggered review sessions by housing counselors who
shared their findings with the state regulator. The pilot cut market activity in half, largely through
the exit of lenders specializing in risky loans and through decline in the share of subprime borrowers.
Our results suggest that predatory lending practices contributed to high mortgage default rates among
subprime borrowers, raising them by about a third.

1.      Introduction
        Predatory lending has been the focus of intense academic and policy debate surrounding

the recent housing crisis. Predatory lending—commonly defined as imposing unfair and abusive

loan terms on borrowers, often through aggressive sales tactics, or loans that contain terms and

conditions that ultimately harm borrowers (GAO, 2004; FDIC, 2006)—has also captured much

media attention and appears to be a major concern for borrowers.1 While all agree that mortgages

with abusive terms are costly to borrowers and to taxpayers, the extent of the phenomenon is

hard to quantify and is politically charged (e.g., Agarwal and Evanoff, 2013; Engel and McCoy,

2007). Several journalistic accounts and industry reports take the position that predatory lending

had a central role in creating and feeding the housing bubble, particularly through subprime loan

originations (e.g., the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2010; Hudson, 2010; Center for

Responsible Lending, 2009). To our knowledge, there is no systematic evidence to date

measuring the effect of predatory lending on mortgage performance. Our paper attempts to fill

this gap.

        In academic literature, predatory lending is modeled as cases in which lenders possess

private information about borrowers’ future ability to repay loans and encourage mortgages with

terms that borrowers cannot afford (Bond, Musto, and Yilmaz, 2009). This model clearly

portrays the empirical challenge in measuring predatory lending: because it is difficult to observe

lenders’ informational advantage over borrowers, it is hard to measure the size of the

phenomenon and assess its role in precipitating the subprime mortgage crisis.

        In this paper, we attempt to overcome this challenge by analyzing the effects of a pilot

anti-predatory legislative program implemented in Chicago near the peak of the real-estate

boom. The pilot required “low-credit-quality” applicants and applicants for “risky” mortgages to

submit their loan offers from state-licensed lenders for third-party review by HUD-certified

financial counselors. As described in greater detail below, the fact that the pilot applied only in

certain areas during a specific time period, only to certain borrower and mortgage contract

1
 Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2013) find that about half of surveyed borrowers would be willing to strategically
default on their mortgage should they discover that their lender was involved in predatory lending.

                                                        2
combinations, and only to a specific set of lenders allows us to parse out its effect on the

availability of mortgage credit with predatory characteristics and to evaluate ex post mortgage

performance. The study draws on detailed loan-level data from public and proprietary sources, as

well as data provided by one of the largest counseling agencies involved in the pilot.

       Our empirical strategy is based on classic difference-in-differences analysis that contrasts

changes in mortgage market composition and loan performance in the treated sample with those

in a control sample. Unlike bacteria in a petri dish, lenders and borrowers could respond to the
mandated treatment either by leaving the pilot area or by adapting to the new rules. Hence, we

pay particular attention to endogenous selection of lenders and borrowers out of treatment. If

predatory lending resulted in significantly higher default rates and thus precipitated the crisis, we

should observe a significant reduction in default rates in the targeted market as predatory lending

declined.

       We find that following passage of the legislative pilot, the number of active lenders

declined disproportionately in the target geographic area. The decline was particularly

pronounced among state-licensed lenders that specialized in the origination of subprime loans,

many of which included contract features deemed objectionable by the legislation. Nearly half of

the state-licensed lenders exited the pilot zip codes, more than double the exit rate in the control

areas. The remaining lenders made fewer risky loans and originated credit to borrowers with

higher credit quality. Specifically, we show that the volumes of loan applications and

originations by state-licensed lenders in the pilot area declined by 51% and 61%, respectively.

The average FICO score of borrowers who were able to obtain credit during the pilot period was

8 points higher (15% of one standard deviation).

       The resulting mortgages issued in the pilot area were less likely to feature “risky”

characteristics (as defined by legislators) that would subject them to counselor review. For
instance, there were fewer loans with negative amortization or prepayment penalties, as well as

fewer low-documentation and low down-payment loans. This set of findings suggests, therefore,




                                                 3
that the legislation had a deep impact on market activity and likely drove much of the predatory

lending activity from the market.

        Yet, although the pilot dramatically affected market activity, it had a relatively moderate

effect on borrower default rates. When we restrict our analysis to the subset of market

participants directly targeted by the pilot—subprime borrowers and state-licensed lenders—we

find improvements in 18-month default rates of 6 to 7 percentage points, relative to the

unconditional default rate of 27%. Moreover, all of the statistically measurable improvement in
loan performance came from changes in the composition of lenders, many of whom were driven

out by the legislation. These estimates suggest that while predatory lending contributed to high

default rates, it may have not been as instrumental in precipitating the financial crisis as

popularly believed.

        In practice, it may be difficult to distinguish predatory lending practices from merely

“aggressive” ones. To make headway in separating the two, we exploit another feature of the

anti-predatory program. The heart of the HB4050 pilot was the imposition of a mortgage review

requirement for risky borrowers and for those who chose risky loans. During the review,

counselors identified loans that were suspected of having predatory characteristics, e.g., loans

with above-market rates, loans appearing to be unaffordable based on borrower characteristics,

and loans with indications of fraud. We analyze a sample of 121 loans for which we have

detailed counselor assessment data.2 We conjecture that loans that were flagged as predatory and

yet were pursued by borrowers (i.e., borrowers ignored the counselors’ advice) were more likely

to default relative to non-flagged loans. Indeed, we find that these predatory loans had 18-month

delinquency rates that were 6.5 percentage points higher than nonflagged loans. The difference

in delinquency rates was even higher for loans with fraud indicia, which had a 12.3 percentage

point differential.

 For an in-depth analysis of the role of mortgage counseling, see Agarwal, Amromin, Ben-David, Chomsisengphet,
and Evanoff (2010, 2012).

                                                      4
        Our findings have important implications for policymakers. First, the pilot program was a

blunt policy tool that swept up a wide swath of borrowers, lenders, and products and caused

substantial market disruption. Second, despite the measureable improvements in mortgage

performance in the subpopulation most affected by the pilot, default rates remained alarmingly

high, suggesting that predatory lending practices may have played a relatively limited role in

triggering the crisis. In fact, because some of the loans eliminated by the pilot may have been

aggressive rather than predatory, we are likely to be overstating the effect of predatory lending
practices. Third, evaluation of welfare gains or losses stemming from such policy programs is

fraught with difficulties, many of which are exacerbated by the distortions that exist in housing

markets. Our paper does not attempt to gauge the welfare consequences of the pilot, and

policymakers should be aware that such consequences are difficult to measure. Finally, the

HB4050 pilot demonstrates the political difficulty of implementing policies that “lean” against

asset bubbles.3 Specifically, interest groups (real-estate professionals as well as community

activists) protested against the legislation. Both groups viewed the preceding run-up in real-

estate prices as an opportunity for their constituents to achieve their goals (profits or housing

access), and they therefore perceived the legislation as harmful.

        Our paper relates to two strands of the literature. The first explores the role of

intermediaries in precipitating the financial crisis. Keys et al. (2010) show that securitization

leads to lax screening by mortgage lenders. Ben-David (2011, 2012) finds that intermediaries

expanded the mortgage market by enabling otherwise ineligible borrowers to misrepresent asset

valuations to obtain larger loans, and by pushing buyers to overpay for properties. Rajan, Seru,

and Vig (2013) show that soft information about borrowers is lost as the chain of intermediaries

in the origination process becomes longer, leading to a decline in the quality of originated

mortgages. Finally, see Agarwal and Ben-David (2013) who study the role of loan officer

compensation leading up to the financial crisis.

3
 As discussed in detail in Section 2.2, the program was terminated early, providing further evidence of the high cost
of identifying predatory lending—the regulators could not withstand the political pressure associated with
implementing the program.

                                                         5
         The second strand of the literature studies predatory lending in personal finance. In

particular, researchers have focused on the debate about whether payday lending helps or

exploits borrowers. Morse (2011) shows that borrowers in areas with payday lending are more

resilient to natural disasters. In contrast, Melzer (2011) uses cross-border variation and finds no

evidence that payday lending alleviates hardship. Bertrand and Morse (2011) find that providing

additional information about loans to payday borrowers reduces loan take-up. Agarwal, Skiba,

and Tobacman (2009) show that payday borrowers preserve access to formal credit through their
credit cards while paying very high interest rates on their payday loans.



2.       Illinois Predatory Lending Database Pilot Program (HB4050)

2.1.     Description of the Pilot Program

         In 2005, the Illinois legislature passed a bill intended to curtail predatory lending.

Although the state had a number of anti-predatory provisions in place, like prevailing practices

elsewhere in the country, they were based on loan characteristics. Some political leaders in

Illinois became concerned about the ease with which lenders could avoid the trigger criteria of

anti-predatory programs by creatively packaging their loans. For instance, balloon mortgages

targeted by regulations were replaced with adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) with short fixed-

rate periods and steep rate reset slopes (the so-called 2/28 and 3/27 hybrid ARMs).4

Consequently, the new bill included a new enforcement mechanism and tougher penalties for

noncompliance. It also sought to educate borrowers prior to closing on their new mortgage loans.

         To that effect, the legislation sponsored by Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan

mandated review of mortgage offers for “high-risk borrowers” by HUD-certified housing

counselors. High-risk borrowers were defined as applicants with sufficiently low credit scores or

sufficiently risky product choices. The legislation set the FICO score threshold for mandatory

counseling at 620, with an additional provision that borrowers with FICO scores in the 621–650


4
  For a detailed analysis of the impact of the state anti-predatory lending laws on the type of mortgage products used
in the market, see Bostic et al. (2012).

                                                          6
range receive counseling if they chose what the regulation defined as high-risk mortgage

products. Such mortgages included interest-only loans, loans with interest rate adjustments

within three years, loans underwritten on the basis of stated income (low-documentation loans),

and repeated refinancings within the past 12 months (Category I loans). Borrowers were subject

to counseling regardless of their FICO score if they took out loans that allowed negative

amortization, had prepayment penalties, or had closing costs in excess of 5% (Category II loans).

The proposal was modeled on a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) program from the
1970s,5 and it generated a lot of excitement among Illinois lawmakers, who passed House Bill

4050 (HB4050) on the last day of the 2005 legislative session. HB4050 applied only to loans

offered by state-licensed mortgage lenders, as the state lacks legal authority to regulate federally

chartered institutions and generally exempts them from mortgage licensing requirements.

Furthermore, HB4050 applied only to select neighborhoods, namely, ten zip codes on the City of

Chicago’s South Side.

        The need for a high-risk borrower counseling session was determined on the day of the

application, and the borrower had ten days to contact the agency to schedule it. The lender was

required to cover the $300 cost of the session. The goal of these sessions, lasting one to two

hours, was to discuss the terms of the specific offer for a home purchase or refinancing loan and

to explain their meaning and consequences to the prospective borrower. The counselors were not

supposed to advise borrowers about their optimal mortgage choice in the sense of Campbell and

Cocco (2003); rather, they were to warn them against common pitfalls. The counselors were also

expected to verify the loan application information about the borrower (e.g., income and

expenses). None of the recommendations was binding—borrowers could always choose to

proceed with the loan offer at hand.

        At the end of the session, the counselor recorded a number of findings in a state-

administered database. These included whether the lender charged excessive fees, whether the

                                                     7
loan interest rate was in excess of the market rate, whether the borrower understood the

transaction and/or could afford the loan, and so forth. Even though HB4050 established the

database for pilot evaluation purposes, lenders feared that the state’s collection of this

information could lead to potential regulatory (e.g., license revocation) or legal (e.g., class-action

lawsuits) actions.

         As another direct penalty for noncompliance, lenders lost the right to foreclose on a

delinquent property. Under HB4050, title companies did not receive a “safe harbor” provision
for “good faith compliance with the law.” As a result, clerical errors at any point in the loan

application process could potentially invalidate the title, making the lender unable to pursue

foreclosure.6,7 Finally, lenders reportedly feared losing some of their ability to steer borrowers

toward high margin products.

         The new regulation imposed costs on borrowers as well. Even though session fees had to

be borne by the lender, anecdotal evidence suggests brokers attempted to pass them on to

borrowers in the form of higher closing costs and administrative charges (Bates and Van Zandt,

2007, and personal communication with mortgage counselors). HB4050 also imposed time costs

on borrowers. By lengthening the expected time until closing, the new law could force borrowers

to pay for longer credit lock periods, further raising loan costs.

         Both the counseling session and the independent collection of borrower data allowed

counselors to form their own assessment of the borrower’s creditworthiness. Effectively, the

counselors were able to elicit private information that may or may not have been used by lenders


6
  According to the Cook County Recorder of Deeds, even federally regulated lenders had to procure a certificate of
exemption from HB4050 to obtain a clean title. Consequently, all lenders were affected to at least some degree by
the legislation.
7
  This feature of HB4050 caused some investors to warn about their willingness to purchase loans originated in pilot
zip codes. Most of these warnings stipulated that to be eligible for purchase, a loan had to receive a certificate of
counseling or of exemption from counseling. However, the presence of one of these certificates was a requirement
for loan closing and recording, which itself is a prerequisite for sale or securitization under standard purchase
criteria. It is thus unclear whether would-be investors had any additional reasons to worry about recorded loans
under HB4050. In any event, the share of securitized loans in the treated zip codes declined from 83% to 70%
during the pilot period. However, this decline was not appreciably different from that in the control zip codes. It thus
appears that the pilot did not have a sizable impact on secondary market activity counter to the historical experience
in Georgia and New Jersey discussed in Keys et al. (2010).

                                                           8
to make approval and/or pricing decisions and then give that information to state regulators. This

external verification process, together with strict penalties for noncompliance, likely provided

strong incentives for lenders to better screen out marginal applications prior to referring

approved applications to counseling. One extreme form of screening was to cease lending in

HB4050 areas altogether.

        A report by the nonprofit Housing Action Illinois (2007) summarized the counselors’

assessments of HB4050 covered loans. Over the course of the pilot, about 1,200 borrowers had
their loan offers reviewed by 41 HUD-certified counselors from 11 agencies. Housing Action

Illinois (2007) reports that 9% of the mortgages were deemed to have indications of fraud. About

half of the borrowers were advised that they could not afford the loan or were close to not being

able to do so. For 22% of the borrowers, loan rates were determined to be more than 300 basis

points above the market rate. For 9% of the borrowers, the counselors found a discrepancy

between the loan documentation and the verbal description of the mortgage. Perhaps most

alarmingly, an overwhelming majority of borrowers who were receiving adjustable rate loans did
not understand that their mortgage payment was not fixed over the life of the loan.

2.2.    Early Termination of the Pilot Program

        The program was meant to run as a four-year pilot in select Chicago neighborhoods.
Afterwards, its coverage was expected to be expanded to the entire metropolitan area. In spite of

vocal opposition from community-based groups and affected lenders, Illinois politicians

clamored to have their districts included in the pilot. This effort by politicians looks particularly

ironic in retrospect, given the eventual response of the population in the pilot area.

        As mentioned earlier, only loans offered by state-licensed mortgage lenders were subject

to HB4050. In disadvantaged Chicago neighborhoods, much of the lending had been done

through state-licensed mortgage bankers, which presented themselves as a local and nimble

alternative to the more traditional bank lenders.8 Consequently, the legislation was likely to

8
  Using the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data described in detail in Section 3, we estimate that state-
licensed mortgage bankers accounted for 64% of mortgage loans originations in the HB4050 zip codes during 2005.

                                                      9
increase the regulatory burden on the very entities providing credit in the selected pilot area. The

possibility that this could result in credit rationing prompted many observers to voice concern

about the potential effect of HB4050 on housing values in the selected zip codes.

        The geographic focus of the legislation differed substantially from typical regulatory

approaches that require counseling for certain loan types (Bates and Van Zandt, 2007). This

feature of the legislation generated considerable opposition from community activists and

residents and prompted several lawsuits. Because the selected pilot area was overwhelmingly
populated by Hispanic and African American residents (81%, see Table 1, Panel A), the

selection also prompted heated accusations of discriminatory intent on the part of lawmakers.

Specifically, community activists formed an organization named the Coalition to Rescind

HB4050, led by John Paul (president of the Greater Englewood Family Taskforce) and Julie

Santos (an immigrants’ rights activist). In the media and through vocal protests at the grassroots

level, the organization put legal and political pressure on politicians to revoke the legislation.9

        The other group to oppose HB4050 comprised mortgage lenders and real-estate brokers,

who claimed that the bill imposed onerous costs on real-estate professionals and that it reduced

market activity. This group also applied considerable pressure to abolish HB4050, ranging from

highly publicized refusals to lend in the pilot zip codes to joining legal actions against the

legislation.10

        As mortgage lenders threatened to withdraw from the pilot zip codes en masse, and as the

tide of concerns about credit access began to rise, opposition to HB4050 reached fever pitch.11

The pilot program was suspended indefinitely on January 17, 2007 after only 20 weeks of

9
  The Chicago Tribune reported on November 2, 2006 that a group of residents and members of the real-estate
community submitted a lawsuit against the state, claiming discrimination.
10
   The unusual confluence of interests between community activists and real-estate professionals in opposing the
same regulatory action is reminiscent of Yandle’s (1983, 1999) “Bootleggers and Baptists” theory. The classic
example of this theory is the banning of Sunday sales of alcohol—a regulation supported by both bootleggers and
Baptists. The former endorsed the legislation because it allowed them to maintain the business of illegally selling
liquor without competition. The latter approved of the regulation because it directly supported their objective of
discouraging consumption of alcoholic beverages.
11
   The record of a public hearing held on November 27, 2006 provides a good illustration of the acrimony
surrounding HB4050 (see http://www.idfpr.com/newsrls/032107HB4050PublicMeeting112706.pdf).

operation. To provide some of the flavor of the public debate, we summarize the main news

items about the HB4050 legislation in the national and local media in the Appendix.



2.3.       How Was the Pilot Program Area Selected?

           HB4050 instructed the state regulatory body (Department of Financial and Professional

Regulation, or IDFPR) to designate a pilot area on the basis of “the high rate of foreclosure on

residential home mortgages that is primarily the result of predatory lending practices.” The pilot
area announced by IDFPR in February 2006 encompassed ten contiguous zip codes on the

southwest side of Chicago (the solid shaded areas in Figure 1).12 Four of these zip codes were

located in Illinois House Speaker Madigan’s district.

           Table 1 summarizes some of the key demographic and mortgage characteristics for the

pilot area and the rest of the City of Chicago.13 The mortgage data come from the First American

CoreLogic LoanPerformance data set on securitized, subprime and Alt-A mortgages (henceforth,

the LP data). Panel A shows that IDFPR’s decision at the time was based on the fact that these

zip codes had substantially higher default rates (Column (1)) compared to the rest of the city

(Column (3)), even though they experienced stronger growth in house prices.14,15 The pilot zip

codes were also predominantly minority-populated and had much higher rates of unemployment

and poverty (Panel A) relative to the rest of Chicago. A simple comparison of population counts

and the total number of loan originations in the nonprime-LP data strongly suggests that the

HB4050 area had a disproportional share of subprime and Alt-A mortgages.




12
  The HB4050 zip codes are: 60620, 60621, 60623, 60628, 60629, 60632, 60636, 60638, 60643, and 60652.
13
  Panel A also provides this information for the set of 12 zip codes that comprise one of our control samples—zip
codes similar to those affected by HB4050 but not chosen for the pilot. Their selection is discussed in detail in
Section 3. The comparisons here are made between the ten HB4050 zip codes and the 31 Chicago zip codes that
exclude both the HB4050 and the 12 control zip codes.
14
  In this table, we use mortgage characteristics and performance for 2005 because this was the information set
available to legislators at the beginning of 2006, when the legislation was voted on.
15
     Default is defined as a 90+ day delinquency, foreclosure, or real-estate owned within 18 months of origination.

3.1.   Data Sources

       Our study relies on several complementary sources of data that cover the calendar years

2005–2007. First, we use data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) to

assess elements of supply and demand for credit. In the absence of loan application and

counseling data collected under the statutory authority of HB4050, we turn to HMDA as the next

best source of information on loan application volume, rejection rates, and so forth. Using
information from HUD and hand-collected data, we distinguish between lenders who specialize

in prime and subprime loans, as well as between lenders that are licensed by Illinois and those

exempt from licensing. Because the effect of the legislation was likely to be felt most acutely by

state-licensed subprime lenders, we use this list to refine our analysis. Furthermore, the HMDA

data allow us to examine how HB4050 affected credit supply along the extensive margin, i.e., to

identify lenders that left the market altogether. Overall, the HMDA data include 92,658 loans

that were originated in the HB4050 zip codes during the 2005–2007 period.

       We also use the First American CoreLogic LoanPerformance (LP) database to assess the

effect of HB4050 on contract type and performance of mortgages originated in the treated zip

codes during 2005–2007. The LP data set includes detailed borrower and loan information such

as FICO scores and debt service-to-income (DTI) and loan-to-value (LTV) ratios as well as

mortgage terms, including maturity, product type (e.g., fixed or adjustable rate mortgage),

interest rate, and interest rate spread. It also contains information on whether a given loan has a

prepayment penalty, allows negative amortization, or required full documentation in

underwriting. These and other characteristics of the LP data are summarized in Table 1, Panels B

and C. FICO scores allow us to determine which borrowers in the HB4050 zip codes were

automatically or conditionally subject to loan counseling. The LP data set includes 37,564
mortgage loans originated in Chicago zip codes in 2005–2007.

       Because the LP data do not include information about the identity of the mortgage

originator for loans, we need to match observations in the HMDA and LP data sets to examine


                                                12
the effects of the legislation. We match on the basis of the zip code, loan amount, and date of

origination. Our matched data set yields 18,724 observations in the HB4050 zip codes.

       In the later part of our analysis, we use information from one of the counseling agencies.

These data are part of the database constructed under the HB4050 legislation, which includes

information on original mortgage offers reviewed during 191 counseling sessions. We match

these data to the Cook County Recorder of Deeds and LP data sets to obtain loan characteristics

on the counseled loans. The resulting data set includes 121 loans (other loans may not have been
securitized and, therefore, not included in the LP data set). We use this data set to gauge the

extent to which counseling had a direct effect on mortgage choice.

       Finally, we use Census and IRS data to control for zip code–level characteristics of

income and population composition.



3.2.   Constructing a Zip Code–Based Control Group

       To evaluate the effect of the HB4050 legislation, we develop control samples that are

similar to the pilot area but are unaffected by the legislation. As discussed in Section 2.3, the

selection of treated zip codes was driven by their demographic and mortgage characteristics, as

well as by political considerations. In fact, HB4050 zip codes exhibit characteristics that are far

from unique in the Chicago area. We use this information to construct a control group that is

meant to resemble the pilot area in terms of its pretreatment socioeconomic characteristics and

housing market conditions. Without the intervention, we plausibly expect the HB4050 zip codes

would have experienced the same changes in outcome variables as our control group zip codes.

To develop the control group, we move beyond the univariate metric of foreclosure rates to a set

of measures identifying economically disadvantaged inner-city neighborhoods.

       In particular, we use 2005 IRS zip code–level income statistics, as well as the 2000
Census shares of minority population and of those living below the poverty level, and the

unemployment rate to identify zip codes within the City of Chicago limits that have similar

characteristics and the smallest geographic distance from the HB4050 zip codes. The resulting


                                                13
12–zip code area has about as many residents as the treatment area and experienced a similar

path of house price changes, as summarized in Column (2), Panel A of Table 1. The statistics in

Panel B of Table 1 corroborate our conclusion that the control zip codes are similar to the treated

area in terms of their high default and delinquency rates, low borrower FICO scores, and

disproportionate reliance on riskier mortgage products.16 Judging by the spirit and the letter of

stated legislative guidelines, these zip codes (shown by the striped area in Figure 1) could have

plausibly been selected for HB4050 treatment.17

         The HMDA database contains 80,876 loans originated in the 12–zip code control sample

during the 2005–2007 period. The control sample contains 34,451 loan originations in the LP

data set, 17,759 of which can be matched with HMDA data.



3.3.     Constructing a Synthetic Zip Code Control Sample

         To further establish the empirical robustness of our analysis, we construct a synthetic

HB4050-like area in the spirit of Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003).18 Instead of identifying a
similar but untreated set of zip codes, we build up a comparison sample loan by loan, by

matching on the basis of observable loan characteristics. Specifically, for each of the loans issued

in the ten–zip code HB4050 area, we look for a loan most similar to it that was issued elsewhere

within the City of Chicago in the same month. The metric for similarity is the geometric distance

in terms of standardized values of the borrower’s FICO score, the loan’s DTI and LTV ratios, the

log of home value, and the loan’s intended purpose (purchase or refinancing). Once a loan is

matched to an HB4050-area loan, it is removed from the set of potential matches and the process


16
  In an earlier version of the paper, we used the reverse sequence to construct the control sample. That is, we built
up the set of control zip codes by minimizing the distance in observed mortgage characteristics in the pre-HB4050
LP data. Afterward we checked for similarities in socioeconomic characteristics between the treatment and control
areas. All of the results reported below are robust to the definition of the control area and are available upon request.
17
  The control area comprises the following zip codes: 60609, 60617, 60619, 60624, 60633, 60637, 60639, 60644,
60649, 60651, 60655, and 60827.
18
  It would be ideal to look at transactions that lie on either side of the border between the HB4050 and the control
zip codes to tease out the effect of the counseling mandate. Unfortunately, the LP data do not contain street
addresses.

                                                          14
is repeated for the next HB4050-area loan. The resulting synthetic HB4050-like area is made up

of observations from all 43 of the non-HB4050 Chicago zip codes. Not surprisingly, 65% of the

observations in this synthetic area come from the 12 comparable zip codes identified in the

preceding section on the basis of their socioeconomic characteristics.

       In Table 1, Panel B, we compare the characteristics of borrowers and mortgages in the

treated zip codes sample to those in the synthetic control sample. The panel shows that for each

loan characteristic the samples have very similar properties. Because we are not constrained by
geographic proximity, the synthetic sample more closely matches the loans in the HB4050

treatment area than does the control sample. However, all three samples display remarkably

similar characteristics.



3.4.   Design of Tests: HB4050 Legislation as an Exogenous Shock to Predatory Lending

       To recap our data summary, the majority of lending in the HB4050 area was done by

state-licensed lenders specializing in subprime loans. Many of these loans had short reset periods

(hybrid ARMs) and prepayment penalties, and did not require full documentation of income—all

characteristics that are commonly associated with “predatory lending.” These loans also had

been defaulting at very high rates (more than 20% of subprime loans originated in HB4050 zip

codes in the year prior to the pilot defaulted within their first 18 months). Thus, to the extent that

HB4050 made it more difficult for this subset of lenders to originate such loans with high ex post

default rates, we regard the pilot as an exogenous shock to lending practices with potentially

predatory characteristics.

       Our empirical analysis is based on the idea that HB4050 did not have a material effect in

untreated but similar areas. If predatory lending leads to higher default rates, we would expect

the negative exogenous shock to such lending practices to have a sizable effect on loan
performance.

       Another way to think about the proposed empirical design is as a two-stage analysis. In

the first stage, we verify that the legislation had a material effect on mortgage origination


                                                 15
practices in the treated area. For example, we show that in the treated area the fraction of “high-

risk” mortgages declined significantly, as did the overall volume of originations and the number

of active lenders.

         The second stage of the analysis measures the effect of the shock to the lending market

on mortgage performance. This stage is based on cross-sectional and temporal variation in a

difference-in-differences framework. Specifically, our tests measure the difference in the

response of various variables (e.g., default status, contract choice, etc.) as a function of whether
the loan was originated in a zip code subject to HB4050. Our regressions include both time

controls and cross-sectional controls, as in classic difference-in-differences analysis.

         Our basic regression specifications have the following form:

Responseijt = α + β Treatmentjt + γ Time dummiest + δ Zip dummiesj + θ Controlsijt + εijt,                        (1)

where Responseijt is the loan-level response variable, such as default status of loan i originated at

time t in zip j; Treatmentjt is a dummy variable that receives a value of one if zip code j is subject

to mandatory counseling in month t and the loan is originated by a state-licensed lender, and 0

otherwise; and Time and Zip dummies capture fixed time and location effects, respectively. In all

regressions, we cluster errors at the zip code level.19 For each loan, the response is evaluated at

only one point in time (e.g., interest rate at origination or default status 18 months thereafter).

Consequently, our data set is made up of a series of monthly cross-sections. The set of controls

varies with the underlying data source, but it includes variables such as LTV at origination,

borrower FICO score, loan interest rate, and so forth.



3.5.     Discussion of the Exclusion Restriction and the Context of the Estimates

         Our empirical tests provide estimates of the effect of the anti-predatory program on the

performance of loans. Here we discuss whether our estimates of improved mortgage


19
  Clustering allows for an arbitrary covariance structure of error terms over time within each zip code and, thus,
adjusts standard error estimates for serial correlation, potentially correcting a serious inference problem (Bertrand,
Duflo, and Mullainathan, 2004). Depending on the sample, there are 22 or 53 zip codes in our regressions.

                                                         16
performance can be attributed to the reduction in predatory lending and whether the result can be

generalized to the entire national market. We identify the effect of predatory lending on borrower

default based on the assumption that HB4050 affected default rates only through its impact on

predatory lending (the exclusion restriction). This assumption may not hold for two main

reasons: (1) the legislation is likely to have altered additional aspects of borrower decision

making, and (2) the legislation is likely to have induced spillovers of borrowers and lenders from

the treated zip codes into neighboring zip codes. Below, we analyze the potential effects of
violating the exclusion restriction assumption.

       The anti-predatory program affected the performance of loans through two main

channels: oversight and education. First, the program imposed oversight on lenders by subjecting

their loan offers to external review, thus causing predatory lenders to be more cautious. Second,

the program provided a detailed review to borrowers, which could have improved their decision

making. During the 20 weeks in which the pilot program took place, over 1,200 borrowers

received information about mortgages. In our sample of 191 loans, about 19% did not pursue

their loan application following the counseling and another 40% modified some of the mortgage

characteristics. Although it is difficult to clearly distinguish between the channels, our

measurement of the effect of predatory lending relies on the direct effect of the program through

oversight. It is plausible, however, that the indirect channel of education violates the exclusion

restriction and that some of the effect of the anti-predatory program on default rates came

through this indirect channel.

       Moreover, spillovers of loans from the treatment sample to the control sample violate the

exclusion restriction because they may have adversely affected the quality of loans originated in

the control sample. Such spillovers could have happened along three dimensions: spatial, cross-

sectional, and temporal. First, potential purchasers could have moved from the treated area to
surrounding areas (most likely to the control zip codes, as they have similar characteristics).

Figure 2a presents the volume of applications in the treated zip codes and the control sample zip

codes, per state-licensed lenders (treated) and non-state-licensed lenders (not treated). Figure 2b


                                                  17
presents similar analysis for originated mortgages. The figures show no apparent spillover in

volume. Second, borrowers could have shifted to lenders in the treated area that were not subject

to the legislation, i.e., non-state-chartered lenders. However, again Figures 2a and 2b do not

show evidence of such a move. One possible explanation for the lack of spillover is that the

market was segmented and state-licensed lenders and non-state-licensed lenders serviced

different populations (subprime and prime borrowers, respectively). Third, there is the possibility

of a run-up in mortgage applications in the treated area before the starting date of the program
(which was known in advance). Figures 2a and 2b do suggest some buildup in applications and

approvals before the onset of HB4050. They also show a minor tick-up immediately after the

termination of the program, in March 2007. Potentially this is a spillover effect, and these loans

could have been originated during the legislation period.

        We argue that both violations of the exclusion restriction assumption cause our estimates

of the effect of predatory lending on borrower default rates to be overstated. If the program

affected default rates through the education channel, then we cannot ascribe the entire measured

effect to the elimination of predatory lending. Further, if there were spillovers, then the credit

quality of the control group is worse than it would be otherwise, creating a greater spread in

default rates between the treated and control groups.

        In a similar vein, it is likely that the legislation had an effect not only on predatory

lending, but also on merely “aggressive” lending practices that pushed the boundaries of legally

permissible behavior without violating them. In this case, the effect that we attribute to predatory

lending should be ascribed to both predatory and aggressive lending practices. With the

exception of our analysis in Section 6, distinguishing between the two types of practices is

difficult. Nevertheless, this limitation also bounds our results from above. Even if we overstate

the number of predatory loans eliminated by the pilot, our results show that the effect on default
rates is relatively small.

        A second issue is whether the effects of predatory lending measured in the context of the

HB4050 legislation can be extrapolated to the national level. There are several reasons to be


                                                18
skeptical of this. The treatment area was characterized by high delinquency rates due,

supposedly, to predatory lending. This lending was done by a particular subset of financial

intermediaries who were readily identifiable and subject to state regulation. The penalties for

noncompliance were fairly harsh, partially because of lack of clarity regarding enforcement. All

of these factors are unlikely to hold for the country as a whole, limiting the effect of such

regulatory intervention. Furthermore, the limited geographic scope of HB4050 made it relatively

easy for lenders to exit, whether because of high compliance costs or for the strategic goal of
highlighting the contractionary effects of the pilot on credit availability. This amplified the effect

of the pilot but would not be applicable at the national level. For all of these reasons, it is likely

that our estimates are an upper bound for the effect of predatory lending.



4.      The Effects of HB4050 on Predatory Lending

        As described above, the legislation disrupted mortgage markets by changing the loan

origination process for certain borrowers and products. This section empirically evaluates its

effect on loan volumes, borrower and mortgage characteristics, and lender participation.



4.1.    Impact of the Legislation on Application and Mortgage Volumes

        We measure mortgage market activity by the volume of loan applications and loan

originations captured in the HMDA database.20 Figure 2a depicts the total number of loan

applications in the treated zip codes (the solid line) and in the control zip codes (the dashed line).

This information is reported in two panels that further subdivide applications reported by state-

licensed lenders (who are subject to the legislation) and all other lenders (labeled exempt).

        There is a precipitous decline in loan applications among state-licensed mortgage lenders

in HB4050 zip codes around the time the regulation became effective (September 1, 2006). For

these lenders, the application volume dropped from 5,276 in August 2006 to 3,584 in September


20
  We count all relevant HMDA records that have one of the following action codes: originated, denied, approved
but not taken, withdrawn, or incomplete.

                                                     19
(32% decline), and to 2,275 in October. We observe some run-up in applications in the treated

areas prior to the legislation period, though it is much smaller than the subsequent drop. In

contrast, application levels in control zip codes hold steady through December 2006. Following

the repeal of HB4050, activity levels in both control and treatment areas converged nearly

instantaneously; then they plummeted jointly to about half that of the market heyday. For non-

state-licensed lenders (chart on the right), we observe no differential effect in the HB4050 and

control zip codes throughout the period examined.
       We observe similarly striking evidence when examining mortgage originations. In Figure

2b, the left chart shows mortgage originations for state-licensed lenders. Originations in HB4050

zip codes collapsed from 2,046 in August 2006 to 785 in September 2006 (a 62% decline) and

remained at this depressed level until the end of 2006. Their levels completely converged with

originations in the control zip codes following the termination of the program in February 2007,

by which time subprime lending activity was grinding to a halt nationwide. Again, we do not

observe any effects of the legislation for non-state-licensed lenders in either the HB4050 or the

control zip codes.

       Table 2 presents the triple difference (diff-in-diff-in-diff) analysis of the drop in activity,

as captured by the HMDA data. We calculate the difference between the number of applications

before and during the legislation period in HB4050 and control zip codes among state-licensed

lenders. We then repeat the same calculation for non-state-licensed lenders and calculate the

difference in the results between the two lender subsets. Panel A focuses on changes in the

monthly rate of applications. It shows a substantial decline in the treated zip codes relative to the

controls among state-licensed lenders: 51% versus 14%. In contrast, there is no measurable

difference in the number of applications to non-state-licensed lenders, which increased

marginally during the pilot period in both the treated and the control areas. Consequently, the
difference between changes in treatment and control applications for state-licensed and non-

state-licensed lenders is striking at nearly 29%. This leads us to conclude that HB4050




                                                 20
significantly lowered borrower applications for mortgage credit and that its impact was, in fact,

concentrated among state-licensed lenders.

       Next, we use the same method to estimate relative changes in origination activity. As

shown in Table 2, Panel B, we find a decrease of 61% in the total number of mortgage

originations by state-licensed lenders in HB4050 zip codes, with a 68% decline in purchase

mortgages and a 54% decline in mortgage refinance transactions. As with applications, the drop

in originations by state-licensed lenders in control zip codes is much smaller. Although there is a
marginal rise in originations by non-state-licensed lenders, the increase is far too small to

compensate for losses in credit origination by state-licensed lenders. Overall, the difference in

the relative decline in total originations by state-licensed lenders in the treatment area and time

period amounted to 39%. This further underscores our contention that the two sets of lenders

served different segments of the market.

       In preparation for the default analysis that follows, we also perform a robustness check of

these results based on the matched sample between the LP data set (which contains default

information) and the HMDA data. The results are reported in Panel C, and they follow exactly

the same pattern. The magnitude of the declines, both relative and absolute, is even stronger in

the matched sample, which is heavily tilted towards state-licensed lenders that originated

subprime loans. For example, the panel shows a 67% drop in originations among such lenders in

treated zip codes, relative to a 14% runoff in the control area.

       We also note that the effect of the legislation is more pronounced for refinancing

transactions relative to purchase mortgages. This result is consistent with Choi (2011), who

examines the effect of anti-predatory legislation on origination volumes and finds a small effect

for purchase mortgages and a larger effect for refinancing mortgages. There are two potential

explanations for this result. First, refinancing activity is often discretionary. In particular,
borrowers who refinance a loan can often wait or find alternative sources of financing. For

purchases, however, if a buyer wants to complete the transaction, she usually has to take out a

mortgage in a timely manner. Second, the HB4050 legislation specified frequent refinancing


                                                 21
transactions as one of the triggers for identifying risky mortgages that would require counseling.

Therefore, one would expect a greater decline in refinancing transactions.

       In sum, the results show that the legislation had far-reaching effects on the volumes of

mortgage applications and originated loans. Moreover, these effects were most pronounced in the

targeted population—state-licensed lenders originating loans for low-FICO-score borrowers.



4.2.   Differential Impact of the Legislation by Borrower and Mortgage Characteristics
       Given that the legislation had a significant effect on mortgage originations, we examine

whether there was a change in the composition of borrower and mortgage types during the

treatment period. After all, the pilot effectively increased the cost of originating mortgages to

low-credit-quality borrowers as well as the cost of originating what were considered risky loans.

       To explore this issue, we use a sample including all mortgages in the LP-HMDA data set

that were originated in the treatment and control zip codes between 2005 and 2007. The

dependent variables are borrower and mortgage characteristics. The independent variable of

interest is the interaction between the HB4050 dummy and the state-licensed lender dummy,

which takes a value of one if the loan was originated subject to the HB4050 legislation. The

regressions include month fixed effects interacted with a state-licensed dummy and zip code

fixed effects interacted with the state-licensed dummy. This specification assures that there are

fixed effects for each dimension that is differenced out (time, zip code, and type of lender).

Standard errors are clustered by zip code to account for correlation within geographical areas.

       The regression results in Table 3, Panel A show that the composition of borrowers and

mortgage types changed significantly following the legislation. Column (1) indicates the average

FICO score of loans originated in the treated zip codes during the HB4050 period was 7.8 points

higher. This result is material as it reflects a shift of 0.13 standard deviations in the distribution
of borrowers (see Table 1, Panel B). Column (2) shows further evidence that the credit quality of

borrowers increased: the average interest spread declined by 0.43 percentage points—or 0.43




                                                 22
standard deviations. Overall, this evidence suggests that during the treatment period, the

population of borrowers was of appreciably better credit quality.

       We also observe that the originated mortgages are less likely to fall into risky categories

as defined by HB4050. In Columns (3) to (8), we examine the change in a variety of mortgage

characteristics: whether loans are adjustable rate mortgages, have low documentation, are

classified as risky mortgages by the HB4050 regulation (Category I or Category II), or are 100%

loan-to-value (LTV), and whether loans are considered “excessively risky” (i.e., mortgages that
are ARM, no- or low-documentation, interest only, and ≥95% LTV).

       The regressions show that mortgages originated in the treated areas would be considered

less risky by the legislation on most dimensions. Following implementation of HB4050, ARM

originations declined by 5.2% (t = 2.60; where the base rate in the control sample is 76%),

Category I loans declined by 2.6% (t = 1.53; the base rate is 83%), Category II loans declined by

3.9% (t = 2.78; the base rate is 20%), 100% LTV loans declined by 2.5% (t = 1.39; the base rate

is 16%), and excessive loans declined by 2.2% (t = 2.00; the base rate is 10%). We do not detect

a decline in no- and low-documentation loans.

       In Panel B we perform a robustness test for the above results. Here we restrict the sample

to lenders who did not exit from the HB4050 zip codes during the legislation period. As

described in greater detail below, we define the “exit group” as lenders who reduced their

average monthly lending rate by more than 90% relative to the prepilot period. The results show

that the change in the composition of borrowers and products was independent of lender exit,

i.e., the quality of borrowers and loans also increased for the remaining lenders.

       Overall, these findings show that new borrowers in the treated group were of better credit

quality and the originated loans were materially less risky, as defined by the legislation, than

those in the control group.




                                                23
4.3.    Impact of the Legislation on Lender Exit

        Part of the dramatic drop in loan applications can be traced to a number of much-

publicized lender withdrawals from the market. We tackle the question of market exit by

counting the number of unique lenders filing HMDA reports before, during, and after the

treatment period in both the treated and control zip codes. To be counted as an active lender in a

given geographic area, a HMDA-reporting institution must originate at least 10% of its prepilot

average per month during the pilot period, with at least one origination in every month.21 Panel A

of Table 4 summarizes the results of this exercise. Of the 89 active state-licensed lenders in the

treated zip codes in the prelegislative period (January 2005–August 2006), only 46 continued to

lend during the treatment period. In a reprise of mortgage origination results, the decline in the

number of lenders is much greater in the treatment areas, and exit is concentrated among state-

licensed lenders.

        As noted before, the legislation created some legal uncertainty about the enforceability of

mortgage contracts in the treated zip codes. This ambiguity by itself may have accounted for the

strong lender response along the extensive margin. It is also conceivable that exit from HB4050

areas was a strategic response by lenders determined to emphasize the disruptive nature of this

high-profile regulation.

        We explore the characteristics of exiting lenders in Panel B of Table 4. Because we want

to focus on mortgage contract features and performance, we need to work with the LP-HMDA

data set, which contains fewer lenders. The sample includes 55 lenders that were active in the

HB4050 zip codes during the prepilot period (January 2005–August 2006). The majority of these

lenders (43) were state-licensed. We focus on loans originated during calendar year 2005, when

HB4050 discussions were not prevalent.

        We note that exiting lenders were smaller. They originated mortgages to borrowers with

somewhat lower credit scores but charged a slightly lower credit spread. A higher share of those

21
   None of the patterns depend on the choice of the threshold level or geographic area. The “every month” condition
is intended to eliminate lenders that withdrew from HB4050 zip codes during the fall of 2006 after working off their
backlog of earlier applications.

                                                        24
mortgages had adjustable-rate contracts. They originated a higher share of Category I and II

loans, but a lower fraction of their loans had no equity (100% LTV). Yet, on net, the 18-month

default rate on mortgages originated in 2005 is measurably higher for state-licensed lenders that

ended up exiting HB4050 areas—11.6% versus 10.4% for lenders that continued operating. We

also note that non-state-licensed lenders in the LP-HMDA sample appear to have had very low

lending volumes and to have been serving a much higher credit quality population.

         Overall, our results show state-licensed lenders were more likely to exit the HB4050 zip
codes during the legislation period. These lenders appear to have served a population with lower

credit quality and to have provided loans that were categorized by regulators as risky.



5.       The Effect of the Anti-Predatory Program on Default Rates

         The previous sections established that the legislation reduced market activity in general,

and in particular, improved the average credit quality of borrowers, improved the risk profile of

mortgages, and affected lenders that originated risky loans. From the point of view of the

legislators, these effects are in line with their objective—to reduce what was perceived to be

predatory lending activity.

         Given these changes in the market, we now examine the effects of the legislation on

mortgage performance. The hypothesis that we test is whether lower predatory lending activity

had a material effect on mortgage default. We measure loan performance by flagging borrowers

who defaulted on their loans within 18 months of origination.22 We then estimate a series of

ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions, as defined in equation (1), in which the set of controls

includes measures of borrower credit quality (FICO score), contract terms (LTV ratio, interest

spread, and logged property valuation), and contract type (no- or low-documentation, and

indicators for Categories I and II). In addition, we include three sets of fixed effects: month

dummies interacted with a state-licensed lender indicator, zip code dummies interacted with a


22
  A loan is considered defaulted if it is 90+ days past due, in bankruptcy, or in foreclosure or is real-estate owned by
the lender.

                                                          25
state-licensed lender indicator, and zip code interacted with calendar month. These fixed effects

control for variation in all three dimensions that define the treatment: zip code, month, and

lender type.

           We present two sets of base regressions in Table 5, Panels A and B. Panel A uses a

sample based on all mortgages between 2005 and 2007 originated in the pilot zip codes in

addition to mortgages in the 12–zip code control group. Panel B uses the same treatment group

but uses the synthetic control sample of matched loans (as defined in Section 3.3). The
dependent variable in all regressions is an indicator of loan default within 18 months. In all

regressions, the variable of interest is an indicator of whether the loan is part of the treatment

group (i.e., originated by a state-licensed lender during the pilot period in the pilot zip codes).

           In each panel, there are six regression specifications. In Column (1) in each panel, we

include no controls other than the fixed effects described above. In Column (2), we add controls

for FICO score and logged loan amount. In Column (3), we add the no/low documentation

indicator, indicators of whether the loans fall under Category I or Category II, and the LTV

variable. Columns (4) to (6) repeat the specifications of Columns (1) to (3) but add lender fixed

effects.

           The results in Table 5, Panels A and B show that when we consider the entire treated

group, the effects of the legislation on default rates are virtually nonexistent. In Panel A, there is

no discernible effect. In Panel B, the effect on the treatment loans is negative, but it is

economically small and statistically insignificant. The magnitude of legislation-related declines

in default rates is about 1 percentage point (no lender fixed effects) or about 2.5 percentage

points (with lender fixed effects). The unconditional likelihood of default in the loan-matched

control sample during the pilot time is 23.8%; hence, the legislation caused a decline in default

of up to 11% for the treated group.
           In Panels C and D, we present additional specifications of the baseline regressions to

hone down on drivers of default in different subsamples, focusing on subgroups that are likely to

exhibit stronger results. Panel C uses a control sample that is based on the 12 control zip codes,


                                                  26
while Panel D is based on the matched synthetic sample. In the first specification, the sample

includes only subprime borrowers (FICO ≤ 620). In the second specification, the sample is

restricted to loans originated by state-licensed lenders. The third specification includes only

loans made to subprime borrowers by state-licensed lenders. The fourth specification is restricted

even further to state lenders who did not exit from the sample.

       Comparing the results in the different specifications sheds light on the source of the

decline in default rates. Specifically, the decline in the default rate is steepest in the matched
synthetic sample that is restricted to the subprime population and state-licensed lenders. It is also

the only sample in which the improvement in default rates is statistically significant. For this

population, the decline in default is about 6 to 7 percentage points, out of a base rate of about

27.2% (third specification in Panel D). This means that the improvement in mortgage

performance is concentrated in the subprime population.

       To answer the question of whether the decline in default is due to the exit of predatory

lenders, we compare the third and fourth specifications. The samples used in these specifications

are the same except that the latter is limited to lenders that continued lending in the treatment zip

codes during the pilot period. The regressions show that the decline in default dissipates once

this restriction is imposed. Put differently, we observe no improvement in the performance of

subprime loans originated by lenders that continued to operate in HB4050 zip codes during the

pilot period. The juxtaposition of these results leads us to conclude that the decline in default was

driven by lender exit.

       In Panel E, we provide additional specifications for robustness purposes. The dependent

variable in these regressions is an indicator of whether the loan defaulted within 36 months (as

opposed to 18 months earlier). The motivation for this is to verify that our results are not driven

by a difference in the sensitivity of the explored populations to the financial crisis; a period of 36
months extends well into the crisis period. Then, we rerun the third and fourth specifications

from Panels C and D. The results show that that the decline in default mirrors the panels above.




                                                 27
       To summarize, our results show that the overall effect of the legislation on mortgage

default rates in treated areas was relatively minor: a decline of 1 to 2.5 percentage points, for a

base rate default of 24 to 27 percent. We find, however, that the pilot had a stronger effect on the

subprime population, for whom the improvement in default rates was statistically and

economically significant: between 5 and 7 percentage points, for a base rate of default of 27%

(18% to 26% relative decline). Furthermore, our evidence shows that the decline in defaults was

driven by lender exit. Hence, these findings suggest the withdrawal from the market of some
lenders resulted in a measurable improvement in loan performance for those subprime borrowers

who were able to access the credit market.



6.     Estimating the Default Rate of Predatory Loans

       With estimates obtained in the preceding sections, we can calculate the default rate of

“predatory” loans, after making some assumptions about loan distribution across markets. In this

exercise, “predatory loans” are defined as loans that were not originated during the HB4050 pilot

period, presumably because of the effect of the treatment. Our goal here is to approximate the

hypothetical default rate of predatory loans.

       We estimate that the default rate on subprime loans that were not originated due to

HB4050 would have been about 32 percent. We performed this algebraic calculation in the

following manner: from Table 1, Panel B, we see the default rates in the treated and control

samples were very similar both before and after the treatment period. It was only during the

treatment period that they diverged. Thus, assuming they would have been similar without the

treatment, we can back out the hypothetical default rate for the precluded predatory loans. In the

synthetic control sample of state-licensed subprime loans, all originated loans during the

treatment period had a default rate of 26.4 percent (Table 1, Panel B, Column (6)). In the treated
group, loan activity declined by 53.7% (Table 2, Panel C, state-licensed lenders), and the default

rate declined by about 7.0 percentage points (Table 5, Panel D, third specification, Columns (4)-

(6)). Therefore, the “precluded” predatory loans would have required a default rate of 32.4% in


                                                28
order to reach an average default rate of 26.4%.23 With this calculation, predatory loans appear to

have a default rate 6.0 percentage points (32.4% – 26.4%) higher than loans that are not

predatory.

           It is important to note that the pilot also disrupted mortgage activity outside of the

narrowly defined subprime segment of the market. Those segments did not realize any gains

from improved mortgage performance (e.g., Table 5, Panels A and B) but did experience the

costs of the disruption.

           Because of the assumptions required for the above calculation, we utilize alternative data

to test for robustness of this estimate using a different methodology. Specifically, we calculate

the default rate of predatory loans using data provided by one of the HUD counseling agencies

that collected loan and borrower information as part of the HB4050 mandate. Our sample

includes 121 loans that we could match to loans in the LP data set.

           During the counseling process, the counselors flagged some loans as potentially being

predatory. They used three main criteria in making this determination: the loan was priced above

the market rates, the borrower was thought not to be able to afford the loan, and the loan was

thought to have fraud indicia (Housing Action Illinois, 2007). We use these flags to measure the

effect of predatory lending in two empirical settings.

           Our first test compares the performance of loans with predatory flags to those not

identified as predatory. Table 6, Panel A shows the results. A loan flagged as predatory yet still

originated had a 6.5 percentage points higher default rate (90+ days delinquent) within 18

months (Column (1)). This magnitude is very similar to the above calculation of a 6.0 percentage

point differential in default rates (although it is not statistically different from zero given our

limited sample size). We also measure the probability of default of the subsample of loans that

were flagged as having indicia of fraud (as opposed to using the three criteria discussed above).

We find the default rate differential for these loans to be even higher at 12.3 percentage points

(Column (3)).

23
     (26.4% - 7.0%) * (100% - 53.7%) + X * 53.7% = 26.4%; X = 32.4%.

                                                      29
        An additional question is whether counselors flagged loans as problematic based on

readily observable information or whether they also relied on soft information collected during

the counseling sessions. This question is relevant for policy design because if only observable

information was used in making the predatory designation, the same outcome could have been

achieved with a specific underwriting protocol and without counselor review.

        To tackle this question, we construct a sample of loans in the control zip codes that are

matched to the 121 counseled loans for which we have contract and performance data.
Specifically, we match each counseled loan with up to ten other loans in the control zip codes

that were originated during the same time period, were originated for the same purpose

(purchase/refinance), and had similar house prices, adjustable/fixed rate types, leverage,

documentation levels, interest rates, and FICO scores.24 Overall, our matched sample includes

1,048 loans (summary statistics are provided in Table 1, Panel E). If a counseled loan is flagged,

we give it a “red flag” indicator and similarly tag each of its matched control loans. Assuming

that the predatory designation was given based on observables only, we would expect to continue

to see higher default probabilities on all “red flag” loans but not to see any differential impact

among the “red flag” loans that were actually counseled.

        Table 6, Panel B presents the regression results. Consistent with the previous evidence,

the regression shows that the “red flag” loans have about a 6 percentage point higher default rate

than nonflagged loans. The interaction with the counseling indicator suggests that the loans that

were actually counseled are not materially different from those that were matched to them, which

is consistent with the idea that loans were flagged based solely on observables.

        We repeat the same exercise with “red flag” defined as only cases of suspected fraud. The

coefficient on the fraud red flag and its interaction with the counseling indicator (Columns (3)-

(4)) are positive but very imprecisely estimated. This finding suggests that our loan-matching

procedure did not match well on the fraud dimension—most likely because indicia of fraud are


24
  More precisely, we include loans that were originated within 31 days of one another and that had house prices
within $8,000, leverage within 10%, interest rates within 1%, and FICO scores within 20 points.

                                                      30
based on soft information collected by counselors that is unobservable in the raw mortgage

servicer data. The results in Panel B indicate that some dimensions of predatory lending, such as

loan affordability and excessive interest rates, are readily captured with observable data, while

others such as fraud indicia are not.

       To summarize, this section used multiple methods to measure the default rates of

predatory loans. The different methods generated strikingly similar estimates: predatory loans

originated in this period had an 18-month default rate that was about 6 percentage points higher
than similar loans that were not predatory.



7.     Conclusion

       Whether predatory lending was an important factor in precipitating the subprime crisis is

one of the key questions in the academic and policy debate about the sources of the crisis and its

aftermath. The main empirical challenge in answering this question is that it is difficult to

distinguish predatory loans from nonpredatory loans on an ex ante basis. In general, predatory

lenders exploit borrowers by having an informational advantage over them. This informational

advantage is not easily discernible when examining the observable characteristics alone.

       In this study we use an anti-predatory legislative pilot (HB4050) enacted in 2006 in

Chicago as an instrument for identifying predatory lending. The legislation required certain

borrowers in ten zip codes in Chicago to seek counseling when they took out a mortgage from

state-licensed lenders. Following implementation of the pilot, market activity dropped by about

40%, largely through the exit of lenders specializing in risky loans and through a decline in the

share of subprime borrowers. Default rates in the subpopulation targeted by the pilot—subprime

borrowers served by state-licensed lenders—improved by 6 to 7 percentage points, relative to the

unconditional default rate of 26 percent. We use these estimates to impute a hypothetical default
rate of about 32 percent on the presumably predatory loans that were not originated due to

HB4050. We obtain similar estimates using other techniques based on subsamples of loans that

were counseled and flagged as being predatory.


                                               31
       In interpreting our results, the first thing to note is that the pilot represented a very blunt

policy tool. Its bluntness reflects the severe informational problems that exist in identifying

predatory lending. Predatory lending is about unobservable information: lenders engage in

predatory lending when they exploit borrowers by having superior information about their ability

to repay the loan (Bond, Musto, and Yilmaz, 2009). Given the ambiguity and subjectivity in

identifying which loans are predatory and which are not, regulators must resort to rough proxies

(Litan, 2001). In the case of HB4050, predatory loans were proxied as loans made in the poorer
parts of the city to borrowers with low credit scores and with a certain risk profile. Of course,

these proxies are imperfect and therefore may impose costs on lenders who do not make

predatory loans and on borrowers who are not being exploited.

       The bluntness of HB4050 resulted in severe market disruptions, as it drove about half of

the state-licensed lenders out of the market, lowered the number of originated mortgages by

about a third, and imposed high counseling costs on the remaining borrowers and lenders. The

wide and fairly indiscriminate reach of the pilot also triggered intense public opposition from all

of the affected parties—communities and lenders alike—ultimately leading to its early

termination. This response highlights the political difficulties involved in policy interventions in

an environment with inherently complex incentive structures and asymmetric information held

by lenders, borrowers, and regulators.

       The pilot did appear to lower default rates among its primary target population—

subprime borrowers served by state-licensed lenders. Although these improvements in mortgage

performance were measurable, the default rates among the treated subset of borrowers remained

alarmingly high. This suggests that potentially predatory lending practices by themselves cannot

account for the meltdown in the subprime mortgage market.

       Our finding that eliminating bad lenders had a greater impact on mortgage defaults than
eliminating bad loans also suggests that reckless, rather than predatory, lending practices deserve

greater scrutiny. Although answering this question is beyond the scope of this paper, these results

are consistent with recent research that highlights the role of long intermediation chains in


                                                 32
mortgage origination leading up to the crisis. In particular, the majority of lenders subject to

HB4050 were mortgage banks and brokers that securitized the lion’s share of their loans. Such

lending practices have been found to be associated with aggressive misrepresentation of

information throughout the mortgage origination and funding process and with subsequently

higher defaults (Keys et al., 2010; Jiang, Nelson, and Vytlacil, 2012; Piskorski, Seru, and Witkin,

2013). In a similar vein, our finding that borrowers often chose to pursue bad loans in spite of

(justified) warnings from counselors brings up questions of the role played by the borrowers
themselves. These results join the body of literature showing that reckless lending and

borrowing, combined with distorted incentives of intermediaries, were at the heart of the

subprime crisis (e.g., Ben-David, 2011; Agarwal and Ben-David, 2013).

        It may be tempting to conduct a back-of-the-envelope welfare analysis by linking the

estimates of reductions in defaults with the costs of such defaults and of the counseling itself.25

However, doing so fails to take into account a number of important effects—losses in utility

incurred by excluded borrowers, positive spillovers on neighborhood property values from lower

defaults, losses from inefficient contract choices that resulted from trying to avoid counseling

sessions, and so forth. Moreover, evaluating the overall welfare effect of this intervention

requires weighing the relative costs and benefits accruing to different market participants.26 It is

further complicated by various distortions that already exist in the housing market due to unique

tax treatment, zoning restrictions, and so forth, as well as potential externalities produced by

individual housing decisions.




25
  For instance, we could have taken the average house value in HB4050 zip codes of $190,000 and assumed a
deadweight loss from foreclosure of about 30% (Campbell, Giglio, and Pathak, 2011). Based on the estimate of a
6% higher default rate resulting from predatory lending, the expected benefit from curbing predatory lending would
be $3,420 (0.06*$190,000*30%) per borrower. Therefore, the pre-borrower net direct benefit (net of counseling fee
and approximately $100 for the cost of time) would be of approximately $2,000.
26
  Some recent attempts to theoretically model the welfare effects of policy choices in household financial markets
include Carlin and Gervais (2009); Bolton, Freixas, and Shapiro (2007); and Carlin (2009).

                                                       33
        Mandated financial counseling and increased oversight of lenders are important policy

tools being considered in the wake of the housing market crisis.27 Both policies impose

restrictions on free contracting between borrowers and lenders. As such, they can be expected to

shrink credit markets, particularly for the financially disadvantaged segments of the population.

In addition to providing an estimate of the quantitative impact of anti-predatory-lending

programs, our paper sounds a cautionary note about the difficulties of implementing effective

policy in an informationally opaque setting with complex and conflicting incentives.




27
  In 2010 Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, which created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
(CFPB) to safeguard consumers from unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices in the financial sector. Among other
approaches, CFPB is likely to consider increasing access to financial counseling.

July 2005:

   -   Governor Blagojevich signs House Bill 4050, which is designed to protects homebuyers from
       predatory lending in Cook County’s at-risk communities and reduce the incidence of
       foreclosures; the project is scheduled to begin January 1, 2006 (U.S. Fed News, July 21, 2005).

   -   Mortgage brokers are concerned about the impact of the new legislation on origination business
       (Origination News, July 1, 2005).

January 2006:

   -   HB4050 is postponed due to technical and logistic issues (National Mortgage News, January 9,
       2006).

March 2006:

   -   Mortgage lenders object to HB4050 and argue that its compliance costs may prompt firms to

The table presents summary statistics for the data used in the study. Panel A compares demographics (from the 2005
IRS Statistics of Income ZIP code data and 2000 Census) of the treated zip codes, the control zip codes, and the rest
of Chicago. Panel B focuses on mortgages originated by state-licensed lenders; it compares means and standard
deviations of the main variables used in the analysis across the treated zip codes, the control zip codes, and the
matched loan (synthetic) sample, and across periods of time (pretreatment, during treatment, and post-treatment).
Panel C presents similar statistics for non-state-licensed lenders. Panel D shows summary statistics (means and
standard deviations) for non-state-licensed lenders. Panel E presents summary statistics for the variables in the data
set received from a counseling agency, and for the matched sample for these loans.

    Table 2. Effects of HB4050 on Market Activity: Application and Mortgage Volumes

The table presents mortgage application and origination statistics for the pre-HB4050, HB4050, and post-
HB4050 periods. The sample is stratified by lender type (all lenders, state-licensed lenders, and non-
state-licensed lenders) and by transaction type (all, purchases, and refinances). Note that the “Purchases”
and “Refinances” categories do not necessarily add up to the “All” category because some mortgages
have other purposes, e.g., home improvement. Panel A and Panel B present an analysis of mortgage
applications using HMDA data. Panel C presents an analysis of mortgage originations using the matched
LP-HMDA data. Panel D limits the sample to loans to borrowers with FICO scores lower than 620.

                      Table 3. Effects of HB4050 on Mortgage Characteristics

The table presents regressions of borrower and mortgage characteristics on the HB4050 indicator. The
sample used in Panel A includes all lenders. The sample used in Panel B includes only lenders who stayed
in the market during the treatment period in the HB4050 zip codes. HB4050 is an indicator of whether the
loan was originated in the treated HB4050 zip codes during the treatment period. FICO is the FICO credit
score of the borrower. Interest spread measures the interest spread over the same-maturity treasury rate
(for fixed rate mortgages) or the quoted interest spread (for adjustable rate mortgages). ARM is an
indicator of whether a mortgage is an adjustable rate mortgage. No/low doc is an indicator of whether the
loan required no or low documentation. Category I is an indicator of interest-only loans, loans with
interest rate adjustments within three years, or loans underwritten on the basis of stated income (no/low-
doc loans). Category II includes loans with negative amortization or prepayment penalties. 100% LTV is
an indicator of whether the loan has a 100% loan-to-value ratio. Excessive mortgages are defined by
HB4050 as mortgages that are ARM, low documentation, interest-only, and ≥95% LTV. Standard errors,
presented in parentheses, are clustered at the zip code level. *, **, and *** denote statistical significance
at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.

                          Table 5. The Effect of HB4050 on Borrower Default

The table presents regressions of borrower defaults. Panels A and B present baseline regressions. Panels A and C
use the treatment sample and a control sample based on zip codes with similar demographics. Panels B and D use
the treatment sample and a control sample based on one-to-one loan matching (the synthetic control sample). Panel
E uses both control samples. In each panel, there are six regression specifications. In all regressions, we regress the
default indicator on the treatment dummy with the following: zip code interacted with calendar month, zip code
interacted with a state-licensed lender indicator, and calendar month interacted with a state-licensed lender indicator.
These three sets of fixed effects control for variations in all three dimensions that define the treatment: treatment zip
code, treatment month, and treatment lender group. In Column (1) in each panel, we include no other controls. In
Column (2), we include controls for FICO score and logged loan amount. In Column (3), we include a no/low
documentation indicator, indicators of whether the loan is Category I or Category II, and an LTV variable. Columns
(4) to (6) repeat the specifications of Columns (1) to (3) but add lender fixed effects. The dependent variable is an
indicator of borrower default (within 18 or 36 months). Default is defined as a 90-day delinquency. HB4050 is an
indicator of whether the loan was originated in the treated HB4050 zip codes during the treatment period. FICO/100
is the FICO credit score of the borrower (divided by 100). No/low doc is an indicator of whether the loan required no
or low documentation. Category I is an indicator for interest-only loans, loans with interest rate adjustments within
three years, or loans underwritten on the basis of stated income (no/low-doc loans). Category II includes loans with
negative amortization or prepayment penalties. The tables also show statistics about the default rate in the control
group. Standard errors, presented in parentheses, are clustered at the zip code level. *, **, and *** denote statistical
significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.

    Table 6. Measuring the Default Rate of Predatory Loans Using the HB4050 Data Set

The table presents analysis of a sample of counseled loans (121 loans) and a control sample of loans
matched from other Chicago zip codes (every counseled loan is matched with up to ten similar loans from
Chicago). Panel A presents the sample of 121 counseled loans. Panel B presents the sample of 121
together with the 1,048 matched loans. The dependent variable is an indicator of borrower default within
18 months. Default is defined as a 90-day delinquency. Red flag is an indicator of whether the counseled
loan was identified as unaffordable or fraudulent by the HUD-certified counselors. Red flag (fraud) is an
indicator of whether the counseled loan was identified as having fraud indicia. No/low doc is an indicator
of whether the loan required no or low documentation. Category I is an indicator for interest-only loans,
loans with interest rate adjustments within three years, or loans underwritten on the basis of stated income
(no/low-doc loans). Category II includes loans with negative amortization or prepayment penalties.
Excessive mortgages are mortgages that are ARM, no/low documentation, interest-only, or ≥95% LTV.
Standard errors, presented in parentheses, are clustered at the zip code level. *, **, and *** denote
statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.

                      Figure 1. HB4050 Treatment and Control Zip Codes

This figure presents a map of the HB4050 treatment area (the shaded area) and the control zip codes (the
striped area). As described in Section 3.3, the 12–zip code control area is constructed to resemble the
treatment area in terms of pretreatment socioeconomic characteristics and housing market conditions. The
socioeconomic variables used for selection include 2005 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) zip code–level
income statistics, the 2000 Census shares of minority population and of those living below the poverty
level, and the unemployment rate. Housing market metrics include default rates on mortgages originated
in 2005 as well as zip code–level means of FICO scores, LTV and DTI ratios, and housing values. All of
the control zip codes lie within the City of Chicago limits. The 12–zip code control area has about as
many residents as the treatment area.

This figure presents a time series of loan application filings. Figure 2a depicts filings in both the treatment
and control areas, separating lenders subject to HB4050 and those exempt from it. Figure 2b focuses only
on the treatment areas, differentiating between lenders that remained active during the mandate period
and those that exited HB4050 zip codes. The solid vertical lines denote the time during which HB4050
was in force.
