              Capital Flows, Investment, and Exchange Rates



                                ABSTRACT



     This paper incorporates international capital flows into a two—country,

monetary—general—equilibrium model of asset prices with investment and

production. We use the model to calculate theoretical covariances between

investment, the current account, the exchange rate, and the terms of trade.

These covariances depend upon the coefficient of relative risk—aversion, the

magnitude and sign of a country's net international indebtedness, other

properties of tastes and technologies, and the stochastic processes on

disturbances to productivity and monetary growth rates. International

capital flows arise from changes in world wealth and its relative composition

in foreign and domestic assets. The dynamic, stochastic relations between

capital flows, exchange rates, investment, and the terms of trade are

critically dependent on optimal portfolio allocations and the stochastic

behavior of asset prices on international financial markets.

                    by Alan C. Stockrnan and Lars E. 0. Svensson


1. Introduction
     Adler and Dumas (1983) have recently called for the incorporation of

international capital flows into a "true stochastic theory of the balance of

payments" based on optimizing behavior and rational expectations. We attempt

here to take a step toward that end by developing a tractable dynamic

stochastic model of the relations between changes in exchange rates, capital

flows, savings and investment, and asset prices.         The model can be solved

explicitly for an equilibrium, and we calculate the covariances of endogenous

variables in terms of underlying stochastic processes of exogenous variables.

Our model combines elements from recent research on general equilibrium asset-

pricing (Lucas (1978)) with investment and production (Brock (1982)), and

asset—pricing in monetary economies (Townsend (1982). Lucas (1982, 1983),

Svensson (1984a,b)) with the recent literature on the interactions of

investment, the current account, and exchange rates. These interactions have

received extensive attention recently, with much of the work summarized by

Branson and Henderson (1985) ,     Frenkel   and Mussa (1985) ,    and   Obstfeld and

Stockman (1985) .    The   importance of investment in accounting for observed

changes in the current account and capital flows is underscored by Sachs

(1983).   This paper examines theoretically the joint stochastic behavior of
capital flows, investment, the exchange rate, and the terms of trade in a

model that synthesizes these areas of research.

      We focus on a two-country world in which the output of one of the two

countries can be used for investment purposes. We find that the covariance

between investment and the current account can be either positive or negative,
depending on the coefficient of relative risk-aversion, the magnitude of

changes in   the   expected rate of   return associated with the changes in
investment, the magnitude and sign of the country's net international

indebtedness, and the covariance between foreign output and the rate of

foreign monetary growth. Productivity shocks that alter domestic output do

not necessarily result in a current account surplus because, unlike much work

in this area, we assume the existence of well-integrated international

financial markets. However, the covariance between domestic output and the

current account surplus is nevertheless positive under certain conditions

(that depend on the degree of risk aversion) because of effects operating

through investment and the capital stock.

      The covariance between capital flows and the terms of trade depends on

the degree of risk-aversion, the magnitude and sign of              international

indebtedness, the covariance between foreign and domestic productivity shocks,

and covariances of rates of foreign and domestic monetary growth with the

other exogenous variables.       We discuss conditions under which           real

appreciation is associated with a current account surplus or deficit. The

covariance between capital flows and the rate of change of the exchange rate

depends on similar considerations.      Disturbances that affect the terms of

trade also affect the exchange rate along the lines discussed in Stockman

(1980) and Obstfeld and Stockman (1985) .     The effects on the exchange rate

also depend on the behavior of nominal prices of goods. Although we introduce

money into the model through cash—in—advance constraints, the velocity of

money is variable as in Lucas (1980) , Stockman (1980) , and Svensson (19814a,b)

Real and nominal disturbances can affect the exchange rate through their

effects on interest rates and money demands.         This introduces additional
                                                                            3

channels through which exchange rates and the current account are related.

Interest rates and nominal asset prices can be computed as in Svenssori

(1981+a,b)

      The model has implications for a number of other issues, including

variability of exchange rates and ratios of prices (or price indexes) of goods

across countries, the joint stochastic behavior of interest rates and exchange

rates, the relations between capital flows and interest rates, the Harberger—

Laursen—Metzler effect of changes in the terms of trade on saving and capital

flows, and the effects of alternative exchange rate systems or of exchange-

market interventions. The model permits explicit calculations of covariances

of eridogenous variables in terms of underlying exogenous variables.     This

affords an important advantage over nonstochastic models in which relations

between exchange rates, capital flows, investment, and the terms of trade are

derived from comparative statics exercises: the non—stochastic models are not

sutied for a serious analysis of portfolio choice.      But the structure of

optimal portfolios plays a critical role in generating the joint stochastic

behavior of exchange rates, capital flows, and investment in equilibrium.

This is illustrated in the results of Section 5.

       Section 2 describes the setup of the model including the optimization

problems solved by foreign and domestic representative households. Section 3

discusses equilibrium. Section L4 discusses the roles of capital flows in the

model, and Section 5 presents results on theoretical covariances between

capital flows, investment, the terms of trade, and the exchange rate.

2.    The Model
         We examine a world economy with two countries, two goods, and a flexible

exchange rate between the two moneys.            The two countries are completely

specialized in production.           Outputs of the goods depend on the countries'

capital stocks and two random variables,


          =
              x(kt,Et)                                                              (2.la)

and

          =
              y(k',e)    ,                                                          (2.lb)

where x. and y. are outputs of the domestic and foreign goods, kt and k are

the domestic and foreign capital stocks, and              and       are exogenous random

variables (possibly vectors). We assume k is permanently fixed,1 so                     is

exogenous. We also assume that only the foreign good can be used for domestic

investment, and that domestic capital completely depreciates after its use.2

Investment transforms foreign goods at time t         into      domestic capital at time

t+1, so y. -      kt+i       equals total world consumption of the foreign good in

equilibrium at time t.

         There are representative households         in    each country who choose

consumptions and portfolio allocations to maximize


      Et =t rt U(x,y), 0< 3 <               1,                                       (2.2)



where x and y are consumption of the domestic and foreign goods by the

household at time r. The utility function U(.) arid discount factor 3 are

identical across countries. We assume U(.) is concave with U,,, =              0.    This

assumption of additively—separable utility is very important because it makes

the model block-recursive and permits us to obtain an explicit solution to the

model.
                                                                               5

        Let P and P denote the own-currency prices of domestic and foreign

goods and e denote the exchange rate.       Let Mt and Nt be the quantities of

domestic and foreign moneys the household owns at the beginning of period t,

and let (—l)Ptt be a lump-sum transfer payment (or tax)            the domestic

household receives during period t, where Mt is the money supply at the

beginning of the period, and wt is one plus the money-growth rate, i.e.

'÷i/Mt. Let at be a vector of the households non—money assets that pay

in interest or dividends at t and have price qt at t.      By 'non—money' assets

we mean all assets other than domestic and foreign currencies. We measure 5,

and q in units of domestic goods, that is, dividends and prices in home

currency are deflated by the home currency price of home goods.              Let

(q+5)q denote the inner product Z1                    The budget constraint of

the domestic household is then


        (1/Pt) [Mt + etNt + (1)P + (q+6)                                   (2.3)



              4   +   (eP'/P)y +       [Mt+i + etNt+i] +


        The budget constraint of the representative foreign household is

analogous but with (-l) replaced by et(c$-l)t.
        In addition to the budget constraint (2.3), the households face finance

constraints (cash—in—advance constraints)


      Mt    t 4                                                           (2.ka)
and

      Nt    P '                                                           (2.b)

where       is the household's total purchase of foreign goods at t, which

equals the purchase of foreign goods for consumption, 4, and the purchase of

investment goods. Investment is discussed below.
                                                                                    6

          This formulation of the household's optimization problem corresponds to

the following scenario. The household begins period t with moneys Mt and Nt,

and with non-money assets at.       The household observes the current state of

the economy, the vector s (to be specified below) .          Then   the household

purchases goods using sellers' currencies, subject to the finance constraints

(2.14).     After goods markets close, asset markets open.      All interest and

dividend payments are made at this time, and assets may be traded. The lump

sum transfer (tax) from the government is made during asset market trade.

Note that this timing prevents these transfers from being used to finance

consumption during period t.3 Asset market trades are constrained by (2.3),

given (2.14)

          Our assumption that trade in goods precedes trade in assets each period

is only a timing convention and has no economic consequences.          We assume,

tentatively, that (i) asset—markets and goods—markets are alternately open for

trades, (ii) households acquire the information s after asset-markets close

but before subsequent goods-markets close           (and acquire no additional

information until after the next round of asset—markets is closed), and (iii)

transfer payments from the government (or tax collections) occur while asset-

markets are open. This timing is illustrated in Figure 2.1. We later relax

assumption (i)      and permit continuous trade in assets (see page 19 and

footnotes 4 and 12)

          Any asset that pays its dividends or interest physically in one of the

currencies (rather than physically in goods) is permitted in the model. Also,

firms are permitted to issue assets that require the owner to deliver to the

firm units of the foreign good that the firm can use as capital. Thus,

domestic firms purchase capital through agents——the owners of assets issued by

      vM = (X4-.z)ITM,                                                       (2.lOa)

and

      Va = (X(q1+61) + p1, (q2+) ...X(qj+j)) ,                               (2.lOc)

where a has J components. There is a set of necessary conditions analogous

to (2.9) for the optimization problem of the representative foreign household.

       We now turn to the optimization problem of domestic firms. The domestic

firm is defined as a set of assets (a1,a2) with (ex-dividend) prices (q1,q2)
                                                                                                              10

We   assume that asset-quantities are fixed and we define units so that the

quantity of each asset associated with the representative domestic firm is

one.6 The value of the firm is then q1 + q2.                     Owners of the firm (the assets

a1 and a2) choose a complete contingency plan for investment (and, therefore,

output) to maximize the value of the firm.7

       The asset a1 has already been discussed: it is a contract obligating

the owner of the asset (who can be thought of as a purchasing—agent employed

by the firm) to perform a service, viz, deliver kt+i physical units of capital

(negative) dividend 5 paid by the firm at t, defined in (2.8). Because the
dividend                is negative for all t, the asset price                           is negative.        (The

absolute value of                     can be thought of as the present-value of the wages

received by the purchasing agent.                   A household that buys a1 pays a negative

price q1 which is analogous to a one-time wage payment for permanent

employment.             If the household sells a1 it is terminating the employment

contract and paying —q1 > 0 for this termination.)

        The asset a2 the second element of a pays as a dividend each period

the firms gross receipts from selling goods that period, i.e.


               =
                    x(k,e)        .                                                                     (2.11)

This dividend is paid when asset-markets open at period t to current owners of

asset a2. Notice that the dividend consists of gross receipts from the

firm's sales during goods—markets at t.

        The value of the firm at period t asset—markets, after dividends

and 2t have been paid, is q1t +                q2.    But (2.9f) implies that q1 satisfies8
                                                                              11

         =                                                                (2.12)
             E

         = -Et    =+i T_t(X+v)pki/
and, by (2.9e), q2 satisfies


         =
             Et   =t+i Tt   X62/X                                         (2.13)

         =
             Et Z=t+i rt XTx,cr)/Xt.

So the value of the representative domestic firm is (ex—dividend, at t)


     Et E1 T_t 7X1,E7) -                                                  (2.14)



We assume that firms act as price—takers, so each firm treats (X7.,p7.,p) as

given for all .      Notice that (2.14) involves kt÷i,kt+7          But kt+l is

investment made at t and is predetermined by period-t asset-markets.        (The

investment goods were purchased at period-t goods-markets and delivered to

firms for installation at period—t asset—markets.) The complete contingency

plan made by the firm at period—t asset—markets involves kt÷2kt+3

      At period-t asset-markets the representative domestic firm chooses a

complete contingency plan for (kt÷2,kt+3,...) to maximize (2.14).           This

involves choosing a function ki.+i(srXi.,p7.iprk2.er), for r =      t+1,t+2,...,
that satisfies9

or


     !31XT+lXk(kT+l,er+l)dF(s') =U(x,y).

The right—hand side of (2.15) shows the marginal cost of investment at r in

terms of foregone consumption. The left side of (2.15) shows the expected
                                                                                                      12


marginal benefit: higher capital at T+l produces additional output at r+l,

and X.r+1   is   the marginal utility           of   this income, which, by (2.9a) and (2.9c)

is the expected marginal utility of an additional unit of domestic money

carried into period r+2, when income generated by the investment can be spent

by consumers.1°


3. Equilibrium
       We now examine an equilibrium in which s =                     (Et,YtWt   )   , i.e.    at the

beginning of each period households observe the current disturbance to

domestic production et the current level of foreign output t' and the

current (gross) rates of monetary expansion                     and c4.

       An equil ibrium for this model is a set of functions v, X, ,                      p, M'   ,   N',
a' d and d for the home consumer, another corresponding set of functions

for the foreign consumer (including M"' ,                 N',   a*1 ,   xd*, and d) ,     a   capital

stock function k' =        K       for the domestic firm, and price and dividend functions

q, M' N' p and 5. All these are functions of the state variables (F,Lk,s)

where s =    (e,y,,w')         .     These functions satisfy (2.5), (2.6) and (2.9) ,                the
foreign analogues of                 (2.5),     (2.6) and    (2.9),     (2.15), and the market

equilibrium conditions

and

      a' + a* = (1,1,1,0)                ,                                                     (3.1c)

claim on sales of foreign output, with 53                   = py.     The supply of asset a3 is
                                                                                       13

assumed fixed and its quantity is normalized to unity.                Any other assets in

this model have total supply equal to zero because they will be liabilities to

one household and assets to another, so these other asset supplies are

represented by the zero vector 0 in (3.lc)

Note that many of the functions include only (k,s) as arguments and not money

stocks. Also note that (3.3m) defines dividends on two new assets, a and

      with world supplies equal to zero.

       The equilibrium solution (3.3) is block—recursive: The seven equations

(3.3a-g) form a block in the seven function X ,                 p,   m, n, p, and K.    This

block has two sub—blocks: the four equations (3.3a,c,e,g) determine the

functions K, m, X, and                  Then (3.3b,d,f) can be used to determine the

functions n, p, and p.

        The equiHbrium in           (3.3)    is a version of the uperfectly poo1ed'

equilibrium in Lucas (1982).             (3.3h) shows that each representative household

holds the world per-capita quantity of each money, while (3.3i) and (3.3j)
                                                                                 15

show that each household consumes the world per—capita output of the domestic

good and net output (after subracting investment) of the foreign good.      If our

model included non-traded goods, then optimal portfolios would allocate larger

shares to domestic than foreign money as in Stockman and Del las (1985)

(3.3k) and (3.31) yield asset—pricing formulas as in Lucas (1978, 1982) and

Brock (1982)

        Investment is a function of current foreign output only.    (3.3g) implies

that the investment function can be written as K(y) since y s the only

exogenous variable remaining in (3.3g) after integration (see the Appendix for

a rigorous argument) .     Intuitively,   the definition of s and the assumption

that s. is independently distributed over time mean that there are no shifts

over time in the function relating the amount of investment to its expected

physical return in units of future home output (or the discounted expected

utility of this output)       But variations in current foreign output alter the

costs of investment measured in future home output (or measured in current

utility).    Higher foreign output reduces the cost of investment, and the

resulting increase in investment allows an exogenous increase in current

foreign output to be transformed into future domestic output.          It is not

surprising, therefore, that (see the Appendix)


       0 <   < 1,                                                            (3.1+)



i.e.   increases in foreign output are used partly for consumption and partly

for investment.

        We now turn to real money balances and follow the reasoning developed in

Svensson (l984a,b) .     There is a critical value of ,    , with    the property

that when           real balances of domestic money equal domestic output, and
                                                                                                             16

when                 real balances of domestic money exceed domestic output and are

inversely related to the rate of domestic money growth and positively related

to domestic output.                    n particular, define


       A   (y) = 3fu         (x (K (y) ,         m (x (K (y) se') ,y ,c') dF (s') ,                     (3.5a)
and

           (x , y)     A (y)
                                 /u   (x)   x.                                                          (3. 5b)

Then (3.5)           and (3.3a,c,e)              imply that the functions m, ). and               satisfy, for
U)     LJ\" 7/

       m   = A   (y) /u (x)           > x, X =       u>    (x) ,   and j =    0,                        (3. 6a)



and, for w (x,y)

       m=      x,     ). =   A   (y) /xW           (x) ,   and      = u (x)    - A (y) /xw   0.         (3. 6b)



Here (3.6a)           corresponds            to the situation when the growth rate of domestic
money is small (below the critical level (x,y)) and the liquidity constraint

is not binding (m>x and =O) , whereas                                (3.6b) corresponds to a high growth

rate    of domestic money ( ) and a binding liquidity constraint (mx and
>O)
           The same line of reasoning can be used to obtain an analogous result for
real balances of foreign currency measured in units of foreign goods, n'.                                   t

capital flows. Using (3.7) and (3.8), (3.3b,d,f) imply tat if                                      <



               A*/uy(y_K(y))*          >    y, X u(y-K(Y)) and                      0,                  (3..9a)



while    if              (y)

          =    y,       A */y*             u>. (y—K (y)) and         u,. (y—K (y)
                                                                                         -    0.        (3. 9b)



Again,    (3.9a,b) corresponds to the rate of foreign monetary expansion being
below (above) the critical level *(y) and the liquidity constraint being

slack (n*<y and p*=Ø) or binding (n*=y and *0)

         The "measured relative price" of foreign goods, i.e., the function p,

can now be obtained from (3.6), (3.9) , and                        (3.7a) .   Then (3.9) and (3.7b,c)

determine n and p.              It is easy to verify that m, X. and                      are functions 0f x,

y, and         alone (not k or c&)*) ; n*, X, and                   are functions of y and              alone

(not k, x, or               ; and p, n, and p are functions of x, y, c,,, and w (but not

k) .   From this point on, we delete the superfluous arguments from our notation

for these functions, eg. )*(y,*) replaces ),*(k,s)

        The nominal price of domestic goods in domestic money is


       P(,x,y,) —                  — M/m(x,y,)                                                         (3.loa)


and the nominal price of foreign goods in foreign money is


       p*(W*) — l/elrN            —   */n(y*).                                                         (3.lOb)
                                                                                                 18

         The equilibrium described in               (3.3) includes   five non—money assets: a1

end a2 together comprise domestic firms, a3 is the equity of foreign firms,

and two other assets, a4 and a5 pool the uncertainty arising from domestic

and foreign transfer payments or taxes.                   (3.3k,l) can be used to obtain the

total market value of each of these assets, as in (2.12) and (2.13), or of any

other assets. These yield "asset—pricing" equations because we assume asset

quantities are fixed, however we could just as well have assumed asset prices

are fixed and obtained 'asset—quantity" equations.                       These approaches are

economically equivalent in any model in which stock splits are irrelevant and

dividends and capital gains are equivalent (see the Appendix).

         We will need to use explicit solutions for asset prices in our

subsequent discussion of savings, investment, capital flows, and the exchange

rate.        It turns out to be practical to express these prices in terms of

foreign goods. The equilibrium prices of the five assets are, when expressed

in    units   of foreign goods (q'=q/p)


        q(y,) = -B1/X"(y,)             ,                                                   (3.lla)

        q' (y,w') = B2 (y) /A (y,w),                                                       (3.1 ib)



        q(y,w) =      3/*(y,)          ,                                                   (3.llc)

        q (y,w*) =     B4/A (y,'),         and                                            (3.1 id)

         *      *
        q5(y,c   )   = B5/X   (y,w )   ,                                                  (3.lle)

where the constants B1, B3,                B4,   and B5, and the function B2(y) , are given in

elasticity      of the marginal utility            of home goods,
                                                                                     19

        sign A = sign B2 = sign (1—r)                                            (3.12)
where

     r    =
              -xu/u.
The implications of (3.12) will be discussed below.

        The "measured relative price" of foreign goods p in the equilibrium

described above does not indicate the number of domestic goods that can be

obtained by sacrificing one foreign good. Domestic goods must be purchased

with domestic money, and foreign goods with foreign money, at goods—markets.

But, in the model described above, these monies can only be traded for each

other at asset markets. The 'measured relative price' of foreign goods Pt has

been defined as eP/P, where the exchange rate et shows the price at which

currencies can subsequently be traded at the period-t asset—market (after the

period—t goods—market is closed) .             Fortunately, this "problem" has an easy
solution: the equilibrium of the model               is unaffected if households are

permitted to trade currencies at goods—markets as well as asset—markets.12 Let

St denote the exchange rate at which currencies trade at period-t goods—

markets. Then the representative household's optimization problem is altered

in three ways. First, a constraint is added equating the values of currencies

bought and sold at period-t goods—markets,


          +   SN   -
                       t   -
                               SW   = 0
                                                                                (3.13)


where Mt and Nt are quantities of moneys held after engaging in currency

trades at the goods—market.               Second, Mt and Nt replace     and Nt in the

liquidity constraints (2.4) and (2.7). Third, Mt and Nt replace Mt and Nt

the left-hand—sides of (2.3) and (2.6) .             Now   Mt and Nt are chosen by the

representative household. The two additional necessary conditions obtained

can be combined to give
                                                                            20


         =
             (x+) N
                                                                        (3.14)
             (x+) M

             u(y—K(Y))
             u(x(kt,et)) P

This solution for the spot exchange rate is analogous to those discussed by

Obstfeld and Stockman (1985, Section 2.1 and 5.2). Notice, for example, that

a change in tastes for goods alters the marginal rate of substitution on the

righthandside of (3.14) and changes the exchange rate even if P and P are

unaffected (e.g. if   >   and    >

      The relative price at which domestic and foreign goods can actually be

traded by households, what we call the (reciprocal of the) terms of trade, is


    Pt                                                                  (3.15)



which, by (3.14), equals the marginal rate of substitution between foreign and

domestic goods.

      The exchange rate prevailing at the period—t goods-market, S., can be

interpreted as the spot exchange rate for period-t. As we have noted, our

equilibrium solution for S. is analogous to the solution obtainea in other

models. The exchange rate prevailing at the period—t asset—market, et, can be

naturally interpreted as the forward rate.   In fact,
                                                                                                     21

    where   (3.6),     (3.7a) , and               (3.9)   have been used. Using the definitions of A'

    and A(y) ,    the forward rate e can be rewritten as


              =   t't Et[uy(yt+i-kt+2)tc/P+i]
                          .'                                                                     (3.17)

                                                                     u.1/P÷1

    This expression shows why e has a natural interpretation as the forward

    exchange rate.             It can be expressed as the sum of the expected future spot

    exchange rate,                         and a term that can be interpreted as a risk—premium.

    The form of the risk-premium in (3.17) is analogous to that obtained in other

    models, e.g. by Hodrick and Srivastava (1983) .                        Svensson   (1984a) discusses
-
    some other properties of St and et in a related model.

4. Capital Flows and the Current Account
4.1 Definitions and Accounting Relations
      The domestic country's current account surplus is defined as the change

in its net holdings of foreign assets, that is, as the capital account

deficit.13 Denote this capital account deficit (current account surplus) in

period t, measured in units of the foreign good, by C. The total world

values of foreign assets, V, and domestic assets, V, are


      v   =t       +           +
                                         (B3+B5+A')/Xt',
                                                                           (L.1)

and

      V =     't   +           + qj + tmt/pt = (-Bi+B2(yt)+B4+A(yt)))/X,


both measured in units of foreign goods. Foreign assets consist of shares in

the foreign firm, claims to foreign monetary transfers, and the value of real

balances of foreign money (at the end of the period, that is, including

current transfers). Home assets are the shares in the home firm, including

the commitment to buy and supply investment goods, the claim to domestic money

transfers, and real balances of home money.

       Households in the domestic country have, according to (2.6) and (3.3) , a

net foreign asset position at the end of period t, Ft, given by


                        -
      Ft =    V/2           Vt/2.                                          (4.2)



The first term in (4.2) is due to domestic households' ownership of foreign

assets, and the second is due to foreign households' ownership of domestic

assets. The current account surplus (or capital account deficit) in period t

is therefore


          =
              Ft    =
                            (v—V_i-Vt+Vt...1)/2,                           (4.3)
                                                                                                       23

where             =
                      Z   -
                              Z_1.           C can be written equivalently as savings minus

investment if domestic saving, S, is defined as the change in domestic

weal   th,

             =
       S         (4'/2+Vt/2),                                                                    (4.4a)


and    domestic investment,                  ,   as   the change in    the value of domestic assets,


             =                                                                                   (4.L+b)

Then

             =
                 S,                                                                              (4.4c)


         Similarly, C is the sum of the balance-of—trade surplus and the service

account      surplus.             The trade account surplus, measured in foreign goods, is

defined as


       TAt    = Xt/2pt        -        - kt+l    =
                                                      Xt/2pt   (yt+K(yt))/2.                      (4.5)



The first term shows exports, which equal half of domestic output. The second

term shows imports of goods for consumption, while the third term shows

imports of goods for investment. The service account surplus consists of net

dividends or interest payments arid capital gains on all assets,


       SAt            — Xt/pt + K                    + (-l)        — (wt.1)mt/pt                  (4.6)

                                   *     *       *         *   *
                          + (q3q1q2) + (q5—q4)
                          +                           — ((Mt/pt))t)/2
The first two terms in (4.6)                     are   the net dividends on assets 2 and 3 received
by the domestic country. The third term is the (negative) dividend paid on
                                                                                    24

asset one.     The fourth and fifth terms show net dividend receipts on the

fourth and fifth assets (which represent claims to half the foreign and

domestic monetary transfers) .          The    sixth and seventh terms in (4.6) show

capital gains on foreign equity (q/2) minus foreigners' capital gains on

domestic equity ((q+q)/2) plus capital gains on claims to foreign
transfers (Aq/2) minus foreigners' capital gains on claims to domestic

transfers (q/2) .       Finally,    the last two terms in (4.6) show domestic

capital gains on holdings of foreign money minus foreign capital gains on

holdings of domestic money. Then the domestic current—account surplus (4.3)

                                         =
is the sum of (4.5) and (4.6) ,     C         TA   + SAt.

         The capital—gains terms in (4.6) could equivalently be interpreted as

dividend or interest-payment terms, and supplies of assets would vary along

with, or instead of, asset prices——see the discussion below (3.10) and in

footnote 6.     If capital gains are excluded (arbitrarily) from (4.6) then the

sum of SAt and TAt does not equal the change in the net foreign asset

position, a fact which should make economists particularly cautious in

interpreting reported current-account data. Also notice that the definitions

of   saving    and investment      in    (4.4)      are not national—income—accounting

definitions. The NIA definition of gross domestic savings is the difference

between "income" (x/pt+y+kt+i)/2 and consumption, i.e. (in units of foreign

goods)


     (xt/pt+yt+kt÷i)/2 -   X/pt                kt+i.


The NIA definition of gross domestic investment is kt+i, so savings minus

investment is zero with NIA definitions, which does not equal the change in

the net foreign asset position.14 The current account surplus (or capital
                                                                                             25

account deficit), defined as the change in the net foreign asset position,

equals savings minus investment only if those terms are broadly defined, as in

(4.4)   , and          equals the sum of the trade account and service account only if a] 1

interest payments, dividends, and capital gains are included as in (4.6) .                  The

NIA incomedefinition arbitrarily excludes capital gains.


4.2 Capital Flows in Equilibrium
           The equilibrium net foreign asset position of the domestic country, Ft.

can be written as a functior of foreign output and foreign monetary growth by

using (4.1), the solution for ?"                  in   (3.9),   and the definitions of A(y) and

B1 (y) ,     i=l   ,   . . . ,5:

             =     F
        Ft                                                                                (4.7)



The equilibrium current account surplus is then, from (4.3),


             =                     't-i,i .                                               (4.8)
                   C(y,

           Notice that               is unaffected by current or lagged values of e or , and

does not depend directly on the current capital stock kt. An increase in Ct

leads to increased output and consumption of x at t, but does not affect the

value, measured in foreign goods, of any assets.                         The higher output of

domestic goods raises the dividend payment by domestic firms, and half of this

is paid to foreign households, so the service account goes into deficit. But

the service account deficit is exactly offset by a trade account surplus as

foreign households import additional domestic goods.15 Similarly, a higher

initial capital stock kt raises domestic output without affecting the capital

account.
                                                                                     26

      An increase in current foreign output raises both its consumption and

investment. The increase in consumption of foreign goods lowers the current

marginal utility of wealth measured in foreign goods, X', and so raises the

value of both foreign and domestic assets measured in current foreign goods,

V and V. The effect of increases in both V" and V on the current account

depends upon the sign of F, net foreign assets.         Increases in V' and V raise

the absolute value of net foreign assets, so they cause a current account

surplus if net foreign assets are positive and deficit if net foreign assets

re negive. An inrese in current foreign oupu iso rise ir1vetmer1L
and next period's capital stock. This raises future domestic output.                The

increase in future domestic output lowers its relative price (in terms of

current foreign output).         (3.12) and (4.1) show that this raises the value of

domestic firms and the value of domestic money (and so raises the value of

domestic assets) if and only if the elasticity of the marginal utility of home

goods, r, is smaller than one. Assuming r < 1, this effect causes a current

account deficit because half of the increase in the value of domestic assets

goes to foreign households.           So, if r < 1, an increase in current foreign

output causes a current account deficit unless net foreign assets are

sufficiently positive.

      An increase in foreign monetary growth, $, has no effect on              if


is initially below the critical level           defined in (3.8), in which case the

liquidity constraint is not binding.           In this case a change in w' has no

effect on the current account. But if            is above the critical value then an
                *                *         .
increase   in       reduces ).       and raises the value of both foreign and home

assets, leading to a current account surplus if net foreign assets are

positive and deficit if net foreign assets are negative.            Intuitively, an
                                                                                  27

increase in      raises the capital loss on money obtained by selling current

foreign goods and so reduces their value. This raises asset values measured

in units of current foreign goods.16

     sign FyIFO = —sign(1—r) and               =                               (4.9)

where r is defined below (3.12).


5. Capital Flows, Investment, and Exchange Rates
      This section presents results on the stochastic behavior of the current

account, investment, the terms of trade, and the exchange rate in our model's

equilibrium. We use a second—order Taylor series approximation to calculate

covariances of    endogerious variables       in     the model.      This method of
characterizing the models equilibrium has two advantages over comparative

statics exercises. First, the covariances implied by a model can be directly

compared to covariances      in   empirical        data.   Second,   the method   is


theoretically appealing because the probability distribution describing

changes in exogenous variables is included in the model.                in contrast,

comparative statics exercises examine effects of changes in exogenous

variables assuming that agents in the model place probability zero on such

changes. The approximation we employ for the covariances is discussed in the

Appendix.


5.1 Capital Flows and Investment
      The influence of saving and investment on capital flows and the current

account have been widely discussed recently, see e.g. Obstfeld and Stockman

(1985) and Sachs (1983) .   As discussed above, the national income accounting
                                                                                      28

measures of Sa\'ings and investment do not lead to equality between the change

in the net foreign asset position and the excess of savings over investment,

since capital gains are excluded.          Empirical measures of investment that

include changes in the value of the existing capital stock are not readily

available.    In the following, we examine the correlation between the current

account and physical investment, the latter defined as kt+i —          kt,   rather than

comprehensive investment given by (14.4b) .        The   covariance between capital

flows (the current account surplus) and investment implied by our model is


     coy (Ct,k+i-kt) = cov(F                                 -K                    (5.1)
                                    Yt't -F ti ''-i' K

                      = 2cov   (F          K



where we make use of the serial independence of y and w.

        The covariance between capital flows and investment can be rewritten,

using the second-order Taylors approximation in the Appendix, as


                                                                                   (5.2)
     COV(Ctgkt+lkt)        2FyKya +     2F,*Kay*
where        is the variance of foreign output and                is the covariance of

foreign output and foreign monetary growth.

        First consider the case when F=O, i.e. starting from a zero net foreign

asset position.17 Then (4.9) and (5.2) imply


     sign cov(Ct,kt+j—kt) = —sign (l—r) .                                           (5.3)


If the net foreign asset position is close to zero, increases in investment

are associated with current account deficits if and only if the elasticity of

the marginal utility of consumption of home goods is less than one.                  The

condition that rx <    1   prevents the increase in future domestic output from
                                                                                     29

reducinq its value sufficiently to lower the current value of domestic firms.

With r < 1, the increased in'.'estment from higher foreign output raises the

value of domestic assets.       Part of this increase goes to foreign households,

creating a current account deficit.         Also notice the direct effect of the

variance of foreign output on the covariance: in the neighborhood of zero net

foreign assets, an increase in the variance of foreign output raises the

absolute value of the covariance between capital flows and investment.18

      If F < 0 then the first term in (5.2) is still negative and F* <         0,    so

the second term has the opposite sign of the covariance between foreign output

and money growth.     If F > 0 and r <       1   then the first term in (5.2)        is


ambiguous in sign and       >   0, so the second term has the sign of               The

ambiguity in the first term, if net foreign assets are positive, reflects two

opposing effects of an increase in foreign output.          First, higher foreign

output increases investment and the value of domestic assets if     r   < 1.    This

tends to create a current account deficit.          Second, higher foreign output

lowers its value, and so raises the value of assets measured in terms of

current foreign output. This "interest rate effect" raises asset values and

therefore raises the absolute value of net foreign assets.          If F > 0 this

tends to create a current account surplus. These two opposing effects make

ambiguous the sign of the first term in (5.2) if F > 0 and r < 1.       The second

term has the sign of the covariance between foreign output and money growth

because an increase in foreign money growth lowers the value of current

foreign output, X".     If ay* >    0   then the value of foreign output is lower

particularly when foreign output is high, and this creates a positive relation

between investment and the value of domestic assets measured in foreign goods,

which implies a positive correlation between investment and the current

account surplus.
5.2 Capital Flows and National Outputs
       The covariance implied by the modei between the domestic current account

surplus and foreign output is


      cov(Ct,yt) = cov(F                    Yt-i't-i '   Y)                             (5.4)




                         F>,a
                                +
                                    F*ay*
If the elasticity of the marginal utility of domestic output, r, is less than

one, then F, is negative unless net foreign assets of the home country are

sufficiently positive. Then, if foreign output and foreign monetary growth

are uncorrelated, (5.4)         is   negative.    Increases in foreign output would then

be associated with       current     account deficits.

       The covariance between capital flows and domestic output is


      coy   (Ct,xt)     coy (F (ytWt) -F t-i          ,x (K t-i t))                     (5.5)



                      — FyXkKyay2 +     x   Fyoye+Fw*ow*e

If   domestic productivity shocks are uncorrelated with foreign productivity

shocks and foreign monetary growth, then the second therm in (5.5)                 is   zero.

The first term has the opposite sign of F>, so, e.g.                  if r <   1   then the

covar lance is positive unless F is sufficiently positive (see footnote 17).

In this case, increases in domestic output would be associated with current

account surpluses. This positive relation between C" and x is diluted, and

possibly reversed, if Gy6 > 0,               i.e. if foreign and domestic productivity

shocks are correlated.
                                                                                            3'
5.3    Capital Flows and the Terms of Trade
       The covariance between capital flows and the relative price of foreign

goods is


      cov(C,pt) =       cov[F(y,w)                                                       (5.6)

                    -


                   : F[uu         (1-Kr)
                                             +
                                                 UyUxxXkKyay

                    -
                        UyUxUxxXay]/u2 - FX[uu (1-Kr)
                   +
                        uyuxxxkKyay* - uyuxxxea*e]/XXu.

Suppose that net foreign assets are zero, so the valuation effect in the last
three terms vanishes, and that foreign and domestic productivity shocks are

uncorrelated, so that the third term vanishes.                        Then the sign of the

covariance has the opposite sign of                        since the first two terms are

negative. So, by (4.9), the covariance has the sign of (l—r) .                    Intuitively,
increases in y lower the relative price of foreign output at the same time
they increase domestic investment. The greater investment raises the value of

domestic assets and so creates a current account deficit if and only if

   < 1,    so increases in the terms of trade are positively correlated with

current account deficits (and investment)                  in this case.       If foreign and

domestic productivity shocks are positively correlated then this relation is

diluted (or reversed) because increases in domestic output reduce (or reverse)

the effect on the terms of trade.                If net foreign assets are not zero, then

disturbances to productivity and to foreign money growth affect the value of

existing net foreign assets measured in units of foreign output.
                                                                                    32

5.4 Capital Flows and the Exchange Rate
        The exchange rate is a nonstationary random variable in our model,

because money suppl es are nonstationary, so we cannot calculate the

covariance of the level of the exchange rate with other variables. The first—

difference of the logarithm of the exchange rate is, however, stationary.19

The covariance impl ied by the model between capital flows and the rate of

change of the exchange rate is


        cov(Cf,S÷—S_l)                                                           (5.7)

           - (2X+l/w*)                +


where     Wx =   dlnux/dx, WY = d1nu/dy         and        indicates a logarithm, e.g.

A), =   dmA/dy.      This complicated expression can be simplified considerably if

both domestic and foreign monetary growth rates are nonstochastic, so that

(5.7)    becomes

                 A A
        cov(C,S—Sti)                                                             (5.8)

           : 2[W(l_K)      -
                               "A "
                                 +        -           A
                                               + (Wx-;kx)XkKy/2JFYC;

               - 2
                     (W-) XFyoy6.

In order to interpret this expression, consider first the case in which

domestic and foreign productivity shocks are uncorrelated, Cye = O•
                                                                                             33

      Suppose that the elasticity of the marginal utility of domestic goods is
                                        A                A
unity, r =   1.   Then i3.l2) implies A>, =    0,   so       =   0.   Further, suppose that

the analogously defined elasticity of marginal utility of foreign goods is
                                                                                        20
less than or equal to unity, r>,       1.     Then we have W>,(l_K>,) —            0.        In


this case the covariance in (5.8) takes the sign of F>, which equals the sign

of F because r =    1   (see footnote 17) .   So    if net foreign assets are positive

then currency depreciation is associated with current account surpluses, while

the opposite result        is obtained if net foreign assets are negative.

Intuitively, this result is entirely due to the revaluations of assets that

accompany changes in foreign output.

      Next, suppose that net foreign assets are zero so that this revaluation

effect is absent, but assume that the elasticity of the marginal utility of

each good is less than one. Then the term in brackets in (5.8) would be

positive except for the term involving A>, which is arbitrarily small if
  -
      r   is small.2' In that case the covariarice is negative, so currency

depreciation is associated with current account deficits. However, if r is
                               A
small enough, the term in A>, dominates and the covariance is positive, so

currency depreciation is associated with current account surpluses.

      The intuition behind these results is as follows. There are no interest

rate effects on the current account operating through the value of existing

assets because net foreign assets are zero.                  Increases in foreign output

reduce its relative price with an elasticity less than unity when the

elasticity of marginal utility of foreign goods is less than one.                    If the

liquidity constraints are binding for both monies, then P', the foreign—

currency price of foreign goods, falls with an elasticity equal to one to

maintain equality of money demand and money supply.                   The domestic-currency
                                                                                   34

price   of domestic goods, P, is unaffected because of domestic money market

equilibrium.    If the exchange rate were to remain unchanged, then the relative

price of foreign goods would fall by the same percentage as the rise in

foreign output.     In order to achieve the smaller, equilibrium fall in the

relative price of foreign goods, domestic currency must depreciate, i.e. the

exchange rate must rise. Because the elasticity of the marginal utility of

domestic goods less than one, the increased investment brought about by higher

foreign output creates a current account deficit for the domestic country,

which accompanies the currency depreciation. The increase in investment and

future domestic output lowers the expected rate of domestic inflation.        If the

liquidity constraint     is not binding in the domestic country then this

reduction in the cost of holding domestic money raises its demand, which

lowers the domestic currency price of domestic goods. This tendency toward
                                                          A
currency   appreciaton is reflected in the term involving A>. in (5.8)   .   If   this

term is sufficiently large then the covariance is positive, so currency

depreciation is associated with current account surpluses. This effect is

stronger the larger the increase in investment and the larger the interest

elasticity of the demand for money.      If the liquidity constraint is binding

for domestic money but not for foreign money then P remains unchanged and P'

falls with an elasticity less than unity, because r < 1.      But because some of

the increased foreign output is used for investment rather than consumption,

the fall in the relative price of foreign goods is smaller than the fall in

P; so domestic currency must depreciate, and this depreciation is accompanied

by a current account deficit.      If the liquidity constraints are not binding

for either money then domestic currency may either appreciate or depreciate,

again because the expected increase in future domestic output lowers expected
                                                                              35

domestic inflation and raises the demand for money, which creates a tendency

for appreciation.      The tendency for appreciation with a current account

deficit is larger the smaller the elasticity of marginal utility of domestic

goods, because a smaller elasticity implies a larger increase in the value of

future domestic output (given the increase in the physical volume of its

output). Currency depreciation is more likely to be accompanied by a current

account surplus the larger the elasticity of marginal utility of domestic

goods, the more interest elastic the demand for investment, and the larger

interest elastic the demand for domestic money.        If domestic arid foreign

productivity shocks are positively correlated, and if the elasticities of the

marginal utilities of both goods are less than one, then the last term in

(5.8)     is positive, which creates an additional tendency for currency

depreciation to be associated with current account surpluses.       This occurs

because increases in domestic output have no direct effect on capital flows,

but lead to currency appreciation through the increased demand for domestic

money.     If these increases tend to occur simultaneously with increases in

foreign output, which (through investment) cause domestic current account

deficits, then currency appreciation and current account deficits would tend

to occur together.


6. Conclusions
         International capital flows can be thought of as arising from two types

of exogenous changes:     (1) those that alter the international distribution of

a fixed level of world wealth and (2) those that alter world wealth and affect

its relative composition in foreign and domestic assets.       Previous work on

international capital flows has, as far as we know, completely disregarded

this second source of international capital flows. We have focused on this
                                                                            36

source, and examined the relations between capital flows, investment, output,

the exchange rate, the terms of trade, and other asset prices. We explicitly

calculate covariances of endogenous variables as functions, implied by the

theory, of parameters of tastes, technology, and the stochastic processes of

the exogenous variables. The covariances depend on such parameters as the

degree of intertemporal substitution in consumption, the sign and magnitude of

net foreign assets, the marginal product of capital, and the variances and

covariances across countries of shocks to productivity and rates of monetary

growth.

      Rather than repeating the results discussed above, we mention here some

of the limitations of our analysis and its possible extensions. Our model is

(we think) the first international general equilibrium monetary asset—pricing

model with endogenous investment and production, and our analysis the first to

examine rigorously—derived endogenous capital flows in an intertemporal asset-

pricing framework. The most severe limitation of our model is one of the most

difficult to deal with: the perfectly pooled equilibrium. This has prevented

us from incorporating into the model capital flows caused by international

redistributions of a fixed level of world wealth.      The greatest hope for

progress in this area probably lies in the application of aggregation results

for limited classes of utility functions in which the allocation of resources

is invariant to the distribution of wealth.       Other limitations of our

analysis, which are not as difficult to relax, include our concentration on

serially uncorrelated disturbances. We have also ignored information about

changes in the prospective rate of return to investment, which would generate

an additional source of disturbances to investment and international capital

flows. The cash-in-advance setup we have used is easy to employ and gives
                                                                              37

intuitively   plausible results, but it relies on a very rigid      transactions
structure (e.g. a fixed payments period) .   Also, we have assumed an asymmetry
in production, with only foreign goods used as capital in the domestic

country.

      Despite these   I imitations, we believe the model has already proven

itself useful in analyzing covariation in investment, capital flows, and

exchange rates, and we believe there are other interesting extensions for

which the model will be useful. First, the model should shed new light on the

relative variability of exchange rates and price levels.        Preliminary work

indicates that variable velocity and investment both promote increases in the

variability of exchange rates. Second, the model could be used to examine

international repercussions of fiscal and monetary policies.       Finally, the

model should be able to provide new insights into the relations between

changes in exchange rates, capital flows, and interest rates.

1.   Alternatively, k' can change exogeneously over time with only minor

     alterations in the model.

2.   Note that if not all capital depreciates, there is joint output in the

     home country of home goods and foreign goods (old capital) .         This
     introduces serial correlation in world output of foreign goods, which

     complicates the model.

3.   This assumption is made by Svensson (l984a,b) .   In Stockman (1980), in
     contrast, transfers are made at the beginning of the period, just prior

     to goods market trade, so transfers can be used to finance current

     purchases.

4.   These timing assumptions make it possible to characterize analytically

     an equilibrium with a variable, endogenous velocity of money as in

     Svensson (1984a,b) .   In particular, a positive nominal interest rate is

     consistent with variable velocity of monies.    In contrast, Lucas (1982)

     assumed that information becomes available at points 2 and J in Figure

     2.1 (along with transfer payments) rather than at points 1 and 3. With

     information available at points 2 and L4, asset trades occur after all

     information about the subsequent goods—market has been received, and

     positive nominal interest rates then imply a fixed velocity of money.

     When asset prices are evaluated before all information (regarding the

     subsequent goods-market) is available, as in our model, positive nominal

     interest rates are consistent with a variable velocity of money.

     Stockman (1980) assumed that transfer payments occur at points 1 and 3

     in Figure 2.1 (along with information) rather than at points 2 and 4.

     This results in endogenous, variable velocity of money but makes

     intractable a complete analytical characterization of the equilibrium.
                                                                                       39

 5.   This    scenario means that firms do not hold money, which simpi ifies the

      model.

 6.   With this assumption, we can solve for equilibrium asset prices, as in

      (2.12) and (2.13).        Alternatively, we could define units of assets so

      that their prices are fixed (e.g. at one), and solve for equi 1 ibrium

      asset-quantities. The point is        that   the model determines total asset

      values: see    the   discussion on page 18, and part 14   of the Appendix.

 7.   There is no conflict in equilibrium between the interests of owners of

      a1 and owners of a2       because all households own the same proportions of

      both assets.     In a more general model in which the owners of a1 and a2

      were different, a conflict of interests might arise similar to the usual

      conflicts between interests of       stockholders and bondholders     (see, e.g.

      Jensen and Mecki ing, 1976)

 8.   We ignore bubble—solutions.

 9.   Note that if there is no uncertainty and the economy is in a steady-

      state    equilibrium, (2.15) becomes xk(k) =     (U/lJ)   (w/32) where       is the

      rate of domestic inflation plus one, so the capital stock varies

      inversely with inflation across steady—states, as in Stockman (1981)

10.   The choice of k+i cannot be conditioned on 5+l (the exogenous vector

      describing    the state of the economy) because capital in place for
      production   at r+l must be purchased and installed at r.

11.   The independence of s over time means both that the probability

      distribution    of the future productivity shock e' is fixed over        time and

      that    the distribution of future foreign and domestic money growth is
      fixed over time--variations         in the latter would affect investment

      through the channel      discussed in Stockman (1981).
                                                                                                             40

12.   Other assets may also be traded at goods-markets.                                            See Svensson

      (1984a,b)

13.   There are no central bank transactions in foreign exchange markets in

      this model.

14.   The number zero is a result of our (arbitrary) assumption about how

      asset returns are split between dividends and capital gains (which are

      excluded from the NIA measures).                               Generally, with NiA definitions,

      savings minus investment depends on this split, though the change in net

15.   If the utility function were not separable in consumption of domestic

      and foreign goods, then increased consumption of domestic goods would

      alter the value of assets measured in foreign goods and could affect the

      current account.                     Also,     f domestic productivity shocks were serially

      correlated then a productivity shock would affect expected future

      domestic output and, therefore, the value of domestic firms. This would

      alter the current account.

16.   If the capital account is measured in units of domestic goods then it is
                                                                      *

2. Derivation of Equilibrium Asset Prices

       Asset prices, for any assets, can be obtained from (3.3k,l) , as                           in

(2.12) and (2.13). The procedure follows Lucas (1978). Svensson (1983, 1984)

discusses asset—pricing in more detail in related models. We will need to use

the explicit solutions for asset prices in the subsequent discussion of

savings, investment, capital flows, and the exchange rate.

       From (3.3k) and (3.3b) we get


                =
                     -Et   =+i              uy(y-K(y))K(y) = -B1,                              (A.3)


where B1 > 0 is constant. This can be rewritten as


      q1 (x,y,) = —B1/X(x,y,c)              .                                                 (A.4)

But q =        q/p   and X = Xp, so (3.lla) follows. From (3.31) we have

                =
                    Et L;=+1 13T-t                                                            (A.5)


and it follows from (3.3m) ,              (3.6) and (3.9) that
                                                                                                                               43

In    (A.7b) we have used (3.7a) which implies that B3                                   is   constant.        In   (A.7c,d)

we use that ).         m
                      TT    = A(y
                                  T   )/         and          XTT
                                                                n =         A'/'.       So B4 and B5 are constant.

The asset prices (3.1)) follow directly from (A.6)                                  ,    (3.7a)   ,   and the definition
 *
q1 =   q/P.
3. The signs of A (y) and B2 (y)
         From (3.5a) and (3.6) it follows that


       A(y) =              , (A(y)/)dF(s')                                                                             (A.8)

                 +
                            tu(x(K(y) e'))x(K(y) ,e')dF
                                                  ,                                (s)

Hence,

                                                                             and                                     (A.9a)
       A>,



       sign A), =      sign (l—r)   ,                                                                                (A.9b)
                                                                                    44

assuming that sign(1—r) is independent of x.

       From (A.7a) and (3.6) we have



      B2(y) =j3fX(x(K(y),e'),y',w)x(K(y),e)dF(s')+2                          (A.1O)


               =

              +    5 (A(y)/w')dF(s')             + B2,


where B2 is a constant. This implies


      B2 =     3J<         (1—r) xk (K (y) ,   ') dF (s ')                  (A. 1 la)


and

      sign B2 = sign(1—r)       .
                                                                            (A.llb)

4.    Quantities and Prices of Assets
       Consider         and t as exogenous stochastic processes.     Consider some

Asset j, a claim to            Note that this need not be interpreted as a claim to

foreign output (as in the paper) .         The price of j is


          =                                                                 (A.12a)


The corresponding ex—post return is


      Rt+i =       (q+1+y+1—q)/q+1.                                         (A.12b)


The supply at of this claim is fixed at unity,


      at = 1.                                                               (A.12c)



       Now consider an alternative asset, Asset k, which pays dividends

has the price t and pays the ex—post return Rt. The variables fulfill, of

course,
                                                                                                    45

           =
               t't+i (t+rYt+i)J/Xt                                                        (A.13a)
and

               =
                                                                                          (A.13b)

Now specify that Asset k has the same return as Asset j, and a constant price,

that is,



                   Rt                                                                    (A.l3c)

and

                   1.
                                                                                         (A.13d)


What is the corresponding dividend                         It follows directly from (A,13b) and

(A.13d) that Rt+i =                        and hence by (A.13c) we have


      t+i          Rt.                                                                    (A.14)


      Consider next an equilibrium where t is the revenue of a firm, and

ownership of the firm is equivalent to owning the constant quantity (a.                        1)


of Asset j, with the firm paying all its revenue as dividends on Asset j.

      Consider now an alternative equilibrium, where ownership of the firm is

equivalent to owning a variable quantity                      of Asset k.    At the beginning of

period t, the outstanding quantity of Asset k is                            The firm distributes
                         =
dividends                    tRt.      Any excess of dividends over revenues is covered by

further issue of Asset k, according to the budget constraint


                             =
                                 tRt   —
                                                                                          (A.15)

                                                                     =
It fol lows from (A.15) ,              (A.13d) and (A.13b) that           _1 implies
               =
                                                                                          (A.16)

and the value of the firm is still
                                                                                                    46

          We   conclude that the split between changes in quantity and capital gains

for assets is arbitrary.                Equilibria wi th assets with constant quant i ty and

var i able prices are equivalent to equilibria with appropr lately defined assets

with variable quantity and no capital gains.


5. Approximating Covariances
          Let   the vector X be stochastic and let f(X) and g(X) be two real—valued

functions. Then Cov[f(X) , g(X)J is approximated by the formidable expression


      ttLAA)          A-LA) Jg - 1LLA—A) AtA) 'gA—tA)J/2                                       (. 1/)



                                     + gE[(X-EX) (X—EX) xx()J/2

                                     + E[(XEX)                     (XEX)


where           and     denote the gradient and Hessian of f (X) (evaluated at EX)

respectively, etc., where all non-primed vectors are column vectors, and where

a prime denotes transpose. That is, the covariance depends on the gradients

and Hessians of f(X) and g(X) and the second, third and fourth moments of the

probability distribution for X. Disregarding third— and fourth—order moments

leaves the first term, which can be written fcig with                               =   E[(XEX)   (X


EX) '].        Letting X =   (y,)   ,    f (X)   =   F   (y,) and g(X) = K(y) we get (5.2) .      See

Svensson (1984b) for further use of this approximation.
