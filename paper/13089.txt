                                               ABSTRACT

This paper addresses how creditor protection affects the volatility of stock market prices. Credit protection
reduces the probability of oscillations between binding and non-binding states of the credit constraint;
thereby lowering the rate of return variance. We test this prediction of a Tobin's q model, by using
cross-country panel regression on stock price volatility in 40 countries over the period from 1984 to
2004. Estimated probabilities of a liquidity crisis are used as a proxy for the probability that credit
constraints are binding. We find support for the hypothesis that institutions that help reduce the probability
of oscillations between binding and non-binding states of the credit constraint also reduce asset price
volatility.

1    Introduction

Recent literature on law and finance has emphasized the role of strong institutions, such as credi-

tor protection, in fostering the development of financial markets. Creditor rights regulation helps

mitigating the problems of asymmetry information and moral hazard between creditors and bor-

rowers. Hence, it is shown to affect credit cycle and credit market breadth. For example, La

Porta et al. (1997) find that countries with poor creditor protection have smaller debt markets.

Their findings are confirmed in Levine (2004) and Djankov et al. (2006), with more sophisticated

econometric methods and boarder country coverage. Burger and Warnock (2006) further find that

countries with strong creditor rights have more developed local bond markets, and rely less on

foreign-currency bonds. Moreover, Galindo and Micco (2005) report that strong creditor rights can

reduce the volatility of credit market.

    Beside the impact on macro economy, creditor protection also affect firm’s investment and

operation. It lowers firm’s borrowing cost and increases firm’s value (e.g. La Porta et al. (2000),

and Bae and Goyal (2003)). Furthermore, it reduce cash-flow risk, operating income variability,

and operating leverage (e.g. Claessens et al. (2001)).

    So far, these studies focus on the credit market and very little on the stock market. In this

paper, we try to fill a gap by looking at how creditor rights affect the stock return volatility

for market aggregates.1 We argue that creditor protection that may relax credit constraints is

also associated with equity price volatility, and the institutional weakness in the credit market

exacerbates the volatility. We expect that better creditor protection could reduce market volatility.

The main intuition is as follows. Firms need to provide collaterals to creditors and thus face

credit constraints. When the credit constraint oscillates between binding and non-binding, firms’
   1
     Some studies have examined how corporate control affects the dispersion of stock prices with a market. For
example, Morck et al. (2000) look at the stock price co-movement within a country. They find that co-movement
is more pronounced in poor economies than in rich economies, which they contribute to cross-country differences in
property rights. Our work is not concerned with the idiosyncratic dispersion of stock prices, but rather with the
instability in the aggregate.

investment, operation and capital return will fluctuate as well. But the probability of this oscillation

can be reduced with better creditor protection. Consequently, firm value (first moment) will rise,

and the volatility (second moment) of firm value will decline.

    We illustrate this intuition with a Tobin’s q investment model. We start with the free market

case, and derive the closed-form solution of Tobin’s q (our theoretical counterpart of stock price)

and its volatility. We then introduce the credit constraint, which depends on the degree of creditor

protection and firm’s productivity. We show that given a distribution of productivity shocks, weak

creditor protection causes more variation of Tobin’s q, due to the oscillation between credit binding

and nonbinding.

    We then put the prediction into empirical testing. We look at aggregated stock return volatility

in 41 countries over the years 1984-2004. We find a empirical regularity that better creditor

protection is associated with lower stock price volatility. We then use a two-stage cross-country

analysis to further examine this regularity. In the first stage, we look at how creditor protection

affects the probability of liquidity crises, defined as a large rise of real interest rate, which serves as

our proxy for the probability of credit binding. We find that better creditor protection reduces the

probability of crises. In the second stage, we examine whether the predicted probability of crises

has an expected effect on the stock market volatility. And we find that higher probability of crises

is indeed connected with larger stock return volatility.

    The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the theory. Section 3

describes the data, empirical regularity, empirical approach and results. Section 4 summarizes the

conclusions.



2    Theory

Here we propose a model that demonstrates potential links between creditor rights and stock price

volatility. It is based on the Tobin’s q investment model.



                                                    3
2.1      Tobin’s q Model

Consider a small open economy, producing a single aggregate tradable good. The production

function for that good, Y , is Cobb-Douglas:2


                                                 Yt = At Kt1−ρ ,                                      (1)


where At , 1 − ρ, and Kt denote the productivity level, the distributive share of capital, and the

capital stock, respectively. We assume that productivity levels follow a first-order autoregressive

stochastic process:

                                           ln(At+1 ) = γ ln(At ) + εt+1                               (2)


where εt+1 follows a uniform distribution over the region [−1, 1]. Using small letters to denote logs

of cap letters, we get

                                               at+1 = γat + εt+1 .                                    (3)


      Firms maximize the expected value of the discounted sum of profits subject to the available

production technology and to a cost-of-adjustment investment technology. According to the latter,

gross investment (Zt ) is specified as

                                                              
                                                        1 1 It
                                            Zt = It 1 +          ,                                    (4)
                                                        2 v Kt

                                1
where It = Kt+1 − Kt , and      v   denote net capital formation (assuming zero depreciation) and a cost-

of-adjustment coefficient, respectively. In the presence of costs of adjustment, gross investment

typically exceeds net capital formation, because of the additional costs of the reorganization and

retraining associated with the installation of new capital equipment.
  2
      The model is based on Krugman (1998) and Frenkel and Razin (1996, Chapter 7).

   Denote r as the world interest rate, a representative firm will maximize the following Lagrangian:

                                                                           
                                   1     
                                               1−ρ
                   L = E Σ∞
                          t=0              At Kt − Zt + qt (Kt + It − Kt+1 ) ,                   (5)
                                (1 + r)t

where the Lagrangian qt could be interpreted as Tobin’s q.

   Maximizing the Lagrangian gives two first order conditions. The first one is with respect to It :


                                                1 It
                                           1+        = qt .                                      (6)
                                                v Kt


   Denoting ln (Kt ) as kt and linearizing ln (υ (qt − 1) + 1) gives


                                       kt+1 = kt + v (qt − 1) .                                  (7)


   The second first-order condition with respect to Kt+1 is:

                                                                 2              !
                              1                   11       It+1
                        qt =         Et [Rt+1 ] −                      + Et [qt+1 ] ,            (8)
                             1+r                  2v       Kt+1


where Rt+1 is the capital rental rate. The optimal-investment rule in equation (8) implies that the

cost of investing an additional unit of capital in the current period must be equal to the expected

present value of the next period’s marginal productivity of capital, plus the next period’s induced

fall in the adjustment cost of investment resulting from the enlarged stock of capital, plus the

continuation value in the capital remaining for the entire future.

   Note that from equation (1):


                                                          −ρ
                                     Rt+1 = (1 − ρ) At+1 Kt+1 .                                  (9)




                                                  5
   Linearizing ln (Rt+1 ), and denoting π ≡ 1 + ln (1 − ρ), yields:


                                       Rt+1 = π − ρkt+1 + at+1 .                           (10)


   According to equation (6),
                                                     2
                                       1       It+1
                                                           = v (qt+1 − 1)2                 (11)
                                       v       Kt+1

Hence, equation (8) becomes

                                                                      
                          1                  1            2
                    qt =     Et (1 + Rt+1 ) − v (qt+1 − 1) + (qt+1 − 1) ,                  (12)
                         1+r                 2

   At the deterministic steady state, It = 0, and qt = 1. Therefore, around the steady state,

the term (qt+1 − 1)2 is in an order of magnitude smaller than (qt+1 − 1). According to the log

linearization approximation, we can then drop the square term from equation (12) and obtain:


                                 (1 + r)qt = Et [Rt+1 ] + Et [qt+1 ] .                     (13)


2.1.1   Free Market Valuation of q

Combining equations (7), (10) and (13), we get:


                                       (π + ρv − ρkt + γat + Et qt+1 )
                                qt =                                   .                   (14)
                                                 1 + r + ρv


   We then solve qt by a “guess”:


                                           qt = B0 + B1 at + B2 kt .                       (15)




                                                           6
       From equations (7) and (15), we get


                                Et qt+1 = B0 + B1 (γat ) + B2 (kt + v (qt − 1)) .                                   (16)


       Substituting equations (15) and (16) into equation (14), we solve B0 , B1 , B2 by comparing

coefficients for at and kt :3

                                                  B0 =    −r−ρv+vB2
                                                              γ                                                     (17)
                                                B1 =    1+r+ρv−vB2 −γ
                                                             √
                                                     r+ρv−       (r+ρv)2 +4ρv
                                             B2 =                 2v          .

2.2      Creditor Protection and Credit-Constrained Investment

We now analyze a Tobin’s q mechanism that evolves around credit constraints.4

       Assume that the firm has to borrow from the creditor a durable input Wt , where Wt ∈ [0, 1].

At the end of the period t, the firm needs to return Wt . For simplicity, assume that the interest

rate paid on the durable input is zero. Then the firm will borrow up to 1. However, there are some

chances that the firm is not willing, or able, to return Wt , and the creditor has to go to a costly

court procedure to claim back the durable good Wt . Therefore, the creditor imposes an ex ante

constraint on how much the firm can borrow. More specifically,


                                                 Wt ≤ min[ωAt , 1].                                                 (18)


       The borrowed input is constrained by the firm’s productivity level At : as At decreases, the firm

will have to borrow less. Finally, higher ω is associated with better creditor protection.5
   3
     Note that the jumping variable qt is negatively related to the state variable kt .
   4
     See Bernanke and Gertler (1989), Hart and Moore (1994), Kiyotaki and Moore (1997), and Mendoza (2006).
   5
     In the literature on credit constraint and financial accelerator, the constraint tends to be based on a firm’s market
value qt kt . However, if both qt and kt are endogenous as in Mendoza (2006), then no tractable solution is available.
By using At rather than qt , we are able to provide tractable closed-form solutions.




                                                             7
   Assume that production function is:


                                          Yt = At Wt Kt1−ρ .                                      (19)


Therefore, if Wt = ωAt , then Y = At ωAt Kt1−ρ . However, if Wt = 1 , Y = At Kt1−ρ .

   According to equation (3), at+1 lies uniformly within [γat − 1, γat + 1], then the probability of

a binding constraint is:

                                                                         
                                                     − ln ω − (γat − 1)
                               Pr (Wt+1 < 1) =                                ,
                                                             2

with the assumption that γat − 1 < − ln ω < γat + 1.

   A representative firm will maximize the following Lagrangian:

                                                                              

                                                  1−ρ
                  L = E Σ∞
                         t=0               At Wt Kt − Zt + qt (Kt + It − Kt+1 ) .                 (20)
                                (1 + r)t

where the Lagrangian multiplier, qt , is interpreted again as Tobin’s q.

   Maximizing this Lagrangian will again gives us equations (7) and (8), although now the form

for Et [Rt+1 ] is different. At time t, the firm needs to take into account whether the constraint will

be binding or not at time t + 1. Equation (10) therefore becomes

                 0 
              Et Rt+1 = Et [π − ρkt+1 + at+1 + ln (Wt+1 )]                                        (21)

tion reduces the price volatility. The intuition is that Rt+1 fluctuates when the credit constraint

oscillates between binding and non-binding (see equation (21)). As ω goes down, the difference

in output in the state where Wt+1 = 1 and the state where Wt+1 = ωAt+1 becomes larger, thus

output fluctuates more and as a result Rt+1 becomes more volatile. Note that as ω increases, B00

increases, so Tobin qt0 increases rather than decreases.

   Earlier, we assume that γat − 1 < − ln ω < γat + 1, which allows the constraint to shift between

binding and non-binding. Now suppose that the constraint is always binding, i.e., γat + 1 < − ln ω,

then equation (21) becomes

And equation (22) becomes

Hence, when the credit constraint always binds, better creditor protection (i.e., higher ω) will

increase the stock price, but may not have impact on the price volatility.



3        Empirical Analysis

In this section we test whether credit constraints and creditor protection indeed affect stock market

volatility in the way predicted by the model. We first discuss the data, empirical regularities, the

empirical approach, and then present the results.


3.1        Data

The data used in this project comes from the combination of sources as described in the Appendix.

        Our creditor protection index comes from La Porta, et al. (1998).7 The creditor rights index

ranges from 0 to 4 and is formed by adding one when the country imposes restrictions, such as

creditor consent or minimum dividends to file for reorganization; when secured creditors are able to

gain possession of their security once the reorganization petition has been approved (no automatic

stay); when secured creditors are ranked first in the distribution of the proceeds that result from the

disposition of the assets of a bankrupt firm; and when the debtor does not retain the administration

of its property pending the resolution of the reorganization. Therefore, higher creditor rights index

is associated with better protection for creditors. Figure 1 shows the countries in our sample that

fall into different categories of the creditor rights index.

      The data for stock market indexes come from Global Financial Data. We have monthly data

(end of month closes, as calculated by central banks, national statistical agencies, or stock exchanges

themselves). The country coverage includes emerging economies as well as developed economies for

the years 1984-2004.8 We converted all stock market indexes in U.S. dollar terms by multiplying

them by the end of month exchange rates and scaled them down by the U.S. CPI index at the end

of the month.

      To measure the stock return volatility (σ), we use the Officer’s method (Officer (1973)). The

Officer method estimates the stock return standard deviation for month 1 to month 12; next

estimate the standard deviation from month 2 to month 13; and then repeat the procedure, rolling

the sample forward continuously. A potential problem with Officer’s approach is that the use of

overlapping observations will create a correlation between standard deviations at different points

in time. An alternative is to use non–overlapping observations. That is, to compute the standard

deviation using, say, months 1 through 12, 13 through 24, and so forth. The problem is that this

procedure results in relatively few data points. We tried both methods and obtain similar results.


3.2      Empirical Regularity

Figure 2 demonstrates the link between credit protection and stock return variability. We can see

that better creditor protection is associated with lower stock price volatility. This relationship is

confirmed statistically: the linear regression of the log of stock return volatility (σ) on creditor

rights index (CR), OECD dummy and the interaction of the two yields the following result


                 Log(σ) = 2.26 − 0.47 ∗ OECD − 0.11 ∗ CR + 0.060 ∗ OECD ∗ CR + ε,


where ε is a robust standard error. All coefficients are statistically significant at one percent

confidence level, the total effect of CR for OECD countries is significantly negative at four percent

      The panel is unbalanced.




                                                  13
confidence level, and adjusted R2 is equal to 0.11. The magnitude of the effect of creditor rights

on stock market volatility is non–negligible, although not very large — an increase in creditor

protection from 0 to 4 for a non-OECD country would lower stock market volatility by one standard

deviation, while for an OECD country, by about a half of the standard deviation.

      We obtain the data on interest rates from IMF International Financial Statistics. In most cases

we use money market rate. When money market rate is not available, we use the discount rate. We

calculate real interest rate by subtracting the inflation rate from the nominal interest rate. We then

calculated annual percentage changes in these real interest rates to identify financial crisis episodes

as described in the previous section. Table 1 lists the financial crisis episodes that we identified.


3.3      Empirical Approach

In our theoretical model, the credit constraint mechanism works through a random situation,

where the constraint moves between binding and non-binding. That is, the mechanism is based on

a probability that the credit constraint is binding. In the empirical model, we use the probability

of liquidity crises to proxy for the probability of binding. Hence, our empirical measure of the

liquidity crisis is directly related to the theoretical counterpart of the credit constraint.

      In recent literature, financial crises are triggered not only by fundamental shocks, but also

by the degree to which market expectations about these fundamentals are coordinated. In the

absence of common knowledge, an individual market participant receives only an independent and

noisy signal about the fundamentals but also must have some uncertainty about the other market

participants’ expectations. Morris and Shin (2000) show how the market participants’ knowledge

about the statistical distributions of the signals and the market fundamentals (but not the actual

realization of the fundamental and its idiosyncratic signals) helps to coordinate the behavior of

market participants. The coordination of expectations induces a unique equilibrium in such a set

up, in which there exists a unique threshold level of the fundamental.9

      In a limiting case when the signal’s residual approaches zero.

   This recent theory of financial crises can guide us as to how to design our empirical approach.

Financial crises are cast in terms of self-fulfilling expectation games. Self-fulfilling expectations

games played by market participants have elements of a “beauty contest” (Allen, Morris and Shin,

2003). Market participants must care not just about acting in the way that conforms with current

fundamentals, but also about acting similarly to the way other do. Institutional features determine

the stochastic distribution of the fundamentals and the effect of the market fundamentals on the

performance of institutions. Thus, for example, creditor protection exerts not only a direct effect

on stock return volatility, but it could also have an indirect effect on the volatility, through its

impact on the probability of financial crises.

   We define financial crisis as an event of a big increase in the real interest rate of over 5 percentage

points in one year, which corresponds to highest 10% of annual changes in real interest rate in our

sample. We also define an alternative measure, to be used for the robustness tests, where crisis

is defined as an increase in the real interest rate of over 10 percentage points in one year, or top

5% of annual real interest rate changes. Table 1 presents a list of countries and years for which

our financial crisis indicator is equal to 1. Thus, our financial crisis variable measures domestic

financial crises and proxies for the times when credit constraints are likely to be binding.

   Following the methodology in Razin and Rubinstein (2006), we use a financial crisis indicator

to estimate the following model.
                                                    
                                                     1 if yit > 0
                                                    
                                    I(crisis)it =                    ,
                                                     0 if yit ≤ 0
                                                    


where y is a latent variable and a function of our independent variables:


                                           yit = Xit0 β + εit ,


and ε have either normal or logistic PDF.


                                                     16
   We then construct a measure of the probability of financial crisis as a predicted value from the

above estimation, which we use in the analysis of stock market volatility.

   We first analyze the data in a panel regression without fixed effects with AR(1) and het-

eroschedasticity in errors, estimating it by feasible GLS (FGLS). In this regression we test whether

credit constraints, as measured by the probability of financial crisis, as well as creditor rights index

have an expected effect on the stock market volatility. Specifically, we estimate


                              ln(σit ) = α + γ ∗ Pr(crisis)it + Zit0 δ + ωit ,


where ln(σit ) is our measure of the stock market volatility, for December of each year; α is a

constant term, Zit is a set of control variables, errors ωit are allowed to be serially correlated and

heteroschedastic.

   Evidently, one cannot possibly account by institutional variables for all the cross–country dif-

ferences that would affect the variations in the stock market volatility between countries. Thus, we

employ country specific fixed–effects regression analysis. Since our creditor rights measure does not

vary over time, it drops out from these regressions. Nevertheless, we can still measure the effects

of credit constraints. Specifically, we estimate


                              ln(σit ) = αi + γ ∗ Pr(crisis)it + Zit0 δ + ωit ,


where ln(σit ) is our measure of the stock market volatility, for December of each year; αi are country

fixed effects, Zit is a set of control variables, errors ωit are allowed to be serially correlated and

heteroschedastic. We use FGLS with AR(1) disturbances in order to estimate this regression.

   The above two stage system can be identified with any set of explanatory variables through

functional form. However, functional form identification tends to be weak, which is why we include

in the first stage the variables that are likely to affect the probability of financial crisis but do not

have a direct effect on stock market volatility, at least in our sample. Thus, we identify this system

                                                     17
by both functional form and exclusion restrictions.

   Because the level of financial development varies vastly across countries, we believe the deter-

minants of stock market volatility may vary as well. Thus, we estimate the second stage regressions

for the sub–samples of OECD and non–OECD countries as well as for the full sample.

   In the first stage we use two additional controls: political situation, which is measured by the

ICRG index; and de jure financial account openness, which we obtained from Edwards (2006).

Higher value of the ICRG index indicates better political situation, higher value of the index of

financial account openness indicates more capital mobility, fewer restrictions on capital flows.

   In the regressions without country fixed effects in the second stage we control for the country’s

wealth measured as GDP in U.S. dollars divided by population and for the size of the stock market

measured by the log of number of firms listed on the stock markets. These variables were all

obtained from Global Financial Data. We also allow for different levels of stock market volatility

under fixed and floating exchange rate regimes. We define exchange rate regime to be fixed if

Reinhart & Rogoff (2004) coarse index is equal to either 1 or 2.

   In addition, in the regressions with and without country fixed effects, we control for the growth

rate of GDP per capita and for the volatility of the U.S. 3-year T-bill rate. We used the U.S. T-bill

rate for the last day of each month from FAME and calculated the measure of volatility in the

same way as we did for the stock returns. We attempted additional control variables, such as fiscal

situation in the country, current account, capital mobility, stock market P/E ratio, but none of

these variables entered the regressions with significant coefficients or affected the results in any way

safe for some of them limiting the sample. Sovereign credit rating does enter significantly in the

regressions, but it is highly correlated with growth rate of GDP per capita (with the correlation

coefficient of 0.79), which is why we did not include it in the main specification.

3.4       Empirical Results

We now report the results of the two stage estimation procedure: probability of crises and stock

price volatility.


3.4.1       Probability of Financial Crises

Here we report the results of our analysis using a less strict definition of a financial crisis. We

estimated all the models with a more strict definition and found that our results are very similar,

with the coefficients of interest in the second stage being larger in magnitude.

       In the estimation of the first stage, we find that


                        Pr(crisis) = 1.16 − 0.16 ∗ CR − 0.02 ∗ P OL − 0.01 ∗ CAP + ,


where  is the standard error, P OL is the indicator of political situation in the country, CAP

is a measure of capital mobility. We find that better creditor protection, more stable political

situation, and more open financial account all lower the probability of domestic financial crisis. The

McFadden’s adjusted R2 for this regression is 0.15.10 We use predicted values of this regression as

a probability of financial crisis, our proxy for the tightness of the credit constraints, in the second

stage.


3.4.2       Stock Market Volatility

Tables 2 and 3 report the results of our second stage estimation, with results of the GLS regressions

without fixed effects reported in Table 2 and those with fixed effects reported in Table 3. We control

for the growth rate of GDP per capita and for the volatility of the U.S. 3-year T-bill rate in both

sets of regressions. In the regressions without country fixed effects we also control for the level of

GDP per capita, the log of number of firms listed on the stock market, and the indicator of whether
  10
       The described regression is estimated using probit. We obtain almost identical results with logit regressions.



                                                            19
the country has a fixed exchange rate regime.

       Both Tables present the results for the full sample (columns (1) and (4)), the non-OECD

countries (columns (2) and (5)), and the OECD countries (columns (3) and (6)). The countries

that joined the OECD during our sample period are classified as non–OECD prior to joining and

as OECD in the aftermath.

       In the regressions without fixed effects, presented in Table 2, we can estimate the effects of cred-

itor rights index. As model predicts, we find that better creditor protection leads to lower volatility

of the stock market. Adding our proxy for the tightness of the credit constraint, the predicted

probability of financial crisis, we see that indeed some of the effect of the creditor protection works

through the probability of the financial crisis, since the coefficients on the creditor rights index

in columns (4)-(6) are lower than those in columns (1)-(3), which did not include the predicted

probability of the financial crisis.11 However, there remains a direct effect of creditor protection on

the stock market volatility.

       We note that the effect of creditor protection is much smaller in OECD countries, which is

expected because the property rights protection in OECD countries tends to be better overall,

making creditor protection less important. In fact, once we control for the probability of financial

crisis, the creditor rights indicator no longer has a significant direct effect on the stock market

volatility in OECD countries.

       As predicted by our model, higher probability of financial crisis, which proxies for a higher

chance that credit constraints are binding, increases the volatility of the stock market. This effect

is especially pronounced for the OECD countries. However, we are concerned that this correlation

between the probability of financial crisis and the stock market volatility arises because of unob-

served differences between the countries. Thus, we estimated the model with country fixed effects to
  11
    Including the predicted probability of the financial crisis does limit our sample somewhat, thus one might be
concerned that the difference in coefficients is driven by the change in sample rather than the inclusion of this variable.
We re–estimated regressions in columns (1)-(3) limiting the sample to be the same as in columns (4)-(6) and found
that limiting the sample affects the coefficients in a negligible way. The results are available from authors upon
request.



                                                            20
analyze the time–series relationship between credit constraints and stock market volatility. Because

creditor rights index does not vary over time for each country, it drops out of the regression.

       Table 3 presents the results of the analysis with country fixed effects. We again confirm the

model prediction that higher probability of tighter financial constraints, as proxied by the prob-

ability of financial crisis, increases stock market volatility. However, for the OECD sample the

coefficient is no longer statistically significant, suggesting that some of the effect found in Table 2

was indeed driven by the cross–country rather than within country variation in the probability of fi-

nancial crises. On the other hand, the regression coefficient is now higher in magnitude, most likely

because the country fixed effects soak up a large amount of unexplained cross–country differences

in stock market volatility.

       The average probability of financial crisis in the sample is 0.08 with the standard deviation of

0.10. The coefficient in column (4) of Table 3 implies that an increase in the probability of financial

crisis by one standard deviation is associated with a 10% increase in the stock market volatility.12

       Thus, our empirical analysis confirms the effect of creditor protection on the stock market

volatility in an economy with credit constraints. While the effects we find are not very large, they

are likely to be biased downwards because of the measurement error associated with our proxy

for credit constraints, as well as the measurement error in the de jure definition of creditor rights

index.13


3.4.3      Robustness Tests

We conduct a series of robustness tests to make sure our findings are not driven by the exact

specification we have chosen. We describe them in this section, but do not report the regression

tables in the interest of space. The tables are available from authors upon request.
  12
     Log of stock market volatility increases by 0.10, which means stock market volatility itself increases by 10%.
While this number is economically meaningful, it is not very large, given that the standard deviation of our stock
market volatility measure is about 70% of its mean.
  13
     It is well known that while the creditor rights index takes on a value of 4 in countries like India and China, de
facto creditor protection in these countries is low.



                                                         21
   We repeat our analysis with an alternative (stricter) definition of the financial crisis in the first

stage, which leads to a different predicted probability of the crisis. The correlation between our

old and new predicted crisis probability is very high: 0.97. We repeat our second stage estimation

with this new crisis probability and find no qualitative differences in our results and very small

quantitative differences.

   Going back to our original definition of financial crisis, we now use logit model to construct our

predicted crisis probability. The correlation of the new measure with the original one is again very

high: 0.99. We re–estimate Tables 2 and 3 using this new prediction. As expected, given the high

correlation of the measures of crisis probability, the estimated coefficients are almost identical to

our main specification.

   We re–estimated the regressions in Tables 2 and 3 including the lagged dependent variable

on the right–hand side. While the coefficient estimates are now slightly smaller, their signs and

significance are not affected. As we would expect, when the lagged dependent variable is included

on the right–hand side, the errors are no longer serially correlated.

   In the estimation of Tables 2 and 3 we did not correct our standard errors for using the predicted

probability as an explanatory variable. As Heckman (1978) points out, consistent estimates of

variance can be obtained if the predicted probability is used as an instrument for the binary

variable on the right-hand side. We re–estimated our model in this way (with and without fixed

effects), using GMM, and found that our results are robust to this correction. In fact, with country

fixed effects, the significance level of the coefficients rises.

   Finally, we attempted to include a number of other macroeconomic variables as controls in first

or second stage of our regressions, such as current account to GDP ratio, interest margin, inflation

rate, change in real exchange rate etc. These variables do not have explanatory power and do not

affect the results of our analysis.

4    A Concluding Remark

In this paper, we examine the connection between creditor protection and the volatility of stock

market prices. We first show in a Tobin’s q investment model that better creditor protection, and

hence lower collateral requirements, reduces the price volatility. The main intuition is that firm’s

investment, operation and capital return fluctuates when the credit constraint oscillates between

binding and non–binding, but the probability of this oscillation can be reduced by better creditor

protection. We then test the theoretical model using cross-country panel regression on aggregated

stock price volatility in 41 countries over the period from 1984 to 2004. We find that weak creditor

protection increases the probability of liquidity crises, our proxy of the probability of credit binding,

and hence the aggregated stock price volatility. Our paper thus illustrates the importance of creditor

protection on the development of sound stock market: strong creditor rights not only increases the

stock value, but also crucially, reduces the counter–productive volatility of the stock market.

    Finally, there are other mechanisms through which creditor protection may affect the volatility

of stock market prices. For instance, Hale, Razin and Tong (2006) discuss the moral hazard channel.

Weak creditor protection induces firms to take riskier investments, as firms will benefit from the

upper range of the realized capital return, with no need to worry about the lower range. Such

moral hazard can increase stock price volatility. We leave it to future work to test this prediction.
