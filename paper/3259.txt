         THE INFORMATIONAL CONTENT OF INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS


                               ABSTRACT


     The ability of capital markets to distinguish firms of
different value by the size of their initial equity offerings lS
attenuated when insiders can sell equity more than once.  A model
is developed in which there is price risk from holding equity
between periods.  When the uncertainty is small. there must be
pooling in the first period.  When uncertainty is large. the
pooling equilibria dominate the separating equilibrium.
