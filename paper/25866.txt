                                         ABSTRACT

Hirschman's (1970) seminal thesis that enabling worker “voice” prevents exit from the
employment relationship has played a foundational role in labor economics. We provide the first
experimental test of this hypothesis in a real-world setting via a randomized controlled trial in
Indian garment factories. Just after what proved to be a disappointing wage hike, workers were
chosen at random to participate in an anonymous survey in which they were asked for feedback
on job conditions, supervisor performance, and overall job satisfaction. Enabling voice in this
manner reduced turnover and absenteeism after the hike, particularly for the most disappointed
workers.

1         Introduction

Hirschman’s seminal thesis on exit and voice – the idea that in the face of low-quality goods or
services, consumers, workers, and citizens can either voice their discontent and create improvement,
or exit the relationship – has profound implications for labor market dynamics (Hirschman, 1970).
Evidence from lab experiments demonstrates that voice has both inherent and instrumental value
(Ong et al., 2012). A worker’s utility increases when she is able to communicate her dissatisfaction
to her employer, creating “inherent” value. And the ability to lodge complaints effectively
may drive positive changes in the employment relationship, delivering an “instrumental” value.
Through these two channels, voice essentially functions as non-wage compensation. As a result,
turnover should decrease when workers can – either individually or collectively – meaningfully
communicate their dissatisfaction with their employer.
        While indirect tests of Hirschman’s theory, based on associations between measures of voice
and firm outcomes, abound in the economics literature (see, e.g., Batt et al. (2002); Beard et al.
(2009); Cottini et al. (2011); Freeman (1980); Gans et al. (2017); Watkins and Hyclak (2011)),
to our knowledge there has been no rigorous direct test of the impacts of increased voice on
worker turnover.1 In this paper, we seek to provide this evidence via a randomized controlled
trial in which we enabled greater voice for workers just after what proved to be a disappointing
scheduled wage hike.
        The State Governments of India revise their wage floors each year; the size of the “increment”
– the increase in the minimum wage – is generally linked to expected inflation (Anand et al., 2014).
In low-skill industries, in which wages for a majority of workers are often closely benchmarked to
the (sector- and locality-specific) minimum wage, the annual wage hike is highly anticipated by
both employers and workers. The employment relationship in this context is never more fraught
with tension than after an increment that is perceived by workers to be below expectations.
Indeed the period of time leading up to and following the annual hike is often marked by
widespread labor unrest (ILO, 2018; Justino, 2006).2
    1
     Experiment-based analyses from psychology have reached similar findings confirming Hirschman’s theory in
the realm of consumer relationships (see, e.g., Divett et al. (2003); Maute and Forrester Jr (1993)).
   2
     The popular press has widely reported on this phenomenon; see, for example, Reuters (2016) and Bengali


                                                     2
   To understand the impacts of increasing voice on worker turnover, and in particular the role
of voice in mitigating the effects of wage-related disappointment, we partnered with the largest
ready-made garments firm in India. Just before the 2016 minimum wage schedule was announced
by the Karnataka State Government, we collected data on a random sample of workers regarding
their current wages; expectations about changes due to the upcoming wage increment; and other
opportunities available to them in the labor market. These data reveal that workers’ expectations
were substantially higher than the realized wage hike: workers expected a hike that was roughly
three times the size of the realized increase. On average, workers expected to earn about 17 USD
(16 percent of total salary) more (per month) than their realized post-increment monthly wages.
   Directly following the wage hike, we randomized half of the surveyed sample to an intervention
designed to enhance workers’ voice. Workers in the treatment group were invited to take part in
a survey asking for 1) feedback on satisfaction related to job, supervisor, wage, and workplace
environment; and 2) opinions on various statements: whether mistakes are held against them,
whether it is difficult to ask others for help, whether supervisors encourage learning, and whether
they can trust their supervisor to advocate for them, listen to them, and help solve their problems.
   The results of this survey are themselves telling. Many workers used the survey to express
their dissatisfaction with various aspects of their jobs. For instance, approximately 20% of
respondents agreed with the statements that mistakes were held against them and asking for
help was difficult. Over 50% of the sample responded negatively to at least one of the six specific
statements about the work environment. Finally, though average reported satisfaction levels
with respect to the job, supervisor, and workplace environment were high (around 4 on a 5-point
scale), satisfaction with wage levels was much lower (averaging less than 3 out of 5), highlighting
the salience of wages as a potential driver of exit.
   Our empirical analysis is guided by an extension of the canonical model of reference-dependence
set in the context of wage determination (Barberis, 2013; Kőszegi and Rabin, 2006, 2009; Tversky
and Kahneman, 1991).3 Based on previous work, we model two pathways through which enabling
(2016).
   3
     Lab-experimental studies confirm the importance of reference dependence based on expectations of future
outcomes, such as pay raises (Abeler et al., 2011; Marzilli Ericson and Fuster, 2011).



                                                     3
voice may impact a worker’s decision to remain in or end the employment relationship. First,
enabling voice may raise the level of non-wage amenities associated with staying in her job
(Farndale and Hope-Hailey, 2011). Second, voice may serve to mitigate the disappointment
created by wage increases that are below expectations (Batt et al., 2002). We derive an empirical
specification directly from this model, and discuss the measures and proxies we employ for each
of the model’s parameters.
   Treatment effect estimates from hazard models show that enabling voice reduced the probability
of quitting by 20% in the months following the wage hike. This effect is strongest for workers who
were most disappointed with the wage increment (i.e., those whose expectations were farthest
from the realized wage hike). At the average deviation from wage hike expectations (about
17 USD), treated workers were 19% less likely to quit than control workers; for those whose
expectations were exactly met, however, the treatment had no effect. This negative interaction
between voice and disappointment persists even when we allow for heterogeneity in the voice effect
across individuals with different outside options, alleviating concerns that the disappointment
variable might simply be capturing variation in the individuals’ outside options. We also see
this pattern in results on the impacts of enabling voice and its interaction with wage-related
disappointment on rates of absenteeism, which we propose is a proxy for effort provision on
the job. Importantly for interpreting these results, we did not share the summary findings of
the survey with firm management during the period in which data on retention and attendance
were compiled. No firm action was taken to address potential worker dissatisfaction during the
evaluation period. Thus, we interpret impacts as demonstrating the inherent – as opposed to
instrumental – value of voice, the importance of which has been demonstrated by lab studies
(Ong et al., 2012; Xiao and Houser, 2005).
   Our study makes two main contributions. First, we provide what is to our knowledge the
first field experimental evaluation of Hirschman’s seminal hypothesis on exit and voice as it
pertains to the employment relationship. Previous studies in economics have carried out indirect
tests using variation in union representation (Freeman, 1980); employee participation in offline
problem-solving groups and self-directed teams (Batt et al., 2002); and voice in the realm of


                                                4
workplace hazards and unsatisfactory work conditions (Cottini et al., 2011). We add to this
work by providing direct causal evidence from a field experiment – which addresses concerns
about the potential endogeneity of voice with respect to turnover and other workplace outcomes
– of the power of voice to mitigate exit in a real labor setting.4
      Ours is also the first such study from a developing country manufacturing context, in which
voice tends to be particularly limited and exit is common (Dundon and J., 2007; Macey and
Schneider, 2008; Rees and Gatenby, 1991). As the low-skill workforce in many developing
countries transitions rapidly from agriculture to industrial work, employers struggle with high
worker turnover due to poor working conditions, low pay, and restricted worker rights (Chun and
Wang, 1995; Mosley and Uno, 2007; Tybout, 2000). Our study affirms the value of providing
voice to vulnerable workers in exactly these high intensity environments as a means of increasing
workers’ job satisfaction and thus reducing turnover.
      Second, we contribute to the body of empirical evidence on the implications of reference
dependence in real-world settings (O’Donoghue and Sprenger, 2018). Much work has shown
the importance of reference points in determining a wide range of outcomes – including market
efficiency, labor supply, consumption choices, workplace effort, financial trading, sports performance,
and even domestic violence (see, e.g., Adhvaryu et al. (2018); Allen et al. (2017); Andersen et al.
(2014); Backus et al. (2017); Bartling et al. (2015); Card and Dahl (2011); Crawford and Meng
(2011); DellaVigna et al. (2017); Haigh and List (2005); List (2003); Ockenfels et al. (2015);
Pope and Schweitzer (2011)). Our paper builds on this work by directly measuring expectations
and showing that falling short of these expectations is associated with a greater probability of
turnover.
      The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the context and
the randomized voice intervention treatment that we use. In section 3, we outline a conceptual
framework that provides us with testable predictions on the relationship between quitting, wage
expectations, and voice. Section 4 describes the data. Section 5 discusses the estimation strategy.
Section 6 reports the results, and section 7 concludes.

    Indeed the value of conducting field experiments to test core theories has long been emphasized in labor
economics (List and Rasul, 2011).

2         Context and Intervention

2.1        Context

Our study focuses on the Indian ready-made garments (RMG) sector. We partnered with Shahi
Exports, Private Limited, the largest RMG exporter in India. Shahi employs more than 100,000
workers across approximately 60 factory units spread across several Indian states. As is the case
in many manufacturing firms in low-income contexts, turnover is high at Shahi: 5% of our study
sample quits by the end of the first month of the study and 18% quits by the end of the fifth
month. The costs of turnover, as emphasized by Shahi’s upper management, pose a significant
challenge, leading to persistently high recruitment and training costs and underutilization of
capital.
        In the RMG sector, wages for frontline workers are benchmarked to government minimum
wage policy, which is largely determined at the state level. In the state of Karnataka, where the
majority of Shahi’s factories (and the entirety of this study’s sample) are located, the minimum
wage schedule specifies different minimum wages across geographic areas, industries, and skill
levels within each industry. The minimum wage is comprised of two parts – a “basic” portion
and a “dearness allowance,” which is intended to allow for cost of living adjustments. Every year,
the state government makes adjustments to minimum wage schedules by changing the dearness
allowance to account for inflation. In addition, adjustments to the “basic” wage level are made
every five years or so by the Government of India at the federal level, commonly resulting in
larger increases than the more frequent inflation adjustments. The last such increase preceding
our study period was in 2014.
        Figure 1 plots the median minimum wage in Karnataka (taken across all geographical zones
and skill levels) for four female-dominated industries.5 The minimum wage that is relevant to
Shahi – the tailoring industry’s – is denoted by the dashed line. As is clear from the figure, the
tailoring wage increased substantially more in 2014 than in subsequent years, due to the basic
    5
   Chattopadhyay et al. (2013) lists food and apparel as the two industries with the highest share of female
manufacturing employment in the state of Karnataka.

wage hike that happened in that year.6
       Wages for frontline workers at Shahi closely track these minimum wage schedules. After
the wage hike announcement made by the government every year, Shahi revises its wages to
comply with the stated increases. Firms have discretion, however, and sometimes do choose to
raise wages by more than the minimum wage policy requires (though this is not commonplace).
Overall, there is substantial uncertainty about the size of these annual wage increases from the
point of view of workers, due to the fact that both government as well as firm decision-making
is not predictable.
       Anecdotal evidence suggests that worker dissatisfaction is especially high after these annual
firm-wide wage increases, a fact that may in part be explained by the potential disappointment
brought about by wage-related uncertainty. In this paper, we investigate how this disappointment
might lead to higher quit rates. In section 3, we outline a model that explains how worker exit
decisions are related to wage-related expectations and disappointment, and why a disappointing
wage hike might lead to higher worker turnover. Our empirical analysis aims to understand
   6
    This was also true for other industries, but the 2014 increase was much larger in tailoring than in other
industries because the baseline tailoring wage was lower compared to comparable sectors.

whether a “voice” intervention can reduce the exit of individuals after these wage hike announcements.


2.2    Intervention

The intervention we consider is an employee satisfaction survey. The survey questions, summarized
in Table 1 (and copied in full in appendix section A.1), created an opportunity for respondents
to express their (dis)agreement with various statements about their job: whether it is difficult
to ask others for help and whether supervisors encourage learning, for example. Respondents
were also asked about their general satisfaction with their job, wage, supervisor, and overall work
environment.
   In the consent script read to each respondent before each survey was administered (copied
in full in appendix section A.1), several important points were made clear. First, respondents
knew that their individual responses were confidential. Second, respondents were aware that the
survey was being conducted because Shahi was interested in learning about the satisfaction of
its workers. Therefore, they knew that the survey results would be communicated in some way
to the firm, even though the surveys were not being conducted by Shahi employees. Finally,
they were told that their names had been selected at random, which should have minimized
the potential for respondents to perceive themselves as singled out in some way, chosen by their
employer specifically.
   The use of an employee satisfaction survey to reduce quitting is motivated by the work of
Hirschman (1970) and many others, under the basic premise that individuals have two main
options in unsatisfactory situations: “exit” the relationship or use their “voice.” That is, if
unsatisfied with their jobs, employees can quit without trying to improve their situation at work
(exit), or they can stay, speak up, and try to remedy the situation (voice). The workers in our
study context do not typically have many opportunities to voice concerns about their working
conditions and may therefore have no option but to exit, which may in part explain the firm’s
high rate of turnover. A “voice” instrument like the survey we administered has the potential to
reduce exit, both because it serves as a means of expressing workers’ dissatisfaction or concerns
(directly providing utility to workers), and because it may lead to actual constructive changes in

                                                8
the work environment.
   Importantly for the interpretation of our results, we did not share summary results of the
survey with firm management until after the evaluation period, i.e., the period in which we
compiled retention and attendance data on the experimental sample. Once the evaluation period
was complete, we shared factory unit-wise summary results from the survey with the firm’s Board
of Directors and the head of HR. This means that during our evaluation, the firm did not make
any changes to labor-facing policy in response to the worker feedback elicited from the satisfaction
surveys. Thus, we highlight the inherent – as opposed to instrumental – value of voice as the
operative channel for any impacts we observe.

    The responses to this employee survey instrument reveal that many workers did in fact use
it to express dissatisfaction with various aspects of the job. Table 1 displays the distribution of
responses to all survey questions. In panel A, we see that over 20% of workers agreed or strongly
agreed with the first two statements: that mistakes were held against them and asking for help
was difficult. Smaller proportions (ranging between 6% and 15%) provided negative evaluations
of their supervisor, indicating their supervisor was either not encouraging, not someone they
could trust, or indifferent about helping solve problems. Combining responses to all of the
statements in panel A, over 50% of the sample responded negatively to at least one of the six
statements.
    Panel B of Table 1, on satisfaction levels, also provides some interesting insights. Though
average reported satisfaction levels with respect to the job, supervisor, and workplace environment
were quite high (over half reported being extremely satisfied), satisfaction with wage levels were
much lower – with over half either somewhat or extremely dissatisfied. This highlights the
salience of wages as a potential driver of exit.



3     Conceptual Framework

This section provides a conceptual framework for understanding the relationship between wage
increases, wage expectations, and the effects of a voice intervention like the one described above.
Consider the turnover decision of a worker after she learns about the size of an (anticipated) wage
hike. This decision depends on her wage prior to the hike, inclusive of job-specific amenities (w),
the wage and amenities at her best outside option (w), the realized wage hike at her current job
(y), the realized wage hike at her best outside option (y), and the wage hike she expected from
her current firm prior to the announcement (ŷ).
    A worker will choose to quit if and only if the utility at her current job (after the wage
increase) is lower than the utility she would have at her next best option – that is, if and only if


                                  w + y − d(ŷ − y) +  < w + y.                                (1)



                                                   10
   Here,  is an idiosyncratic (individual-specific) error term, and the function d(.) captures the
utility loss (or gain, if ŷ − y is negative) resulting from the discrepancy between the realized
wage hike and the worker’s expected wage hike. When ŷ − y is positive, this term represents
the disappointment resulting from receiving a lower wage increase than expected. In equation
(1), it is assumed that this disappointment is specific to her current firm: a worker will only
experience this utility loss if she stays at the current job. This is because she attributes the
utility loss from a lower-than-expected wage increase to her current firm, which makes working
for that firm less desirable. For similar reasons, we omit expectations about the size of the wage
hike at the worker’s outside option – over-estimating the outside option wage hike should not
lead to disappointment at the worker’s current job (which has no control of this hike) or at her
outside option (to which she has no existing attachment).
   Assuming that y − y (the difference between the wage hike in the current job and outside
option) is approximately 0 or is random noise (for which we provide some evidence in the previous
section), the condition specified by equation (1) can be rewritten as the following (where ˜ =
 + (y − y)):


                                     ˜ < d(ŷ − y) − (w − w).                                   (2)


   Therefore, the probability of quitting can be expressed as a function of current wages, outside
wages (both inclusive of job-specific amenities), and wage disappointment, as shown below in
equation (3). As described in the next section, we collect data on all of these variables and thus
are able to estimate this equation directly in our empirical analysis.


                               Pr(Quit) = F (d(ŷ − y) − (w − w)) .                              (3)


   Equation (3) demonstrates how quits may rise after a wage hike if workers are on average
disappointed by the size of the realized hike (i.e., if ŷ − y > 0). Within this framework, the voice
intervention described above might be able to reduce quitting in two ways, as we show in the



                                                 11
equation below:


                           Pr(Quit) = F (d(ŷ − y, v) − (w(v) − w)) ,                         (4)


where the voice intervention v enters in two ways. First, a voice intervention might amount to
an increase in amenities at her current job (w0 (v) > 0), by improving a worker’s perception of
the firm or her supervisor. Second, a voice intervention could also mitigate the disappointment
generated by the lower-than-expected wage hike, which would lead to an effect that interacts
with wage disappointment (d12 < 0). If workers express their disappointment by either exiting
or by voicing their opinions, providing workers with the ability to voice their opinions should
weaken the relationship between disappointment and exit.



4     Data

To estimate the theoretical model described in the previous section, data on quitting, current
wages, outside wages, and wage expectations are required.        We use three main sources of
data for this analysis: a baseline survey specifically designed to learn about expectations and
outside options, the employee satisfaction survey that served as our voice intervention, and firm
administrative data.


4.1    Baseline and Intervention Surveys

In May 2016, before workers were made aware of how the annual minimum wage hike would
translate into an increase in their take-home pay at Shahi, we conducted a baseline survey to
elicit worker expectations about the pending wage hike. Workers were asked how much they
expected take-home wages to increase next month, along with questions about wages at their
best outside option – the job they would most likely have if they did not work at Shahi. We
surveyed a randomly selected sample of approximately 2,000 workers from 12 factory units located
in the cities of Bangalore, Mysore, Maddur, Shimoga, and Kannakapura in the Indian state of



                                               12
Karnataka.
       Using this data, we construct a measure of disappointment, which combines data on ex ante
worker expectations and ex post wage increases. Specifically, we calculate the difference between
the wage hike an individual was expecting to receive in June and the wage hike she actually
received, which turned out to be a 398 rupee increase (approximately 6 USD in 2016 dollars) for
all individuals in our sample.7 Another important variable is the outside option wage. Workers
are first asked what job they would most likely have or would be easiest to get if they did not
work at Shahi, and then asked for the wage they would earn at the specified job.
       Of the baseline sample, approximately half were randomly selected for the voice intervention.
To assign treatment status, we stratified by factory unit and job type (there are 12 factory units
and 5 different job types: tailor, checker, helper, operator, or other). The selected individuals
were given the voice intervention (the satisfaction survey described in section 2.2) after the wage
hikes were implemented at the beginning of June 2016. These surveys were administered from
the end of June to the beginning of July 2016.


4.2       Administrative Data

Given the motivation from the exit-voice literature, we are most interested in turnover (retention).
From the firm’s administrative data, we are able to observe the dates that an individual joins
and leaves the firm. We also observe daily attendance and can calculate the share of days (in a
given time period, during which a worker was still employed by the firm) a worker was absent. A
less extreme version of exit, and likely indicative of decreased motivation, absenteeism represents
another outcome that might reflect the potentially mitigative effects of our voice intervention.
       We obtain a set of individual-level controls from the firm’s personnel data. These include
tenure at the firm, gender, education, hometown, department, and job type.
   7
    The size of the wage increase is not always the same for all workers because the government sometimes
dictates different wage increases for workers of different skill levels and across different geographic zones. Shahi
also has the discretion to raise wages more for different workers (more skilled workers, for example) as long as it
complies with the new minimum wage laws. It is not uncommon, however, for Shahi and other firms to implement
a uniform wage increase for all workers in all factories across the state of Karnataka.

4.3        Summary Statistics

Table 2 reports summary statistics for our study sample.8 Column 1 represents the full sample.
Column 2 reports statistics for the treatment group that received the voice intervention, column
3 for the control group, and column 4 the difference between the two. Wage disappointment,
defined as the difference between expected and actual monthly wages after the hike, is high.
On average, individuals were expecting to earn 16.9 USD more (which is approximately 17% of
average monthly wages) than they actually ended up earning after the hike. In other words,
individuals were expecting a wage hike of approximately 23 USD on average (approximately 22%
of monthly salary), a value that lies in between the 2014 minimum wage hike (which corresponded
to a 35% increase) and the 2015 wage hike (which corresponded to a 7% increase), both depicted
in Figure 1.
        The sample is balanced on important observables, like salary, tenure, education, and job
type across treatment and control. Language is the only variable for which there is a (small)
statistically significant difference (at the 10% level) across treatment and control. The joint test,
however, cannot reject the null that all covariates are balanced across treatment and control
groups (with a p-value of 0.661).9



5         Empirical Strategy

The first part of our empirical strategy is derived directly from equation (3) in section 3, which
predicts that quitting behavior should depend on current wages, outside wages, disappointment,
and exposure to the voice intervention. We begin by estimating a Cox proportional hazard model
of the following form:


                         λi (t) = λ0 (t) exp (β1 Wi + β2 W i + β3 Di + β4 Ti + γXi )                           (5)
    8
     This includes individuals in the baseline survey who were present at the firm when the intervention took place
(in June 2016) and who were not missing any demographic covariates.
   9
     We perform this Wald test of joint significance by estimating a system of equations, regressing each
characteristic onto treatment status, using seemingly unrelated regression (SUR).

where λi (t) denotes the instantaneous probability of individual i quitting at time t (measured in
days relative to her start date) conditional on being still employed at time t. Wi is the individual’s
current wage, W i is the outside option wage given in the survey, Di is disappointment, and Ti is
an indicator for the voice intervention treatment. Disappointment is measured as the difference
between the wage hike an individual was expecting to receive and the wage hike an individual
actually received, with higher values capturing greater disappointment. Xi is a vector of controls:
gender, years of tenure indicators, years of education, an indicator for speaking Kannada, an
indicator for being from Bangalore, and an indicator for being part of the sewing department.
We estimate the model with and without fixed effects for job type and factory unit because
treatment assignment was stratified by these variables.
   In equation (5), β4 captures the average effect of the voice intervention. But this specification
does not allow us to distinguish between the direct effects of voice on amenities and effects
operating through the mitigation of disappointment (both of which are suggested by the exit-voice
theory). To tease these two mechanisms apart, we estimate the following interaction specification,
derived from equation (4):


                 λi (t) = λ0 (t) exp (κ1 Wi + κ2 W i + κ3 Di + κ4 Ti + κ5 Di Ti + γXi ) ,         (6)


which allows for the intervention to have heterogeneous effects by the level of disappointment. If
providing workers with voice offered them a way to express their disappointment (an alternative
to quitting), we should expect to see a positive coefficient on disappointment (κ3 ) and a negative
coefficient on the disappointment-voice interaction (κ5 ). This would mean that those who are
more disappointed are more likely to quit, but the disappointed individuals who were given voice
are less likely to do so than those who were not.
   We also conduct a similar analysis using OLS to analyze retention as well as other outcomes
of interest.   We run OLS regressions using the same independent variables as in equation
(6); dependent variables we consider include separate indicators for having quit by the end
of July, August, and every month until November, as well as rates of absenteeism across various



                                                   16
combinations of months.



6     Results

We begin with a graphical presentation of the data. In Figure 2, we plot the cumulative share of
the sample that has left the firm, starting in July 2016 (the first month after the voice intervention
treatment) until the end of November. We plot this separately for the voice intervention and the
control groups. The dashed line, which represents the voice intervention group, starts separating
from the solid line (the control group) after about two weeks, and remains lower than the solid
line throughout the entire time period. By the end of November, quit shares are approximately
2 percentage points lower in the voice intervention group than in the control group.

                            Figure 2: Quit Rates by Treatment Status




    In Table 3, we investigate these results more formally, estimating the hazard model described
in equation (5), which is derived directly from the model in section 3. In column 1, we estimate
a negative coefficient of -0.23 on the voice intervention coefficient, which indicates that those in


                                                 17
the treatment group are on average 20% less likely to quit than those in the control group. In
column 2, we allow for the treatment to interact with wage disappointment, estimating the hazard
model in equation (6). In this regression, it is clear that the effects of the voice intervention are
strongest among the most disappointed. That is, we estimate a significant negative coefficient
on the interaction between the voice treatment and wage disappointment; while the main effect
of voice, now representing the impact of voice on the those whose expectations were exactly met
by the wage hike, is small in magnitude and not significant. In addition, the main effect of wage
disappointment is positive and significant.
      In other words, individuals who were disappointed by the wage hike were more likely to quit,
but the voice intervention was particularly able to lower quit rates among these disappointed
workers. At the average level of wage disappointment (17 USD), treatment individuals were
19% less likely to quit than control individuals. For those who were not disappointed at all,
the intervention had no statistically significant effect. This set of results suggests that the voice
intervention worked primarily by mitigating disappointment.
      In columns 3 and 4, we show that the inclusion of factory unit and job type fixed effects have
little effect on the coefficient estimates. In the appendix (Table A1), we show that our results
are robust to various alternative specifications of the model. In column 1, we allow for factory
unit-level frailty;10 in column 2, we show results without any controls; in column 3 we include
all individuals who were part of the treatment assignment procedure (including those who left
before July and were therefore not exposed to the voice intervention). Across all three columns,
we see robust evidence that the voice intervention significantly reduced quitting for the most
disappointed individuals.
      Although our voice intervention treatment was assigned randomly, wage disappointment is, of
course, potentially endogenously determined. In the conceptual framework outlined in section 3,
equation (1) makes it clear that the quit decision also depends on the wage hikes that take place at
an individual’s outside option. If workers who expected large wage hikes at Shahi (and who were
therefore very disappointed) did so because they were expecting large wage hikes at their outside
 10
      This allows for a factory unit-specific random effect that enters multiplicatively in the hazard function.

option, this would generate a positive correlation between wage disappointment and outside
option wage hike expectations. If their large outside option wage hikes were actually realized,
this would make it rational for them to quit. Our positive wage disappointment coefficient,
therefore, could instead be capturing higher quit rates among individuals who saw larger wage
hikes at their outside option. Similarly, the negative interaction coefficient could be capturing
greater effectiveness of the voice intervention among those with larger outside option hikes.
   We argue that this scenario is unlikely for two reasons. First, the outside options for most
Shahi workers are likely to be in one of the four female-dominated industries depicted in Figure
1. This figure shows that the wage hike in tailoring was similar to (or higher than) the wage
hikes in the other three industries, in 2016 as well as in the previous two years. This makes it
unlikely that a Shahi worker saw a higher wage hike at their outside option than the one they
experienced at Shahi.
   Second, we are able to test whether controlling for the worker’s outside option type (as
provided by the worker in the baseline survey), and its interaction with voice, affects our
coefficient estimates. Specifically, in column 1 of Table 4, we include indicators for whether a
worker reported their outside option was a garment factory job, other factory job, agricultural self
employment or labor, piece rate work, and other. Importantly, we also include the interactions
between these indicators and the voice intervention indicator to ensure that the heterogeneity in
the treatment effect we are attributing to wage disappointment is not due to variation in outside
option wage hikes.
   In column 2, we conduct a similar exercise, except we use the job type specified by the worker
in response to a slightly different question. This question asks if a worker can earn a higher wage
at another job outside Shahi, and if so, what this job is. To control for this variable, we once
again include indicators (and their interactions with the voice intervention) for garment factory
job, other factory job, agricultural self employment or labor, piece rate work, other, and finally,
an indicator for having no better-paying option at any time of the year.
   Comparing the estimates in Table 4 to those in Table 3, it is clear that outside option job
types do not substantially change any of our main coefficient estimates. This robustness alleviates

concerns that unobserved outside option wage hikes are contributing to our results in Table 3.
Again, it is clear here that factory unit and job type fixed effects do not affect our coefficient
estimates. We therefore drop them in the remaining tables (but report these specifications in
the appendix).
    We have established that the voice intervention reduced quitting in the five months after
the wage hike, particularly for the most disappointed individuals. Next, we conduct a slightly
different analysis to investigate when the effects of the voice intervention started to kick in, and
how persistent these effects were. For this analysis, we run OLS regressions using the same set of
independent variables as in the hazard models above. The five dependent variables of interest are
dummy variables for having quit by July, August, September, October, and November. Results


                                                                 21
are reported in Table 5. Here, we see that the main effect of disappointment is small in column 1,
but larger and significant in the remaining columns. It appears that disappointed individuals did
not start quitting at higher rates than non-disappointed individuals until August. This is in line
with the fact that many of the workers in this sample are migrants, who may have needed several
weeks to discuss their decision to quit with their families, or to save enough money for the trip
home. August is also when the effect of the voice intervention on these disappointed individuals is
first observed. The magnitudes of the wage disappointment main effect and the disappointment-
voice interaction are similar in the remaining columns, suggesting that the voice intervention did
more than just temporarily delay quitting (at least within our window of analysis) – the effects
of the voice intervention persisted for several months after the wage hike.
   The analysis so far has focused on quitting as our main outcome of interest. Next, we consider
the possibility that those who do not leave the firm may still actualize their disappointment: they
may, for example, reduce on-the-job effort or time spent at work. To investigate this possibility,
we repeat our regressions above using absenteeism as our outcome variable – specifically, the
share of days (over various time periods) that an individual did not attend work, conditional on
still being employed at the firm. In all of these regressions, we adopt an ANCOVA specification
which controls for pre-treatment absenteeism rates – that is, the share of days in the months of
April and May (prior to the June voice treatment) that an individual was absent from work.
   The results in Table 6 reveal that voice and disappointment both play a role in determining
patterns of absenteeism after the wake hike. For individuals in the control group, disappointment
drives up absenteeism. This is clear in columns 1 through 5, which suggests these effects start
kicking in immediately. These immediate effects on absenteeism, along with the slightly more
delayed effects on quitting, are consistent with the idea that quitting may take some time even if
workers experience the disappointment almost immediately. However, as was the case in Table
3, the voice intervention mitigates these effects entirely (starting in August). For those who were
not disappointed, there is no effect of the intervention on absenteeism, but the intervention did
reduce absenteeism among disappointed individuals.

7     Conclusion

In this study, we provide what is to our knowledge the first real-world experimental evidence on
Hirschman’s seminal theory of the exit-voice tradeoff. A randomly assigned employee satisfaction
survey, administered to Indian garment workers shortly after a disappointing wage hike, reduced
quit rates by 20%. Importantly, the effects of this voice intervention were strongest among those
most disappointed by the wage hike – individuals who, prior to the wage hike, stated expectations
for the hike that were much higher than what was actually realized.
    These results are in line with the predictions of Hirschman (1970), and subsequent work
exploring the implications of Hirschman’s thesis in various areas of economics. Turnover was
substantially higher for individuals who did not have access to the voice “technology” embodied
in our survey. For those who were randomized to this voice treatment, through which many
workers indeed expressed dissatisfaction with various aspects of the job, exit was much less
likely. The same pattern of results is apparent when we look at worker absenteeism, a less
extreme form of exit.
    Our results support an inherent value of voice: the act of communicating dissatisfaction
regarding the employment relationship is in itself valuable, at least in the short term. We
interpret the results this way because we did not share the summary findings of the survey
with our firm partners until after the evaluation period, meaning that the firm could not have
internalized the survey’s results and acted to remedy human resource policy during the study.
It is, of course, possible that when invited to take the survey, respondents might have felt that
their responses could spur firm policy change. This feeling would mean a greater emphasis on the
instrumental role for voice in our experiment. While we are not able to dispositively distinguish
between our baseline interpretation and this alternative, more instrumental, interpretation of
the results, the persistence of retention impacts for at least six months after the intervention
suggests that it is likely that voice did not act purely through an instrumental channel.
    The power of voice to change labor market outcomes for workers has been a mainstay
of organizational psychology, both in theory and practice, at least since Hirschman’s seminal
work. Despite this importance, however, engendering voice has proven particularly challenging

                                               25
in low-income country contexts, where the rapid growth of the manufacturing sector has greatly
expanded opportunities for employment, but has also often created situations in which large low-
income workforces have few channels by which to communicate or express grievances. Indeed, this
fact likely contributes to the persistently high turnover rates observed in low-skill manufacturing
in these contexts. The recent advent of short message service (SMS) and app-based technologies
for anonymous communication with employers may substantially increase access to voice for
workers in these developing country manufacturing firms. More research on the impacts of these
technologies on workplace and labor market outcomes is needed to assess their value.

A.1     Employee Satisfaction Survey

Respondents were asked to respond on a five-point scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree) to
the following statements:

  1. If I make a mistake in this job, it is often held against me.

  2. It is difficult to ask others in this line for help.

  3. My supervisor often encourages me to take on new tasks or to learn how to do things I
      have never done before

  4. If I was thinking about leaving this company to pursue a better job elsewhere, I would talk
      to my supervisor about it.

  5. If I had a problem in this company, I could depend on my supervisor to be my advocate.

  6. Often when I raise a problem with my supervisor, s/he does not seem very interested in
      helping me find a solution

    Respondents were asked to respond on a five-point scale (extremely dissatisfied to extremely
satisfied) to the following questions:

  1. How satisfied/happy or dissatisfied/ unhappy are you with your current job/position?

  2. How satisfied/happy or dissatisfied/ unhappy are you with your current wage?

  3. How satisfied/happy or dissatisfied/unhappy are you with your supervisor?

  4. How satisfied/happy or dissatisfied/unhappy are you with your overall workplace environment?

    Before the survey was administered, the following script was read to each respondent.

      Namaskara, my name is (surveyor name), I am here today to talk to you because
      Shahi is very interested in learning what it can do to ensure the satisfaction of its

                                                  31
workers. Your truthful responses will be very helpful in this goal. 2500 names were
chosen in a random lottery and yours was one of them. I would like to ask you a few
questions for the next 10 to 15 minutes. There are no right or wrong answers to our
questions – we are only interested in your opinion. Everything that you share in this
interview is confidential.

Participating in this interview is voluntary – there is no compulsion. However, your
participation will be much appreciated and useful. If there is any question that you
do not want to answer, please feel free to tell us. Can we proceed? Do you have any
questions or concerns before we begin?
