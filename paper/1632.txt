                   On the Limitations of Government
                      Borrowing: A Framework for
                           Empirical Testing

                                 ABSTRACT



     This paper seeks to distinguish empirically between two views on the

limitations of government borrowing. According to one view, nothing precludes

the government from running a permanent budget deficit, paying interest due

on the growing debt load simply by issuing new debt, An alternative Derspec—

tive holds that creditors would be unwilling   to   purchase government debt un-

less the government made a credible commitment to balance its budget in present

value terms. We show that distinguishing between these possibilities is mathe-

matically equivalent to testing whether a continuing currency inflation might

be fueled by speculation alone or is instead driven solely by economic funda-

mentals. Empirical tests which have been developed for this economic question

lead us to conclude that postwar TJIS. deficits are largely consistent with

the proposition that the government budget must be balanced in present—value

terms.

1. Introduction.

       This paper addresses the question of whether the government budget must

be balanced in present—value terms. This question holds profound implications

for macroeconomic theory and practice, With a Keynesian consumption function,

an affirmative answer can reverse the traditional conclusion that money—financed

deficits are more expansionary than bond—financed deficits (Blinder and Solow,

1974). With a permanent—income       consumption   function, by contrast, it can imply

that   a bond—financed deficit has   no effect on aggregate demand1     And if the

only   politically acceptable means   of raising the requisite revenues is with

money creation, it can imply a strong practical link between budget deficits

and inflation, as argued by Sargent (1982) and Sargent and Wallace (1981), It

of course also has serious implications for measures which may be necessary to

adopt in the future as a consequence of budget deficits accumulating in the

United States and many developing countries

       Why do some claim that government deficits must be balanced with future

surpluses? Whenever the budget goes into deficit, new debt must be issued,

If this is in the form of one—period bonds, then next year interest and prin-

cipal on that debt will come due.2 Accordingly, even if taxes in this follow-

ing year were sufficient to cover spending on government programs, new debt

would still have to be issued for that year, not only to replace the old debt

which comes due, but further to cover the accumulated interest on this debt,

If taxes are no greater than spending for yet a second year, then at the end

of the second year outstanding debt will have grown by two years of accumulated

interest. If taxes never exceed spending, debt would grow forever without

bound as an infinite interest load accumulated as a conseouence of a single

year's deficit.
                                      —2—


     Whether rational households would in fact always be willing to buy this

debt remains an unsettled theoretical question. If the government's borrowing

cost equals or exceeds the economy's growth rate, then an unpaid deficit im—

plies that debt must grow to become an infinite multiple of GNP,3 Such an

equilibrium seems counter—intuitive, though McCallum (1984) provides an optinii—

zing example in which both households' interest income and the tax on that in-

terest income indeed grow to become an arbitrarily large multiple of total pro

duction. On the other hand, if the interest rate (r) is less than the econo-

my's growth rate (q), then an infinitely—lived government clearly could run a

permanent deficit without having debt become a growing multiple of GNP, as

stressed by Feldstein (1976) and Buiter (1984). While r < q     is inconsistent

with an optimizing equilibrium with infinitely—lived individuals in the stan-

dard neoclassical growth model (e.g., Cass 1965 or Dixit 1976, p, 109), it

does appear to be allowed in certain overlapping—generations models,4 and

in models where private borrowing takes place at higher interest rates than

public borrowing, e.g., if private debt is inherently riskier as in Eaton (1981).

     It in any case seems desirable to supplement these theoretical considera-

tions with empirical evidence. Seater (1982) and Aschauer (1985), among others,

have tested the hypothesis that the present—value budget must be balanced jointly

with a permanent—income efficient—markets hypothesis, and accepted. Barro

(1984b) tested the hypothesis that the present—value budget must be balanced

jointly with the assumption that taxation and deficit policies have historically

been optimal, and again accepted. However, to our knowledge there has been no

direct empirical test of the present—value constraint itself,

     Such a test might at first glance seem straight—forward enough, The United

States government, for example, has run more or less a chronic deficit since
1930, suggesting that permanent deficits are quite feasible and practical,

However, this simple argument ignores the potential role of debt retirement

through monetization and capital gains on bonds or tangible assets through

inflation. It further provides no formal test of whether these deficits were

rationally anticipated, nor allowance for what might rationally be expected to

happen out of sample.

      In this paper we propose an empirical framework for testing the practical

limits to public borrowing which gets around these criticisms, We show that

the   proposition that the government can accumulate ever—growing debt through

perpetual deficit—financing is mathematically equivalent to the proposition

that prices can rise continually in a self—fulfilling speculative bubble.. Thus,

empirical tests which have been developed for the latter hypothesis may also

be fruitfully applied to study the limits of government borrowing,

      Section 2 provides a formal statement of the present—value constraint to

be tested. Section 3 briefly discusses some issues of data and measurement.

In Section 4 we present the results of alternative empirical tests of whether

the postwar record of budget deficits in the United States could be consistent

with the present—value constraint under rational expectations, with brief con-

clusions bffered in Section 5.


2. The present—value government borrowing constraint.

      In the light of the disparate concepts of the correct measurement of real

government indebtedness prevalent in the literature (e.g., Jump 1980, Buiter

1983, Barro l984a, and Eisner and Pieper 1984), it seems worthwhile to develop

from first principles the expression appropriate for the tests proposed in this

paper. One difficulty arises because at any time the public holds government
                                                    -4-


securities of a variety of terms and vintages. To understand the budget impli-

cations of capital gains and losses on these different issues, we allow each

dollar of debt potentially to have its own unique characteristics, Let the

integer J denote the nominal face value of interest—bearing government debt

at the end of period t, which we may think of as a collection of                different

$1 face—value bonds. Let                Ci =              denote the nominal market value

of the j'th (face value) dollar of debt, and e.                its coupon paid between dates

t—l and t. We further let Pt denote an aggregate price index for goods in the

economy and        the associated ax post real interest rate which is earned on

one—period government bonds during an average year, Finally we define
                                                                         v1 ,
to   be the real excess one—period holding yield of bond j relative to the average

earned on one—period bonds:

      Of course, not all       these   bonds are held by the public, and the quantity

held by the public will increase or decrease in part as they are sold or pur—

chased by the Federal Reserve, Suppose that at the end of period t—l the first

      bonds   are held by the Fed and the remaining j—1—_1 held by the public,

principle, equation (3) might be thought of as an accounting identity charac—

terizing open—market operations. As a practical issue however, we must append

the measurement error term u1, since open-market purch.ases near the beginning

of period t would actually take place at market prices closer to bji, and since

serious data difficulties arise in keeping track of the true market val-ue of

all the assets in the Fedts portfolio1

        Additionally, some number of new bonds (sayp J--J1) might be issued

during period t to cover any budget deficit, and these of course are likewise

Equation (8) and its implication (9) can not be a point of serious controversy,

for they do little more than summarize the equations of motion characterizing

monetary and fiscal policy. What is of economic interest (and subject in prin

ciple to empirical refutation) is what happens to the second term in (9) as N

gets large. This term registers whether the supply of bonds held by the public

grows faster on average than-the rate of interest. It accordingly reflects the

feasibility of the government running a permanent budget deficit, paying im'-
 terest on the growing debt load simply by Issuing new debt. In this paper we

 are therefore interested in testing

Buiter   (1984) calls (10) the "present value budget constraint," while West's

(1984) study of stock price volatility refers to a condition analogous to (10)

as the "transversality condition." Note that condition (10) does not imply that

"the national debt would eventually be paid off" (e.g., Dornbusch and Fischer,

1984, p. 525). In fact (10) is consistent with a constantly increasing stock

of debt, as long as the rate of increase is less thin the governments borrowing

rate. Rather, the question we pose is whether interest on this debt is to be

paid with future tax increases or instead with continual issue of new debt.

     If (10) represents the null hypothesis that the government budget must be

intertemporally balanced, how may we usefully frame the alternative possibility

that government deficits could continue forever? The answer to this question

is obtained by now solving equation (8)- backwards to get:

standing the limits of government borrowing, The next section discusses the

data on which such tests might be based, while section 4 suarizes our results,


3, Issues of data   and measurement,
     Eisner and Pieper (1984) and Barro (1984a) have shed substantial light on
the relation between officially reported budget figures and the appropriate
measures   of true economic interest, Here we briefly discuss how the theoreti-

cal magnitudes appearing in our        equation (13)   are related to the budget figures
                                                  —9--



 actually reported in the United States. Complete details on data sources and

 methods used in our study are available in a data appendix available from the

 authors on request.

         a. Interest payments.

         The theoretical measure of government spending (Ge) in the above deriva-

 tion excludes outlays for interest expenditures. Correcting the officially

 reported surplus (T —                 to exclude interest payments requires three steps
                                G)
 (1) Add to (T —               total interest payments (some $28..l g for fiscal year
                          G)
1974).     (2) For data prior to 1982, subtract back out that part of this Treasury

interest (some $6.6 B in FY 1974) that was paid directly into federal govern-

ment trust funds such as social security. (Prior to 1982, this sum was already

included as an expenditure offset in the officially reported surplus, and ac-

cordingly would be counted twice if we just added total reported interest pay-

ments to Tt —
                 Gt
                      .    After     1982, it has furthermore already been subtracted

before reporting the total interest figure, so just adding the reported inter-

est figure to Tt —             in   this case gives the correct measure.)   (3) Likewise

subtract the deposit of Federal Reserve earnings (some $4.8 B in F! 1974), which

again are already included in T under miscellaneous receipts. A sample cal-

culation is provided in Table 1, with details for each fiscal year in the data

appendix.

     Some debt is issued by various federal agencies in addition to that issued

by the Treasury. Outlays for the service of such debt are presently included

as expenditures of that agency, and should be subtracted from               to arrive at

our measure of G. Unfortunately, such data are not readily available, Since

agency debt is small (e.g., $12 B in 1974 compared with $475 B in Treasury

debt), little harm can come from assuiirL that the present value relation holds
                                         —10—


 for agency debt, in which case we could approximate the present value of later

 agency interest payments by the current market value of new agency debt issue,

 Thus, we subtract new issue of agency securities ($0.9 B in FY 1974) from

 and   do not count the market value of agency securities in our measure of public

 holdings of government debt, Bt.6


        b. Trust funds.

        In the unified budget system used in the US. since 1969 (and extended

retroactively to 1959), two separate accounts are maintained, Federal funds

are    general purpose revenues and programs,   Trust fuxds collect specified taxes

and    spend on specified programs such as social security,
        In FY 1974, the Federal funds deficit was $17,4 B, whereas the Trust funds
surplus was $14.0 B, The difference, —$3.4 B, is the deficit officially reported
for FY 1974, This is obviously the correct concept, and needs to be extended
to debt accounting    as veil, Treasury debt went up    from $457.3 B at the end of
FY 1973 to $474.2 B at the end of FY 1974,      but clearly this does not represent

an   equivalent increase in net government indebtedness, since most of these new
bonds were simply held by a different branch of the government. The correct
measure would subtract the stock of investments in government accounts ($140.2 B
at the end of FY 1974) from total Treasury debt,
       Some might argue that these Trust fund holdings are to be used against the
government's liabilities implied by future social security benefit payments.
It seems to us that this is an inaccurate interpretation, Such programs are not
a current liability in the sense that they can be associated     with any   concrete
number.    Rather, they represent the outcome of an uncertain political process,
                                      —1 1




and the correct way to represent this "liability" is by the discounted cash

flow of an entry on current account rather than any dubious imputation to capital

account. That is, we follow the official accounts in registering net social se-

curity inflows or outflows on the deficit account, and not as figures imputed

to the debt itself.

     c, Off—budget items.

     Starting in 1971, the activities of certain agencies such as the Postal

Service Fund and Rural Electrification and -Telephone Revolving Fund are charac—

terized as "off—budget."    Any deficits of such operations require the issue

of Treasury bonds, though they do not count in the officially measured deficit

of the U.S, government.

     Suppose that these funds were indeed primarily conveyors of sound loans.

Imagine the agency issuing a $1 loan financed through a $1 sale of Treasury bonds,

and so running an off—budget $1 deficit for that year. In the following year,

the agency receives $r as interest payments from the private sector, but the

Treasury pays $r back to the public as interest on the T—bond. For this year,

the official budget and off—budget items would accordingly sum to a zero net

deficit. Thus, a net intertemporal deficit would be measured if one combined

the official budget and off-budget items into a single account, whereas the oper-

ation itself is clearly fiscally neutral— the government issued a $1 Treasury

bond but acquired a $1 private bond, and has simply sqapped lika assets with

the public. A correct measure would be obtained in this case if we adopt our

convention of excluding Treasury interest payments from    and simply igiiore

the off—budget surplus or deficit altogether.
                                          —12—


       Of course, these programs are not pure market loans but in fact have a

substantial subsidy aspect. Our only justification for ignoring this is that

it is difficult to quantify and presumably small relative to the complete budget,

       d. Tangible assets,

      Eisner and Pieper (1984) have begun the difficult task of quantifying the

market   value of various tangible assets owned by the government,   The question

for   purposes   of the present study is, do government bond—holders believe that

future interest payments will really be met through sale of such assets rather

than by more conventional means such as tax revenues or debt retirement through

monetization? One's position on this question is perhaps a matter of taste

as much as anything else, Our own view is that with one important exception,

the promise of substantial liquidation of government tangible assets is not a

politically credible backing for U.S, Treasury debt, and should not realistically

be expected to substitute for future tax revenues or money seignorage.

      The one exception is the government's gold holdings, There is abundant

historical evidence that governments willingly draw down or deplete these stocks

in the wake of fiscal crises; this indeed is presumably the primary purpose of

holding such stocks in the first place, To see the budget implications of such

gold sales, let Au denote government's gold holdings in ounces, Au the price

per ounce of gold, and Bt the nominal market value of debt, all measured at the

beginning of period t. Let St denote the correctly measured surplus during

period t (excluding interest payments from spending but making no correction

for gold flows), and let i be the one—period interest rate, which for simpli-

city we assume is the same for all bonds, If at the end of period t the govern-

ment sells off some amount of gold (Au — Au÷i > 0) at price           and uses the
proceeds to retire debt, then next period's debt will be given by

                           —        —         —
        B+i =    (l+i)B        St       (AU       Au+i)P1
which can be written as


        (B+i —   PiAu+i)       =    (l+i)(B       —   PAuA) +       -   7r)P'Au          St

where
          Au_
            =
              Au
                 +l   —   Au Au         .   Thus, if we define true government indebted-
ness as the stock of Treasury debt held by the public less the current market

value of the government's gold holdings (i,e., as Bt — PAuAu)              the equation

governing the evolution of true government indebtedness is obtained by sub-

tract ing (i —     7r5P'Au         from the officially measured surplus
                                                                                  Ge).
(Note, however, that revenues should not include changes in the gold stock,

i.e., ignore Au+i —       Au   in calculating T

     For fiscal year 1974, gold prices increased by 1746%, whereas the nominal

interest rate on one—year government bonds was 7.56%. Based on a market value

of the government's gold holdings of $33.8 B, a sum of (.1716 — .0756) (33.8)

= $3.2 B should be added to the surplus for F? 1974 to represent capital gains

from gold.

     e. Money seignorage.

     When the Federal Reserve acquires a bond, future interest payments on that

bond accrue to the Fed and are counted as part of tax revenues under Misce1—

laneous Receipts" in the official budget, Since the present value of this tax

benefit is equal to the Fed's initial cost of the bond, seignorage is in this

sense theoretically already included in the budget. In practice, however,

any finite—sample estimate of the discounted value of these miscellaneous receipts

must be less than the discounted value of N . — N

                                         —14—


reason, we exclude deposits of Fed interest from our measure of Tt and include

the seignorage measure (N —
                                Mi),   where Mt denotes high-powered money (the

sum of currency in circulation plus reserves in member banks),

     f, Other adjustments.

     Painstaking calculations of the true market value of government debt,

based on actual market quotations of outstanding securities, have been provided

by Seater (1981) and Cox and Rirschhorn (1983) and updated by Cox (1985). At

the end of FY 1974, outstanding government debt was trading at a market value

of only 95% of its par value,

     We also need to subtract Federal Reserve assets from our measure of the

government debt. Since these are all carried on the books at par value, the

simplest way to construct the correct measure closer to market value of these

assets is from the liabilities side, namely, by sub tracting high—powered money

from outstanding government debt to get a measure of net interest—bearing debt

held by the public.

     Finally, the Treasury operating cash balance and market value of gold

holdings must be subtracted to arrive at the figure B appearing in equation

(8). Sample calculations for the 1974 deficit and debt are provided in Table 1,

Table 2 details the actual series used in the calculations to follow.




4. Empirical tests.

     We are interested in the question of whether the U.S, government's credi-

tors could rationally expect that the government budget would be balanced in

present—value terms. In the light of the discussion of section 2, we Inter-

pret this as the restriction A = 0 in the formulation
                                             —15--




      Be/Pt =      A(l+r)t + EtE(l+r)S+j +                                               (14)



where B/P       and S are the adjusted debt and surplus series reported in Table          2

and      is   a regression disturbance term reflecting expected changes in real
short—term interest rates, the term structure of long rates, and measurement
error.   The operator Et denotes the       expectations of creditors, which we assume
are formed rationally.
      Equation (14) is mathematically equivalent        to the model proposed by Flood

and Garber (1980) for studying self—fulfilling hyperinflations. However, Hamil-

ton and Whiteman (1984) expand on Flood and Garberts caution that their technique

implicitly imposes strong restrictions on        the   variables used by agents in form-

ing expectations Et or on the dynamics allowed for n, and note that a more general

test should first be considered8 which is more robust with respect to such

restrictions, In particular, for g           stationary   process for (nt, Et E (l+)S+.),
                                                                                      J
                                                                               j=l
when A = 0,     Bt/Pt will be stationary, whereas for A0 > 0,        Be/Pt will not be

stationary. We accordingly initially examine two simple tests.

      (1) Dickey—Fuller test for unit roots. Dickey and Fuller (1979, p. 431)

suggest the following test of the null hypothesis that a series z is nonsta—

tionary with unit roots. Estimate

      zt —z t—l    =   0

                                                 —z t—2 ) +et
by ordinary least squares, and calculate 01/a1 where CT1        is   the OLS standard

error for 0. The null hypothesis (nonstationarity) says this statistic should

be zero; the alternative (stationarity) says less than zero.

      Using the data in Table 2 we estimated the following equation by OLS for

The Dickey—Fuller test statistics are —2.92 in the case of the surplus and —2.82

in the case of debt, to be compared with a 5% critical value of —3,00 and 10%

value of —2.63 reported in Table 8.5.2., p. 373 of Fuller (1976). The data thus

favor rejection of the null hypothesis of nonstationarity in both cases; that

is, the data seem fully compatible with the assertion that investors rationally

expected the budget to be balanced in present value terms.

       (2) Generalized Flood—Garber test. If expectations of future surpluses

are conditioned in part on past surpluses and if we include lagged debt to elimi-

nate the serial correlation of the resulting error term, then equation (14) takes

the form

       Bt/Pt =    C+      A(i+r)t + c1(Bt i/Pi) + .,, +                           c(B/P)
                                                                 +
                      +

If one were willing to impose stronger restrictions on the dynamics                  of n and
on   the information set used by creditors, then one would want to estimate (15)

jointly with cross—equation restrictions on the process followed by S, as

in Flood and Garber's (1980) study of money demand, In the absence of such

restrictions, Hamilton and Whiteman (1984) show that the coefficients

are unrestricted, and a more general test of H is obtained by simple OLS9

estimation of (15):

We took r = 0.0112, the average ex post real rate over 1960—1984. This equa—

tion clearly yields no indication that govermuent debt tends to be growing at

rate r; the coefficient A is statistically insignificant, and, if anything,

negative in sign,

       (3) Restricted Flood—Garber test, The test actually used by Flood arid

Garber (1980) would b.e valid for our application only tinder the further restric—

tions that n follows a white noise process

           =   k +                                                                            (16)



and that creditors' expectations of future surpluses are hased solely on past

realizations of surpluses.1° A straight—forward manipulation of the formula

derived by Hansen and Sargent (1981, p. 99) yields that for

We estimated equations (17) and (19) jointly by nonlinear least squares for

t = 1963 to 1984, Parameter estimates and standard errors are summarized in

Table 3.

     As in the less restrictive tests above we note that there seems to be

no role whatever for the "bubble" term; A is statistically insignificant, andy

if anything, negative, The assumption that bond—holders rationally expected

the debt to be paid back in present value terms fits the data better than the

assumption that debt has simply accumulated with an ever—growing interest load,

Moreover, for these parameter estimates, equation (19) has an R2 of 0,53; that

is, more than half of the observed variance in the market value of real govern—

merit debt could be explained from a rational—expectations forecast of the dis-

counted value of future surpluses. Note such high explanatory power is achieved

despite the fact that all of the other parameters which characterize the dyna-

mics of outstanding debt in equation (19) are tied down by the univariate

process £ or surpluses (17), and such parameters appear in (19) only to the

extent that they could characterize rational—expectations forecasts of future

surpluses. The high R2 is also achieved despite the omission of all of the

additional variables besides past surpluses which would be used by agents

to forecast future surpluses,
                                                —l9-


       Of course, to achieve such a fit to the data, the regression is forced

to fit strongly negative coefficients in the autoregressive process for sur-

pluses at two— and three— year lags, as the values in Table 3 indicate.

Bond—holders must assume that big deficits typically only last a year or two,

and will     later he    balanced out with   surpluses.   There is indeed moderate sup-

port   for   this position even in a completely unconstrained OLS estimate of the

latter regression:


       St =    —0.30     + 0.62 st_i — 0.30 St2 —          0.20 St3

                (3,51)      (0.23)           (0.28)        (0,27)


The restricted rational—expectations estimates of Table 3 simply exaggerate

this feature in the data, Overall, then, the present value hypothesis seems

to hold up quite well.


5. Conclusions.

       In this paper we have examined the proposition that in order to be able

to issue interest—bearing debt, a government must promise to balance its bud—

get in expected present—value terms. We suggested a battery of empirical tests

of this proposition, some of which are quite robust with respect to assump-

tions about the dynamics of variables which are seen by agents but not the

econometrician, and others which are highly restrictive. The conclusion from

all our tests, however, is the same— the proposition that the government must

promise creditors that it will balance the budget in expected present—value

terms seems largely consistent with postwar U.S. data.

       This result might seem surprising since the official budget accounts

register essentially uninterrupted deficits for the United States from 1960

to 1981. However, the real value of government debt held by the public actually
                                      2O—

fell during this period, indicating that the continuing reported deficits

grosssly misstated the true fiscal posture of the government. We suggested

an alternative measure of the government deficit which takes into account

revenues from monetization and capital gains on gold but excludes interest

payments, From the time—series properties of this adjusted deficit series

one can construct a rational'-expectations forecast of the present value of

future government budget surpluses. Such a forecast series can account for

53% of the observed variance of real government debt under the assumption that

the government budget must be balanced in presentalue terms

     If our conclusion on the limitations of government borrowing is correct,

then the prevailing sentiment in Washington that current deficits can con-

tinue forever is wrong; the adjusted deficit series must soon turn to surplus,

One policy change which could turn the adjusted series to surplus would be

a resurgence of money growth.

                                           FOOTNOTES


     We are indebted to Charles Engel, Ron Michener, and John Taylor for help-

ful comments, and    to   Michael Cox for generously providing us with his data,

     11f government taxes (Tv), spending (Gt) and              debt    (Dr) are related by

            +                   =


then any proposal which changes taxes but leaves spending the same must be such

that the right—hand side of the above expression remains constant. Thus,                 per-
manent disposable income defined by Z (l+r)W,÷.L+. -ST+.) would be corn—
                                   =1        j
pletely unaffected by any such tax         policy,      See for example Barro (1984a, pp,

380—381) or Blanchard (1985) for additional details.


     2The more general case of a deficit financed by a mixture of money and

different—term bonds is analyzed formally below.

     3To take   a simple example,      let output Q(t) grow at the rate q (Q(t) =

Qt)        and let spending gQ(t) and taxes xQ(t) be fixed multiples of GNP. If

r is the cost of borrowing and D(t) is the debt, then debt accumulates accord—

ing to

     dD/dt =      (gx)0(t)   + rD(t)

implying

    D(t) = {D + tQ(g—x))e't                                        if q =      r
            =   {(g_)/(q_)}Q(t         —   ert) + Dert             otherwiae

whicb explodes relative to Qt whenever g >               x   and q <   r   ,




           example of this was provided by Carmichael (1982). See, however, the

discussion by Burbidge (1983, 1984) and Buiter and Carmichael (1984).
                                           —25—

         5Here we refer to the dollar flow of nominal interest payments made to

 the public divided by the aggregate price level, as distinct from the real user

cost of capital which would include capital gains (i.e., use the real interest

rate). We use the former interpretation because we are interested in the stock

of outstanding government debt, for which purpose the correct expression is the

cash—flow identity (4) governing debt accumulation.

     6To take a simple example, suppose that in year 1 spending exceeds taxes

by $1, with    the   shortfall made up by $1 issue of new agency debt. In all sub-

sequent years, interest spending is $r and taxes are correspondingly higher

by $r. In the accounts as actually reported, this policy would be associated

with a $1 deficit in year 1 and no surplus in subsequent years. In our proposed

measure, by contrast, the deficit is zero in all years! i.e., agency debt has

no effect on the present value calculation for Treasury debt, as it should not

in this case.

     7The Export—Import Bank was also originally off—budget, though the accounts

were later revised to reflect its current on—budget status,

     8Th stationarity test also forms the basis for Diba and Grossnian's (1984)

investigation of gold price behavior.
     9
         Flood and Garber rightly note in their footnote 18 on page 754 that cau-

tion must be exercised in interpreting the usual t—test in this application.

A related issue of course arises with our Dickey—Fuller tests; if (10) fails,

the nonstationary root is not unity as the Dickey-Fuller tests assume but rather

(1+r).

     1°The second assumption in particular is admittedly unrealistic, Indeed,

it can be shown that expectations must be based on additional information besides

St (namely, on the exogenous shocks to which the endogenous policy variable St
                                    —26—

responds) if equation (14) is to hold, because the forecast errors (E —
                                                                          Ei)S+.
satisfying (14) cannot be fundamental for S. It nevertheless seems of interest

to see how good an approximation one gets to the data by ignoring this difference

between the true forecasts of creditors (ES+.) and our econometric forecasts

(ES+.) based on a univariate autoregression for St.
