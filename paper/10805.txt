Estimating the Expected Marginal Rate of Substitution: Exploiting Idiosyncratic Risk

                                            ABSTRACT

This paper develops a simple but general methodology to estimate the expected intertemporal

marginal rate of substitution or "EMRS", using only data on asset prices and returns. Our empirical

strategy is general, and allows the EMRS to vary arbitrarily over time. A novel feature of our

technique is that it relies upon exploiting idiosyncratic risk, since theory dictates that idiosyncratic

shocks earn the EMRS. We apply our methodology to two different data sets: monthly data from

1994 through 2003, and daily data for 2003. Both data sets include assets from three different

markets: the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ, and the Toronto Stock Exchange. For both

monthly and daily frequencies, we find plausible estimates of EMRS with considerable precision and

time-series volatility. We then use these estimates to test for asset integration, both within and

between stock markets. We find that all three markets seem to be internally integrated in the sense

that different assets traded on a given market share the same EMRS. The technique is also powerful

enough to reject integration between the three stock markets, and between stock and money markets.

1 Introduction

            In this paper, we develop and apply a simple methodology to estimate the expected

intertemporal marginal rate of substitution (hereafter “EMRS”). We do this for two reasons.

First, it is of intrinsic interest. Second, when different series for the EMRS are estimated for

different markets, comparing these estimates provides a natural yet powerful test for integration

between markets. Our method is novel in that it exploits information in asset- idiosyncratic

shocks.

            While the primary objective of this paper is methodological, we illustrate our technique

by applying it to monthly and daily data covering firms from large American and Canadian stock

exchanges. Our method delivers plausible EMRS estimates with considerable precision.

Estimates from different markets can be distinguished from each other and from the Treasury bill

equivalent.

            Section 2 motivates our measurement by providing a number of macroeconomic

applications. We then present our methodology; implementation details are discussed in the

following section. Our empirical results are presented in section 5, while the paper ends with a

brief conclusion.



2 Why Should Macroeconomists Care About Asset Market Integration?

            We begin with a conventional intertemporal asset pricing condition:



          p tj = Et ( m t+1 x tj+1 )                                                           (1)




                                                  1
where: p tj is the price at time t of asset j, Et () is the expectations operator conditional on

information available at t, mt +1 is the time-varying intertemporal marginal rate of substitution

(MRS), used to discount income accruing in period t+1 (also known as the stochastic discount

factor, marginal utility growth, or pricing kernel), and xtj+1 is income received at t+1 by owners

of asset j at time t (the future value of the asset plus any dividends or other income).

        We adopt the standard definition of asset integration – two portfolios are said to be

integrated when they are priced by the same stochastic discount factor. Here “priced” means

that equation (1) holds for the assets in question. Equation (1) involves the moments of mt +1 and

xtj+1 , not the realized values of those variables. In particular, for integration we do not required

realized values of mt +1 to be equated across assets or agents pricing assets.

        Although many moments of mt +1 are involved in asset market integration, the object of

interest to us in this study is Et mt+1 the time t expectation of the intertemporal marginal rate of

substitution (EMRS). We concentrate on the first moment for three reasons. First, the

expectation of the MRS, Et mt +1 is intrinsically important; it lies at the heart of much

intertemporal macroeconomic and financial economics and is virtually the DNA of modern

aggregate economics. Second, it is simple to measure with high statistical accuracy. Third,

cross- market differenc es in estimated values of Et mt+1 are statistically distinguishable, providing

powerful evidence concerning market integration. 1 We are testing only for first- moment equality

when many additional moments are used in asset pricing; thus, ours it a test of a necessary

condition for integration. If we reject equality of the first moment, we can reject integration, but

failing to reject first-moment equality is consistent with (but does not imply) complete

integration.


                                                    2
2.1 Motivation

        Asset market integration is a topic of continuing interest in international finance, see e.g.,

Adam et. al. (2002). It is of special interest in Europe where continuing monetary and

institutional integration have lead to lower barriers to asset trade inside the EU. But there are a

number of compelling reasons why most policy-oriented macroeconomists should be interested

in asset market integration.

        When macroeconomic modeling was based on descriptive structure a generation ago,

market integration was not very relevant to macro. Modern macroeconomic models, however,

are usually built on the assumption that agents maximize an intertemporal utility function in a

stochastic setting (e.g., King and Rebelo 2000), and Clarida, Gali and Gertler, 1999). In such

macro models our equation (1) could be used to determine bond holdings and might look like:



           1            ρu ( c ) * qt
                  = Et ( c t +1           ).                                                    (2)
        (1 + it )       uc ( ct ) * qt +1



The corresponding equation to determine stock holding or to value firm revenues would be:



                    ρuc (ct +1) * qt
        pt = Et (                    * xt +1) .                                                 (3)
                    uc (ct ) * qt +1




In equations (2) and (3), 0 < ρ < 1 is a constant; u (ct ) is a concave period flow of utility function

with argument period t consumption and uc (ct ) is its partial derivative with respect to period t




                                                   3
consumption. The price level at time t is qt ; the one-period interest rate is it ; xt+1 and pt are the

aggregate counterparts to the symbols defined in equation (1).

        Equation (2) is the basis for the modern IS curve; equation (3) is an efficiency condition

for investment undertaken in period t. The point is that equations (2) and (3) both use the same

                                    ρ uc (ct+1 ,..)*qt
stochastic discount rate, mt +1 =                      , to evaluate short-term bonds (equation 2) and the
                                    uc ( ct ,..)* qt+1

payoffs from real productive assets (equation 3).

        In our terminology, modern macro models assume markets pricing bonds and real assets

to be integrated – both use the same stochastic discount rate. Asset market integration is a

transmission channel of monetary policy in these models. In policy models, monetary authorities

adjust (1 + it ) in response to the current and expected future state of the economy, see e.g.,

Clarida, Gali and Gertler (1999). One transmission mechanism has mt +1 adjusting in equation

(2) with the discount rate transmitting policy to other decisions, as in equation (3). Cross- market

and cross-decision equality of intertemporal discount rates is a substantive assumption. Testing

for asset market integration between stocks and bonds (which we do below) can be thought of as

a specification test for the modern IS curve.

        The IS curve is just one manifestation of asset market integration. Agents in many

modern macro models use the same intertemporal discount rate to evaluate all intertemporal

decisions – consuming vs. saving (the IS curve), enjoying leisure now vs. enjoying it later (the

labor supply schedule), investing savings in various assets, and so on. Because these models

typically use a single intertemporal discount rate, asset market integration is an essential

ingredient.




                                                     4
        In open economy work, e.g., Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000), capital market integration plays

an even more substantive role. It is present in all the ways of closed-economy models, plus it

plays a role in cross-currency and other international asset trading possibilities. Integration

manifests itself perhaps most clearly in pricing foreign-currency bonds. The foreign- currency

bond pricing condition is:



                           st+1 (1 + it* )
        1 = Et ( mt*+1 *                   ),                                                (4)
                                 st



where mt*+1 is the discount rate used to price foreign currency assets, st is the domestic-currency

price of foreign exchange, and it* is the foreign-currency interest rate. Another way to write

equation (4) is:



                              st +1(1 + it* )                 s (1 + it* )
        1 = COV (mt*+1,                       ) + Et mt*+1Et ( t +1        ).                (5)
                                    st                              st



When pricing of foreign-currency securities is integrated with pricing of domestic-currency

securities, Et mt*+1 = Et mt +1 = 1/(1 + i) and equation (5) becomes




                              st +1 (1 + it*) 1 + it*      s
        1 = COV (mt +1,                      )+        Et ( t+1 ) ,                          (6)
                                     st         1 + it      st



which is familiar from the work of Hodrick (1987). If, however, bond markets are not integrated

internationally, equation (5) becomes:


                                                                 5
                             st +1 (1 + i*t ) (1 + it* ) Et mt*+1      s
        1 = COVt ( m*t+1 ,                   )+                    Et ( t +1 ) .                                      (7)
                                    st          (1 + it ) Et mt +1      st




                                                   Et mt*+1
Without integration, the size of θ t =                      is uncertain and varies through time. Tests of
                                                   Et mt +1

                                                                        st+1 (1 + it* )
uncovered interest parity (UIP) set both COVt ( m*t+1,                                  ) = 0 and θ t = 1 , Hodrick (1987).
                                                                              st

                                                                                                        st +1(1 + it* )
When such tests reject UIP they are usually interpreted in terms of COV ( mt*+1 ,                                       ) being
                                                                                                              st

non-zero and correlated with interest rate regressors, but this need not be the whole story. For

instance, Alvarez, Atkeson, and Kehoe (2002) interpret the UIP puzzle as well as excess

volatility results using segmented asset markets, i.e., θ t ≠ 1 .

        There are clearly many reasons why macroeconomists (with either a domestic or

international focus) should be interested in asset integration.



3 Methodology

        Consider a standard decomposition of equation (1):



        p tj = Et ( mt+1 x tj+1 ) = COV t ( mt+1 , xtj+1 ) + Et (mt +1 ) Et ( x tj+1 ).                               (8)




where COVt () denotes the conditional covariance operator. It is useful to rewrite this as



        x tj+1 = −[1 / Et (m t +1 )]COV t ( mt +1 , x tj+1 ) + [1 / Et ( m t+1 )] ptj + ε t j+1 , or


                                                                  6
          xtj+1 = δ t ( ptj − COV t ( mt +1, xtj+1 )) + ε tj+1                                       (9)




where ε tj+1 ≡ xtj+1 − Et ( xtj+1 ) , a prediction error orthogonal to information at time t, and

δ t ≡ 1 / Et ( mt+1 ) . The latter time-series vector is the set of parameters of interest to us. In an

integrated market without trading frictions, it is identical for all assets, since the first moment of

the marginal rate of substitution should be equal inside integrated financial markets. Our work

below is essentially concerned with exploiting and testing this restriction.



3.1 Two Earlier Approaches to Parametric Estimation of Market Integration

         It is typical in domestic finance to make equation (9) stationary by dividing the equation

by p j, t , resulting in:




          xtj+1 / pt j = δt (1 − COVt ( mt +1 , xt+j 1 / ptj )) + ε t+j 1 ,                          (10)




where ε tj+1 is redefined appropriately. This normalization converts equation (9) into a traditional

asset-pricing equation. That is, it breaks one-period asset returns, xtj+1 / ptj , into the risk- free

market return, δ t ≡ 1 / Et ( mt+1 ) , and asset-specific period risk premia, the covariance term.

Equation (10) is given economic content by adding two assumptions:



         1) Rational Expectations: ε tj+1 is assumed to be uncorrelated with information

         available at time t, and




                                                                      7
        2) Covariance Model: COVt ( mt +1 , xtj+1 / ptj ) = β 0j + Σ i β i j f i, t , for the relevant

        sample,



where: β 0j is an asset-specific intercept, β i j is a set of I asset-specific factor coefficients and f i ,t

a vector of time-varying factors. Both assumptions are common in the literature; Campbell, Lo

and MacKinlay (1997) and Cochrane (2001) provide excellent discussions. With these two

assumptions, equation (10) becomes a panel estimating equation. Time-series variation is used

to estimate the asset-specific factor loadings {β } , coefficients that are constant across time.

Estimating these factor loadings is a key objective of this research program.

        In practice, many empirical asset pricing modelers set δ (t ) = 1+ i (t ) , where i (t ) is an

appropriate short-term riskless interest rate. 2 That is, the EMRS is simply equated with e.g., the

Treasury-bill rate; it is not estimated at all. While this simplifies empirical work considerably,

this assumes integration between stock and money markets, one of the very assumptions we wish

to test rather than make.

        The first approach to testing asset market integration between a pair of markets makes

one of the factors, say the first one, equal to a market ident ifier. This allows cross-sectional

estimation of a market-specific effect each period. For a set of risk factors that are held to price

assets in both markets, the market-specific effects should all be zero under the null of integration.

Rejecting the joint null hypothesis – but maintaining rational expectations – rejects either market

integration, or the risk pricing model (or both).

        Two points are essential to the first approach. First, it is based on the Finance standard

where the risk premium is postulated to be a function (usually linear) of a set of aggregate risks.




                                                         8
Second, the market integration test is tested as part of a joint hypothesis that includes the

aggregate risks that model risk premia.

         A second approach is provided by Flood and Rose (2003), who follow the spirit of Roll

and Ross (1980) in testing for market integration based on cross- market equality of δ t . Flood

and Rose differ slightly from the Finance standard and normalize by ptj−1 instead of ptj




         xtj+1 / ptj−1 = δ t (( ptj / ptj−1 ) − COVt ( mt+1 , xtj+1 / ptj−1 )) + ε t +j 1                    (10’)



In this equation, the factor loadings {β } (from the model used to proxy the covariance model)

can still be estimated. But in addition, cross-sectional variation can be used to estimate{δ } , the

coefficients of interest that represent the EMRS and are time varying but common to all assets.

Still, this approach – in common with the traditional approach that relies on (10) – requires

correct specification of COVt ( mt +1 , xtj+1 / ptj ) in the form of the factor model β 0j + Σ i β i j f i, t . If

the latter is mis-specified, the {δ } estimates will also be incorrect.

         The traditional finance approach allows one to estimate a covariance model and factor

loadings (betas) with precision, at the expense of precluding estimation of the EMRS (since it is

assumed to be the T-bill return). The second approach is oriented towards estimating the EMRS,

but still requires specification of a covariance model. We now continue further down this road

and develop a third approach which is even more geared towards estimating the EMRS; it does

not require any explicit covariance model specification.



3.2 A New Strategy




                                                                      9
        In this paper, we rely on a different normalization. Suppose we observe ~ptj , which is

defined to be the value of ptj conditional on idiosyncratic information (available at time t) being

set to zero. Consider the regression:



                                        N
        ln( pt / pt −1 ) = α 0 + ∑ α i f t + vt ,
              j    j          j       j i      j
                                                                                                       (11)
                                       i =1




where the f ti are a set of aggregate factors, e.g., the log of unity plus average price growth, and

vtj , the residual, is the idiosyncratic part of asset j price return. From the definition of ~
                                                                                              pt j ,



                                       N
         pt = pt −1 exp(α 0 + ∑ α i f t ) ,
         ~ j    j          j       j i
                                                                                                       (12)
                                       i =1




which is ptj with its idiosyncratic part set to zero.

        Normalizing by ~
                       pt j delivers:




         xtj+1 / ~
                 pt j = δ t [( ptj / ~ptj ) − COV t ( mt +1 , x tj+1 / ~
                                                                       p tj )] + ε tj+1 .              (13)




The first term inside the brackets, ( ptj / ~ptj ) , equals exp( vtj ) , which is a function of only

idiosyncratic information. The second term, COVt ( mt +1, xtj+1 / ~pt j ) is the covariance of the

unknown market discount rate, mt+1 , with the synthetic return, x tj+1 / ~pt j Similar to the risk

premium assumption in Finance, we assume COVt ( mt +1, xtj+1 / ~pt j ) moves only because of



                                                                       10
aggregate phenomena. Since idiosyncratic risk, ( ptj / ~ptj ) is orthogonal to systematic

risk, COVt ( mt +1, xtj+1 / ~pt j ) , (13) can be decomposed as




         xtj+1 / ~ptj = δ t ( ptj / ~ptj ) − δ tCOV t ( mt+1 , xtj+1 / ~
                                                                       ptj ) + ε tj+1 = δ t exp( vtj ) + u tj+1   (14)




where utj+1 ≡ ε tj+1 − δ tCOV t ( mt +1, xtj+1 / ~ptj ) . By design, both parts of the composite error term are

orthogonal to the only regressor, exp( vtj ) = ptj / ~ptj . The first part, ε tj+1 , is a forecasting error

which is unrelated to all information at time t by rational expectations. The second part,

COVt ( mt +1, xtj+1 / ~pt j ) is unaffected by any idiosyncratic phenomena. Since both terms are

orthogonal to the regressor that represents idiosyncratic risk, ( ptj / ~ptj ) , the coefficients of

interest, {δ } , can be consistently estimated via (14). A correct empirical specification of

COVt ( mt +1, xtj+1 / ~pt j ) would lead to more efficient estimation of {δ } . However, an empirical

specification of COVt ( mt +1, xtj+1 / ~pt j ) is unnecessary for consistent estimation.

        The basic idea of this study and the essential way it differs from previous work is that we

use asset- idiosyncratic shocks to identify and measure the expected marginal rate of substitution

(or rather, its inverse), {δ } . This stands typical Finance methodology – the first approach

discussed above – on its head. In traditional asset-pricing Finance, idiosyncratic risk is irrelevant

and orthogonal to the center-piece measures of aggregate risk. By their nature, idiosyncratic

risks are easy to insure against and hence carry no risk premium. While idiosyncratic shocks

carry no information about individual asset risk premia, they are loaded with information

relevant to market aggregates. Our test for asset market integration is simple; we check if the

implied prices of carrying idiosyncratic risks – measures of the expected marginal rate of


                                                                    11
substitution – are equal across portfolios. If equality of the estimated EMRS cannot be rejected,

then our test cannot reject cross-portfolio integration. If, however, we can reject equality then

we also reject integration.

        Our normalization has the advantage – in common with the strategy of Flood-Rose

(2003) – that it allows estimation of {δ } . However, it does not rely directly on a correctly

specified asset pricing model. That is, we do not explicitly rely on a model

of COVt ( mt +1, xtj+1 / ~pt j ) , (such as, e.g., the CAPM used by Bekaert and Harvey, 1995).

        The essential difference between our method and traditional methods is that we substitute

a representation of price movements plus an orthogonality condition, for a model

of COVt ( mt +1 , xtj+1 ) , which incorporates a similar orthogonality condition. The advantage of our

method is that it deals only with observable variables. The stochastic discount rate mt+1 is

unobservable as are its moments. When we project asset price movements onto a set of

aggregate factors, we are taking the same stand on relevant aggregates that others take when they

model COVt ( mt +1, xtj+1 ) . The advantage of our method is that it leaves a highly volatile regressor

– idiosyncratic shocks – attached to δ t = 1/ mt +1 .

        Our methodology has a number of other strengths. First, it is based on a general

intertemporal theoretical framework, unlike other measures of asset integration such as stock

market correlations (see the discussion in e.g., Adam et. al. 2002). Second, we do not need to

model the EMRS directly; we allow it to vary over time in a completely general fashion. Third,

the technique requires only accessible and reliable data on asset prices and returns. Fourth, the

methodology can be used at a full range of frequencies. Fifth, the technique can be used to

compare estimates of EMRS across many different classes of intertemporal decisions, including

saving decisions that involve domestic and foreign stocks, bonds, and commodities. Sixth, the


                                                    12
technique is easy to implement and can be applied with standard econometric packages; no

specialized software is required. Finally, the technique is focused on estimating an intrinsically

interesting object, the (inverse of the) expected marginal rate of substitution.



4 Empirical Implementation

        In practice ~
                    pt j is an unobservable variable. Thus, we use an observable statistical

counterpart derived from an empirical model, denoted p̂tj (we note that this induces

measurement error, an issue we handle below). We do this in a straightforward way, using

simple time-series regressions that link individual asset-price returns to the average. In

particular, we estimate the following J time series regressions via ordinary least squares (OLS):



        ln( ptj / p tj−1 ) = a j + b j * ln( pt / p t−1 ) + v tj                               (15)




where aj and bj are fixed regression coefficients, pt is the market-wide average price and vtj is

the time-t asset idiosyncratic shock. This equation has a natural and intuitive interpretation; it

models the first-difference of the natural logarithm of a particular asset price as a linear function

of the price growth of the market. Estimates of equation (15) allow us to produce the fitted value

of p̂tj , which we define as:




        pˆ tj ≡ p tj−1 * exp( aˆ j + bˆ j ln( p t / pt −1 ))                                   (16)




                                                                   13
       We are not particularly attached to this specific model of p̂tj . For instance, one could

employ the Kalman filter to avoid using future data and allow for moving coefficient estimates.

Alternatively one could add additional regressors to equation (15) to control for more aggregate

factors. 3 We have assumed that the log first-difference of prices is linear in the market; one

could change the particular functional form assumption. We have used a time-series approach to

estimating p̂tj but a cross-sectional approach is also possible. 4 None of these assumptions are

critical; they simply seem to work in practice. 5 But while this particular setup has delivered

sensible results, we stress that one only needs some model for p̂tj , not this precise one.



4.1 Estimation

       We are fundamentally interested in estimating {δ } from the following model:


        xtj+1 / pˆ tj = δ t ( ptj / pˆ tj ) + utj+1                                           (17)




for assets j=1,…,J, periods t=1,…,T. We allow {δ t } to vary arbitrarily period by period.

       Using p̂tj in place of the unobservable ~
                                               pt j might induce important measurement error.

Hence it is natural to consider estimation of equation (17) with instrumental variables (IV) for

consistent estimation of {δ t } . IV is also known to handle the “generated regressor” issue which

has long been known to be associated with potentially overstated precision of standard errors; see

Shanken (1992) and Cochrane (2001 and website correction). The latter show that this is not

typically very important in practice, especially for monthly data. While IV estimation seems

natural, estimation via the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) also allows us to handle

both potential econometric issues, while also not requiring independent and identically


                                                      14
distributed disturbances. Accordingly, we use and compare three different estimation

techniques: OLS (for simplicity), IV, and GMM. As instrumental variables for { p tj / pˆ tj } , we use

the set of time-varying market-wide average prices { pt } .



4.2 The Data Sets

       We employ two different data sets. The first is a decade of monthly data, spanning

1994M1 through 2003M12, while the second is a year of daily data for 2003. We use different

frequencies both for intrinsic interest and to check the sensitivity of our techniques. Though

these frequencies are standard in Finance, there is nothing special about them, and there is no

obvious reason why our methodology could not be used at either higher or lower frequencies.

We focus on stock markets, but again see no reason why bond and other markets could not be

considered.

       Our American stock data were extracted from the CRSP data base and consist of month-

end prices and returns (including dividends, if any) for all firms in the S&P 500 (as of the end of

2003). We have adjusted for stock splits, and checked and corrected the data for errors. We

only retain the 435 companies that have data for the full sample span (this selection does not

induce any bias that we can imagine). Since we are interested in estimating and comparing

implied EMRS across markets, we also include data from two other markets. First, we add

comparable data for the NASDAQ-100 firms, also taken from CRSP. Most S&P 500 firms are

traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and we avoid overlap (when we compare the

NYSE with the NASDAQ) by simply deleting from the S&P sample those firms traded on the

NASDAQ. Second, we add comparable data for the firms in the S&P/TSX Composite Index of




                                                 15
the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE). This data set is extracted from Datastream, and we convert

Canadian dollars into American using comparably timed exchange rates.

        For the monthly data set, we have 120 monthly observations on 389 firms from the S&P

500 traded on the NYSE, 65 different firms from the NASDAQ, and 152 firms from the TSE.

For the daily data set, we have data for 247 business days when both the Canadian and American

stock exchanges were open, on 440 NYSE firms, 99 NASDAQ firms, and 223 TSE firms.

        It has been traditional since at least Fama and MacBeth (1973) to use yields on short-

horizon treasury bills to proxy the risk- free rate, and it is natural for us to compare our estimates

of the expected risk-free rate with T-bill returns. We use data on T-bill returns downloaded from

the Federal Reserve’s website. 6

        Finally, for purposes of estimation, we group our stocks into portfolios, typically twenty.

We do this randomly (alphabetical order of ticker), though we see no reason why one could not

group firms on the basis of e.g., beta, size, or whatnot. We use portfolios partly to remain within

the Finance tradition followed since Fama and MacBeth (1973). But using portfolios also makes

our task more difficult, since portfolios have lower idiosyncratic risk and reduce cross-sectional

dimensionality. It turns out not to destroy our ability to estimate the parameters of interest to us,

though there is no obvious reason why individual securities could not be used in place of

portfolios.



5 Results

        The focus of this paper is estimating the expected marginal rate of substitution. We begin

with an illustration that relies on monthly data from 400 firms in the S&P 500, grouped into




                                                  16
portfolios of twenty firms. 7 We have 118 observations between February 1994 and November

2003, since we lose an observation at either end of the sample, due to leads/lags.

        The three graphs on the left of Figure 1 portray estimates of the EMRS from (17),

denoted {δˆt } . These were estimated using three different techniques: IV, GMM, and OLS, using

only the first ten portfolios. The mean of {δˆt } is plotted, along with a +/- 2 standard error

confidence interval band. The OLS and GMM point estimates are identical (by construction),

and are extremely highly correlated with the IV estimates. The primary differences between the

different estimates lie in the standard errors; all three estimators deliver small standard errors,

with the GMM standard errors being slightly smaller than those of either IV or OLS (but with

more period to period volatility). 8 Indeed, we almost never find significant differences between

the three estimators below, and thus tend to rely on IV below. 9

        Even though we estimate the expected MRS from only ten portfolios, the results seem

quite sensible. Most of the estimates of the (inverse of the) expected monthly MRS are just over

unity. The sample average of {δˆt } over the 118 periods is around 1.0085, implying an annual

MRS of slightly over 1.1 (=1.008512 ). While somewhat high compared to e.g., Treasury bill

returns, this figure is certainly plausible in magnitude. Further, the measures of EM RS are

estimated with precision; the confidence interval is barely distinguishable from the means in the

plots. Still, the most striking feature of the expected MRS is not its mean, but its volatility over

time. The standard deviation of {δˆt } is around .04 for all estimators, and the point estimates

vary over the decade between .88 and 1.09. This considerable volatility in the expected EMRS

mirrors our (2003) results as well as the famously high lower bound of Hansen-Jagannathan

(1991). 10




                                                  17
5.1 Integration within the S&P 500

       Do our results depend sensitively on the exact choice of portfolios chosen? An easy way

to check is to estimate {δˆt } using data from all twenty portfolios and look at the differences from

the ten-portfolio estimates. This is done on the right side of Figure 1, which graphs the mean and

confidence intervals of the expected MRS for the three estimators. In particular, the graphs on

the right portray the difference between {δˆt } estimated from all twenty portfolios, and {δˆt }

estimated from only the last ten portfolios. The differences are economically small; they average

around .003 (for all three estimators). They also have large standard errors (of around .011), so

that the differences do not appear to be statistically significant. In an integrated market, all

securities should deliver the same expected marginal rate of substitution. Figure 1 thus delivers

little evidence of significant departures from integration inside the S&P 500.

       The rows on the right of Figure 1 compare {δˆt } on a period by period basis for a given

estimator. That is, the figures implicitly ask whether the expected MRS for, say, February 1994,

is the same when estimated from all twenty portfolios and only from the last ten. This is

interesting because equality of {δˆt } derived from different assets is a necessary (but not

sufficient) condition for market integration. But it is also interesting to compare the entire set of

estimated EMRS simultaneously; that is, to test formally for joint equality. If the disturbances –

{uˆ tj } – were normally distributed, this test would be easy to compute via a standard F-test.

However and unsurpris ingly, there is massive evidence of non-normality in the form of fat tails

(leptokurtosis). 11 Accordingly, we estimate the distribution for our critical values with a

conventional bootstrap. With our bootstrapped results, we find the hypothesis of joint equality

{δˆt } for all 118 observations cannot be rejected at any conventional significance level (for any



                                                  18
estimator). That is, we cannot reject integration within the S&P 500. While this might only

indicate a lack of statistical power in our techniques, we show later on that it is easy to reject

equality of {δˆt } across substantively different markets.



5.2 Estimates of the Expected Marginal Rate of Substitution and Treasury Bills

        The hypothesis of equality of {δˆt } cannot be rejected when the twenty stock portfolios

are split up. But are the estimated EMRS similar to treasury-bill returns? No. It is easy to
                                                                            r
generate the risk-free rate using an actual interest rate; we simply create δ t ≡ (1 + i t ) where it is
                                                                     r
the monthly return on nominal treasury bills. The sample average of {δ t } is around 1.003

(around 3.7% annualized), somewhat lower than but close to the sample average of {δˆt } .

        But while the first moments of our estimated risk-free rate and the T-bill equivalent are

similar, the second moments are not. The T-bill rate has considerably lower time-series volatility
                                                    r
than our estimated EMRS. The standard deviation of {δ t } (across time) is .001, which is smaller

than that of {δˆt } by a factor of over thirty! Since the estimated risk-free rate is so much more

volatile than the T-bill equivalent, it is unsurprising that the hypothesis of equality between the

two can formally be rejected at any reasonable level of significance. 12

        To summarize, our estimates of the time- varying expectation of marginal rate of

substitution are intuitively plausible in magnitude, and precisely estimated. They also display

considerable volatility over time. While this variation is consistent with the literature, it is

grossly at odds with the smooth T-bill return. Unsurprisingly, we can reject equality between

our estimates of EMRS and those of the T-bill.




                                                   19
5.3 Other Markets

       What of different markets? Figure 2 provides estimates of the expected marginal rate of

substitution (along with a +/- 2 standard error confidence interval) derived from three different

markets: the NYSE, the NASDAQ, and the TSE. In each case, we use twenty portfolios to

estimate the expected risk-free rate. The number of available stocks differs by exchange; we use

portfolios of nineteen stocks each from the NYSE, but our NASDAQ portfolios contain only

three stocks, and those from the TSE have seven stocks. We estimate {δˆt } in the same way as

above, using instrumental variables for 118 observations between 1994M2 and 2003M11. To

facilitate comparison, we also graph the EMRS implicit in the short Treasury bill return.

       For all three markets, the average value of EMRS seems reasonable, being slightly over

unity. These are again estimated with considerable precision, even for the NASDAQ; the

confidence interval can hardly be distinguished from the mean. But again, the single most

striking feature of the estimates is their considerable time-series volatility. The standard

deviation (over time) of {δˆt } is .04 for both the NYSE and the TSE, and .07 for the NASDAQ.

While this is consistent with received wisdom in Finance (e.g., Hansen and Jagannathan, 1991),

it contrasts starkly with the smooth T-bill return portrayed at the bottom of Figure 2.

       Our results for the three markets are tolerable and consistent with our earlier findings.

Different estimators (OLS, GMM, and IV) deliver economically similar results which are

statistically close (Hausman tests sometimes reject equality and sometimes do not). There is

considerable leptokurtosis. And bootstrapped tests for internal integration indicate no evidence

that using e.g., ten NASDAQ portfolios delivers significantly different estimates of the expected

MRS from using all twenty NASDAQ portfolios. That is, we find no evidence against internal

integration for the three markets.



                                                 20
        We consider these results to be reassuring, given the depth and liquidity of the three

advanced stock markets we consider. But they might simply indicate a lack of power in our

statistical techniques; after all, they are simply not rejecting a necessary (but not sufficient) test

for market integration. Accordingly, as a more stringent test, we also now test formally for

integration across markets. This is also a subject of considerable intrinsic interest.

        We begin comparing the estimated risk- free rate across markets with a series of scatter-

plots in Figure 3. The top two graphs on the left of the Figure compare monthly estimates of

{δˆt } from the NASDAQ and the TSE (on the y-axis) against those derived from the NYSE (on

the x-axis). At the bottom- left, we also provide a comparable graph using the T-bill rate on the

ordinate. Clearly, the estimates of the expected MRS from the NASDAQ and TSE are correlated

with that from the NYSE; the correlation coefficients are .67 and .73 respectively. However they

are not identical; the mean absolute difference between the {δˆt } derived from the NYSE and the

NASDAQ is .04, and almost 10% are greater than .1 (the analogous figures for the TSE are .02

and 3% respectively).

        It is straightforward to formally test the hypothesis that the estimated EMRS are equal

across markets. One way to do this is to test for equality between the estimates graphed in

Figure 3. While this is perfectly acceptable (and the method we use for the daily results below),

we note that the portfolios used to estimate {δˆt } graphed in Figure 3 have different numbers of

stocks. Thus they have different degrees of estimation precision. To “balance the playing field”

we construct twenty portfolios NYSE with nineteen stocks each. We can then use simple Chow

tests to test for equality between {δˆt } derived from the twenty NYSE portfolios with those which

also use either the three NASDAQ portfolios (of nineteen stocks each), or the eight TSE

portfolios (again, of nineteen stocks). When we do so, we find strong evidence against


                                                   21
integration. The F-test for integration between the NYSE and the NASDAQ is over 13, strongly

rejecting the null hypothesis of integration (even allowing for non-normally distributed

disturbances that we explore through the bootstrap). The analogous F-test for integration

between the NYSE and the TSE is over 8, again inconsistent with the null hypothesis of equality

at all significance levels.

        Succinctly, while our estimates of the expected MRS are similar for the three different

markets, they are significantly different in both the economic and statistical senses. That is, we

are able to reject the hypothesis of equal EMRS across markets, and thus market integration.

This result is intrinsically interesting, since there are few obvious reasons for this market

segmentation. Moreover, they indicate that our methodology is not lacking in statistical power.



5.4 Daily Results

        Thus far, we have used a decade of monthly data. We now present results derived from

the most recent available year of daily data, 2003. We use closing rates for the 245 days when

both markets were open, converting Canadian dollar quotes from the TSE into American dollars

using a comparable exchange rate. We consider the same three markets, no ting in passing that

both the American and Canadian markets close at 4:00pm daily in the same time zone.

        Figure 4 is the daily analogue to the monthly estimates displayed in Figure 2. In

particular, we plot the mean of the expected MRS for all three markets, along with a +/- 2

standard error confidence interval (the T-bill equivalent is also plotted at the bottom of the

figure). We use IV as our estimator, though essentially nothing changes if we use OLS or GMM.

In each case, we present estimate {δˆt } using twenty portfolios; each NYSE portfolio has 22

stocks, each NASDAQ portfolio five, and each TSE portfolio eleven. 13



                                                 22
        As with the monthly data set, the means of the series again seem reasonable ; they are

1.001, 1.002 and 1.001 for the NYSE, NASDAQ and TSE respectively. These magnitudes seem

intuitively reasonable, if somewhat high; they are roughly comparable in order of magnitude to

the T-bill interest rate, which averaged just over 1% in 2003. The series of EMRS are also

estimated with considerable precision manifest in tight confidence intervals. There is again

evidence of leptokurtosis. Still, the most striking feature of all three series of the estimated MRS

is their volatility over time. This is especially true when one compares them with the virtually

flat T-bill return. It is little surprise then that the hypothesis that the daily estimates of {δˆt }
                                                                                    r
derived from S&P 500 stock prices are statistically far from the T-bill equivalent {δ t } .14

        When we check for internal integration within a market (such as S&P 500 stocks traded

on the NYSE) by comparing estimates of {δˆt } derived from different sets of portfolios, we are

unable to reject the hypothesis of equality at any reasonable confidence interval. That is, we

(unsurprisingly) find no evidence against integration within markets.

        However, as with the monthly data, integration across markets is another story. The

scatter-plots of the estimated daily EMRS at the right side of Figure 3 are analogous to those

with monthly data immediately to the left. Both the NASDAQ and the TSE deliver {δˆt } that are

positively correlated with those from the NYSE; the correlation coefficients are .86 and .69

respectively. The mean absolute differences between the series are around .006 (for both the

NASDAQ and the TSE compared to the NYSE), and range to over .02. While these may seem

small, they are economically large since they are at a daily frequency. In any case, the series are

statistically distinguishable. When we test for equality between the estimates of {δˆt } portrayed

in Figures 3/4, we find the hypothesis rejected for both the NYSE against the NASDAQ (the F-




                                                    23
test statistic is over 12) and the NYS E against the TSE (the test statistic is over 17).

Bootstrapping the critical values does not reverse these conclusions.

        In brief, our daily data set produces similar results to those of our monthly data set. The

estimates of the expected MRS seem intuitively reasonable, and display volatility consistent with

that in the literature, but far in excess of the T-bill. While we can never reject the hypothesis of

internal integration, we always reject the hypothesis of integration across markets in the sense of

equal EMRS.



6 Conclusion

        In this paper, we have developed a methodology for estimating the expected

intertemporal marginal rate of substitution. Our technique relies on exploiting the general fact

that idiosyncratic risk, which does not alter any risk premia, should deliver a return equal to the

market's expectation of the marginal rate of substitution. This enables us to estimate the

expected risk- free rate from equity price data, an object that is intrinsically interesting.

Comparing the rates estimated from different markets also provides a natural test for market

integration, since integrated markets should share a common expected MRS.

        We apply our methodology to a decade of monthly data and a year of daily data,

including data on stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ, and the

Toronto Stock Exchange. For both data sets, we find intuitive estimates of the expected

marginal rate of substitution with reasonable means and considerable volatility over time. We

cannot reject the hypothesis that markets are internally integrated in the sense that different

portfolios traded on a given market seem to have the same expected marginal rate of substitution.




                                                   24
However, we find it easy to reject the hypothesis of equal EMRS across markets. This is both of

direct interest, and indicates that our technique has considerable statistical power.

       There are many possible ways to extend our work. One could add a covariance model –

e.g., the well-known factor model first developed by Fama and French (1996) – to equation (14).

A well- specified covariance model should result in more efficient estimates of the EMRS.

Alternatively, one could sort stocks into portfolios in some systematic way (e.g., size, industry,

or beta). More factors could be added to the first stage regression, equation (15). More

generally, while our use of the ~
                                pt j normalization has advantages, others might be used instead.

Most importantly, while we have been able to reject the hypothesis of integration in the sense of

equal expected marginal rates of substitution across markets, we have not explained the reasons

for this finding of apparent market segmentation. If our result stands up to scrutiny, this

important task remains.

    In general, there is no guarantee that mt +1 is a unique variable; agents behaving according to equation (1) use the
entire perceived distribution of    mt+1 to price assets at t.

   We have experimented with additional regressors suggested by Fama and French (1996), and they seem to make
no difference to our results in practice.
4
   Indeed, we have experimented with a cross-sectional analogue to (15), and it delivers economically and
statistically similar estimates of {δ } .
5
   For instance, the median R2 from our twenty estimates of equation (15) is a respectable .77, and the lowest of the
twenty R2 s is still .59.
6
   In particular, we use closing secondary bid prices on three-month treasury bills for both daily data sets.
7
   These firms are traded mostly on the NYSE, but somewhat on the NASDAQ.
8
   One can compare the differences between the estimators with a Hausman test. In this case, the difference between
the OLS and IV estimators turns out to be economically small but marginally statistically significant; the hypothesis
of equality is rejected at the .006 confidence interval. Also, robust standard errors (either clustered by portfolio or
not) are typically even smaller.
9
   The exception is our bootstrapped tests for integration, where we tend to use OLS for computational simplicity.
10
    The estimates of EMRS have essentially no persistence and are also uncorrelated with traditional finance factors,
such as the three used by Fama and French (1996). Adding either an intercept or portfolio-specific intercepts to the
estimating equation (17) changes results little, which is unsurprising since the former are small and of marginal
significance; the same is basically true of time -specific intercepts. Finally, we have added the three time-varying
Fama-French factors to the first stage equation (15); this makes any substantial difference to our results.
11
    This is a well-known phenomena; see, e.g., Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay (1997).
12
    The F-test statistic for equality between the expected MRS and the T-bill return is over 50; under the null
hypothesis of market integration, it has degrees of freedom (118, 2360). Bootstrapping the critical values has no
substantive effect on conclusions.
13
    The exception is the last NASDAQ portfolio which only has four stocks.
14
    The F-test statistic for equality between the expected MRS and the t-bill return is over 150.
