            Productivity and R&D at the firm level in French Manufacturing



                                            ABSTRACT



            In a companion study to that of Griliches and Mairesse for the United
States, we have investigated the relationship between output, labor, and physi-
cal    and R&D capital during the 1972—1977 period for a sample of 182      R&D per-

forming firms    in the French nnufacturing industries. Our results are quite

comparable to those obtained for the U.S. The relationship between firm

productivity    and   R&D   appears both strong and robust in the cross—sectional
dimension of the data; it        is   less so in the time dimension. However, the
within—firm   estimates are still significant and of a likely order of nagnitude.

In this respect, they are more satisfactory than the U.S. ones. We show that

this    is largely due   to   a better measurement of the variables: (1) the fact that
we can use a value—added measure of output instead of sales (or equivalently

that we include naterials among the factors of the production function); (2) the

fact that we can correct the measures of labor, physical capital and output for

the double counting or expensing out of the labor, capital and materials com-

ponents of R&D expenditures.

Introduction

        Following Griliches and Mairesse's study for the United States (this

volume), we use a similar analysis to assess whether or not there exists a

significant relationship between R&D expenditures and productivity performance

at the firm level in French manufacturing. Our purpose is twofold: to check the

type of results obtained by Griliches and Mairesse on their U.S. sample of firms

doing R&D against a comparable sample of French firms and to set the stage for a

careful comparison of industrial productivity growth in the two countries. The

framework and data used are basically the same as in the U.S. study. We have,

however, the advantage of being able to use value added which iray be a more

appropriate measure of production than sales. Moreover, having detailed infor-

mation on R&D expenditures permits us to correct the measures of physical capi-

tal, labor, and production for the double counting or expensing out of R&D

labor, capital, or materials. One important drawback of our study is the

shorter period, 1972—77 as compared to 1966—77 in the U.S. study.

         On the whole, our main findings are quite close to the results obtained

by Griliches and Mairesse. We come up with similar discrepancies between

the total and within—firm estimates of the two parameters of main interest: the

elasticities of physical and R&D capital stocks, a and y, based on differences

across firms and changes over time, respectively. However, due to better

measures of the variables, the problem is much less serious than it could have

been, and on the whole our estimates are statistically significant and of a

likely order of magnitude.

         We describe our framework and data and present our main results in sec-

tion I. We document and discuss the changes in our estimates due to our

ixrroved measures of variables in section II. In both sections, we systemati-

cally refer to Griliches and Mairesse and stress the various comparative aspects

of the two studies.

I. Framework, Data and Main Results

     A. Framework

          Our basic nodel, as in Griliches and Mairesse, is the simple extended

Cobb—Douglas production function, which can be written in logarithmic form as

                         =   a +   A   t +   cx      +          +i   k1 +     et
or

     it — L±t)      = a + At +
                                   a(ct      —
                                                  £jt) + y(kt   —
                                                                     Lit)    + (P —      + et.
The subscripts i, t refer to the firm i and the current year t; e is the error

term in the equation; v, c, P., and k stand for production (value added), phys-

ical capital, labor, and R&D capital, respectively; a, , and y are the

parameters (elasticities) of interest; p = a +                      +y      is the coefficient of

returns to scale; and A is the rate of disembodied technical change.

          We follow the common practice in analyses of panel data by assuming

that the error term           is composed of two components: a permanent effect

specific to the firm u. and a transitory effect w. Such a decomposition

generates two types of estimates, which can be viewed as providing cross—

sectional and time—series estimates, respectively: the between—firm estimates

based on the firm—means y. and the within—firm estimates based on the

deviations of the observations from the firm—means (y.— y.). The between—firm

estimates are not affected by the biases due to possible correlations between the

explanatory variables with the wts (at least in a long enough sample), while

the within—firm estimates are not affected by correlations with the u's.

Both estimates should be consistent under the assumption of uncorrelated errors,

while significant differences between them imply some sort of ndel misspecif i—

cation. The least squares estimates based on the original observations y,, the

total estimates, differ very little from the between—firm estimates, since

most of the variability in our data comes from the between—firm dimension rather
                                      —3—


than from the within—firm dimension. Therefore, as in the U.S. paper, we

shall report only on the total estimates and the within—firm estimates, and not

also on the between—firm ones.


B. Data

          Our sample is based primarily on the match of two different data

sources: INSEE provided us with balance sheet and current account figures (from

the SUSE files) while the Ministry of Research and Industry (DGRST and STISI)

provided the R&D information (from the annual survey on company R&D expendi-

tures). The size of the sample is larger than that of the U.S. sample: 182 firms

against 133 for the complete U.S. sample, or 103 for the U.S. sample that is

restricted to nonmerger firms.   The study period, however, is much shorter:

from 1972 to 1977, as compared with of 1966 to 1977 for the U.S. samples.

          Like the U.S. sample, ours is very heterogeneous. This led us to

divide it into two subsamples: so—called scientific firms belonging to the

R&D intensive industries: chemicals, drugs, electronics and electrical equip-

ment; and other firms belonging to the other manufacturing industries.

          Our variables are defined and measured on a basis similar to Griliches

and Mairesse; however, we have taken advantage of the additional information we

had on materials and on the components of R&D expenditures. We measure

production by deflated value—added V rather than by deflated sales. We also

correct our value—added variable by adding back the materials consumption com-

ponent of R&D expenditures, which is normally expensed out in current accounts.

Labor L is measured by the number of employees, physical capital stock C by

gross—plant adjusted for inflation, and R&D capital stock K by the weighted sum

of past R&D expenditures using a constant rate of obsolescence of 15 percent per
                                      -

year.   Both our labor and physical capital stock variables are corrected for

the double counting of R&D already included in the R&D capital stock variable.

The available number of' R&D employees is thus simply substracted from the total

number of employees, while the part of physical capital stock used in R&D is

computed on the basis of the average ratio of the physical investment component

of R&D expenditures to total R&D expenditures and is likewise substracted.

          Detailed information on the sample and the variables is given in Appen-

dix A; see in particular Appendix Tables Al and A2 which are comparable to the

corresponding ones in the U.S. study. The much more rapid productivity growth

and higher R&D intensiveness of the scientific firms subsample (than for the

other firms subsample) are remarkable in both countries. Since our study period

is shorter, the within—firm variability is even a smaller proportion of the

total variability (about 1 percent for levels, and 5 to 10 percent for ratios)

than is the case in the U.S. sample. Note also that the French firms are much

smaller in size than their U.S. counterparts: an average of 1500 employees in

French firms as against 10,000 employees in U.S. firms.


C. Main Results

          Our main results are presented in Table 1, again in a format com-

parable to the U.S. study: total and within—firm estimates of the production

function with and without R&D capital stock, assuming or not assuming constant

returns to scale, for all firms and for the scientific and other firms sepa-

rately.

          The total estimates are quite satisfactory on the whole. The elasti-

city of' physical capital x is perhaps somewhat too low but still of a likely

order of magnitude: about .20. In contrast, the elasticity of R&D capital
                                      —5—




y   may be too high: about .20 for the scientific firms and .10 for the other

firms. The returns to scale are not significantly different from unity. As

could be expected from the average rates of productivity growth over our study

period, the rate of disembodied technical change is quite high (3 percent) for

the scientific firms, while it is actually negative (minus 2 percent) for the

other firms.

         The within—firm estimates tend to differ from the total ones, although

not as nich as in the U.S. study. When assuming constant returns to scale,

both types of estimates are actually quite close, the only significant dis-

crepancy being the higher within—firm estimate of a for the other firms. How-

ever, when we relax this assumption, just as in the U.S. case, we obtain lower

estimates of a and y with rather implausible decreasing returns to scale

estimates.


II. Further    Results
      A. Value Added versus Sales

          The use of gross output or sales S instead of value added, or, alter-

natively, the omission of materials M among the factors in the production func-

tion is one of the possible misspecifications and sources of bias stressed by

Griliches and Mairesse. We are able to check with our data whether or not this

makes a real difference. Table 2 gives the results of such comparisons for the

scientific and other firms separately. The estimates on the first three lines

are comparable to those in Table 1, except that we use sales instead of value

added to measure output. In the estimates on the fourth line, nterials are
included as another factor of the Cobb—Douglas production function (with an

elasticity o).
         The Griliches and Mairesse conjectures are verified by and large.

The total estimates using sales and omitting materials do not differ much from

those obtained with value added: the elasticity of R&D capital y is practi-

cally unaffected, and returns to scale remain constant; however, the elasticity

of physical capital a tends to be significantly higher. When materials are

included, we find a plausible total estimate of the elasticity of materials 6

of .5, while the estimate of the elasticities of physical and R—D capital

a and y are multiplied approximately by a factor of (1—6) ' .5 as expected.

The within—firm estimates with sales instead of value added also are similar

when we impose constant returns to scale. However, if we do not, large discre-

pancies occur; we get even more sharply decreasing returns to scale (.5 instead

of .75), while the estimate of y collapses for the scientific firms (.03) and

also that of a for the other firms (.o). When materials are taken into

account, the within—firm estimates are much improved; they become coherent again

with the within—firm estimates obtained using value added (granted the multi-

plicative factor l-) as well as closer to the total estimates.

           Our results confirm that the omission of materials in the sales spe-

cification affects especially the within—firm estimates, which is related to the

fact that in the short—run materials usage varies much less than proportionally

with changes in output and other inputs. The value—added specification has the

advantage of being largely immune to such problems (implying in a sense that out-

put and materials vary proportionally). It is clear, however, that the sales spe—

cification duly including materials and the value—added specification both suffer

from other problems since they still give rise to estimates of large decreasing

returns to scale in the within—firm dimension. One possible explanation is the

disregard for the simultaneity in the determination of output and labor, and
                                                      —T—



also materials. Griliches and Mairesse have investigated this second possibi-

lity by estimating what they call the seraireduced—form model, and we consider it

too.




B. Semi—Reduced Form Estimates Versus Production Function Estimates

         If we assume with Griliches and Mairesse that firms maximize their

short—run profits and are price—takers on competitive markets, and if we lump

together the unobserved factor price variables with the errors in the equations,

we derive a "semi—reduced form model" expressing the relationship between the

endogenous output and labor variables only in terms of the predetermined physi-

cal and R&D capital stocks. Using value added and omitting materials (and

ignoring also constants, time trends or year dummies), we get:



                   a'c +       y'kt + ej
(I)


               =
                   cx'c.   +
                               y'k1t   +
                                           et

where a' =   a/(i   —   ) and y'       =   y/(l   —




         If   we use sales rather than value added and include materials as

another variable factor, we have the same two equations for output and labor

(with sales instead of value added) and a parallel third equation for materials:
                                                       —8—




                   = a'c + y'kt + elt


(II)       £jt =       cz'ct    +
                                    -y'kt    +
                                                 et

                   =
                       a'c + y'k + e
where ci' =              —     — 6) and y' =        o/(i   —   — 6)


Note that if this last system of equations holds, it implies that materials vary

proportionally to sales, and hence that the value—added equation of the first

system and the first system itself will also be verified. That is the elastici-

ties for value added a,                   and y will be equal to the corresponding ones for

sales iltiplied by 1/(1 —                 6),    and the reduced—form coefficients in the first

system a/(i —      ,)    and y/(i —        ) will     be equal to the ones in the second system

a/(l -      - 6)   and y/(l -             - 6)
           Unconstrained and constrained total and within—firm estimates of the

two semi—reduced form models using value added or sales are given in Table 3 for

the scientific and the other firms separately. The corresponding estimates,

a' and y', in the various equations are rather close. Although most differ-

ences appear statistically significant given the large number of observations,

constraining the coefficients to be equal entails only a very small loss of fit.

The within—firm estimates of the materials equation are the most out of line,

and also the poorest looking ones. All other estimates (i.e. the within—firm

estimates of       the    other equations, and the total estimates of all the equations)

are    coherent enough with the direct estimates of the production function
(given in tables 1           and    2).
                                       —9—



           The total estimates of the research capital coefficient y' are all

very significant and large; compared to the estimates of the physical capital

coefficient a', they indicate that the relative magnitude of the two capital

elasticities y/o.(= y'/a') is about two—thirds for the scientific firms and one—

third for the other firms. This is somewhat small but also more reasonable than

what we get from the direct estimates. Taking for example the true elasticity

of labor     to be .6 in terms of value added, we obtain indeed very sensible num-

bers for a and y: respectively .22 and .13 for the scientific firms, and .26

and .09 for the other firms.

           The within—firm estimates of the research and physical capital coeffi-

cients are cich smaller than the corresponding total estimates, and they also indi-

cate a smaller relative magnitude for the research capital elasticity: about 30

to 40 percent for the scientific firms and 15 to 20 percent for the other firms.

Thus, the absolute size of the within—firm estimates is also a problem for the

semi—reduced form xxdel and the discrepancy between these estimates and the

total estimates remains. The fact that the estimated sum (a +    i)/(l   —   )   is

only about .4 to .5 in the within—firm dimension, while it is about .9 in the

total dimension, is the equivalent of the finding of decreasing returns to scale

for the production function within—firm estimates compared to the finding of

nearly constant returns to scale in the total estimates. The same pattern is

also observed in the U.S. study, but to a lesser extent: the semi—reduced form

within—firm estimates are much better looking than the production function

within—firm estimates.

           On the whole, the semi—reduced form estimates do confirm the direct

production function estimates, but, contrary to what could be hoped, they do not
                                     —10—




constitute a major improvement. Clearly the simultaneity between output and

labor is only one source of trouble. There are other problems which may affect

both types of estimates. The omission of labor and capital intensity of utiliza-

tion variables (such as hours of work per employee) in the production function

considered by Griliches and Mairesse is presumably a very important one. The

failure of the assumption of competitive markets and errors in the variables are

two other possibilities also suggested by them. In what follows we are able to

show that the measurement problem of the double counting of R&D matters a lot.



C. Correcting for The Double Counting of R&D

         The Griliches and Mairesse's study, as well as the other studies of the

contribution of R&D to productivity, suffers from the fact that R&D labor and

physical capital are normally counted twice, once in the available measures of

labor and physical capital and again in the measure of R&D capital stock. When

a value—added measure is used for output, it also suffers from the fact that R&D

expenditures (due to special fiscal rules in favor of R&D spending), are treated

as intermediate inputs and are expensed out. This is true for materials used in

R&D activities in France and for all R&D expenditures in the U.S. These pro—

bleras are generally overlooked for lack of information to make the necessary

adjustments. At best it is considered that the marginal product or rate of

return p, which derives from the estimated elasticity of R&D y in the produc-

tion function, should be interpreted as the "net rate of return to R&D above and

beyond its normal remuneration" (Griliches 1979). For our sample of firms, we

can illustrate the importance of correcting the different variables for the

double counting of R&D and we can verify the excess return interpretation. We
                                         —11—




find that such interpretation is roughly valid for the total (or between—firm)

estimates in the cross—sectional dimension of the data, but not for the within—

firm estimates in the time dimension of the data. Both types of estimates are

biased downward in the absence of correction, but in a rather untypical fashion

the total   estimates are much more affected than the within—firm estimates.
We document these findings in Table       we also attempt to rationalize them in

Appendix B.

           Following Schankerman (1981), the biases due to R&D double counting and

expensing out can be analyzed in terms of the following omitted variables in the

production function: (v'—v), —c(c'—c) and —(.'—), where (v'—v), (c'—c) and

        are the log differences of the uncorrected and corrected measures of

value added, physical capital and labor. These three corrections are approxi-

mately —3, 5 and 10 percent respectively in our sample of scientific firms and

—1, 1, and 3 percent for the other firms. Using the appropriate auxilliary

regressions, the overall biases (i.e. the differences between the estimates

based on   the uncc'rrected and corrected measures) can be decomposed into three
components corresponding to the three corrections for R&D materials, capital,
and labor. Table       gives the overall biases and their components for the scien-

tific and other firms separately. These numbers correspond to the estimates we

get when we impose constant returns to scale; but they are practically unchanged

if we do not.

           In   spite of the limited magnitude of our corrections for R—D double
counting, the overall biases in the estimated elasticity of R&D capital y     are

quite   sizeable. On the other hand, the biases in the estimates of the
                                      —12—




elasticity of physical capital   (and also of A and ,   or     are relatively

small. The total estimates of y are increased from about .10 to .20 (a

doubling) and from .09 to .12 for the scientific and other firms respectively,

while the within-firm estimates rise from .17 to .23 and .06 to .08 respec-

tively. The discrepancy between the within—firm and total estimates for the

scientific firms thus nearly vanishes. It is interesting to note that all three

y—bias components are always negative and that they tend to be larger when the

corresponding corrections are nre substantial, i.e. for the scientific firms

compared to the other firms and for the R&D labor correction compared to the

other two.

                             Summary and Conclusion



         In a companion study to that of Griliches and Mairesse for the United

States, we have investigated the relationship between output, labor, and physi-

cal and R&D capital during the 1912—1911 period for a sample of 182 R&D per-

forming firms in the French manufacturing industries. Our results are quite

comparable to those obtained for the U.S. The relationship between firm

productivity and R&D appears both strong and robust in the cross—sectional

dimension of the data; it is less so in the time dimension. However, the

within—firm estimates are still significant and of a likely order of magnitude.

In this respect, they are nre satisfactory than the U.S. ones. We show that

this is largely due to a better measurement of the variables: (1) the fact that

we can use a value—added nasure of output instead of sales (or equivalently

that we include materials among the factors of the production function); (2) the

fact that we can correct the measures of labor, pbysical capital and output for

the double counting or expensing out of the labor, capital and materials com-

ponents of R&D expenditures. As in the U.S. study, the "semi—reduced form"

estimates which allow for simultaneity in the determination of output, labor and

also materials agree with the production function direct estimates and confirm

the importance of R&D capital relative to pbysical capital. However, both spe-

cifications yield rather implausible decreasing returns to scale estimates in

the within—firm dimension. This is a pervasive problem in this type of work

which needs to be solved before we   shall   be able to reconcile our cross—

sectional and time—series results completely.

*The estimates of the biases due to R&D materials, capital and labor are the estimates of the auxilliary regressions
 on (v'—v), (c'—c) and (i.'—) respectively multiplied by 1, —a and —8, where                   cx
                                                                                and 8 are taken as the unbiased esti-
 mates from the production function using the corrected asiires (i.e. the estimates in Table i). The corresponding
 R2 and nan square errors (MSE) are those of the auxilUary regressions. These numbers are given in the case of the
 production function with constant retirns to scale; they are practically unchanged, however, if we do not impose this
 restriction, and the biases in the estimated returns to scale themselves are negligible.

                                    APPENDIX A



               Additional Information on the Sample, the Variables,


                              and Various Experiments



           The construction of our sample is quite similar to that of the U.S.

sample by Griliches and Mairesse. Based on the two—digit French NAP and U.S.

SIC classification, the definition of the group of scientific firms is the same

in the two countries; however, we do not have firms in the computer and instru-

ments industries in the French sample.        We preferred to exclude from our sample

the firms belonging to the air—crafts, boats and space vehicles industry (10 of

them); this is an extremely R&D intensive industry (with an average R&D to

value—added ratio of 35 percent) but most of it is public financed (about 80

percent) contrary to the other R—D intensive industries. The group of other

firms in the U.S. include some nonmanufacturing companies, and also petroleum

ref ining or food processing companies, which we have not considered as part of

manufacturing in constructing our sample. As it is, the French sample accounts

for nearly one half of the total R&D expenditures performed by French firms,

while the similar ratio is about one—third for the U.S. sample.

          Actually, our sample is rrre comparable to the U.S. restricted sample,

since we removed about 25 "merger firms" (or firms which we assumed to be such

because they showed large jumps of more than 100 percent increase or 50 percent

decrease in gross plant, sales and/or number of employees). Since our study

period covered only six years, it   was not   possible for us   to   deal with such

firms   by distinguishing "premerger" and "postmerger" firms.
                                    —20—



        Our value—added measure is at "factor costs", that is after deduction

of the value—added tax and it is adjusted for inventory changes. Materials

are taken simply as total purchases. Computing a proxy for value added as sales

minus purchases changed only slightly our within estimates. We have deflated

value added, sales and materials by the relevant national account industry price

indices (at the two—digit classification level). Using the gross output price

indices (rather than the value—added ones) to deflate value added did not change

our estimates.

         In our data, the numbers of employees are generally given at the end of

the year and not computed as yearly averages which is the case for the U.S.

data. We used, therefore, the beginning of the year numbers (i.e. the lagged

numbers), as is also done for the capital stock measures. Taking the end of

year number of employees tended to deteriorate our within estimates.    This is

another indication that simultaneity between employment and output is one of the

sources of discrepancy between the total and within estimates.

         The adjustment for inflation of the gross plant book value is made on

the basis of an estimated average age of capital and an assumed average ser-

vice life of 16 years. The average age of capital is derived from the ratio of

net plant to gross plant, this ratio being itself corrected to take into account

that the fiscal lengths of life used to compute depreciation in France are nch

shorter than the actual service lives.     Experiments using gross plant adjusted

for inflation in various ways, or even without any adjustment, made only very

little differences to our estimates, as was also the case in the U.S. study.

         We have been able to obtain the (internal) R&D expenditures before 1972

and back to 1963 for most of the firms in our sample, by consulting original
                                      —21—




listings of the first R&D surveys. Our R&D capital stock measures are thus

constructed from the past R&D flows for a long enough presample period (at least

9 years). Again as in the U.S. study, alternative measures assuming 0 or 30

percent rate of obsolescence per year instead of 15 percent, or using quite dif-

ferent initial conditions in 1963, had only minor effects on the estimates and

the quality of the fit.

         In addition to information on the materials, wages and physical invest-

ment components of total R&D expenditures (and the number of R&D employees),

which we used to correct our measures of value added, physical capital and labor

for R&D expensing out and double counting, different definitions and measures

of R&D are available: total expenditures (whether they are financed by the firm

or not), expenditures financed by the firm itself (this is the sole measure

available in the U.S. study), and internal expenditures spent inside the firm

(this is the measure we have preferred, since we could obtain it before 1972).

We have also the distinction between development, applied and basic research

expenditures. Experiments with R&D   captial   stock constructed from these various

measures yielded basically the same results. Further detailed attempts to

investigate differences in the efficiency of company financed and public

financed R&D or development, applied, and basic R&D did not prove very success-

ful. At best there is some indication of positive composition and interaction

effects of the sort found by Mansfield (this volume). Public financed R&D

appears to be less productive per se than company—financed R&D, but it appears

also to enhance the productivity of the latter significantly. Similarly, basic

research, though it may not be as directly productive, interacts positively with

applied research and development.
                                     —22--




        Finally and following the example of the first studies by Terleckyj, we

have considered the number of R&D employees as a proxy for the R&D capital stock

in the production function. The total estimates are practically unaffected,

but the within estimates became nich poorer: the estimated y is about halved

for the scientific firms and is not anymore significant for the other firms.

         For details on all these different experiments, the reader is referred

to the Cuneo thesis (1982). Table Al indicates our sample composition and size

at the two—digit industry level; it gives also the average labor productivity

growth rate and the average R&D value—added ratio over our study period 1972—77.

TableA2 lists the (geometric) means, (logarithmic) standard deviations,

(logarithmic) between and within—firm decomposition of' variance, and the

average rates of growth of our major variables, separately for the scientific

and other firms.

               R&D Double Counting and the Excess Return Interpretation


           In a recently published article (1981), Schankerman pointed out

forcefully and analysed explicitly the importance of R&D double counting and

expensing in measuring the returns to R&D. Using a large cross—section sample

of firms (already investigated by Griliches, 1980), he was able to show that the

resulting biases could indeed be quite large. He also made the point that the

excess return interpretation, even though it happened to be roughly verified in

his particular sample, should be considered as "conceptually incorrect". Using

our sample we can provide another striking illustration of the importance of

such R&D double counting biases, particularly in the cross—sectional dimension

(between or total estimates) and less so in the time dimension (within—firm

estimates). We find also that       the   excess return interpretation is not too far

off, at least for our total estimates. If              and     are the marginal products

      +   a(K/C)   .   For the scientific firms, we can take a and y to be .25 and

.20 (total estimates with corrected measures), and y to be .10 (total estimate

with uncorrected measures), implying that K/C should be around .4,            which     is

about the actual order of magnitude. The same is also roughly true for the

other firms.

           It is not by mere chance that the excess return interpretion is, in

fact, roughly valid, and Schankerman's analysis must be           qualified   in this

respect. It is easy to see intuitively why          such   interpretation might apply to

a certain degree of approximation. Schankermants analysis in terms of biases due

to omitted corrections, although quite right, tends to obscure the matter. The

question is one of functional form, log—linear rather than linear, as much as

one of xn±sraeasurement.                  If we consider only the issue of double counting R&D

labor and capital (and ignore that of expensing out R&D materials), and if we

assume a linear production function (instead of the Cobb—Douglas function), the

excess      return interpretation becomes quite intuitive. Assuming a linear for-
mulation we must be more careful about the "units" of nasurement of our
variables. Define C, L                    and K as the true service flows of physical capital,

labor      and R&D capital in value              units, and suppose       K is made of R&D labor Lr and
R&D   physical capital Cr i.e. K = L                   +   C   ,   then the true equation and the estimated
one are respectively:

      =       i(C/K)p               + (L /K)P&] is the rate of return of R&D capital in excess

of the "normal remuneration" of its labor and physical capital components. One

will      actually estimate the excess rate of return                           if   the variation in (Cr/K)

and       (L/K)   is small relative to that of K. This seems reasonable enough across

firms of widely different sizes, i.e. in the cross—sectional dimension, for the

total estimates. However, for a given firm over time the relative stability of

(Cr/C) and (L/L) may seem as plausible as that of (Cr/K) and (L/K). If this

is really so, whether one used the corrected or uncorrected ireasures of the

variables, one would estimate the rate of return                            itself in the time dimen-

sion, i.e. for the within—firm estimates.
