        The relationship between unions and earnings dispersion is examined using establishment-
level data from the 1980, 1984 and 1990 Workplace Industial Relations Surveys. Initially the
cross-sectional relationship is examined using the 1990 data. The earnings dispersion of skilled
and semi-skilled workers is seen to be lower across unionised establishments than across non-
union establishments; secondly, within-establishment earnings dispersion is lower in plants which
recognise trade unions for collective bargaining purposes than in those that do not. All three
surveys are then utilised to ascertain to what extent the decline in unionization in Britain has
contributed to the rise in earnings inequality of semi-skilled workers. There was a sizable and
important widening of the gap in the dispersion of earnings across union and non-union plants
between 1980 and 1990. For semi-skilled earnings, the decline in the share of plants with
recognised unions can account for 11-17% of the rise in earnings inequality over this time period.
The importance of falling union activity (as measured by union recognition) seemed to accelerate
through the 1980s. Between 1980 and 1984 the relatively small falls in aggregate recognition
explain less than 10% of the inequality increase, whereas between 1984 and 1990 about one-
quarter of the increase can be accounted for by the fall in unionisation. The majority of the rise
in earnings inequality is, however, due to a large increase in earnings dispersion across non-union
establishments.

I. Introduction

       One of the most striking features of the UK labour market during the 1980s was a

considerable rise in the inequality of earnings. In the 1980 distribution of male weekly

earnings, the ratio of the 90th percentile of the distribution to the 10th percentile was 2.452;

by 1990 this had dramatically risen to 3.106.' For women there was also a large rise, albeit

by slightly less in absolute magnitude (from 2.358 to 2.856).

       The 1980s also saw a marked decline in union presence. According to the three

Workplace Industrial Relations Surveys that were conducted between 1980 and 1990, the

percentage of private sector plants with recognised trade unions was 54% in 1980, 50% in

1984 and 40% in 1990 (Millward et aL, 1992). Other indicators of union presence suggest

a similarly sharp fall: for instance, aggregate union membership fell from 13.2 million
employees in 1980 to 9.9 million in 1990; the number of trade unions fell from 453 to 287;

the corresponding fall in aggregate union density was from 54% to 3g%â€¢2

       The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we use data from the recently available 1990

Workplace Industrial Relations Survey to establish the impact of unions on the distribution

of earnings. Second, we document changes in this relationship between 1980 and 1990 by

using data from the 1980, 1984 and 1990 Surveys, and thereby attempt to gauge the extent




         These figures are from the New Earnings Survey which also shows a dramatic rise
for hourly earnings. The increases are driven by changes at both the top and the bottom of
the distribution: for males (females) the ratio of the 90th percentile to the median hourly
earnings rose from 1.616 (1.613) to 1.811 (1.786) between 1980 and 1990; the male (female)
decrease in the ratio of the 10th percentile to the median was from 0.659 (0.684) to 0.583
(0.625).

 earnings inequality.

        The structure of the paper is as follows. Section II presents a brief survey of existing

- mainly US - evidence on unions and earnings dispersion and on various explanations of the
rise in earnings inequality (again mainly based on US work). Section Ut uses the 1990

Workplace Industrial Relations Survey to provide cross-sectional evidence on the impact of

 British unions on manual earnings dispersion. Section IV uses the 1980, 1984 and 1990

surveys to evaluate the contribution of falling union presence to the rise in earnings inequality

for one particular group of workers (semi-skilled manuals) on which there exist comparable

data in all three years. Finally, Section V offers some concluding remarks.



H. Unions and Earnin2s Dicnersjpn: Existing Work

Unions and the Dispersion of Earnings

       Theoretically, unions can influence the distribution of earnings in either a positive or

a negative direction. If, as right-wing economists argue (notably Hayek, 1980 and Minford,

1983), the pay-raising (or monopoly) aspect of unionism is dominant, then unions, by

pushing up the earnings of certain select groups in the economy, will increase inequality and

dislodge lower-paid workers from employment. For instance, Hayek states "unions have

become the biggest obstacle to raising the living standards of the working classas a whole.

They are the chief cause of the unnecessarily big differences between the best and the wont

paid workers" [Hayek, 1980, page 52]. On the other hand, others (e.g. Freeman and Medoff,

1984; Lewis, 1986) argue that unions have traditionally organised low-paid workers and have

thus squeezed the distribution of earnings both within and     across   firms, occupations and

                                              2
 industries.

        The large body of US empirical evidence points to the dominance of the latter,
 indicating that unions are associated with reduced earnings dispersion (Freeman, 1980;

Freeman, 1982; Hirsch, 1982). The finding is usually explained as compression resulting

from union pay policies since unions typically organize lower-paid workers and attempt to

standardise pay for given job definitions (Reynolds and Taft, 1956; Slichter, Healy and

Livernash, 1960). Many have argued that unions act as a redistributive force and, in this

respect, that unions can have a desirable influence on economic outcomes (see Freeman and

Medoff, 1984, chapter 5). This is the mechanism behind what Flanders (1970) terms the

'sword of justice' effect of trade unions.

        For the UK the evidence is more limited but, in accord with the US work, Metcalf

(1982) uses data from the New Earnings Survey to show that unions reduce the inter-industry

earnings distribution. Similarly, whilst it is not the main focus of his work, Stewart (1983a,

1987,   1991) reports standard deviations of ln(earnings) that are lower for union than

non-union establishments, based on National Training Survey data from 1975 and on data

from the Workplace Industrial Relations Surveys of 1980 and 1984.' Ingram (1991) reports

a higher coefficient of variation amongst non-bargained pay settlements, using data from the

CM pay databank. Blanchflower and Freeman (1992) also find coefficients of variation to

be lower for union workers in the UK, using data from the International Social Survey

Programme. Finally, Miliward et al. (1992) examine the proportion of establishments in the



           Stewart's (1987, 1991) work also reports that the union/non-union earnings
differential is lower for (higher paid) skilled workers than for semi-skilled workers (see, for
example, Table 3 of Stewart, 1991) which also tends to compress the union sector
distribution.

 1990 Workplace Industrial Relations Survey which employ low-paid workers. They report

that 27% of private sector establishments have at least some workers with pay below the 10th

percentile of the 1990 New Earnings Survey earnings distribution, but that the percentage is

19% in plants with recognised unions as compared to 32% in non-union plants. All these

studies point to UK trade unions having an important equalising effect on earnings.



Unions and Changes in Earnings Dispersion

       The 1980s saw a considerable rise in earnings dispersion in the UK, the US and in

some other developed countries.4 The start of the US rise can be traced back to the late

1960s, whereas it appears that earnings inequality began to rise in the UK from about 1977

or 1978 onwards. Figure I plots the gap between the 90th percentile and the 10th percentile

of the male and female distributions of log(hourly earnings) between 1972 and 1990 to

illustrate this trend increase through the 1980s. A voluminous literature which attempts to

explain the US rise has emerged in recent years, though to date there is less UK research on

the issue,6

       The US work provides at least three principal explanations for the rise in earnings



        ' See, for example. Davis (1992) who provides a comprehensive description of trends
in earnings inequality among 13 countries, or the description of changing wage structures in
the UK, US, France and Japan by Katz, Loveman and Blanchflower (1993)

       'Analogous plots illustrating the US experience can be found in Murphy and Welch
(1992) or Juhn, Murphy and Pierce (1993) and in many other papers.
       6 On the US rise in wage inequality see the February 1992 issue of the Ouarterly
Journal of Economics and the survey of Levy and Murnane (1992). Research in the UK is
limited to a small number of pieces: see Atkinson (1993), Jenkins (1991) and Johnson and
Webb on income inequality and Gregg and Machin (1993), Katz, Loveinan and Blanchflower
(1993) and Schmitt (1992) on the increase in the inequality of earnings.

 inequality. The first is that there has been an increase in the return to education so that the

earnings gap between highly educated workers and those with few or no qualifications has

widened. The second is that there has been an increase in the demand for skilled workers for

whom employers are prepared to pay higher earnings, either as a result of skill-biased

technical change (Krueger, 1993; Bound and Johnson, 1992) or increased import competition

(Murphy and Welch, 1992). A third explanation is that the declining role of labour market

institutions like unions and minimum wages, which have traditionally protected the wages of

workers at the bottom of the pay distribution, has contributed to rising earnings inequality

(Freeman, 1992)?

       Whilst there is probably some merit in each of these explanations, we are interested

here in the role of falling union activity in explaining the rise in earnings inequality. Recent

US studies of this question have come to very similar conclusions despite using very different

methodologies. Freeman (1992) uses simple variance decompositions to show that the fall in

US union density between 1978 and 1988 can account for about 21% of the coincident rise

in earnings inequality. Card (1991) uses a more sophisticated approach, based on quintile

regressions, to reach much the same conclusion, namely that over the period 1973-87, 21%

of the increase in the variance of earnings can be accounted for by changes in the level and

distribution of unionisation. A third study of interest is Freeman and Needels' (1993)

comparison of changes in labour market inequality in the US and Canada. They find that

declining unionisation has played an important role in the rise in inequality in the US, whilst




         In the US in the 1980s those at the lower end of the distribution actually became
worse off in absolute terms, facing real pay decreases; in the UK, despite the considerable
changes in the structure of wages, the bottom decile still achieved positive real pay changes.

                                              S
in Canada union presence has not fallen and inequality has also remained relatively

unchanged. Finally, Lemleux (1993) and DiNardo and Lemieux (1993) use microdata sources

to compare the impact of unions in Canada and the US. Lemleux (1993) concludes that

approximately 40% of the Canada-US difference in male earnings inequality can be attributed

to differences in union activity, whilst DiNardo and Lemieux (1993) present estimates

indicating that the relative decline of unions, together with the eroded relative value of the

US   minimum wage, can account for the majority of the Canada-US differences in the

evolution of wage inequality.




m. Estimates of the Union Effect on Earninrs DisDersion. 1990

The Workplace Industrial Relations Survey of 1990

       The 1990 Workplace Industrial Relations Survey is a nationally representative survey

of 2061 establishments in Britain that employ 25 or more employees. In many respects it

is very similar to the two earlier (1980 and 1984) surveys that are described in some detail

in Daniel and Millward (1983) and Millward and Stevens (1986). Like the two preceding

surveys, its main strength is on industrial relations issues though there is a little more

economic information contained in the 1990 survey (for example, in a subset of
establishments financial managers were asked to report information on profiubility, costs,

market structure etc.).

       In this section we investigate the relationship between unions and the dispersion of




         More details are given in Millward et a!. (1992).

                                             6
earnings using data from the 1990 Workplace Industrial Relations Survey. We approach this

issue in two ways. The first is to consider the relationship between union status and the

within-skill, across-establishment dispersion of the earnings of skilled and semi-skilled

manuai workers.9 The second is to analyse across skill, within-establishment inequality by

looking at a question asked only in the 1990 survey, which allows us to measure the upper

and lower tails of the pay distribution of all full-time workers employed in the establishment.



Across-Establishment Manual Earnings Inequality

       Managers were asked to report median weekly earnings of the typical majority sex

worker in the relevant skill group and, as in both previous surveys, the data are banded into

eleven categories, with the bottom and top pay bands being open-ended. To compute

unconditional means and standard deviations we simply allocate midpoints to each of the

closed bands and utilise Stewart's (19831,) Maximum Likelihood estimator (described below)

to estimate the bottom and top pay levels. We also use this estimator to compute conditional

standard deviations from the various earnings regressions reported on below.'0



          The reason for focusing on these groups of workers is that WJRS is not good on
reporting non-manual pay data, having no data on managers and information only on a veiy
heterogeneous classification (clerical workers). There are data on unskilled manual pay but
we were unsure of its suitability for analysing dispersion since the same band intervals for
the grouped pay data are specified for skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers: while the
earnings distributions are reasonably good approximations to the log-normal for the (higher
paid) skilled and semi-skilled, there is a large concentration of unskilled pay levels in the
bottom interval, rendering log-normality invalid. However, similar results did emerge if we
used the unskilled and clerical pay data to draw union/non-union comparisons (see footnote
11).
       'Â° The qualitative nature of the results is not sensitive to the choice of top and bottom
band pay levels or to crnder grouping of the bands (we thank Francis Green and Mark
Stewart for suggesting that we do this). For example, amalgamating the bottom two and the

                                              7
        The upper panel of Table I reports the raw standard deviation of ln(earnings) for

 skilled and semi-skilled manual workers in the union and non-union segments of the private

 sector in 1990. Union status is defined as the recognition of manual trade unions for

 collective bargaining purposes. In both cases the standard deviation is lower in the union

 sector: 13% (skilled) and 19% (semi-skilled) lower than the non-union standard deviation.

 The gap is significant at the 5% level of significance in both cases."

        There are a number of other possible reasons, beyond union status, why earnings

 dispersion may be lower in the union sector. Establishment-level characteristics such as size,

 ownership status and worlcforce composition are clearly important determinants of earnings

and their variability. We can standardise for these establishment characteristics by computing

regression-corrected Maximum likelihood estimates of the standard deviation of ln(earnings).

As the earnings data are grouped, simple least-squares estimation procedures are inconsistent,

so we use Stewart's (198Th) Maximum Likelihood estimator for grouped dependent variable

models. This is a limited dependent variable procedure which estimates the overall and

unobserved distribution as well as the conditional expectations. This estimator is based on

using the available information on establishment characteristics to form the conditional

expectation of earnings for each observation in the sample. One can then compute estimated

standard deviations in the usual manner (more details are given in Stewart, 1983b).



to? two bands to give nine bands produced a very similar pattern (i.e. skilled and semi-
skilled union/non-union differences were extremely similar).
       " Despite the qualifications noted in footnote 9 above, we also computed
unconditional standard deviations for unskilled and clerical workers as: 0.341 in the union
sector and 0.408 in the non-union sector for the unskilled, generating a gap and associated
standard error of -0.068 (0.024); for clericaJs 0.231 (union), 0.261 (non-union), and a gap
of -0.030 (0.012).

                                              S
        We estimated separate union and non-union semi-logarithmic earnings equations

controlling for plant size, various workforce plant and union characteristics (precise details

on the controls are given in the notes to Table 1). After including this (very stringent) set of

controls, the estimated conditional standard deviation of ln(earnings) is higher in the

non-union sector, though only by a little and not significantly so for skilled workers. For

semi-skilled workers, however, the gap is large and statistically significant, providing strong

evidence for the 'sword of justice' role of trade unions.



Within-Establishment Earnings Inequality

       Unlike the two previous surveys the 1990 survey contained a question on
within-establishment dispersion. The precise question had two parts - for the lower and upper

ends of the earnings distribution - and is reproduced here:

 Please consider the average gross earnings of aJlfidl-tinie employees ncluding managers)

at this establishment. Approximasey what proportion of full-time employees earn ha( that

amount or less? Approximately what proportion offull-time employees earn twice that amount

or more?0

       The nature of the question makes it evident that, in some plants with highly

compressed earnings structures (with no very low-paid or high-paid employees), the
proportion earning twice or more I half or less than avenge will be zero. The data are thus

censored at zero and we need to take account of this when we estimate regression models.

We do so by using a Tobit estimator.

       The raw data are described in Table II. Owing to their censored nature we provide

two pieces of information: the proportion of plants with any workers paid 50% or less /

                                              9
 200% or more of average earnings, and the average proportion of workers in each of these

 categories (the avenge includes the zeros). Plants with recognised unions have lower

 within-plant earnings inequality (see also the description of the raw data in Miflward et al.,

 1992, Table 7.15, pp.248-9). lJnionised plants are less likely to have workers paid 50% or

less and 200% or more than the avenge. Further, the proportion of workers that receive

such low or high earnings (relative to the avenge) is higher in the non-union sector.

           As in the case of across-establishment dispersion, this pattern may be shaped by

various establishment-specific factors. In Table Ill we thus report Tobit estimates of the

relation between within-establishment earnings dispersion and trade union recognition.

Columns (l)-(3) consider the bottom end          of the distribution (the 50%      question) and

columns (4)-(6) consider the top end (200%). In each case, the first column is a simple

regression on a recognition dummy, the second includes plant and worker characteristics and

the third additionally includes eight one-digit industry dummies.

           For both questions, the estimated coefficient on the recognition
                                                                            dummy is negative
and statistically significant (though only at the 10% level in column (1)). The effect at the

top of the distribution is extremely precisely determined across all three specifications. Other

noteworthy results include the significant impact of local labour market unemployment at the

bottom end of the distribution and the important workforce composition and plant size

effects.

           It appears therefore that within-establishment earnings dispersion is also lower in the

presence of unions. Trade unions have an equalising impact at both ends of the
within-establishment distribution of earnings. The 'sword ofjustice' effect appears to receive

support from the relationship between unions and earnings dispersion, both in

                                                10
across-establishment and within-establishment comparisons.



IV. Chanlies in the Ijnion-Earnln2s Dispersion RelationshIp. 1980-1990

       The previous section pointed to an important earnings-equaJising effect of unions in

1990. However, there were considerable changes in earnings dispersion in the 1980s. In this

section we therefore use the three Workplace Industrial Relations Surveys (of 1980, 1984 and

1990) to examine changes in the relationship between unions and across-establishment

inequality between 1980 and 1990. We focus on one group of workers for whom we have

data in all three years, the semi-skilled, and report union/non-ujion comparisons of
dispersion over time.'2

       Panel 1 of Table IV reports unconditional standard deviations of ln(earnings) for

semi-skilled workers in union and non-union plants for the three available years. In 1980 the

gap between union and non-union dispersion (in terms of unconditional standard deviations)

was -0.028; in 1984 the gap widened to -0.063 and by 1990 it became -0.066. All gaps are

significantly different from zero, though only at the 10% level in 1980. Whilst dispersion

grew among both union and non-union plants, it appears that the non-union distribution

opened up by more over the 1980s.



       12
           Another possible approach would be to use the 1984-90 panel of just over 500
trading sector establishments. However, the sample size became very small after allowing
for missing data and making samples consistent between the two years due to differences in
responses to the earnings question (in 1990 responses were sought only if the establishment
had at least five workers in the appropriate skill group). Examination of the characteristics
of these plants led us to believe that, mainly because of this 5+ requirement, they were
unrepresentative of the overall population (e.g. they were larger and more unionised). We
therefore remained reluctant to use the panel for modeling earnings (of course, this should
not detract from the use of the panel to study other issues).

                                             11
        In Panel 2 we report regression-corrected conditional standard deviations, together

with union/non-union differences. The pattern is robust to the inclusion of controls: in all

cases, union dispersion is lower than non-union dispersion (though only just in 1980 and it

is not different from zero in terms of statistical significance). The gap widens through the

 1980s and the rise is strongly significant in conventional statistical terms: adopting a

 "differences-in-differences" approach shows a 1980 to 1990 change of -0.045 with an

associated standard error of 0.021. Furthermore, in the union sector the regression controls

are able to explain the majority of the observed rise in dispersion that is depicted by the

unconditional standard deviations in Panel 1. Finally, to put it another way, the importance

of unionisation is clearly illustrated when one views that, in the union sector between 1980

and 1990, the conditional standard deviation rises by 0.023 (or 12% of the 1980 standard

deviation) as compared to a 0.069 (34%) rise in the non-union sector.

       There is, however, an important issue of comparability of the earnings data across

years. First, the earnings question in 1980 was different from the question asked in the later

years. Second, the question in 1990 (whilst having the same format as the 1984 question) was

only asked for plants which had 5 or more of the skill group in question (here the

semi-skilled). More specifically, the 1980 question asked managers to give the weekly

earnings of the typical employee in the appropriate skill group. In 1984 and 1990 managers

were first asked to state whether there were more men or women in a particular skill group

(in 1990 only if there were 5 or more workers in the skill group) and then to report the

typical pay of this majority sex worker.

       We have done some further checks on this. Table IV also reports union/non-union

earnings dispersion gaps when one restricts the 1980 and 1984 data to cover only workplaces

                                             12
with 5 or more semi-skilled employees. A similar pattern emerges, with the gap if anything

becoming wider through the 1980s. Based on consistent sample definitions, the
union/non-union dispersion gap in the conditional standard deviation widens from -0.010 in

1980 to -0.058 in 1990.

       To analyse the importance of falling union activity through the 1980s for the overall

rise in inequality, note that the variance of ln(real earnings), say V(w), can be written as

       V(w) = U.V(w') + (l-U).V(W') + U.(l-U).(W - wa)2

where U is the proportion of unionised plants and u and n superscripts denote union and

non-union status respectively. The variance of earnings can thus be decomposed into a

weighted combination of the union and non-union sector variances plus an interaction term

based on the union earnings gap. One can think of the first two terms as picking up within-

sector changes in the structure of earnings, and the third term as capturing between-sector

changes due to trade union related wage differences. Using this decomposition, it is possible

to compute the predicted variation of ln(earnings) in 1990 had the 1980 union structure

prevailed and compare it to the actual 1990 variance. The gap between these two gives an

indication to the importance of the decline in unionism for the rise in the inequality of

earnings.

       In the upper panel of Table V we report the 1980 and 1990 computations of V(w),

together with the simulated value in 1990 had the 1980 union structure prevailed. We report

four experiments which differ in whether they utilise weighted or unweighted union

proportions and on whether they use the full sample of establishments or restrict to those

which have at least five semi-skilled workers. We use the conditional standard deviations

from the regression models of semi-skilled earnings reported in Table IV, together with

                                            13
Stewart's (1991, 1992) estimates of the ceteris paribus semi-skilled union/non-union

ln(earnings) gap of 0.066 in 1980 and 0.062 in 1990.

        For all four cases, the first two rows of the upper panel of Table V adequately

illustrate the sharp rise in the variance of earnings between 1980 and 1990. In the third row

we report the value of V(w) that our models predict would have been present in 1990 had

the union structure of 1980 still been in place (i.e. using the 1980 value of 0). As one would

expect, this is lower in all cases. Finally, the fourth row of Table V computes the percentage

contribution of the 1980 to 1990 fall in unionisation. Depending on the experiment

considered, this ranges between 11 and 17%.

       The lower two panels of the Table perform the same analysis for the two sub-periods

1980-84 and 1984-90. The latter period is where the majority of the 1980-90 decline in

unionisation occurred. Not surprisingly, then, the impact of falling unionisation is more

marked in the second sub-period. Effects are small, and can explain less than 10% of the

inequality rise, between 1980 and 1984; on the other hand, between 1984 and 1990 the

obsen'ed decline in union activity is an important contributor to the rise in the inequality of

the earnings of semi-skilled manual workers and can account for between one-fifth and one-

quarter of the observed increase.

       Hence, on average, the decline in unionisation accounts for somewhere around 15%

of the rise in the variance of semi-skilled earnings between 1980 and 1990. This is similar

to the US findings of Card (1991) and Freeman (1993), who report that the US decline

accounts for about 20% of the US rise in the variance of male earnings between the 1970s

and 1980s. Given the very large changes in the UK wage structure that occurred during the

eighties, the decline in union activity thus appears to be an important factor. Nevertheless,

                                             14
the majority of the rise in across-establishment semi-skilled earnings dispersion between 1980

and 1990 is due to increased inequality in the non-union sector.'3



V. Concluding Remarks

       In this paper we have examined two related issues. The first concerns the relationship

between union presence and earnings dispersion. In empirical work based on the 1990

Workplace Industrial Relations Survey we find that the distribution of earnings is more

compressed in plants with recognised trade unions. This is the case for across-establishment

comparisons of the distribution of skilled and semi-skilled manual earnings and for

comparisons of within-establishment earnings distributions. Unfortunately the nature of the

data precludes us from analysing whether across- or within-plant pay compression is the more

important and from satisfactorily analysing the relation between unions and the dispersion of

non-manual pay.

       The second part of the paper considers changes in the relationship between unions and

earnings dispersion using all three Workplace Industrial Relations Surveys. For the

semi-skilled, pay dispersion rose in both union and non-union sectors during the 1980s, but

by much more in the non-union sector. The decline in unionisation appears to account for

around 15% of the increase in the across-establishment dispersion of semi-skilled earnings


       " One aspect of the larger increase in the non-union sector may be the weakening of
minimum wage protection for low paid non-union workers via the reduced importance of the
Wages Councils which culminated in their abolition in August 1993. Machin and Manning
(1994) and Dickens et al. (1993) provide evidence that the failure to upgrade Wages Council
minima was in fact associated with rising pay dispersion within Wages Council sectors. More
generally, rises in the rate of return to education (Schmitt, 1992), the observed increase in
the relative demand for skilled workers Qsachin, 1994) and perhaps the increase in
unemployment are likely to be important correlates of the overall rise in inequality.

                                             15
between 1980 and 1990. The majority of the aggregate fall in union activity (based on union

recognition) took place in the second half of the decade and the importance of declining

unionism is more marked in the 1984-1990 time period where it can account for up to one-

quarter of the rise in inequality. The remainder appears to be largely attributable to a big rise

in earnings inequality in the non-union sector.

        Comparison with other work on this subject suggests an interesting cross-country

pattern (see Davis, 1992, for a discussion of international trends in the structure of wages).

It appears that countries with declining union activity have experienced coincident rises in

earnings inequality - the US since the late sixties, the UK through the eighties. On the other

hand, earnings inequality has stayed relatively constant in other countries (e.g. France or

Canada) where the degree of unionisation has also remained constant or risen (see Katz et

al., 1993, on France and Lemieux, 1993, DiNardo and Lemieux, 1993, and Freeman and

Needels, 1993, on Canada). Caution should be exercised in drawing strong conclusions from

this since the economic experiences of these countries have been very diverse and the role

played by trade unions in different countries has been quite varied. Nevertheless, the results

suggest that the decline in unionisation is an important feature of recent changes in earnings

inequality in industrialised countries.
