                                         ABSTRACT

In canonical models with financial constraints, the possibility of fire sales creates a pecuniary
externality that results in ex-ante overinvestment. I show that this result is sensitive to the
microfoundations for fire sales. If they result from asymmetric information instead of
misallocation, the overinvestment result is reversed. Macroprudential policy may therefore need
to treat different types of investment differently.

    Fire sales, where distressed sales depress asset prices, are a recurring feature of financial
crises, and preventing or mitigating them is a central concern of macro-prudential policy.
One common policy recommendation is to preventatively curb investment booms in order to
reduce the scale of fire sales during crises. Lorenzoni (2008) formalizes one possible rationale
for such policies: investors don’t internalize the pecuniary externality that falling asset prices
impose on financially constrained agents. In this paper I show that this argument depends
on the exact mechanism that makes asset prices fall. It is valid when fire sales involve
misallocation of real assets; if instead they result from asymmetric information, a social
planner would like to increase rather than reduce investment.
    It seems intuitive that prices should fall when constrained agents need to sell assets, but
it requires some explanation. Assets are just claims on future cash flows. If asset sales do
not alter either cash flows or the discount factor of the marginal investor, there is no reason
for asset prices to fall. In other words, one needs a theory of what makes asset demand
downward-sloping as opposed to perfectly elastic.
    A standard way to microfound downward-sloping demand curves for assets is the misallo-
cation mechanism proposed by Shleifer and Vishny (1992) and Kiyotaki and Moore (1997),
and adopted by Lorenzoni (2008). Assets are assumed to have different productivity de-
pending on who holds them. They have a high marginal product in expert hands but a
diminishing marginal product in non-expert hands. If constrained experts sell marginal
units to non-experts, this lowers the marginal product in second-best use, and therefore the
equilibrium price. This mechanism is an appealing microfoundation for applications where
the assets in question are real assets that must be actively managed by whoever owns them.
For assets that are not actively managed by the owner, such as securities backed by pools of
mortgages which have a designated servicer, the fit is less clear. To a first approximation,
the cash flows from these assets are the same regardless of who owns them.1
    Empirically, fire sale effects have been documented in several different markets. These
include real assets like used aircraft (Pulvino 1998) and real estate (Campbell et al. 2011)
where misallocation seems like a first-order concern and financial assets like equities (Coval
and Stafford 2007), corporate bonds (Ellul et al. 2011), convertible bonds (Mitchell et al.
2007) and residential mortgage-backed securities (Merrill et al. 2014) where it seems less
essential.
    In Kurlat (2016), I propose an alternative model of fire sales that does not rely on cash
   1
    Although differences across investors in tax rates, in the correlation between a given asset and the rest
of their portfolio or in beliefs about the asset’s cash flows might all be sources of differences in valuation
across investors even for assets that do not require management.


                                                      2
flows changing depending on who owns the asset. Instead, I assume that there is asymmetric
information and potential buyers differ in their expertise in evaluating assets: more expert
buyers can detect bad assets more accurately and refrain from buying them. This setup
results in an equilibrium where only investors with sufficiently high expertise buy assets.
The cash flows obtained by the marginal buyer depend on his expertise because expertise
determines the composition of the pool of assets he purchases. Under certain conditions on
the joint distribution of buyers’ wealth and expertise, the equilibrium features a downward-
sloping relationship between asset sales and asset prices: in order to clear the market when
sales are high, less-expert investors need to be induced to buy so the price needs to fall.
    I embed this model of fire sales into a simplified version of Lorenzoni’s three-period model
and ask the same normative questions that have been asked of this canonical framework.
Would a social planner that can intervene ex-ante but not ex-post want to deviate from
the level of investment in the competitive equilibrium? In what way? I find that in the
asymmetric information model, the normative conclusions are reversed: the social planner
wants higher investment relative to the competitive equilibrium, even if this will deepen the
fall in asset prices.
    The reason for this reversal is that the two models imply very different types of inefficien-
cies. In the canonical model, the inefficiency comes from what Dávila and Korinek (2017)
label a distributive externality. Incomplete markets prevent constrained investors from sav-
ing towards the state of the world where they have high marginal utility of wealth, and
raising asset prices partially substitutes for this. Since the net present value of investment is
zero (given how it will be misallocated in equilibrium) there is no first-order loss in reducing
it relative to the competitive equilibrium in order to raise asset prices. In the model with
asymmetric information, there are two important differences. First, redistributing wealth to-
wards constrained investors to mitigate fire sales has no social benefit. Privately, they have a
high marginal utility of wealth because it allows them to retain assets instead of selling them
at an adverse selection discount, but since no real output is destroyed in a fire sale, this is
just a transfer. Therefore the force for preventing fire sales in the canonical model is absent.
Second, the social net present value of marginal investment in the competitive equilibrium
is positive. What stops agents from choosing higher investment is the understanding that
they may have to sell it at an adverse selection discount. But since this discount is just a
transfer, the social planner would like investors to ignore it and choose higher investment.
    I then extend the basic framework to allow for investment in the intermediate period in
addition to the initial period. By lowering asset prices, fire sales raise the rate of return on


                                               3
experts’ wealth, leading to inefficiently lower intermediate-period investment. In the canoni-
cal model, this just reinforces the argument for lowering initial investment: it prevents both
misallocation and future underinvestment. In the asymmetric information model, allowing
for intermediate-period investment introduces a tradeoff: the social planner must balance
present and future underinvestment. The direction in which the planner wants to inter-
vene depends on the strength of fire sale effects and the sensitivity of intermediate-period
investment to asset prices.
    Finally, I examine what happens in the asymmetric information model if bad assets
are deliberately created with the intent of being sold, and their quantity is endogenous. I
find conditions such that this reinforces the argument for increasing ex-ante investment: if
additional investment leads to lower asset prices, it also reduces incentives to waste resources
in creating bad assets.


1    The Canonical Model
The model is a simplified version of Lorenzoni (2008), similar to the example studied by
Moore (2013). Lorenzoni’s original model features aggregate uncertainty, with fire sales only
taking place in bad states of the world. While this feature is appealing on empirical grounds,
it is not essential for the main argument, so, like Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2004), I
focus on a deterministic economy.


Technology, Preferences and Markets
There are three periods: t = 0, 1, 2; two groups of agents: households and entrepreneurs; and
two goods: consumption goods and capital. Preferences are given by u = c0 +c1 +c2 for both
groups of agents. Entrepreneurs are endowed with n consumption goods at t = 0; households
are endowed with e0 and e1 consumption goods in periods t = 0 and t = 1 respectively.
    Consumption goods are perishable and not storable. However, entrepreneurs have access
to a technology that converts consumption goods into capital one-for-one at t = 0. Capital
requires maintenance at t = 1 in order to produce output at t = 2. Maintenance costs are z
consumption goods per unit of capital. If a unit of capital’s maintenance costs are not paid,
then that unit of capital becomes useless. At t = 2, a maintained unit of capital will produce
A consumption goods if it is operated by entrepreneurs. Instead, if households operate k H
                                           
units of capital, they will produce F k H consumption goods, where F (·) is a differentiable
concave function.

                                               4
   Overall, the economy’s resource constraints are:

                                cE    H
                                 0 + c0 + k ≤ n + e0                                        (1)
                              cE    H
                               1 + c1 + zαk ≤ e1                                            (2)
                                     k E + k H ≤ αk                                         (3)
                                     cE    H     E                    H
                                                                        
                                      2 + c2 ≤ Ak + F k                                     (4)

Equation (1) is the t = 0 resource constraint. The total endowment of consumption goods
n+e0 has to be split up between consumption of entrepreneurs cE0 , consumption of households
 H
c0 and investment k. Equation (2) is the t = 1 resource constraint: the endowment is split
between consumption and maintenance costs; α ∈ [0, 1] is the fraction of capital for which
maintenance costs are indeed incurred. Equation (3) says that maintained capital is allocated
for use by either households or entrepreneurs. Equation (4) is the t = 2 resource constraint.
    No inter-temporal contracts are enforceable, so no agents can borrow or lend. It is
also impossible to enforce contracts whereby entrepreneurs manage capital on behalf of
households: each unit of capital will be managed by whoever owns its. There is, however,
a competitive spot market for for capital (after maintenance) at t = 1. Denote the price of
capital in this market by q.

The entrepreneurs solve the following problem:

Equation (6) is the t = 0 budget constraint: entrepreneurs simply face a choice between
consumption and investment. Equation (7) is the t = 1 budget constraint. They raise sq


                                                  5
consumption goods by selling s units of capital, and divide this between consumption and
maintaining a fraction α of their capital.2 Equation (8) says that the capital they can carry
over into t = 2 is the part of their original capital that they have chosen to maintain minus
the amount that they have sold. Equation (9) says that at t = 2 they just consume.
   Households solve the following problem:

Equations (11)-(13) are the budget constraints the household faces in periods 0, 1, and 2
respectively. At t = 0 they just consume because they have no investment technology or
access to financial markets. At t = 1 they decide how much to consume and how much
capital to buy. At t = 2 they just consume.
                                                               

capital market clears, so (3) holds with equality.


Equilibrium Characterization
Assume that the following conditions hold:

Assumption 1.

   1. A > 1 + z

   2. F 0 (0) < A

   3. F 0 (0) >    Az
                  A−1

   2
    There is no intra-period financial constraint saying that entrepreneurs must obtain goods to meet main-
tenance costs before being able to sell capital. This is equivalent to assuming that capital can be sold without
maintenance and maintained by the buyer.

    Assumption 1.1 just says that investing in capital (and then maintaining it) has positive
net present value. Assumption 1.2 implies that capital is always more productive in the
hands of entrepreneurs. Assumption 1.3, on the other hand, says that households are not
so unproductive that the price of capital can fall to the point where no investment takes
                                                       Az

place (Assumption 1.1 ensures that the interval A, A−1      is nonempty so Assumptions 1.2
and 1.3 are not inconsistent). Assumption 1.4 ensures that there is a unique market-clearing
price of capital. Assumption 1.5 ensures that entrepreneurs’ endowment n is large enough
that in equilibrium they do not invest all of it and consume at t = 0. Assumption 1.6 says
that households’ endowment at t = 1 is sufficiently large to meet maintenance costs for the
maximum possible level of investment.
    Suppose the entrepreneur enters period t = 1 holding k units of capital, and the market
price is q. His problem reduces to

                                    V (k, q) ≡      max           cE    E

As shown below, Assumption 1 ensures that in equilibrium A > q > z. q > z means it’s
better to maintain capital and sell it than to not maintain it, so constraint α ≤ 1 will
bind. A > q means that entrepreneurs prefer to buy (or avoid selling) capital rather than
consuming at t = 1, so cE                        E
                           1 ≥ 0 will bind, and k ≥ 0 will not. The entrepreneur will incur

capital as possible into t = 2. The solution to his problem is:

so the entrepreneur sells just enough capital to meet maintenance costs, and can afford

   Turn now to the household’s problem. Assumption 1.6 ensures that e1 is large enough so
that cH
      1 ≥ 0 doesn’t bind, so households’ first order condition for choosing k
                                                                              H

Therefore, the market-clearing condition s = k H implies that in equilibrium the price of
capital must satisfy:                      

For a general F (·) function, it’s possible for (18) to have more than one solution: a lower
price makes entrepreneurs have to sell more units of capital to meet maintenance costs, which
lowers the marginal product obtained by households, justifying the lower price. Assumption
1.4 (which is satisfied, for instance, with a Cobb-Douglas production function) ensures that
this is not the case.

Lemma 1. If equation (18) has a solution, it is unique. The solution q (k) is a decreasing
function.

   Lemma 1 means that this model has “fire sale” effects. Higher t = 0 investment means

                                                      8
that entrepreneurs will have to liquidate more capital at t = 1, so households will have
to absorb more units of capital, pushing down the marginal-product-in-second-best-use and
therefore asset prices.
    Assumption 1.3 implies that for sufficiently low k H , F 0 k H > A−1Az
                                                                  

implies that entrepreneurs will choose positive investment in equilibrium. On the other
hand, Assumption 1.5 implies that if k = n, then F 0 k H < A−1    Az
                                                            

imply that entrepreneurs choose zero investment, a contradiction. Therefore, in equilibrium
the entrepreneurs must choose an interior solution for the level of investment. Using (17),
this requires:
                                                Az
                                         q=                                              (19)

which leaves entrepreneurs exactly indifferent between investing and consuming at t = 0.
    Replacing (19) into (18):                          

Equation (20) implicitly defines the level of investment k that entrepreneurs will choose in
equilibrium. The rest of the equilibrium objects follow immediately.


Welfare
In line with the literature, I adopt the normative criterion of constrained efficiency, first
proposed by Hart (1975), Stiglitz (1982) and Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis (1986) in the
context of incomplete-market models, and applied by Kehoe and Levine (1993) to economies
with financial constraints. Consider a constrained social planner that wants to maximize
entrepreneurs’ utility subject to delivering a minimum level of utility to households. The
planner can dictate the level of investment that entrepreneurs carry out and can make
transfers across agents at t = 0, but cannot intervene in any way at time t = 1 or t = 2.
Hence the planner is limited to choosing cE       H
                                             0 , c0 and k.
    In general it is not clear whether this type of normative exercise provides useful guidance
for the analysis of optimal policy with a limited set of instruments. However, as pointed out
by Dávila and Korinek (2017), this particular planning problem is equivalent to a Ramsey
policy problem with a tax on investment and lump-sum redistribution, both applied at t = 0.




                                              9
   The planner solves:

                                          max cE

Unlike individual entrepreneurs, the planner takes into account how the choice of k will
determine asset prices at t = 1. The first constraint is just the t = 0 resource constraint. The
second constraint imposes a minimum level of utility for households. Households consume
cH
 0 at t = 0; at t = 1 they consume their endowment e1 minus what they spend buying
s (k, q (k)) units of capital at a unit price q (k); at t = 2 they consume the output of the
capital they purchased. Replacing the constraints into the objective, the planner’s problem
reduces to:

           max W (k) ≡ n + e0 + e1 − zk + F (s (q (k) , k)) − Π̄ − k + V (k, q (k))
             k

                        Π̄ − e1 + q (k) s (q (k) , k) − F (s (q (k) , k)) ≥ 0
                 n + e0 + e1 − q (k) s (q (k) , k) + F (s (q (k) , k)) − Π̄ − k ≥ 0

   At an interior point where the nonnegativity constraints on t = 0 consumption don’t
bind, the marginal value of investment is:
                                                                       

The inequality follows from Lemma 1 and Assumption 1.1. This establishes the following
result:

Proposition 1. (Lorenzoni 2008) In the canonical model, the social planner can obtain a
Pareto improvement by lowering investment relative to the competitive equilibrium.

    The equilibrium allocation is constrained inefficient: a constrained planner would be able
to make everyone better off by lowering investment. The reason for this inefficiency has been
discussed by Lorenzoni (2008) and Dávila and Korinek (2017). In equilibrium, households
consume at both t = 0 and t = 1, so their marginal rate of substitution between wealth in
both periods is 1. Entrepreneurs, instead, consume at t = 0, so their marginal utility is 1,
but are constrained at t = 1, when their marginal utility of wealth is Aq > 1. Hence marginal
rates of intertemporal substitution are not equalized across entrepreneurs and households. If
intertemporal contracts were enforceable, entrepreneurs would want to save and households
would want to borrow. Lower investment, by raising the price of capital, shifts wealth from
households to entrepreneurs at t = 1 and therefore partially substitutes for the missing credit
market.3 At the equilibrium, the direct effect of marginal investment (taking q as given) is
second-order. Using (16), (18) and (19):
                                                          
                           ∂W                         zk       z A (q − z)
                              = −1 − z + F 0                     +         =0                         (23)
                           ∂k                          q       q     q

so the only first-order effect is the redistribution of wealth at t = 1.
    The literature has given different labels to this effect. Typically, it is described as a pe-
cuniary externality: individual entrepreneurs do not take into account that their investment
decisions affect other entrepreneurs’ constraints by changing prices. In the terminology of
Dávila and Korinek (2017), this is a distributive externality: prices affect the distribution
of wealth across agents and dates in an environment where marginal rates of intertemporal
substitution are not equalized. It is also often referred to as a “fire sale” externality: addi-
tional investment means that additional units of capital will have to be sold, which lowers
its price.
    Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2003, 2004), Farhi et al. (2009), Bianchi (2011), Benigno
et al. (2011), Bianchi and Mendoza (2013), Jeanne and Korinek (2010, 2016), Hart and Zin-
gales (2015), Korinek (2017) and Di Tella (forthcoming) also analyze constrained efficiency
   3
     Note that entrepreneurs are savings-constrained at t = 0 but borrowing-constrained at t = 1. They want
to saving towards t = 1 precisely because they know that they will not be able to borrow.

in economies with financial constraints. They show examples where ex-ante decisions af-
fect future constraints through aggregate consumption, which affects prices of goods and/or
the stochastic discount factor. The inefficiencies identified in this class of models are also
sometimes described as “fire-sale externalities”, but work through a different channel as the
misallocation mechanism. Asriyan (2016) analyzes an example where misallocation interacts
with dispersed information.
    A central ingredient of Lorenzoni’s fire-sale argument is that the demand for capital is
indeed downward sloping, so that additional sales lead to lower prices. In this canonical
model, this happens because the marginal product of capital in its second-best use is dimin-
ishing. This assumption has been made by a large literature following Shleifer and Vishny
(1992) and Kiyotaki and Moore (1997). In the next section, I revisit the normative analysis
in a model with an alternative microfoundation for fire-sale effects.


2    An Asymmetric Information Model
The entrepreneurs’ side of the economy is the same as in the canonical model. The household
side follows Kurlat (2016) in assuming that there are households with different degrees of
expertise for evaluating assets.


Technology, Preferences, Markets and Information
                                                                           
Relative to the canonical model, there are two differences. First, F k H = Ak H , so capital
is just as productive in the hands of households as in the hands of entrepreneurs. Second,
there is a specific form of asymmetric information. In addition to real entrepreneurs, there
is a unit measure of fake entrepreneurs. They are endowed with nF consumption goods at
t = 0 plus a measure λ of “lemons”, completely useless pieces of fake capital, indexed by i
and distributed uniformly in the interval [0, 1].
    Households differ in their ability to distinguish lemons from real capital; their expertise
is indexed by θ ∈ [0, 1] and is exogenously given. When analyzing any asset, a household
will observe a binary signal x ∈ {0, 1}. If the asset is real capital, then the household will
always observe x = 1. If the asset is a lemon, the signal will depend on the lemon’s index and
the household’s expertise: a household of expertise θ will observe a signal x (i, θ) = I (i ≥ θ)
when analyzing lemon i. Hence, lemons in the interval [θ, 1] will be indistinguishable from
real capital for household θ. Higher θ means that a given household is more expert, since it
mistakes fewer lemons for real capital.

   Household θ is endowed with e0 goods at t = 0 and e1 (θ) goods at t = 1, where e (·) is a
continuous function. As in the canonical model, no intertemporal contracts are enforceable
and there is a competitive market for capital at t = 1.


Equilibrium definition
The equilibrium concept is derived from Kurlat (2016). There is a single price q at which
real capital and lemons trade at t = 1. Households can be selective in what they buy in the
capital market, to the extent that their expertise allows them to tell lemons and real capital
apart. Therefore household θ will buy real capital plus lemons with indices in the interval
i ∈ [θ, 1], pro-rata relative to their respective supply. All the real capital offered on sale will
indeed sell, but lemons will be rationed, since some of the households will reject them. Let
µ (i) be the fraction of lemons of index i put on sale that indeed sell.4
    The problem real entrepreneurs face is exactly the same as problem (5); what market
mechanism results in the price q does not affect the problem they face.
    The fake entrepreneurs solve:

                                                 max          cF0 + cF1                                (24)

                                                    cF0 ≤ nF                                           (25)
                                                    ˆ1
                                        cF1   ≤q         sF (i) µ (i) di                               (26)
                                                    0

                                                   sF (i) ≤ λ                                          (27)

At t = 0, their consumption is simply constrained by their endowment nF . At t = 1, their
consumption is constrained by the revenue they obtain from selling lemons. If they put sF (i)
lemons of type i on sale, they actually sell µ (i) sF (i) of them, at a price q each. (26) results
from integrating over their portfolio.

    Kurlat (2016) derives these equilibrium conditions from the assumption that there are markets at every
possible price and with every possible rule for ordering buyers’ trades, and buyers and sellers choose where
to trade. See Kurlat (2016) and Kurlat (2017) for details.

where s is the amount of real capital sold by entrepreneurs and δ is the number of assets
(capital plus lemons) that the household buys at t = 1. The only difference between this
problem and problem (10) is in constraint (31). The pool which household θ draws from
includes all the s units of real capital that entrepreneurs put on sale plus the sF (i) units of
lemons indexed i ∈ [θ, 1] that fake entrepreneurs put on sale and the household is incapable
of filtering out. Assets are divisible and the law of large numbers holds, so the fraction of real
capital among the δ assets bought by household θ is s+´ 1 ssF (i)di ; it obtains A consumption

real capital, so adding up over households gives the total demand for real capital, which is
equated to the supply s. Instead, the market for lemons does not clear, since lemon i is only


                                                             14
accepted by households with θ ≤ i. Hence, the fraction that indeed sells is given by (33).


Equilibrium Characterization
Assume that the following condition holds:

Assumption 2.
  ´
    e1 (θ) dθ > zn + λA

   Assumption 2 says that, in total, households’ t = 1 endowment is large enough to pay for
the maintenance costs of the maximum level of investment, and to pay for all the lemons as
though they were real capital. It is enough to ensure than in equilibrium some households
consume at t = 1.
   It is immediate that the solution to the fake entrepreneur’s problem is cF0 = nF , sF (i) = λ
             ´1
and cF1 = qλ 0 µ (i) di. Fake entrepreneurs have no value of keeping their lemons so they
always put them on sale, and at t = 1 they consume the proceeds of all the sales they are able
                            ´1
to make. This implies that θ sF (i) di = λ (1 − θ). Therefore the solution to the household’s
problem (28) is:                 
                                                        s

                                            q         s+λ(1−θ)

Condition
                                              s
                                                       A=q                                  (35)
                                       s + λ (1 − θ∗ )
defines a cutoff level of expertise θ∗ such that households with θ > θ∗ spend their entire
endowment of t = 1 goods to buys assets while households with θ < θ∗ do not buy any assets
at all because they understand that they would take in too many lemons and make losses.
    Replacing this in the market clearing condition (32) and rearranging:

                                 ˆ1
                                            1
                                                    e1 (θ) dθ = q                           (36)
                                      s + λ (1 − θ)
                                 θ∗


Also, as in section 1, the entrepreneur’s optimal investment decision is given by (17) and
sales of real capital satisfy (15). Using (33), sF (i) = λ and (15), the fraction of asset i that




                                                15
can be sold in equilibrium is:

                                               ˆi
                                           1               1
                                   µ (i) =                         e1 (θ) dθ                         (37)
                                           q         s + λ (1 − θ)
                                               θ∗


    It is immediate that there always exists an equilibrium with q = 0, k = 0 and θ∗ = 1. If
entrepreneurs expect the price of capital to be zero, they know that they will be unable to
afford the maintenance costs of any capital they created, so they do not invest. As a result,
only lemons are on sale at t = 1, which justifies q = 0, and households do not buy anything.
                                                                          Az
In addition, depending on parameters, there can be equilibria with q = z−1    and an interior
                                                                Az

    Lemma 2 is the analogue of Lemma 1. It says that, depending on the magnitude of e1 (θ∗ ),
the model with asymmetric information may or may not have the types of fire-sale effects
that are present in the canonical model.5 Higher investment has two opposing effects on asset
prices. First, it improves the overall mix of assets on sale at t = 1 since, by assumption, the
number of lemons is fixed and more investment means more real capital needs to be sold to
meet maintenance needs. Other things being equal, this pushes asset prices up rather than
down, the opposite of a fire-sale effect.6 On the other hand, absorbing the extra supply of
assets on sale requires drawing less-expert households into the market, since the more-expert
households exhaust their wealth. These households are rationally aware of their lower ability
to filter out lemons, so other things being equal they are only willing to buy at lower prices.
The net effect of higher investment on q depends on which of these two effects dominates.
   5
     Kurlat (2016) shows a version of this result in a model where sales of real capital are exogenous, as
opposed to being dictated by the need to meet maintenance costs.
   6
     Eisfeldt (2004) and Uhlig (2010) point out that simple models of trading with asymmetric information
do not produce fire sales precisely for this reason.


                                                        16
If e1 (θ∗ ) is high, this means that a small drop in the cutoff level of expertise is enough to
draw a lot of wealth into the market. In this case, the first effect dominates and asset prices
rise. Conversely, when e1 (θ∗ ) is low, the marginal level of expertise must fall more, and the
fire sale effect where q falls results. This possibility is important for the comparison with
the canonical model, since it shows that it’s possible to obtain the same positive predictions
for the relation between investment and asset prices from both microfoundations.


Welfare
Consider again a constrained social planner that wants to maximize entrepreneurs’ utility
subject to delivering a minimum level of utility to households and to fake entrepreneurs. As
before, the planner can dictate the level of investment that entrepreneurs carry out and can
make transfers across agents at t = 0, but cannot intervene in any way at time t = 1 or
t = 2. Hence the planner is limited to choosing cE       H       F
                                                    0 , c0 (θ), c0 and k. Denote by q (k), s (k) ,
θ∗ (k) and µ (i, k) the solution to the system of equations (35), (36), (15), (37), taking k as
given. Also, let

(37) and simplifying:

Constraint (41) is the t = 0 resource constraint. Implicit in it is the assumption that
the planner can redistribute consumption across real entrepreneurs, fake entrepreneurs and
households at t = 0. Constraint (42) imposes a minimum level of utility on household
θ. At t = 0, the planner just assigns this household consumption cH     0 (θ). At t = 1, the
household has the choice of either consuming its endowment e1 (θ) or spending it to buy eq(k)

The first step follows from rearranging, using (39) and using the market clearing condition
(36) and the last step uses (16) and (15). As long as Assumption 1.1 (which states that
investing in capital has positive net present value) holds, then dWdk(k) > 0. This establishes
the following result:

Proposition 2. In the model with asymmetric information, the social planner can obtain a


                                                 18
Pareto improvement by raising investment relative to the competitive equilibrium.

    Proposition 2 says that this model has the opposite normative implications as the canon-
ical model. The competitive equilibrium has underinvestment rather than overinvestment.
Furthermore, this property holds regardless of whether condition (38) holds, i.e. regardless
of whether higher investment leads to fire-sale effects.
    In both the canonical model and the asymmetric information model, the social planner’s
investment decision takes into account the present value of investment and the indirect effect
of investment through the effect of asset prices on t = 1 budget constraints. However, these
effects work very differently in the two models.
    In the canonical model, the net present value of investment is given by equation (23), and
is equal to zero. Even though the net present value in best use is positive, only a fraction
q−z
  q
     of the marginal unit of capital will be used by entrepreneurs; a fraction zq will be used
by households, and the net present value of building marginal capital and assigning it to
households is negative. Taking into account how capital will be allocated, the overall net
present value of investment is zero. Conversely, there is social value in reallocating wealth
across agents and periods. Shifting entrepreneurs wealth from t = 0 to t = 1 allows them to
afford more capital and allocate it to its best use, which creates social gains.
    Instead, in the asymmetric information model, the net present value of investment is
always positive and equal to A − 1 − z, since capital will have the same marginal product no
matter who holds it. The reason why the equilibrium does not produce as much investment
as the social planner would like is that entrepreneurs do not capture the full value of invest-
ment at the margin. They know that they will have to sell a part of their capital to meet
maintenance costs in a market where it will be partially pooled with lemons and therefore not
be paid its full value. The presence of lemons in the market acts like a tax on investment, and
the planner wants to counteract the effects of this tax on the level of investment.7 Conversely,
given a level of investment, there is no social value in reallocating wealth across agents and
periods in any direction. This is despite the fact that marginal rates of substitution are
not equalized. Entrepreneurs’ marginal rate of substitution is Aq , just like in the canonical
                                                                       n              o

fake entrepreneurs’ marginal rate of substitution is 1. As in the canonical model, the reason
entrepreneurs have a high marginal value of wealth at t = 1 is that having higher wealth
   7
     Kurlat (2013) shows an equivalence result between asymmetric information taxes on trading. Here the
presence of maintenance costs and financial constraints implies that investment requires subsequent trading
to meet maintenance costs, so asymmetric information acts like a tax on investment.



                                                    19
lets them avoid selling capital for q < A. However, unlike the canonical model, this has a
first order negative effect on households and fake entrepreneurs, who benefit from trading in
a market where real capital is on sale. Overall, since total output does not depend on the
distribution of wealth at t = 1, the benefit to entrepreneurs of higher wealth exactly cancels
the total loss to households and fake entrepreneurs. Therefore the social planner only cares
about the positive net present value of investment and increases k until it hits nonnegativity
constraints on t = 0 consumption.
    Dávila and Korinek (2017) show that in a class of models of which the canonical model
is a special case, the differences between the social planner’s problem and the competitive
equilibrium can be summarized by three sufficient statistics: the differences in the marginal
rates of substitution across agents, their trading positions, and the sensitivity of asset prices
to investment. The model with asymmetric information does not fall within this class, and
their result does not extend to it. Entrepreneurs have a higher marginal rate of substitution,
are net sellers of capital, and if condition (38) holds asset prices fall when investment rises.
Nevertheless, the social planner wants higher investment than in the competitive equilibrium.
    Note that one premise of the normative exercise is that the planner can redistribute across
agents at t = 0. If there are fire sale effects, this requires taking goods from households (and
possibly fake entrepreneurs) to compensate entrepreneurs for the lower prices that will result
from higher investment.8 If this redistribution is not feasible, then higher investment does
not result in a Pareto improvement, and its desirability will depend on the welfare weights
the planner places on each kind of agent. In the extreme case where the planner only cares
about entrepreneurs (for instance, because households and fake entrepreneurs are foreigners),
then avoiding fire sales justifies limiting investment irrespective of the microfoundation.


3       New Investment Margin
In this section I ask how the normative conclusions in the canonical model and the asym-
metric information model change if entrepreneurs have an additional opportunity to invest
at t = 1. Suppose entrepreneurs can convert ψ (x) goods at t = 1 into x units of capital that
will yield Ax consumption goods at t = 1.

Assumption 3.

    1. ψ (·) is increasing and convex, with ψ 0 (0) < z
    8
    In the canonical model, it is the other way around: entrepreneurs need to compensate households for
the profits they forgo when lower investment mitigates fire sales.

                                                  20
  2. (ψ 0 (x))2 < ψ (x) ψ 00 (x) for all x

    Assumption 3.1 ensures that the equilibrium amount of new investment at t = 1 is
positive. Assumption 3.2 means that ψ (·) is sufficiently convex that new investment does
not respond too strongly to asset prices.
    The entrepreneur’s t = 1 problem, both in the canonical model and in the asymmetric
information model, becomes:

                                                      ψ 0 (x) = q

The entrepreneur equates the marginal cost of delivering capital into period t = 2 across the
two ways of obtaining it: new investment at a cost of ψ 0 (x) or retaining maintained capital,
which has an opportunity cost of q. Assumption 3.1 ensures that the entrepreneur chooses
an interior solution.
   Replacing this back into the entrepreneur’s problem gives:

In the canonical model, sales of capital will be purchased by households, so the price of
capital will be equal to the marginal product of capital in the hands of households. The
equilibrium price will therefore satisfy:

This establishes the following result:

Proposition 3. In the canonical model with reinvestment, the social planner can obtain a
Pareto improvement by lowering investment relative to the competitive equilibrium.

     Introducing a new-investment margin does not change the overinvestment result. It is still
true that in equilibrium the ratio of marginal utilities across entrepreneurs and households
is Aq > 1 and the net present value of investment is zero, so shifting the terms of trade in
favor of entrepreneurs results in a Pareto improvement.


Asymmetric Information Model
Equilibrium in the asset market at t = 1, given a level of k, is determined the same way as
in the model without reinvestment. The only difference is that sales of real capital are given

                                                           22
by equation (48) instead of equation (15). As in the baseline, there is an equilibrium with
                                                                    Az
q = 0 and no investment and possibly interior equilibria with q = A−1    or corner equilibria
          Az
with q > A−1 and k = n.

Lemma 4.

  1. Taking k as given, the system of equations (35), (36), (48) has a unique solution q (k),
     θ∗ (k), s (k) for any k ≤ n.

  2. q 0 (k) < 0 if and only if condition (38) holds.

      Lemma 4 is an extension of Lemma 2. It means that the presence of fire sale effects in
the variant of the asymmetric information model with reinvestment at t = 1 depends on
the same forces as in the baseline. The uniqueness result relies on Assumption 3.2, which
limits how strongly sales of real capital react to asset prices. Without it, it is possible to
construct examples where higher asset prices induce higher sales of real capital to finance
new investment, which improves the pool of assets on sale and justifies the higher prices, a
standard source of multiple equilibria in variants of the Akerlof (1970) model.
      The social planner will solve problem (40), with the only difference that V (k, q (k)) is
defined by equation (47) and q (k), s (k) and θ∗ (k) are defined as the solution to the system
of equations (35), (36) and (48). At an interior point where the nonnegativity constraint on
c̄F0 (k) and c̄H
               0 (θ, k) don’t bind, the same steps that lead to equation (45) result in:

                                                                         

                                                                                Az
Evaluating this expression at an interior equilibrium where q =                A−1
                                                                                        and rearranging:

            dW (k)                   A−1−z
                            =                            [(A − 1) ψ 00 (x (q (k))) + Aq 0 (k)]
              dk     k=k∗       (A − 1) ψ 00 (x (q (k)))

This implies the following result:

Proposition 4. In the asymmetric information model with reinvestment:

  1. If there are no fire-sale effects (q 0 (k) ≥ 0), the social planner can obtain a Pareto
     improvement by raising investment relative to the competitive equilibrium.

  2. If there are fire-sale effects (q 0 (k) < 0), the social planner can obtain a Pareto im-
     provement by raising investment relative to the competitive equilibrium if the cost of

                                                    23
       t = 1 investment is sufficiently convex relative to the magnitude of fire-sale effects:

                                              A        |q 0 (k)|
                                                                   <1                                     (52)
                                            A − 1 ψ 00 (x (q (k)))

       Otherwise, the social planner can obtain a Pareto improvement by lowering investment
       relative to the competitive equilibrium.

    As in the baseline asymmetric information model, the planner recognizes that entrepreneurs
hold back on investment because they anticipate having to cross subsidize lemons; the plan-
ner wants to counteract this implicit tax and encourage higher investment at t = 0, knowing
that the social net present value of t = 0 investment is A − 1 − z > 0.
    On the other hand, in equilibrium there is also underinvestment at t = 1. Entrepreneurs
choose investment at t = 1 according to the first order condition ψ 0 (x) = q, while the efficient
level of investment (for instance, if entrepreneurs were able to borrow) would be ψ 0 (x) = A.
The net present value of marginal investments at t = 1 is A − ψ 0 (x) = A − q > 0. . If raising
the amount of investment at t = 0 results in a change in asset prices of q 0 (k),
                                                                                 this     results in
                  q 0 (k)
x0 (q) q 0 (k) = ψ00 (x) additional units of investment, with net present value ψA−q
                                                                                   00 (x)  q 0 (k).
    When condition (38) holds so that the model has fire sale effects, this is a negative
number: higher investment at t = 0 pushes down investment at t = 1 by lowering asset
prices. Effectively, the planner faces a tradeoff between underinvestment at t = 0 and
underinvestment at t = 1. Depending on how these two compare, the planner may want
to raise or lower t = 0 investment relative to the competitive equilibrium. Condition (52)
determines the direction of the net effect. The planner wants to lower t = 0 investment
              A                                                   Az    A      A−q
when (i) A−1     is high; at an interior equilibrium where q = A−1   , A−1 = A−1−z     is the ratio of
                                                                    A
the net present value of t = 1 investment to t = 0, so high A−1        means t = 1 investment is
                               00
relatively valuable; (ii) ψ (x) is low, so the marginal cost of investment is relatively flat and
t = 1 investment responds strongly to asset prices;9 and (iii) q 0 (k) is very negative, meaning
strong marginal fire sale effects.
    Instead, if condition (38) does not hold, then there is no tradeoff. By raising t = 0
investment, the planner raises asset prices and raises t = 1 investment. In this case, the
planner unambiguously wants to raise investment relative to the competitive equilibrium.
    Note that the effect on t = 1 investment is not, in the terminology of Dávila and Korinek
(2017), a distributive externality. The reason why the planner wants to raise asset prices is
   9
    ψ 00 (x) is the inverse of the coefficient of a regression of investment on Tobin’s q, so in principle it’s
straightforward to measure it empirically.


                                                      24
not as a way to redistribute towards entrepreneurs at t = 1 and indirectly replace the missing
credit market. Holding q constant, entrepreneurs use their marginal unit of wealth to retain
existing capital, not to build new capital. As in the baseline asymmetric information model,
whether or not entrepreneurs sell capital at t = 1 is neutral from the social planner’s point
of view, and therefore there is no social value in increasing entrepreneurs’ wealth at t = 1.
Instead, the reason why higher asset prices at t = 1 matter is that they determine the
discount factor that entrepreneurs apply to new investment. Entrepreneurs obtain Aq goods
at t = 2 by dedicating one good at t = 1 towards retaining existing capital, and therefore
require the same return from new investment. By raising asset prices the social planner lowers
the required return on new investment, and therefore mitigates t = 1 underinvestment. One
way to interpret the difference between this effect and a distributive externality is to imagine
that there was a way for the social planner to (unexpectedly) intervene at t = 1 and transfer
wealth from households to entrepreneurs, while keeping q constant. In the canonical model,
this would increase efficiency because entrepreneurs could afford to dedicate more capital to
its best use. Here instead keeping q constant would imply no change in t = 1 investment
and therefore no efficiency gain.


4     Investment by Fake Entrepreneurs
In this section I consider a a variant of the asymmetric information model where lemons are
created deliberately with the intent of being sold, a possibility has been studied recently by
Caramp (2016), Neuhann (2017) and Fukui (2018). Concretely, suppose that the amount of
lemons is the result of investment by fake entrepreneurs. They can convert ϕ (λ) goods at
t = 0 into λ lemons (uniformly distributed in [0, 1]) at t = 1, which they can then attempt
to sell in exchange for goods.

Assumption 4.

    1. ϕ (·) is increasing and convex, with ϕ0 (0) = 0

    2. ϕ0 nF > A
              

   Assumption 4 says that the marginal cost of the first lemon is zero, whereas if the fake
entrepreneurs were to use all their wealth to produce lemons, the marginal cost would exceed
the maximum price they could possibly get for them. This ensures that whenever there is
positive investment in real capital, there is an interior solution for how many lemons are
produced.

                                               25
     The fake entrepreneur’s problem becomes

                                                max          cF0 + cF1

                                              0 ,c1 ,s (i)

                                                        s.t.
                                             cF0 + ϕ (λ) ≤ nF
                                                   ˆ1
                                        cF1 ≤ q         sF (i) µ (i) di
                                                   0

                                                  sF (i) ≤ λ

   Using the fact that the fake entrepreneur will always attempt to sell its lemons (i.e
 F
s (i) = λ), the first order condition for investment in lemons is:

                                                        ˆ1
                                         0
                                       ϕ (λ) = q             µ (i) di = ρ                          (53)
                                                        0


Given a level of investment in real capital k, equilibrium in the t = 1 asset market requires
that {s, q, θ∗ , ρ, λ} satisfy: the optimal selling condition for (15); the indifference and market
clearing conditions (35) and (36); the rationing formula (39) and the first order condition
for fake investment (53). As in the baseline model, there always exists an equilibrium with
                                                                                  Az
q = 0 and, depending on parameters, there can be equilibria with q = z−1              and k ∈ [0, n]
                                      Az
and/or an equilibrium with q > A−1 and k = n.

Lemma 5.

     1. The system of equations (15), (35), (36), (39), (53) has a unique solution q (k), θ∗ (k),
        s (k), ρ (k), λ (k) for any k ≤ n.

     2. There exist cutoffs ēλ and ēq such that

         (a) λ0 (k) < 0 if and only if e1 (θ∗ (k)) < ēλ and
         (b) q 0 (k) < 0 if and only if e1 (θ∗ (k)) < ēq

     3. For ϕ00 (λ (k)) sufficiently large, then ēq > ēλ , so q 0 (k) < 0 is a necessary condition for
        λ0 (k) < 0

    Lemma 5 describes how asset prices and investment by fake entrepreneurs depend on
real investment k. If lemons did not face rationing in equilibrium (i.e. if µ (i) = 1 for all

                                                        26
i), or if µ (i) was an exogenous constant, then the first order condition (53) would imply a
direct relationship between asset prices q and revenue per unit from selling lemons ρ, and
therefore investment by fake entrepreneurs λ. However, the degree of rationing faced by
lemons responds endogenously to the level of investment, so q and ρ need not move in the
same direction. Part 2 of Lemma 5 says that the pattern from the baseline model, established
by Lemma 2, applies to both q and ρ. If there is a low level of wealth near the cutoff level of
expertise, higher k will lead to falls in both asset prices and fake investment. Even though
the cutoffs might be different, the basic force that leads to fire sale effects (a large fall in the
marginal level of expertise among asset buyers) also leads to lower fake investment. Part
3 says that if there is enough curvature in ϕ so that fake investment does not respond too
strongly to ρ, then there exist parameter combinations such that higher k leads to lower
q but higher ρ but not the other way around, so fire sale effects are a necessary but not
sufficient condition for fake investment to be decreasing in the level of real investment.
    The planner solves problem (40) with the only difference that the exogenous constant λ
is replaced by the function λ (k) and constraint (41) is replaced by
                              ˆ
                     cE
                      0   +       cH           F                        F
                                   0 (θ) dθ + c0 + k + ϕ (λ (k)) ≤ n + n + e0



in order to take into account that creating λ (k) lemons requires investing ϕ (λ (k)) resources.
The implicit assumption is that the planner can control the level of investment by real
entrepreneurs but cannot control fake entrepreneurs’ investment, which will be given by
(53). The planner just assigns a total cF0 + ϕ (λ (k)) goods at t = 0 to fake entrepreneurs,
understanding that how they will divide them between consumption and fake investment
depends on the level of real investment and the resulting asset market equilibrium.
    Following the same steps that result in expression (45) and using (53), the marginal social
value of investment is given by:

                                  dW (k)
                                         = A − 1 − z − ϕ0 (λ (k)) λ0 (k)
                                    dk
                                                       ϕ0 (λ (k)) 0
                                         = A − 1 − z − 00         ρ (k)
                                                       ϕ (λ (k))

This implies the following result:

Proposition 5. In the asymmetric information model with endogenous creation of lemons:

  1. If real investment lowers the average revenue from selling lemons (ρ0 (k) ≤ 0), the

                                                   27
      social planner can obtain a Pareto improvement by raising investment relative to the
      competitive equilibrium.

  2. If real investment raises the average revenue from selling lemons (ρ0 (k) > 0), the
     social planner can obtain a Pareto improvement by raising investment relative to the
     competitive equilibrium if the cost of producing lemons is sufficiently convex:

                                       1      ϕ0 (λ (k)) 0
                                                          ρ (k) < 1
                                    A − 1 − z ϕ00 (λ (k))

      Otherwise, the social planner can obtain a Pareto improvement by lowering investment
      relative to the competitive equilibrium.

    The social planner cares about the positive net present value of investment A − 1 − z
and the deadweight cost of fake investment. Whenever ρ0 (k) > 0 (which, using (53), implies
λ0 (k) > 0) this involves a tradeoff. Higher real investment increases the average revenue per
lemon ρ and therefore induces wasteful investment by fake entrepreneurs. If this effect is
large enough (which will be the case if the marginal cost of producing lemons is relatively
flat, so quantities respond strongly), then it’s possible that the social planner may want
to reduce investment relative to the competitive equilibrium. Instead, when λ0 (k) < 0,
there is no tradeoff. Higher investment has a positive net present value and also discourages
wasteful fake investment, so the planner unambiguously wants to raise investment relative
to the competitive equilibrium.
    Part 3 of Lemma 5 implies that if there are no fire sale effects (q 0 (k) > 0), this guarantees
that higher real investment encourages higher fake investment, so the social planner faces a
meaningful tradeoff. Instead, if there are fire sale effects (q 0 (k) < 0) then it’s possible that
the planner faces no tradeoff. Since fake entrepreneurs rely on the asset market, a worsening
of asset market conditions for selling lemons is actually helpful in deterring fake investment.
If µ were an exogenous constant, this would immediately imply that fire sale effects are
desirable: allowing for an endogenous response of fake investment strengthens the case for
raising investment relative to the competitive equilibrium. Lemma 5 gives conditions under
which the argument can be made precise while taking into account that q and ρ are not
exactly proportional.




                                                28
5    Conclusion
The main lesson from the above analysis is that the normative implications of fire sales are
not robust across different possible microfoundations. One should therefore be cautious in
extracting conclusive policy implications from the observation that investment booms lead
to collapses in asset prices and tightening financial constraints, even if the empirical fact
itself could be firmly established.
    In addition, it is worth devoting attention to try to determine what model best applies
in practice, which might be context-specific. A priori, one would expect the canonical model
to be a good fit for applications to investment in highly specific real assets such as airplanes,
where alternative uses run into sharply diminishing marginal returns. Instead, the asymmet-
ric information model may be a better fit for investment in complex financial instruments
such as tranches of mortgage-backed CDOs, which are hard for non-experts to evaluate. Em-
pirically, distinguishing between the models is challenging because many of the predictions
similar: in both models, higher initial investment leads to falling asset prices and to increased
profits for the average arbitrageur who buys at the fire sale price. An open challenge is to
develop precise empirical tests that can tell the models apart.
    Of course, these are not the only two possible explanations of fire sales. Other prominent
theories include models with differences of opinion (Fostel and Geanakoplos 2008, Geanako-
plos 2009), cash-in-the-market pricing (Allen and Gale 1994, 1998, Acharya and Yorulmazer
2008) or signal extraction in the presence of noise traders (Grossman and Stiglitz 1980, Calvo
1999). I expect the non-robustness of the normative implications of fire sales to to extend
to this broader class of models a well.

Proof of Lemma 2
   1. Replacing (15) into (35) and solving for q:
                                                           q
                                              −zk +         (zk)2 + 4λ (1 − θ∗ ) zkA
                                q (θ∗ ) =                                                                   (54)
                                                                     2λ (1 − θ∗ )

      Replacing (15) and (54) in (36) and rearranging:

                                         ˆ1
                                                                 1
                             Φ (θ∗ ) ≡                                                  e1 (θ) dθ − 1 = 0   (55)
                                              zk + q       (θ∗ ) λ (1          − θ)
                                         θ∗


      (θ∗ , q, s) is a solution to the system of equations if and only if Φ (θ∗ ) = 0, q = q (θ∗ )
      and s = zk   q
                     . To establish existence, note that since q (θ∗ ) ≤ A, and k < n, it follows
      that:
                                              ˆ1
                                         ∗          1
                                     Φ (θ ) >            e1 (θ) dθ − 1
                                                 zk + Aλ
                                                      θ∗



                                                            30
  so Assumption 2 ensures that for sufficiently low θ∗ , Φ (θ∗ ) > 0. Furthermore, for θ∗
  sufficiently close to 1, Φ (θ∗ ) < 0 and since Φ (θ∗ ) is a continuous function, a solution
  to (55) exists. To establish uniqueness, take the derivative of Φ (θ∗ ):

                                                                ˆ1
       0    ∗              1                                                λ (1 − θ)
     Φ (θ ) = −                          e1 (θ∗ ) − q 0 (θ∗ )                                  e1 (θ) dθ
                zk + q (θ∗ ) λ (1 − θ∗ )                             [zk + q (θ∗ ) λ (1 − θ)]2
                                                                θ∗


  Taking the the derivative of (54):
                                                                                        0.5 
                                                 ∗              2              ∗
                           2λzk zk + 2λ (1 − θ ) A − (zk) + 4λ (1 − θ ) zkA
             q 0 (θ∗ ) =                                                 0.5                     >0
                                 4λ2 (1 − θ∗ )2 (zk)2 + 4λ (1 − θ∗ ) zkA

  This is positive because:

                                             4λ2 (1 − θ∗ )2 A2 > 0
           ⇒ 4λ2 (1 − θ∗ )2 A2 + (zk)2 + 4λ (1 − θ∗ ) Azk > (zk)2 + 4λ (1 − θ∗ ) Azk
                                     ⇒ (zk + 2λ (1 − θ∗ ) A)2 > (zk)2 + 4λ (1 − θ∗ ) zkA
                                                                                                      0.5
                                       ⇒ zk + 2λ (1 − θ∗ ) A > (zk)2 + 4λ (1 − θ∗ ) zkA

  The fact that q 0 (θ∗ ) > 0 implies that Φ0 (θ∗ ) < 0. Since Φ (θ∗ ) is monotonically
  decreasing, there is a unique solution to equation (55).

2. Rewrite (35), (36), (15) as
                                              Γ (q, θ∗ , s; k) = 0

Proof of Lemma 4
   1. Replacing (48) into (35), q (θ∗ ) solves:

      Note that

      where the last step follows from using the definition x (q) ≡ (ψ 0 )−1 (q) and Assumption
      3.2. Also, limq→0 Ω (q, θ∗ ) > +∞ and limq→A Ω (q, θ∗ ) > −∞. This implies that for
      each θ∗ ∈ [0, 1] there is a unique q (θ∗ ) that satisfies (48) and (35). Also note that

                                                  ∂Ω (q (θ∗ ) , θ∗ )     q (θ∗ )

  so, using the implicit function theorem:
                                                                       ∗       ∗)

                                                                ∂θ∗

  Replacing q (θ∗ ) into (36) gives (55), so the same steps that lead to the proof of part
  1 of Lemma 2 apply.

     Since ϕis convex, (53) defines an increasing relationship between ρ and λ. Together
     with (63), this implies that there can be at most one value of λ that satisfies (15), (35),
     (36), (39) and (53). Assumption then implies that a solution exists.

    Therefore if ∂k > 0 then q 0 (k) < 0 follows immediately. Instead if ∂k     < 0, the

    right hand side of (65) is increasing in Λ (ρ), so it suffices to show the result for

           and the inequality follows from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Therefore by
           continuity there exists ēq such that q 0 (k) < 0 if and only if e1 (θ∗ (k)) < ēq .

  3. Since Λ0 (ρ) = ϕ00 (Λ(ρ))

                               , then for sufficiently large ϕ00 we have Λ0 (ρ) → 0, which implies

     q 0 (k) → ∂k . Therefore it is sufficient to prove that λ0 (k) < 0 implies ∂k      < 0. Note

     Assume λ0 (k) < 0. By the argument in part 2a, this requires                           ∂k
                                                                                                 < 0, so using (64):

                                         ∂q
     and therefore, using (59),          ∂k
                                              < 0.
