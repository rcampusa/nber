Popular Attitudes towards Markets and Democracy: Russia and United States Compared 25

                                            ABSTRACT

We repeat a survey we did in the waning days of the Soviet Union (Shiller, Boycko and Korobov,
AER 1991) comparing attitudes towards free markets between Moscow and New York. Additional
survey questions, from Gibson Duch and Tedin (J. Politics 1992) are added to compare attitudes towards
democracy. Two comparisons are made: between countries, and through time, to explore the existence
of international differences in allegiance to democratic free-market institutions, and the stability of
these differences. While we find some differences in attitudes towards markets across countries and
through time, we do not find most of the differences large or significant. Our evidence does not support
a common view that the Russian personality is fundamentally illiberal or non-democratic.

  Public attitudes toward markets and toward democracy are fundamental to the well-functioning
of an economy and a society. Attitudes toward markets and attitudes toward democracy are
naturally connected: both are about individual freedoms, how they should be allowed, how the
freedoms can be assured, or, on the other hand, how they should be limited.
  In 1990, a year before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, while one of us, Boycko, lived in
Moscow, and while the other, Shiller, lived in New Haven, in the greater New York area, we did
a telephone survey of the general public in the respective cities (with Ukrainian survey expert
Vladimir Korobov) about attitudes toward markets. Questions were about fair prices and income
inequality, resistance to exchange of money, lack of appreciation for incentives, and hostility
toward business, (see Shiller et al (1991)). The questions, as well as questions in our follow-up
survey Shiller et al (1992), were identical as far as the translation between Russian and English
would allow, and as far as our impressions of how the questions would be understood could be.
We designed questions that would reveal the underpinnings of attitudinal differences between the
countries, based on our personal impressions in our respective countries of the significant
underlying differences. Our questions avoided direct use of abstract concepts, like “markets” or
“capitalism”, as we were concerned that these may have subtly different meanings in the two
countries, colored by culture, associations, prevailing senses of politically correct usage, etc.
Instead we asked respondents about their behavior in, or evaluations of, imaginary scenarios that
resemble real life situations that the respondents in both countries were likely familiar with.
  In the same year, 1990, political scientists James Gibson, Raymond Duch and Kent Tedin,
(1992) did a telephone survey in Moscow with questions about attitudes toward democracy. We
felt their survey contained some of the same spirit as ours and similar methodology. Although
Gibson et al (1992) did not provide an explicit comparison with US or another developed
democracy, they largely avoided asking directly about “democracy”, “competition among
political parties”, or “strong leader”. 1 Instead, their respondents were mostly asked to evaluate
social rules applied to specific situations or scenarios. The questions probed attitudes to social
norms, freedoms, rights consciousness, tolerance of minority views, support for dissent, etc.



  1
    A good example of this more direct approach to measuring Russian political attitudes is Hale (2011). See Guriev et al 2008 and Treisman
(2011, pp 377-388) for recent surveys of this literature.
   In this paper, we report on a new survey that we have done in 2015, twenty-five years after
these 1990 surveys. The script for the interviewer had as its first part the identical questions that
we asked in 1990 (then called Questionnaire B), and in the identical order, followed by seven of
the questions asked by Gibson et al, though not an exact ordered sequence of their question
scripts. Since the Gibson et al. survey in 1990 was in Russian only, we did a retranslation of their
original Russian questions into English, making slight improvements in the accuracy of the
translation over the English translation of the questions that were presented in the Gibson et al.
(1992) paper. 2
       Knowing that answers to questionnaires are influenced by framing, and by the previous
questions asked, we wanted to make the procedure identical through time as much as possible,
which is something we could do for the first part of the interviews. The details of the 1990
surveys are in Shiller et al. (1991) and Gibson et al. (1992). The 2015 Russian survey, carried out
in Moscow in November 2015 by the Russian survey firm ADAPT, produced 301 responses, 151
from landline and 150 from mobile, while the United States survey, carried out in Greater New
York City November 2015 by Survey Sampling Inc., produced 300 responses, 170 from landline
and 130 from mobile. Additional characteristics of the five surveys are in Table A1 below.



                       I.         Changes in Russia and in the United States over 25 Years

   Since 1990, Russia has experienced tectonic changes in its economic and political system,
largely succeeding in building a market economy, but failing to develop a functioning
democracy. The EBRD transition indicators index for Russia, that tracks progress in market
reforms against standards of industrialized market economies along six dimensions, has
increased from an average of 1.0 in 1990 to 3.3 in 2014 (the index range is from 1.0 to 4.3). The
gains in the Polity2 index for Russia, that measures the level of democracy, were more modest:
from 0 in 1990 to 4 in 2014 (the range is from -10 to 10).
   A popular interpretation in recent years is that Russians' attitudes have been to blame for the
lack of progress on democracy, that Russians understand the workings and advantages of free
markets, but not of democracy. In 2004, Russian oligarch-turned-dissident Mikhail

                                                                      4
Khodorkovsky, while serving his prison term, had the following to say about President Vladimir
Putin: he “is probably neither liberal, nor democratic. But he is still more liberal and democratic
than 70 percent of our country’s population " 3.
  While illiberal and non-democratic attitudes are certainly common in Russia, the question is
how frequent they are compared to the same attitudes in developed democracies. Gibson et al
(1992) showed that these frequencies were in fact low in 1990, generally comparable to those
observed in developed countries with functioning democracies. An important objective of our
2015 surveys was to explore if the frequencies of non-democratic attitudes are still low in Russia
and to compare them directly to United States.
  Another recent development in Russia is massive and, admittedly, effective government
propaganda effort 4, which has a substantial anti-Western component. “Western democracy” is
generally portrayed as dysfunctional, amoral, hypocritical, etc., which has likely damaged public
perception of the concept of democracy, and might have affected the fundamental attitudes to it
as well. We believe that in the current, “propaganda-intensive” environment, responses to the
questions in our survey, mostly focused on social rules applied to specific situations, have a
better chance of revealing fundamental public attitudes than the more direct questions about
democracy.
  In the United States, economic and political changes since 1990 appear less dramatic. In 1990
Ronald Reagan’s free market revolution was still new, but already suffering from concerns that
deregulation had spawned a savings and loan crisis. By 2015, doubts about free markets were
reinforced by the 2008 financial crisis. Doubts can be observed through social movements such
as the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011, the surge of concern with inequality as with
Piketty (2014), the expressions of fears of dangers to working people from robotics destroying
economic power of working people, and the enthusiastic reception to socialist Bernie Sanders of
2015.
  Changes in the two countries over the 25 year period presented certain challenges for our
survey methodology and data analysis. The proliferation of mobile phones in both countries
required us to get representative samples of the users of the two kinds of telephones. Large shifts
in the composition of the underlying populations of Moscow and New York necessitated

additional attention to control variables. However, probit regressions with controls for age, sex,
education level, foreign origin, rural origin, and cell phone confirmed statistical significance of
“large” differences between countries or over time with only a few exceptions.
  When presenting our results below we report the frequencies of “anti-market” and “anti-
democracy” responses. In calculating these frequencies we omit “No answer” responses from
the denominator. Same-year differences between the two countries that in our probit regressions
are statistically significant at 5% and at 1% are marked by “C” and “CC”, respectively; statistically
significant differences within a country over time (between 1990 and 2015) are marked by “T”
(at 5%) and “TT” (at 1%).

                                 II.     Attitudes toward Free Markets

  Our original conclusion from the 1990 survey was that attitudes toward markets were
surprisingly similar between Russia and the United States. We find they are generally as similar
in 2015, maybe even more so.
  For example, in our 1990 survey we asked a question that referred to demand-induced
increases of prices of flowers on holidays, implicitly alluding to the International Woman’s Day
in Russia, when even in the Soviet times men routinely bought flowers for wives and girlfriends,
and to Mothers’ Day in the U.S.:
  B2. “On a holiday, when there is a great demand for flowers, their prices usually go up. Is it
fair for flowers sellers to raise their prices like this?”
                                         M90                 NY90       M15              NY15
                No                       66%                 68%T         67%CC           55%TCC


  We see that in both countries people are opposed to this outcome of free markets: higher prices
are unfair. The only change here we observe in 2015 – relatively small in magnitude, but
statistically significant – relates to New York, where tolerance to price hikes have actually
increased, not decreased, as movements like Occupy Wall Street might suggest.
  We sharpened the same question by removing any possible cost justification for increased
prices, and still get similar results:




                                                     6
   B11. “A small factory produces kitchen tables and sells them at $1000 each. There is so much
demand for the tables that it cannot meet it fully. The factory decides to raise the price of its
tables by $100, when there was no change in the costs of producing tables. Is this fair?”
                                                            M90                     NY90              M15                   NY15
                       No                                    66%                      70%              68%C                    57%C


(Prices were indexed to inflation in both B11 and B7 below, and presented in local currency.)
   A follow-up question asked about the policy implications of these fairness judgements:
   B3. “Should the government introduce limits on the increase in prices of flowers, even if it
might produce a shortage of flowers?”
                                                            M90                     NY90              M15                   NY15
                        Yes                                54%CC                    28%CC             43%CC                22%CC


   Here a significant difference remains between Russians and Americans, although now in both
countries respondents are less supportive of government regulation. 5
   Another follow-up question was about whether the factory should have the right to increase
prices:

   B12. “Apart from fairness, should the factory have the right to raise the price in this
situation?”
                                                            M90                     NY90              M15                   NY15
                       No                                   43%TT                     41%            53%TTCC                  35%CC


   In this case we register a statistically significant, even if not large, shift in attitudes in Moscow
in the “anti-market” direction both over time and relative to New York. 6
   We also explored perception of speculation as a potential reason for price increases. In 1990,
Russians were less likely than Americans to attribute a price increase in world markets to
speculators’ efforts. Today, these attitudes have effectively reversed across countries: Russians



   5
       The changes over time in both countries, however, are not statistically significant.
   6
     Our probit regression reveals that education has stronger effect on responses to B12 than geography: those with education level of “some
college” or higher are 20 percentage points less likely to answer “no” than the lesser educated part of the sample.
are more likely to hold speculators responsible, while Americans are skeptical of speculators’
capabilities.

  B6. “If the price of coffee on the world market suddenly increased by 30%, what do you think
is likely to be to blame? [Responses:] 1. Interventions of some government. 2. Such things as bad
harvest in Brazil or unexpected changes in demand. 3. Speculators’ effort to raise prices.”

                                      M90             NY90            M15             NY15
3. Speculators’ effort to raise
prices                                 32%TTCC        51%TTCC          54%TTCC         33%TTCC


  One of the differences that surprised us in the 1990 survey was that Americans were more
intolerant than Russians of compensated price increases, including a compensated increase in the
aggregate level of prices. Today the level of intolerance is the same in two countries, at about
65%.

  B10. “Suppose that economists have come to the conclusion that we could substantially
improve our standard of living in the next year if we would be willing to accept a thirty percent
inflation rate (increase in the prices of goods by 30%). This would mean that our incomes would
rise by more than 30%. Then we could buy more goods at the new higher prices. Would you
support such a proposal?”

                                      M90            NY90             M15             NY15


       No                              53%C             72%C             63%             65%




  Back in 1990 we found some evidence that Russians were, to a certain extent, less willing than
Americans to accept exchange of money as a solution to problems. In 2015, we observe smaller
differences between countries, although they remain statistically significant, as in responses to
the question below:




                                                 8
  B7. “You are standing in a long line to buy something. You see that someone comes to the line
and is very distressed that the line is so long, saying he is in a great hurry and absolutely must
make this purchase. A person at the front of the line offers to let him take his place in line for
$50. Would you be annoyed at this deal even though it won't cause you to wait any longer?”
                                       M90             NY90            M15             NY15


     Yes                               69%TCC          44%CC           57%TCC           44%CC


  In 1990 we were surprised to find only a small (and not statistically significant) difference
between Russians and Americans in their level of concern about a possible future government
confiscation of savings. Although soon after our survey people’s savings in Russia were wiped
out by the government printing money, this experience apparently had no lasting effect, as
evidenced in responses to the following question:
  B8. “How likely is it, from your point of view, that the government in the next few years will
take measures, in one way or another, to prevent those who have saved a great deal from making
use of their savings? Is it quite likely, possible, unlikely or impossible that the government will
do this?”
                                       M90             NY90            M15             NY15


“quite likely”+”possible”               61%             52%             50%              54%



  Still, at around 50%, the level of concern about confiscation of savings remains substantial in
both countries, actually.
  Another unexpected result of the 1990 study was Russians’ relative willingness to make large
risky investments in a business of a group of friends. Perhaps due to negative experience or
improved investment opportunities this willingness has declined and there are no intercountry
differences here anymore:
  B5. “Suppose that a group of your friends are starting a business that you think is very risky
and could fail but might also make investors in that business rich. Would you be tempted to
invest a substantial portion of your savings in it?”
                                                    M90                  NY90                   M15                    NY15
          No
                                                     59%TT                    67%                  71%TT                   75%


  Transition to a market economy improves labor incentives by making consumer goods and
services available at market clearing prices, rather than through queues and other non-price
rationing mechanisms. We see evidence of this in a sharp, 31-percentage point, increase in
Russians’ willingness to work hard to earn more money, as documented below:
  B9. “Suppose that for certain reasons you are offered a 10% increase in the duties you
perform at your work place with the following terms: your workweek will be increased by 1/10
(say, you will work an additional half a day) and your take-home pay will also increase by 10%.
If you take this offer, this has no other effects on your prospects for promotion or relations with
co-workers. Do you consider it attractive to have less free time, but more money, so that you
would take this offer, or would you decide to reject it?”
                                                    M90                  NY90                   M15                    NY15


I will definitely reject the offer                   73%TTCC                51%CC                 42%TTCC                 58%CC



  Americans willingness to work harder for money has slightly decreased over the period and
they are now behind Russians in this respect 7.
  In responses to another work-related question, we document a moderate “anti-market” shift in
Russians’ views of whether it is appropriate to take initiative at work:
В1. “In your opinion, which of the following statements is closer to the truth? 1) An employee
who works hard and has the best interests of the business at heart can be worth twice as much to
his company as less well-motivated employee. 2) As a rule, an employee should generally do just
what he is told- trying to do much more is likely to do more harm than help. “
                                                    M90                  NY90                   M15                    NY15
                         2)                           11%T                    11%                 20%TCC                  10%CC




  7
     In 1990, only 2% of respondents in Moscow worked in private firms, while in 2015 42% did. In New York, the change was in the other
direction: from 53% in 1990 to 43% in 2015.

                                                                   10
   And today, as 25 years ago, Russians remain more interested than Americans in becoming
wealthy through success in business:
   B4. “Which of the following achievements would please you more?” [Response choices: 1)
You win fortune without fame: you make enough money through successful business dealings so
that you can live very comfortably for the rest of your life; 2) You win fame without fortune: for
example, you win a medal at the Olympics or you become a respected journalist or scholar.]
                                                       M90                    NY90                   M15                     NY15

   As a general summary of these results, while there are differences, we see a basic similarity
across countries and through time. Sometimes Russians have a dimmer view of free market
outcomes and incentives, sometimes the Americans.

                                             III.       Attitudes toward Democracy

   In Table 1 below we present frequencies of “anti-democratic” responses to seven questions
about democracy from Gibson et al (1992) in the three subsamples. The “anti-democratic”
responses are “agree” or “completely agree” in questions B13, B14, B15, and B18, but
“disagree” or “completely disagree” in B16, B17, and B19 (we reordered and renumbered
Gibson’s questions)
   In responses to three out of the seven questions (B13, B14, B15) we document an increase in
anti-democratic attitudes in Moscow between 1990 and 2015 8 and these same attitudes are the
only ones that appear substantially stronger in Moscow than in New York in 2015.
   We observe a regrettable increase in Russians’ intolerance of minority views, as evidenced in
responses to B13. But, at 37%, the frequency of this intolerance remains below 50% and not too
far from that of Americans (29%).
   In 1990, most Russians used to support the freedom of demonstrations by radical and extremist
groups that may lead to disorder and destruction (question B14), in 2015 they no longer do. But
in 2015 Russians may overreact to the words “radical” and “extremist” that are heavily employed



   8
      Strictly speaking, the results of our 2015 survey and those of Gibson et al (1992) are not directly comparable because of differences in
survey methodology (telephone interviews vs. in-home interviews) and geography (Moscow vs. Moscow region). Significance tests reported in
the table below for changes through time in their Moscow questions also do not account for any control variables.
by government propaganda, with its emphasis on discrediting “color revolutions” in neighboring
countries. Nevertheless, the difference with Americans is large, at 31 percentage points.
   Still, the largest difference with Americans that we found, of 41 percentage points in responses
to question B15, relates to a preference for a society with strict order at the expense of some
freedoms that may bring “destruction to the society”. This preference, at 76% in Moscow today,
is not too different from 69%, recorded by Gibson et al (1992) 25 years ago. 9
   The other differences between Russians and Americans in attitudes toward democracy, as
evidenced in responses to questions B16-B19 in Table 1, appear fairly small and unimportant, or
go in the other direction.
   Is the glass of Russians’ attitudes to democracy half-full or half-empty? While in several
respects “pro-democracy” attitudes are not as strong in Russia today as 25 years ago and weaker
than those of contemporary Americans, we find strong correlation between our survey results
and those of Gibson et al (1992) who “… discovered far more support for democratic values in
Moscow than [they] anticipated” (p. 360).

                                                   IV.        Interpretation of Results

  Back in 1990, before the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the launch of President Yeltsin’s
market reforms, a common view in Russia was that ordinary Russians are “not ready” for the
transition to a market economy, because they do not understand the markets and have different
values. The impact of Shiller et. al. (1991), despite its finding of some interesting attitudinal
differences between Russians and Americans, was to demonstrate that this view was really not
supported by evidence. Today, after 25 years of development of markets in Russia, that old view
sounds almost ridiculous. The new evidence presented in this paper, building on the earlier
results of Gibson et al (1992), again uncovers some differences between Russians and Americans
in their attitudes toward democracy. Yet on balance the evidence does not support a parallel
common view that the Russian personality is fundamentally illiberal or non-democratic.
Perhaps at some point in the future this view will sound ridiculous, too.




   9
    One caveat that we have about this result is the accuracy of the translation: despite our best efforts to find the proper English equivalent, the
formulation of the alternative to “strict order” in Russian may remain somewhat stronger-worded than in English: «Лучше жить в обществе со
строгим порядком, чем дать людям так много свободы, что они смогут стать разрушителями общества».

  Introduction:


  Hi my name is___ I am calling on behalf of Cowles Foundation for Research on Economics at
Yale University. We are conducting a survey of public opinion of residents of the greater New
York City area. Our interview touches on attitude to economic problems. We are not selling
anything and your responses are strictly confidential and anonymous. Is this a good time to
participate?


  Agent note: terminate business phone numbers and dispose them accordingly in the sample.


  QS1. Are you at least 18 years old?


    1. Yes- continue to QB1
    2. No- proceed to QS1_1


  Qs1_1. Is there any other member in your household who is at least 18 years old?


    1. Yes- loop back intro
    2. No- callback


  В1. In your opinion, which of the following statements is closer to the truth?

   1. An employee who works hard and has the best interests of the business at heart can be
      worth twice as much to his company as less well-motivated employee.
   2. As a rule, an employee should generally do just what he is told- trying to do much more
      is likely to do more harm than help.
   3. No answer

  B2. On a holiday, when there is a great demand for flowers, their prices usually go up. Is it
fair for flowers sellers to raise their prices like this?

   1. Yes
   2. No
   3. No answer

                                                     16
  B3. Should the government introduce limits on the increase in prices of flowers, even if it
might produce a shortage of flowers?

   1. Yes
   2. No
   3. No answer

  B4. Which of the following achievements would please you more?

   1. You win fortune without fame: you make enough money through successful business
      dealing so that you can live very comfortably for the rest of your life.
   2. You win fame without fortune: for example you win a medal at the Olympics or you
      become a respected journalist or scholar.
   3. No answer

  B5. Suppose that a group of your friends are starting a business that you think is very risky and
could fail but might also make investors in that business rich. Would you be tempted to invest a
substantial portion of your savings in it?

   1. Yes
   2. No
   3. No answer

  B6. If the price of coffee on the world market suddenly increased by 30%, what do you think is
likely to be to blame?

   1. Interventions of some government.
   2. Such things as bad harvest in Brazil or unexpected changes in demand.
   3. Speculators’ effort to raise prices
   4. No answer


  B7. You are standing in a long line to buy something. You see that someone comes to the line
and is very distressed that the line is so long, saying he is in a great hurry and absolutely must
make this purchase. A person at the front of the line offers to let him take his place in line for
$50. Would you be annoyed at this deal even though it won’t cause you to wait any longer?

   1. Yes
   2. No
   3. No answer

  B8. How likely is it, from your point of view, that the government in the next few years will
take measures, in one way or another, to prevent those who have saved a great deal from making
use of their savings? Is it quite likely, possible, unlikely or impossible that the government will
do this?

at your work place with the following terms: your workweek will be increased by 1/10 (say, you
will work an additional half a day) and your take-home pay will also increase by 10%. If you
take this offer, this has no other effects on your prospects for promotion or relations with co-
workers. Do you consider it attractive to have less free time, but more money, so that you would
take this offer, or would you decide to reject it?

   1. I will definitely reject the offer.
   2. I will be more or less indifferent
   3. I will definitely accept the offer
   4. No answer

  B10. Suppose that economists have come to the conclusion that we could substantially
improve our standard of living in the next year if we would be willing to accept a thirty percent
inflation rate (increase in the prices of goods by 30%). This would mean that our incomes would
rise by more than 30%. Then we could buy more goods at the new higher prices. Would you
support such a proposal?


                                                     18
   1. Yes
   2. No
   3. No answer

  B11. A small factory produces kitchen tables and sells them at $1000 each. There is so much
demand for the tables that it cannot meet it fully. The factory decides to raise the price of its
tables by $100, when there was no change in the costs of producing tables. Is this fair?

   1. Yes
   2. No
   3. No answer


  B12. Apart from fairness, should the factory have the right to raise the price in this situation?

   1. Yes
   2. No
   3. No answer

 Здравствуйте, я провожу опрос общественного мнения для исследовательской
компании Адепт. Ваш номер телефона был выбран случайным образом. Я хотел бы
задать вам несколько вопросов о ваших взглядах на экономику. Наш опрос
преследует чисто научные цели и мы гарантируем анонимность ваших ответов. Я
займу не более десяти минут вашего времени.


 В1. Как вы считаете, какое из следующих утверждений ближе к истине:
   1. работник, который усердно трудится и принимает близко к сердцу интересы
      дела, может быть в два раза более ценным для своей организации, чем менее
      усердный работник.
   2. как правило, работник должен делать только то, что ему велят - если он
      старается сделать намного больше, то это скорее принесет вред, чем пользу.
   3. нет ответа

 В2. На праздники, когда спрос на цветы особенно велик, цены на них обычно
возрастают. Справедливо ли, что продавцы цветов поднимают цены?
   1. да
   2. нет
   3. затрудняюсь ответить

 В3. Должно ли государство вводить ограничения на рост цен на цветы, даже если в
результате таких ограничений может возникать дефицит цветов?
   1. да
   2. нет
   3. затрудняюсь ответить
 В4. Какое из следующих жизненных достижений принесло бы вам больше
удовлетворения:
   1. вы становитесь богатым, но не знаменитым: в результате удачных деловых
      операций вы заработали достаточно денег, чтобы комфортабельно провести
      всю последующую жизнь.
   2. вы становитесь знаменитым, но не богатым: к примеру, вы завоевываете
      медаль на олимпийских играх или становитесь уважаемым журналистом или
      ученым.
   3. нет ответа

 В5. Предположим, что группа ваших друзей открывает деловое предприятие,
которое, с вашей точки зрения, весьма рискованно и может провалиться, но может
также сделать богатыми тех, кто вложит в него деньги. Сочли бы вы заманчивым
вложить в такое предприятие значительную часть своих сбережений?
   1. да
   2. нет
   3. затрудняюсь ответить

 В6. Если цена на кофе на мировом рынке неожиданно поднимается на 30%, как вы
думаете, что скорее всего стоит за этим?
   1. целенаправленные действия какого-нибудь государства
   2. такие причины, как неурожай в Бразилии, или непредвиденное изменение
      спроса
   3. стремление спекулянтов повысить цены
   4. не знаю

 В7. Вы стоите в длинной очереди за какой-нибудь покупкой. Вы видите, как кто-то
подходит к очереди и очень расстраивается, что очередь такая длинная, а он спешит,
и ему совершенно необходимо купить эту вещь. Один из стоящих в начале очереди
людей предлагаем ему уступить свое место за 3 тысячи рублей. Вызовет ли у вас
раздражение такая сделка, даже если из-за этого вам не придется дольше ждать?
   1. да
   2. нет
   3. затрудняюсь ответить

 В8. Насколько вероятно, с вашей точки зрения, что государство в ближайшие
несколько лет предпримет какие-нибудь меры, чтобы так или иначе не дать


                                           26
возможности тем, кто накопил большие сбережения, воспользоваться ими? Считаете
ли вы, что это весьма вероятно, возможно, маловероятно или невозможно?
   1.   весьма вероятно
   2.   возможно
   3.   маловероятно
   4.   невозможно
   5.   затрудняюсь ответить

 В9. Предположим, что по некоторым причинам вам предлагают увеличить на 10%
ваши     непосредственные      обязанности    на   работе   на   следующих   условиях.
Продолжительность вашей рабочей недели возрастет на 1/10 (например, вы будет
работать дополнительно полдня в неделю), одновременно ваша зарплата также
повышается на 10%. Если вы примете предложение, это никак не отразиться на
перспективах вашего служебного роста и на ваших отношениях с коллегами.
Сочтете ли вы заманчивым иметь меньше свободного времени, но больше денег, и
примете это предложение или решите отказаться от него?
   1.   я наверняка откажусь от такого предложения
   2.   мне будет более или менее все равно
   3.   я наверняка приму такое предложение
   4.   нет ответа

 В10. Предположим, что экономисты пришли к выводу, что мы сможем в будущем
году    значительно    повысить     наш      уровень   жизни,    если   согласимся   на
тридцатипроцентную инфляцию (повышение цена на 30%). Это означает, что наши
доходы должны будут вырасти более, чем на 30%. Тогда мы сможем купить больше
товаров при новых, более высоких ценах. Поддержали бы вы такое предложение?
   1. да
   2. нет
   3. затрудняюсь ответить

 В11. Небольшое предприятие производит кухонные столы и продает их по 40
тысяч рублей за штуку. Спрос на столы настолько велик, что предприятие не может
его полностью удовлетворить. Предприятие решает поднять цены на 4 тысячи
рублей, хотя его затраты на производство не изменились. Справедливо ли это?
   1. да
