             Exchange Rates, Inflation, and the Sterilization Problem:
                                Germany, 1975—1981



                                      Abstract

          When the goals of internal and external macroeconomic equilibrium are

in conflict, sterilized intervention in the foreign exchange market may pro-

vide an independent policy instrument through which the central bank can re-

solve its dilemma in the short run. This paper is concerned with the West

German   Bundesbank's   use of sterilization during the recent years of exchange—

rate flexibility. The paper asks whether the Bundesbank pursued steriliza-

tion during the years 1975-1981, and whether sterilized foreign exchange

intervention exerts a significant influence on the exchange rate in the German

case. Estimation of a stylized Bundesbank reaction function suggests an af-

firmative answer to the first of these questions.

         To assess the efficacy of sterilized intervention, a structural

portfolio balance model of German asset markets and prices is estimated. Dynamic

perfect—foresight simulations of the empirical model are used to ascertain whether

imperfect substitutability between foreign and domestic bonds is sufficient to

allow the Bundesbank to attain independent internal and external goals over

the short run of about a month. The model's verdict is that the Bundesbank has

little if any power to influence the exchange rate over that time span without

altering current or expected future money—market conditions.

 1. Introduction

       The conflict between internal and external equilibrium has been a

 recurrent theme of the balance—of—payments literature. The conflict arises

when the domestic credit measures appropriate for attaining a domestic

policy target move the economy away from an important external target.

Central banks have often attempted to resolve such dilemmas by sterilizing

the monetary effects of foreign reserve flows in the hope of temporarily

divorcing their domestic policies from balance-of-payments considerations.

       Sterilized or "pure foreign exchange intervention leaves money

supplies unchanged but alters privately-held stocks of outside currency—

denominated debt.1 Pure intervention can have no exchange rate effects

when domestic and foreign bonds are perfectly si±stitutable   in
portfolios. If debt management policies do influence the exchange rate,

however, they provide a second policy instrument (along with domestic credit

policy) through which the monetary authority can simultaneously achieve its

internal and external targets in the short run.2 The extent to which ster-

ilized intervention is effective in practice is an unresolved issue [see

Genberg (1981) , Mussa (1981) , and Obstfeld (1982a)].

       The recent experience of West Germany illustrates both the nature of the

policy dilemma that may arise under flexible exchange rates and the potential

role of sterilized intervention in dilemma situations. Between the end of 1980

and the end of 1981, Germany faced domestic stagnation, high foreign interest

rates, massive current—account deficits, and a depreciating exchange rate.

The activity slowdown required monetary expansion and a fall in home inter-

est rates. But policies appropriate from a purely internal standpoint

would have worsened inflation immediately, in spite of domestic slack, by

triggering further Deutschemark depreciation. This external side-effect
                                     2




reduces the cumulative expansionary impact of a less stringent

monetary policy, and also raises firms' real costs by increasing

thepricesof imported intermediate production inputs. The policy dilemma

could have been avoided if sterilized official dollar sales had

been capable of preventing the Deutschemark fran depreciating in the face

of a less restrictive domestic credit policy.

       This paper is concerned with the German Bundesbank's use of steriliza-

tion during the recent years of exchange-rate flexibility. The paper asks

whether the Bundesbank pursued a sterilization policy during the years 1975—

1981, and whether sterilized foreign exchange intervention is effective in

the German case.

       The first question is answered by estimating a Bundesbank

domestic credit reaction function. While the policy function postulated is

certainly an over—simplified representation of Bundesbank behavior, it yields

strong evidence that sterilization played an important role. The

estimated sterilization coefficients indicate that only a small fraction of

any change in reserves was allowed to affect the monetary base.

      The second question is answered with the help of an empirical portfolio-
                                                    3
balance model of German asset markets and prices.       To assess the effects of

alternative financial interventions, the empirical model is simulated under

the assumption that agents have perfect foresight concerning future exchange

rate movements. While a transitory change in the monetary base lasting three

quarters is found to have a significant effect on the exchange rate, a tran-

sitory sterilized foreign exchange intervention of equal magnitude is found

to have virtually no effects. This evidence suggests that sterilization is

not an effective "second instrument" in the case of Germany. The finding
                                       3




is consistent with Bundesbank accounts of its own recent experience with

pure foreign exchange intervention.

         Empirical reduced-form portfolio balance models have been estimated

by a number of authors, including Branson, Halttunen, and Masson (1977, 1979)

Dooley and Isard (1982), Hooper and Morton (1982), Martin and Masson (1979),

and Porter (1977, 1979). In contrast to these contributions, the present

study estimates a structural model of German asset markets. Structural

estimation is necessary if one wishes to identify the channels through which

changes in asset supplies influence the exchange rate. In addition,

structural estimation makes possible direct tests of the hypotheses under-

lying the portfolio balance approach.4

        The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is a

short   summary of macroeconomic developments in the Federal Republic of Germany
between 1975 and 1981. Section 3 briefly reviews the portfolio balance model
of   exchange rates and describes the effects of sterilized foreign exchange

intervention. Section 4 reports estimates of a Bundesbank domestic credit

policy reaction function. A portfolio balance model of Germany is set out

and estimated in section 5. In section 6, the effects of sterilized and

nonsterilized foreign reserve sales are studied through dynamic perfect-

foresight simulations of the empirical model. Section 7 offers concluding

remarks. An appendix contains a detailed description of the data and

definitions used in this study.

2. The conflict between internal and external balance during 1975—1981

       The traditional case for flexible exchange rates, as made by Johnson

(1969), held that the abandorunent of fixed parities would free governments

"to use their instruments of domestic policy for the pursuit of domestic

objectives." The experience of the last decade has shown this view to

be too sanguine, at least where monetary policy is concerned. Monetary

expansion induces exchange rate depreciation which feeds into domestic prices

and wages. This, in turn, shortens the short run in which easy money can

keep nominal interest rates low.

       When external price and interest—rate shocks lead simultaneously to

recession, inflation, and an external deficit, the exchange rate's sensi-

tivity to domestic credit conditions raises a genuine policy dilemma.

Internal balance demands a fall in interest rates. But the interest-rate

effects of money are dissipated quite rapidly as the accompanying exchange

depreciation causes domestic inflation to accelerate. Indeed, ref lationary

monetary policy may have some contractionary effects, for depreciation

occasions an immediate rise in the production costs of industries using

imported production materials.     Intermediate price rises lead to lay-

off s in the affected sectors while reducing profitability and discouraging

investment.

       The recent experience of West Germany illustrates the dilemma that

may confront policy makers under flexible exchange rates. (See Table 1.)

At the outset of 1975, the German economy still suffered from the contrac-

tionary and inflationary effects of the 1973-1974 price shocks. In spite

of the danger of exchange rate depreciation, the Bundesbank adopted an

inward—looking monetary policy, allowing the money supply to grow at a

rapid pace. By summer, recovery was under way. The full force of the

policy dilemma was not felt in 1975, however, for a favorable conjunction

of external factors weakened the inflationary impact of the Bundesbank'S

expansionary measures. First, the current account balance, while declining

considerably from its 1974 level of DM 26.6 billion, remained in surplus

that year.6 Second, the dollar prices of German imports fell as a result

of the worldwide slump. Although the Deutschemark's value against the dol-

lar dropped by 6.3 per cent during 1975, the index of import prices actu-

ally declined over that same period. At 6 per cent, Germany's 1975 in-

flation rate was a point lower than it had been during the previous two

years.

         Over the following three years, inflation decelerated and the

Deutschemark appreciated strongly against both the U.S. dollar and the cur-

rencies of its major trading partners. After a strong showing in 1976,

 the economy grew more slowly in 1977 and 1978. But the Deutschexnark's

 strength persisted in spite of brisk monetary growth, helping to dampen

 the rate of price increase. In every one of the years 1976-1978 the

 Bundesbank overshot its monetary—growth target—-sharply so in 1978,

 when the central bank money stock grew by 11.8 per cent.



         The decade's second round of major oil price increases began in

late 1978. In spite of the Deutschemark's continuing appreciation over

1979, the        import price index jumped by 11.6 per cent and inflation

accelerated sharply. Contributing to the poorer price performance were

the expansionary stance of fiscal policy and a boom in investment and inven-

tory demand encouraged by the low level of interest rates over 1978. This
                                    6




strong increase in aggregate demand more than offset the contractionary

effects of the oil price increases, and the year's GNP growth rate was

high. To conthat the inflationary tendencies, and in particular to pre-

vent the price increases from being built into future wage settlements,

the Bundesbank allowed central bank money to grow at a rate of only 5.5

per cent, near the bottom of the 1979 target range. As monetary policy

grew more stringent, German interest rates followed world interest rates

upward. The year's second quarter saw the emergence of the first in a

series of quarterly current account deficits that was to continue without

interruption until the final quarter of 1981. Germany's new external

weakness would become a major policy problem in the following two years.

      Buffeted by an escalating price of oil, the industrialized economies

experienced a distinct slowdown starting in the spring of 1980. In Germany,

however, the pace of economic activity remained relatively strong until the suimner,

and the current account accordingly worsened. After the beginning of

1980 when the dollar stood at an all-time low in the foreign exchange

market) the Deutschemark began to weaken. But U.S. interest rates were tem-

porarily soft during the summer, and the Bundesbank took the opportunity

to speed up monetary growth in the face of the emerging recession. As

the U.S. slowdown ended and as U.S. monetary policy became more con-

tractionary in the early autumn of 1980, dollar interest rates

rose sharply. The rise in U.S. interest rates, coupled with an enormous

third-quarter current deficit (which, at DM 12.7 billion, exceeded the deficit

over the entire previous year), exerted irresistible downward pressure on the

Deutschemark's market value, and forced the Bundesbank to abandon its counter—

cyclical monetary measures. Faced with an accelerating inflation fueled by

steep import price rises and unexpectedly high wage settlements, the Bundesbank
                                       7




would risk no worsening of the exchange—market situation.

        In the third quarter of 1980, the Bundesbank found itself caught

 in the conflict between internal and external balance. Its initial re-

 sponse was to intervene heavily in the foreign exchange market in support of

 the Deutschemark while at the same time increasing domestic credit to offset

 the contractionary effect of reserve losses on liquidity. Over the course

 of the year, the Bundesbank's net external assets fell by DM 25.7 billion

 as a result of foreign exchange operations. But between September 1980

 and February 1981, the Deutschemark-dollar exchange rate plummeted by

 nearly 17 per cent. In the latter month, the Bundesbank decided that in

 view of inflationary dangers it could no longer continue to hold

 German interest rates constant as U.S. rates increased. Al-

 though the economy continued to stagnate, the authorities adopted a decidedly

 stringent monetary stance and pushed interest rates upward.

        The policy dilemma that arose in late 1980 required a choice

between internal and external balance; the Bundesbank chose the latter.

This course was followed, in the face of strong domestic criticism, until

the final quarter of 1981. With the current account once again in surplus,

with U.S. interest rates on a seeming downward trend, and with unemployment

growing, the Bundesbank initiated a relaxation of domestic credit condi-

tions., But the relaxation was a cautious one. As the Bundesbank explained

in its February 1982 Monthly Report:



          .accelerated cuts in interest rates, with the consequence of a
       depreciation of the Deutsche Mark, would increase the importation
       of inflation and quicken the pace of domestic price rises. A de-
       teriorating price climate would undoubtedly lead to new fears of
       inflation, and hence inevitably trigger another upturn in interest
       rates. The Bundesbank cannot take these risks.

3. Foreign exchange intervention under imperfect asset substitutability

       When home and foreign bonds are imperfect substitutes, debt manage-

ment that leaves monetary aggregates unchanged may influence the

 exchange   rate. 7   Nonmonetary or "pure' foreign exchange market

intervention can take many forms, ranging from sterilized foreign asset

purchases to forward exchange operations to the outright issuance of

foreign-currency debt (such as Carter notes) .      Pure foreign exchange

intervention, if effective, provides an independent central bank policy

instruirent and with it, a possible escape from the policy dilemma posed

by domestic stagnation and a weakening exchange rate.

       The portfolio—balance model of the exchange rate formalizes the

idea that relative supplies of outside interest-bearing debt as well

as relative money supplies influence the exchange rate.

A brief review of the model illustrates the potential value of debt manage-

ment as a policy tool and serves as background for the subsequent econo-

metric application. 8

       The economy considered is one whose residents can hold wealth in the

form of domestic money and in the form of interest—bearing bonds denominated

in foreign or domestic currency units. Foreign bonds and domestic bonds issued

at home are imperfect substitutes: their nominal returns (adjusted for

expected exchange rate depreciation) need not be equal, and there exist

well—defined demand functions for national debts as well as for national

monies. Foreigners may hold domestic bonds, and so domestic money is the

only nontraded asset. The relevant asset demand functions are written as:



     L(R,y,W/P)W       =   domestic demand for high-powered money
                                               9




   B(R,R* + c,y,w/P)W =           net   domestic demand for domestic bonds9



   F(R,R* + E,y,W/P)W         =   net   domestic demand for foreign bonds,

                                  expressed in terms of domestic currency



            B*(R - e,R*)W*    =   net   foreign demand for domestic bonds,

                                  expressed in terms of foreign currency



where



        R        nominal interest rate on domestic bonds

             =   nominal interest rate on foreign bonds
             =   expected rate of exchancie rate depreciation
        P = domestic       price level

        y = domestic        real output

        W = domestic        nominal wealth

             =   foreign   nominal wealth.




Assets are assumed to be gross substitutes; the variables y arid W/P

entering the domestic portfolio—share functions capture the effect of

the transactions level on asset demands, as in Tobin (1969). The wealth

constraint implies that
                                   10




       L+B+F=l.                                                             (1)




       The foreign bond rate R* is taken to be exogenous. The domestic

price level P, output y, and the wealth variables W and W' are assumed to

be fixed in the short run.1° Eq. (1) implies that domestic holdings of

foreign assets need not be considered in deriving the economys instant-

aneous equilibrium. Asset—market clearing requires only that residents

willingly hold the stock of base money and that foreign and home

dea-and for domestic bonds sum to the available net supply. As usual, E,

the exchange rate, is the domestic—currency price of foreign exchange.

With H denoting the supply of high-powered money and D the stock of outstand-

ing government debt not held by the central bank or foreign official

agencies, the asset-market equilibrium conditions are



       H = L(R,y,W/p)W,
                                                                            (2)




       D = B(R,R* + E,y,W/P)W + EE*(R —   ,R*)tJ*.                          (3)




Given P, y, and W, equilibrium condition (2) determines the domestic interest

rate R. Given the expected depreciation rate E and w, eq. (3) then determines

the euilibrium exchange rate E.

       Short-run asset—market equilibrium is depicted in Fig. 1 for a

fixed value of .   The HH locus is horizontal at the unique home interest

rate consistent with money-market equilibrium. The DD schedule consists

of points at which the home bond market clears. A decline in R creates

an excess supply of domestic debt, while a rise in E restores equi—

librium by increasing the home-currency value of the foreign demand. Thus,

DD has a negative slope.11 Momentary equilibrium occurs at the intersection

of HH and DD, where all asset markets clear simultaneously.-2

       The conflict between internal and external equilibrium becomes ap-

parent when we consider the effects of domestic credit expansion. These

effects are depicted in Fig. 2 on the assumption that the expected deprecia-

tion rate C does not change. A purchase of domestic assets by the central

bank shifts the HH schedule downward to H'H'. Because the central bank

finances its purchase by issuing high-powered money, a lower nominal interest

rate is necessary for money-market equilibrium. Domestic credit expansion

also shifts DD to the left, to D'D', because fewer domestic bonds

are available to be held in private portfolios)3 In the new equilibrium,

the interest rate is lower but the price of foreign exchange is higher. Any

stimulus to investment is purchased at the cost of increased import costs

and additional pressure on domestic prices)4

       Sterilized foreign exchange intervention, when used in concert with

domestic credit expansion, enables the monetary authority to lower the

nominal interest rate in the short run while holding the exchange rate

constant at E. A sterilized sale of foreign exchange is a pure debt swap

which leaves the monetary base unchanged. The cent:ral bank uses foreign

reserves to purchase high—powered domestic money, but at the same time

prevents any decrease in liquidity through an exactly offsetting expansion

of domestic credit. The intervention has no effect on H but decreases D.

It thus shifts D'D' leftward to D"D", which intersects H'H' at the

initial exchange rate E. In effect, the central bank prevents the

depreciation implied by its expansionary domestic policy through "pure"

foreign exchange intervention in support of the exchange rate. This policy

would be self—defeating under perfect asset substitutability, for sterilized

intervention would then have no effect on the external value of the currency,

         The foregoing discussion raises two empirical questions concerning

the   recent German experience. First, did the Bundesbank in fact employ
sterilized intervention in an attempt to simultaneously achieve     its internal

and   external objectives? And second, are the actual effects of sterilized
intervention     of sufficient importance to offer an escape from the policy

dilemma?       These questions are addressed in the next three sections.



4. Did the Bundesbank sterilize?

       Estimation of the Bundesbank's domestic credit policy reaction

function   provides evidence on the extent to which   sterilized intervention

was practiced during 1975-1981. If the Bundesbank indeed followed a

strategy similar to that described in the previous section, domestic credit

should respond positively to cyclical shortfalls in output but negatively

to increases in foreign exchange reserves. Under complete sterilization

the coefficient of the change in foreign reserves is -1, for domestic

credit is systematically varied to offset the effect of reserve acquisitions

on domestic liquidity.

        An   issue of considerable importance is the precise definition of the
reaction     function's dependent variable. The change in the Bundesbank's net

domestic assets does not provide a complete picture of the stance

of domestic credit policy. In addition, variations in reserve requirements

on banks have played an important part in domestic
credit Control.         The change in domestic credit, ADC, is therefore defined
                                                13




 as the increase in net domestic assets minus the reserves impounded by any

 increase in required reserves .                The latter component is calculated as



      [REQ   (t)   —
                       REQ (t—l) I M3 (t—l) ,                                           (4)


 where       REQ is the average reserve ratio and M3 is the broadly-defined money

 stock.       DC includes open-market purchases as well as Bund2sbank lending

to private banks (through discount and Lombard facilities) and to the

central and Lander governments. All variables are defined in detail in

the appendix)-5

          Domestic credit is assumed to respond to the increasein reserves,

the current output gap, and lagged price-level inflation)-6 The reaction

function therefore takes the form



          DC(t)        =
                           ir1FA(t)    +
                                           Tr2GAP(t)
                                                       +
                                                           7T3INF(t-1)
                                                                         + u(t) .       (5)


In   (5), ANFA is the change in the Bundesbank's net foreign assets, valued in

Deutschemarks at a constant exchange rate; GAP is the percent excess of trend

over actual output; and INF is the month-to-month percent increase in the

price level. Because exchange rate fluctuations entail changes in the Deutsche—

mark value of reserves which are not reflected as changes in the monetary base,

the measure ANFA excludes the periodic reserve valuation adjustments made by

the Bundesbank. The reaction function was estimated by nonlinear least squares,

with a correction for first—order serial correlation in u(t))7 The first row

of Table 2 reports the result of estimating (5) over the entire sample period.

          The estimated equation supports the hypothesis that the Bundesbank

has used domestic credit policy to attain domestic policy objectives

while engaging in sterilized foreign exchange intervention in order to

influence the exchange rate. Over the period 1975—1981, the sterilization

coefficient    is negative, large, and highly significant. In addition,

it does not differ significantly from -1, and thus is consistent with a policy

of full sterilization. The coefficient      is positive and significant,

providing evidence that countercyclical considerations influenced domestic

credit policy. Further evidence along these lines is provided by the

coefficient of lagged inflation, 7r3, which, while statistically insignifi-

cant, is nonnegligible in magnitude and of the anticipated sign.18

       As a check on the stability of policy response during the period

under study, the reaction function (5) was estimated over two subperiods

in which the Bundesbank faced on the whole quite different external condi-

tions. The second and third rows of Table 2 report estimates of (5) over

the sample periods 1975:2—1979:3 and 1979: 4—1981:10. The story told by

these estimates is essentially the same a the one sketched above.

Over both subperiods, the sterilization coefficient is negative and close to

-1. Over both subperiods, domestic credit responds in countercyclical fashion

to output and price fluctuations. The reaction function does exhibit some in-

stability over time, however. The countercyclical coefficients are of much greater

magnitude over the second subperiod. Over the first subperiod, a one—tailed

test indicates rejection of the hypothesis of complete sterilization. The results

are unfortunately too imprecise to allow strong conclusions about policy shifts.

      The econometric evidence that the Bundesbank pursued a policy of substan

tial sterilization is in agreement with the published record of Bundesbank

measures.The year 1980, in which the Bundesbank supported the exchange rate
                                       15




through massive reserve sales, provides an example. In March of that

year, in order to "offset foreign exchange outflows," the Eundesbank re—

purchased before maturity more than DM 3 billion in paper previously

sold to banks. In April, minimum reserve ratios were lowered and re-

discount quotas were raised in "view of the sustained outflows of foreign

exchange from the Bundesbank." Minimum reserve ratios were lowered further

in September to "offset the contractionary effects of the outflows of for-

eign exchange on bank liquidity." Rediscount quotas were again increased

in October and in January 1981. A further decrease in required reserve

ratios also occurred in January. "A monetary policy guided solely by

external factors would have allowed the contractionay monetary effects of

the balance of payments deficit to work through in full to the domestic
                                  19
economy, the Bundesbank stated.

       The finding that sterilized foreign exchange intervention was in

fact pursued does not provide evidence that sterilized intervention

had a significant effect on the exchange rate. Information

concerning the efficacy of policies cannot be obtained from a reaction

function, which merely describes the authorities' behavior. To assess the

efficacy of policies, one needs information about the structure of the

economy. The next sections attempt to evaluate the effects of sterilized

intervention using an empirical model of German asset markets and the

price level.

5. A structural model of asset markets and prices

       In this section a structural monthly macromodel of West Germany is de-

scribed and estimated. The model's financial sector is patterned on the port-

folio balance model set out in section 3, but it has a more complex money

market comprising money supply as well as money demand. Given expectations

and the price level, the financial sector determines the Deutschemark-dollar

exchange rate and the three-month domestic interbank interest rate. A separ-

ate equation describes how the price level evolves over time in response to

lagged inflation and lagged import-price changes. Both output and the three—

month Eurodollar interest rate are taken to be exogenous. While the model does

not explain the level of nominal home wealth, the potential endogeneity of that

variable, along with that of the price level, is recognized in the estimation.

      A key problem in estimating the model is the choice of a variable to

proxy exchange—rate expectations. The financial sector submodel is based on

the premise that Deutschemark bonds issued in Germany and Eurodollar deposits

are imperfect substitutes in portfolios. Eurocurrency deposits differing only

in their currency of denomination are assumed to be perfect substitutes, how-

ever, so that the premium on forward dollars in London may be used

in estimation as a proxy for the Deutschernark's expected depreciation rate.2°

By assuming that the expected nominal return on Eurodollar deposits must

always equal that on Eurodeutschemark deposits, the present study neglects

the role of nondiversifiable exchange risk in determining the interest dif-

ferential between onshore German assets and Eurodollar deposits.23- Rather, that

portion of the differential not explicable by expected exchange depreciation is

ascribed entirely to various political risks, such as the prospect

of capital controls.22 A number of recent empirical studies have rejected
                                        17


the hypothesis that Eurocurrency interest differentials equal expected depreciation

rates [see, for example, Cumby and Obstfeld (1981)].            In adopting the hypothesis

in spite of those findings, I am assuming implicitly that as an empirical

matter, the political risk premium separating covered returns on Euro—

currency and onshore deposits is large relative to the exchange risk premium

separating expected nominal returns on offshore deposits denominated

in different currencies. To the extent that this assumption is un-

justified, the econometric results reported below are biased.

       The model's first equation explains the demand, for sight deposits M,

defined as the money stock Ml minus currency in circulation, CURR.

CURR is taken to be exenous to the model. Long-run deposit demand is

proportional to domestic nominal wealth W, with the proportionality factor

depending negatively on the three—month interbank interest rate R and pos-

itively on real income y. The demand function is assumed to have the

form



                               a2
       Md =                                                                    (6)
              a0exp(—a1R)(y)        ('i/P) exp(u1)W



where u1 is a mean—zero disturbance. The equation estimated is derived

from (6) by taking natural logarithms, assuming gradual adjustment of the

log of nominal deposits to its long-run desired level, and subtracting

log(P) from both sides. This leads to the specification



  log(M(t)/P(t)) =      —                             +
                                        a2log(y(t))       c3log(w(t)/P(t))
                       +                          + (1 —
                            a4log(M(t—l)/p(t))             c)u1(t)            (7)
                                           18




       The banking system's supply of sight deposits is proportional to the mone-

tary base H in the long run. Supply depends positively on the difference

between R and the central bank discount rate DISCS and negatively on both the

currency/deposit ratio CURR/M and the average required reserve ratio REQ.

A convenient specification of long-run deposit supply is



       MS =                -                                                                    (8)
              b0exp[b1(R       DISC)](CURR4)b2(REQ)b3eXP(U2)H,


with u2 a mean—zero disturbance. By taking the loq of (8), assuming partial

nominal adjustment, and subtracting log(P), one derives the functional form



                                                                                 —
  log(M(t)/P(t)) =     +         (R(t) —   DISC(t))    —
                                                           2log(CURR(t),'M(t))       3log(REQ(t))

                   + (1 —      4)log(H(t)/P(t))       + 4log(N(t—l)/P(t)) + (1 —       B4)u,(t).9

The analogue of the money-market equilibrium condition(2) is obtained by

equating the right-hand sides of (7) and (9).

       Consider next the equation explaining German holdings of domestic bonds.

The net supply of these bonds available to the German public (BS) is equal to

the indebtedness of the German public authorities (DBT) minus the net dom-

estic assets of the Bundesbank (NDA) minus net foreign private holdings of

domestic bonds (B*):



       35=DBT_NDA..3*=D_B*.                                                              (10)




The measure (10) ignores forward exchange operations of the Bundesbank, which
                                            19




alter the stock of outside domestic ,onds without immediately affecting NDA.

Home demand for domesti.c bonds is given in the long run by



         Bd =                          +
                                                               -c4       c5
                c0exp(c1R)exp[_c2(R*       €)]exp(—c3DIsc)   (y)     (W/P) exp(u3)W                 (11)




where R* and E now represent the three—month London Eurodollar deposit rate and

the three—month London forward premium on dollars, respectively. The variable

DISC enters (11) with a negative coefficient because a rise in the central

bank discount rate discourages bank lending and so decreases overall demand for
                 23
domestic debt. When coithined with the gradual adjustment of bond holdings, eq.

(11) implies the specification



         log(B(t)/P(t))          +         — y2(R*(t) +    c(t))   —
                                                                       3DISC(t)
                                                                                  —
                                                                                      y4log(y(t))
                          +   y5log(W(t)/P(t))   +
                                                     (61og(B(t-l)/p(t))    + (1 -
                                                                                      )u3(t).       (12)



         It remains to specify a structural equation describing foreign residents'

demand       for domestic bonds.       This demand has actually been negative over

the entire sample period, for foreigners have been net borrowers of Deutsche—

marks. The equation estimated therefore explains the supply of Deutschemark

bonds by nonresidents, i.e., foreign borrowing.


         Specification of this structural equation is complicated by the fact

that the borrowers are residents of many countries besides the U.S. Thus,

exchange rates other than the DM-dollar rate enter into the determination of

asset-market equilibrium. The foregoing problem can be avoided by making the

admittedly stringent assumption that all currency areas have essentially

identical DM-bond supply functions. Let the long-run supply function for

currency area i be given by
                                            20




      -B= E.d0exp[—d1(R - E)]exp(d2R*)exp(u4)W,



where E. is the Deutscheinark price of currency i, W is the nominal wealth

 of area i measured in local currency units, and u4 is a stochastic dis-

turbance common to all area supply functions. Note that the supply of

bonds by area—i residents has been written as a negative demand.

 If Si is the U.S. dollar price of currency i (S1                 1), aggregate foreign

borrowing of Deutschemarks can be written



      -d
     _3* =

 logarithmic form, assume gradual adjustment of nominal bond holdings, and

 subtract log(E) from both sides of the resulting equation. This yields

       The estimated coefficients have the signs predicted by theory, but

they are not always statistically significant. In particular, the rate—of-

return coefficients in eq. (12) are insignificant and quite small: home and

foreign bonds do not appear to be highly substitutable from the standpoint

of resident bond—holders. In contrast, the interest elasticities of foreign

borrowing are quite large. The short—run elasticity of foreign borrowing

with respect to the covered return R — s (calculated at the sample mean of that va-

riable) is —14.9 ;the corresponding short—run elasticity with respect to R*

is 14.2. These elasticities rise to -77.7 and 73.8, respectively, in the

long run, i.e., after foreign borrowing has fully adjusted to its long-run

desired level.

        The equations in Table 3 are consistent with the hypotheses underlying

the portfolio balance approach, but they do indicate the existence of lags in

asset-market adjustment. Adjustment of deposit supply to its long-run level

appears to be immediate, for the coefficient of lagged deposits in eq. (9) is

small and insignificant. Eqs. (12) and (14) provide strong evidence of slow bond-

market adjustment, however, while eq. (7) provides somewhat weaker evidence that
deposit demand adjusts gradually.
        As an input to the simulation experiments of the next section, an

equation explaining CPI inflation was estimated. General price-level inflation

was related to its own lagged values and lagged foreign price inflation by the

6. The effects of intervention policies: Simulation results

      This section compares the effects of sterilized foreign exchange inter-

vention, which is not allowed to affect the monetary base, and nonsterilized

or monetary intervention, which is fully reflected in the suptly of high—

powered money. The policy comparisons are made by simulating the empirical

model of the previous section under different assumptions about the time paths

of the supplies of base money H and domestic debt D. Exchange rate expecta-

tions play a central role in any evaluation of the effects of alternative

policies. The simulations reported below are based on the assumption that

agents have perfect foresight concerning future exchange rate movements. Thus, the

values for C   fed   into the simulation are the same as the actual depreciation

rates that the simulation predicts.26 Simulations of this type serve primarily

to elucidate the empirical model's structure. The perfect foresight assumption

ensures that the simulated effects of policies are not the result of arbitrary

expectatiorial hypotheses.

       Because many foreign exchange interventions are explicitly temporary

in nature, I compare the effects of two transitory interventions, each of

which occurs in January 1979 and is reversed after nine months.    The first

of these is an official foreign exchange sale that decreases the mone-

 tary base by 10 percent (DM 13.25 billion). The second is a sterilized

foreign exchange sale of equal magnitude, the net effect of which is to

decrease the stock of privately—held outside DM-denominated debt by 1DM 13.25

billion while leaving the monetary base unchanged. Both interventions are

unanticipated, but their transitory nature is fully understood. A third, refer-

ence exchange rate path is provided by a benchmark simulation experiment that

uses as input historical values of the base and the outside debt supply.

      The simulation procedure is iterative and works as follows.27 All

simulations begin in 1979:1 and end in 1981:9. The three-month forward premium

is written as 400[log(F/E)], where F is the three—month forward rate, and in

each round of simulation, the forward rates for 1981:7, 1981:8, and 1981:9

are set equal to the spot exchange rates prevailing in 1981:10, 1981:11, and

1981:12.28 In the first round of simulation, the remaining forward rates

(1979:1—1981:6) are set at their historical values. Simulation with the fore-

going forward—rate series as input produces a simulated exchange rate path

over 1979:1-1981:9; and that series, led three periods, serves as the input

for F over 1979:1-1981:6 in the next simulation round. The procedure is

continued until the simulated exchange rate series agrees with the exchange

rate series produced in the previous round.

       Table 5 reports the results of the three perfect—foresight simula-

tion experiments. The benchmark simulation gives the exchange rate's

perfect—foresight path in the absence of intervention. The benchmark ex-

change rate path is high relative to its historical level. For example,

the benchmark simulation predicts an exchange rate of 2.6126 marks per

dollar in January 1979, whereas the actual exchange rate was 1.8616. The

disparity reflects the fact that many of the events that impinged on the

exchange market over the simulation period were in fact unanticipated. Had
                                  24




 its subsequent depreciation been foreseen at the outset, the Deutschemark

 would have been much weaker over that period. While the perfect-foresight

 assumption produces unrealistic exchange rate levels, the simulation pro-

 cedure is nonetheless useful for exercises in comparative dynamics.

        Consider the effect of a 10 percent decline in the monetary base

 lasting three quarters. As Table 5 shows, this monetary intervention

 causes an immediate 3•0 percent appreciation of the currency relative to its

 benchmark value. Because it is known that the base will rise to its benchmark

 level after 1979:9, the exchange rate begins to depreciate to-

ward the benchmark rate. When the base rises abruptly in 1979:10 the

 interest rate falls, and because the price level is slightly below the

benchmark level, the interest rate is lower as well. The exchange rate

is above its benchmark level in 1979:10 because a greater expected apprecia-

tion of the Deutschemark must offset this lower home interest rateS

       A DM 13.25 billion foreign exchange sale whose monetary effect is

sterilized causes an impact .04 percent appreciation relative to the bench-

mark. This effect is insignificant compared to that of the equivalent non—

sterilized intervention. The exchange rate effect of the lower debt stock

remains insignificant in subsequent periods, although the exchange rate

does depreciate slightly relative to the benchmark in 1979:10, when the

sterilized intervention is reversed. This depreciation is needed to cre-

ate the expected appreciation that persuades asset-holders to demand a higher

stock of DM-denominated debt.

       The simulation experiments suggest that the Bundesbank's ability to

influence the exchange rate without altering monetary conditions is very

limited. It is accurate to assert that the sterilized intervention con—
                                   25




sidered above has essentially no effect on the exchange rate. In contrast,

foreign exchange interventions that are allowed to affect the monetary

base have a strong impact on the exchange rate, even when they are known

to be transitory. While a permanent sterilized foreign exchange sale would

of course have a somewhat greater exchange rate effect, the effect would

remain small relative to that of a permanent nonsterilized sale.

Further, permanent changes of this type may not always be feasible. A

permanent sterilized foreign exchange transaction of the magnitude contem-

plated here would have caused a 40 per cent change in the Bundesbank's

net domestic assets in January 1979.

  7. Conclusion

         Even under flexible exchange rates, the goals of internal and

  external balance can conflict. If foreign and domestic bonds

  are imperfect substitutes in portfolios, sterilized foreign exchange inter—

  vention may provide a "second instrument" (along with domestic credit

  expansion) enabling the central bank to reconcile its internal and its

  external objectives. The econometric evidence suggests that the German

 Bundesbank did attempt to use sterilization in this manner over the period

  1975—1981.

         To assess the efficacy of sterilized intervention in the German

 case, a structural portfolio balance model of German asset markets and

 prices was estimated. Dynamic perfect-foresight simulations of the empiri-

 cal model were used to ascertain whether imperfect substitutability between

  foreign and domestic bonds is sufficient to allow the Bundesbank to attain

  independent internal and external goals over the short run of about a month.

  The model's verdict was that the Bundesbank has little if any power to

  influence the exchange rate over that time span without altering current

  or expected future money—market conditions. These findings leave open the

  possibility that sterilized foreign exchange market intervention has signifi-

  cant but short-lived exchange rate effects which disappear within a month.

         Major shortcomings of the empirical model include the sketchy treatment

of price-level dynamics and   the   failure to explain the current account and

with it, the level of domestic wealth. Adequate treatment of these factors

v.ould require a much larger model. An additional drawback of this paper's

approach is the neglect of imperfect substitution between Eurocurrency deposits

differing only in their currency of denomination. All these issues are left

on the agenda for future research.

Footnotes



 1. A sterilized foreign exchange purchase by the central bank is one

whose effect on the monetary base is offset by a simultaneous and equivalent

sale of central bank domestic assets.



2. The use of Keynesian fiscal policy as a second instrument was advocated

in Mundell's (1968) celebrated writing on the policy mix. The starting

point of that work is the observation that monetary and fiscal expansion

have opposite effects on the capital account because of their opposite

effects on the interest rate. Countercyclical fiscal policy of the type

envisioned by Mundell is currently unpopular in a number of countries,

however. This unpopularity is due in part to the longer-run "crowding out"

effects of government spending and borrowing. It is also due in part to

the concern that government deficits might fuel inflationary expectations.

Fiscal policy interventions of a different sort do not entail the foregoing

risks, and are in fact being pursued. To stimulate investment in the face

of high foreign interest rates, the German government approved a "joint

initiative on jobs, growth and stability" in February 1982. The program

involves a number of investment (and employment) subsidies which are to

be financed for the most part by an increase in the value—added tax.



3. The portfolio balance approach to exchange rate determination under

imperfect asset substitutability has been developed by Boyer (1978),

Branson (1977), Flood (1983), Girton and Henderson (1977), Kenen (1976),

Kouri (1982), Porter (1977), and others. The approach is the open-economy
                                     31




analogue of Tobin's (1969) general-equilibrium model of domestic financial

markets.



4. A further distinguishing feature of the present study is its use of

data on bond holdings disaggregated by currency of denomination. The

studies listed in the text use cumulated current accounts (or cumulated

current accounts net of cumulated official intervention) to proxy private net

external asset positions. As many of the authors point out, however, this

procedure is not valid when current imbalances are financed through lending

denominated in several currencies. Alternative structural models of

West Germany are presented by Artus (1976, 1981), who also assumes limited

asset substitution. Frankel (1981) estimates a portfolio balance model of the

dollar—mark rate based on two—period mean—variance optimization.


5. For further discussion, see Dornbusch and Kruqman (1976) and Goldstein

(1980)




6. The precise channels through which the current account influences the

exchange rate remain in dispute. Loopesko (1982) reports evidence that even an-

ticipated German current-account imbalances have exerted significant effects

on the dollar-Deutschemark exchange rate.



7.   Imperfect asset substitutability is neither sufficient nor necessary to

ensure the efficacy of nonmonetary financial operations that affect the rela-

tive supplies of bonds denominated in different currencies [see Henderson

(1983) and Obstfeld (l982a)]. For example, if agents internalize the gov-

ernment and central bank budget constraints, as in Obstfeld (1982b), inter-

vention operations that leave current and expected future money supplies un-
                                       32




changed   exert no effects on asset prices even when asset substitutability is

limited. In setting out the portfolio—balance model and in applying it to

the German data, Ricardian equivalence issues will be left aside. More pre-

cisely, it will be assumed that all government-issued debt represents outside

debt and that private agents do not consider central-bank foreign asset

positions in formulating their own asset demands.

         Even with perfect asset substitution [as in Dornbusch (1976) ,   for   ex—

ample], norunonetary intervention policies can influence asset prices if the       de-
cision   to undertake them conveys to the mar:et new information about the future
path of the money supply. Mussa (1981) in particular stresses this as      a    channel

through   which pure intervention may operate. The discussion in the text ignores

the foregoing possibility without denying its potential importance in practice.



8. Henderson (1979, 1983), Kenen (l98l),Marston (1980), and Obstfeld (1980) pro-

vide alternative discussions of open-economy financial policy under imperfect

asset substitutability.



9. All bonds have a fixed nominal face value.



10. Exchange rate movements entail capital losses and gains for bond holders,

and so cause variations in nominal wealth even in the short run. In other

words, nominal wealth should be viewed as an endogenous variable. Valuation

effects are omitted here, however, in order to simplify the exposition; their

incorporation would raise no substantive difficulties.



11. When foreign holdings of domestic bonds are ve--as they are in the

case of West Germany-—the DD schedule may have a positive slope. As noted by
                                        33




Branson, Haittunen, and Masson (1979), Martin and Masson (1979), Tobin and

de Macedo (1981), and others, monetary expansion can have a perverse effect

on the exchange rate, causing it to appreciate, when one country is a net

debtor in foreign currency. Henderson and Rogoff (1982) and Kouri (1982)

demonstrate, however, that this perversity disappears in more fully speci-

fied dynamic exchange rate models once rational expectations of future

exchange rate depreciation are introduced. Under rational expectations,

monetary expansion causes the exchange rate to depreciate even when for-

eigners have a short position in domestic currency. The empirical simula-

tions reported in section 6, below, assume that agents have perfect foresight

concerning future exchange rate movements. Accordingly, financial policies

move the exchange rate in the expected directions.



12. The view that the exchange rate is set so as to clear markets for asset

stocks does not contradict the fact that the exchange rate adjusts to ensure

ex post equality between two flows, the balance of private external payments

and the official capital account deficit. To see this, assume for simplicity

that foreign official agencies do not purchase domestic assets. Then the

capital account surplus measured in terms of home currency is just the difference

between private foreign acquisitions of domestic securities and the value

of private    domestic acquisitions of foreign securities over any time interval

[t-l,tJ. Defining       B*(R_C,R*)W* and F      F(R,R*+C,y,W/P)W, we may therefore

write the capital account surplus, K, as



       K =                  -
             j[ET)*(T)]dr       IE(T) [(T)/E(T)]dT,


where dots denote time derivatives. By integration, the capital account is
                                                34




       K =   E(t)B*(t)    -   E(t_l)B*(t_l)      -   {F(t)   -   (t-l)}   + [E(T)/E(T)](T)dT


         =   (EB*)    -   F   + CG,



where CG =   f[E(T)/E(T)J(T)dT            is the capital gain on domestically-owned for-

eign assets due to the change in the exchange rate between times t—l and t.

The increase in domestic wealth over the interval [t—l,t] must equal the sum

of the current account surplus (CA) , government dissaving (G — T)                        ,   and capital

gains CG. By the wealth constraint (1) and by (2) ,                  this   must also equal

H + B + F, where B B(R,R*+,y,W/p) Letting NDA denote the central bank's

net domestic assets and FXR the foreign currency value of the central bank's

net foreign assets, we infer from the central bank's balance sheet and

equilibrium condition (3) that

                                      t
       CA + (G - T) + CG =                            + NDA + iB + iF
                                   JE(T)FXR(T)dT
                                      t— 1
                                      t
                               =                      + iNDA + iD -       i(EB*)       + iF
                                   jE(T)FXR(r)dT
                                      t— 1
                                      t
                               =                      + (G - T) -     [i(EB*)      -
                                   JE(T)FXR(T)dT
                                    t—l

Use of the expression for the capital account surplus K derived earlier leads

to the balance-of-payments identity

                  t
      CA + K =
                 JE(r)FXR(T)dT.

13. The principal tools of Bundesbank domestic credit policy are changes in
                                        35




reserve requirements, changes in rediscount and Lombard quotas, and repur-

chase operations, rather than open-market transactions         se [see Schlesinger

and Bockelmann (1973) and the discussion in section 4, below]. These policies

affect the asset markets in the saxne manner as open—market changes in D.

Changes in reserve requirements, in particular, change the willingness of the

banking system to lend and so alter the excess nonbank demand for domestic

debt at any interest rate and exchange rate. In addition, changes in reserve

requirements shift HH by   altering   the derived demand for high-powered money.



14. Why must the exchange rate depreciate? The answer comes from consideration

of the suppressed equilibrium condition requiring that residents willingly hold

the portion of the stock of outside foreign bonds not held by foreigners. A

fall   in R, given E, leads to excess demand for foreign bonds. An appreciation

of E would reduce the domestic-currency value of the home country's stock of

foreign bonds (assuming the latter is positive) , and so increase rather than

decrease this excess demand. Since domestic credit expansion lowers R while

leaving the stock of privately-owned foreign bonds unchanged, it must also

cause E to rise. Note that the central bank could increase the base and lower

R by an outright nonsterilized purchase of foreign exchange rather than through

a purchase of domestic assets. This policy does not shift DD and therefore

has an even greater impact on E than an equal domestic credit expansion.



15. Herring and Marston (1977) employ a formulation similar to (4) in speci-

fying the Bundesbank reaction function they estimate over the Bretton Woods

period. Note that our definition of LDC ignores the effects of foreign

exchange   swaps with domestic banks.
                                          36




 16. When the lagged rather than the contemporaneous output gap was used in

the reaction function its coefficient was insignificant and of the wrong sign.



17.   The variable GAP is assumed to be predetermined. In the presence of a

systematic foreign—exchange intervention rule, the change in reserves valued

 at a constant exchange rate may be correlated with the disturbance to eq. (5).

 If such a correlation exists, ordinary least squares estimates of (5) are in-

 consistent.    more thorough analysis would specify a Bundesbank intervention

 function [as in Artus (1976)] and estimate 5) by two—stage least squares.


18. Artus (1976) draws similar conclusions from a domestic credit policy re-

action function estimated over the period 1973:4—1975:7. His estimate of the

sterilization coefficient (-. 745)   is   somewhat lower than those reported here.

Darby and Stockman (1983), like Artus, find evidence of substantial but in-

complete sterilization over the floating-rate period through 1976. Black (1983)

also finds evidence of sterilization, but for a longer sample period (1964:2-

1979:11) that includes part of the Bretton Woods era.




19. The quotations are taken from the Report of the Deutsche Bundesbank

for the Year 1980.



20.   Empirical studies show that covered interest parity holds quite closely

in the Eurocurrency markets [see Frenkel and Levich (1981) and Herring and

Marston (1976), among others]. Thus, if Eurodollar and Eurodeutschemark

deposits are perfect substitutes on an uncovered basis, the forward premium on

dollars in terms of DM quoted in London must equal the expected rate of deprecia..

tion of the mark against the dollar. An alternative approach that avoids
                                     37




the assumption of perfect substitution among Eurocurrency deposits takes

the realized depreciation rate as a proxy for the expected rate. The econo-

metric issues raised by the alternative approach (along with appropriate

estimation techniques) are described by Cumby, Huizinga, and Obstfeld (1982).



21. The exchange risk premium, which allows Eurocurrency interest differentials

and expected depreciation rates to differ, is studid by Frankel (1979),

Hodrick (1981) , and Stulz (1982), among others.



22. Aliber (1973) has suggested that covered interest differentials between

bonds issued in different political jurisdictions and between home- and foreign—

currency bonds issued in the same jurisdiction, are explicable in part by poli-

tical risks. Dooley and Isard (1980) and Genberg (1981) provide more recent

discussions. Kouri (1976) analyzes a stochastic model in which political/default

risk generates covered interest differentials depending on outside asset stocks.

       Capital controls--for exartple, prohibitions on asset sales or interest

payments to foreigners--provide an additional instrument of central bank

policy and are often imposed when the requirements of internal and external

balance conflict. Use of that instrument naturally entails severe efficien-

cy costs. Both existing capital controls and the prospect of additional future

capital controls cause deviations from covered interest parity. The Bundesbank

is empowered to implement capital controls under Article 23 of the Foreign

Trade and Payments Law of 1961. During the closing years of the Bretton Woods

period, significant barriers to capital inflow were erected in an attempt

to salvage the faltering system of fixed parities. Dooley and Isard (1980)

estimate that political risk can at times account for up to 200 basis points

of the differential between the onshore three-month interbank interest rate
                                       38




 and the Zurich three—month Eurodeutschemark rate during 1970-1974. Most (but

 not all) of these capital controls were dismantled in the early years of the

 float. One that remained was the prohibition on nonresident purchases of cer-

 tain securities (e.g., public authority bonds and money-market paper) first

 imposed in June 1972. The stringency of that control was varied in subsequent

 years in response to the changing external situation. In January 1974, non-

 resident purchases of fixed—interest securities with maturities exceeding four

 years were again authorized. The minimum maturity was reduced to two years

 in September 1975 (at which time the existing authorization requirement for the

 payment of interest on nonresident deposits with domestic banks was also abo—

 lished); increased again to four years in December 1977; reduced to two years

 in March 1980; and reduced to one year in November 1980. In February 1981,

 the prohibition was relaxed completely. It seems reasonable to conclude that

 during 1975-1981, the policy environment was one in which the probability of

 further capital controls was significant. Transaction costs can of course

 explain a portion of the onshore—offshore covered interest differential, but

 it is unlikely that they provide a complete explanation. McCormick (1979)

 argues that transaction costs are smaller than has been widely believed.
 For an application of Dooley arid Isard's (1980) model to the recent French
 experience, see Claassen and Wyplosz (1983).
 23. A more complete specification of the home bond market would disaggregate

 resident domestic bond holders into banks and nonbanks. That extension has

 been foregone in the interest of simplicity.



24. The instrumental variables for each equation were the logarithm of the lagged

nominal asset stock deflated by P (t—l) (E (t-l) in the case of eq. (14)) plus R* Ct),

R(t—1), log(CURR(t-l)/M(t-1)), log(REQ(t-l)), log(H(t-l)/P(t-l)), log(y(t)),

log(W(t—l)/P(t—l)), log(W*(t)/P*(t)) (where p* is the U.S. CPI), DISC(t—l),
                                       39




and log((DBT(t—1)/p(t—1)). This choice of instruments again reflects the

assumption that y(t) may he viewed as a predetermined variable (cf. section 4);

but it allows for the possible eridogeneity of nominal domestic wealth and the

home price level. Note, however, that foreign wealth W* and the U.S. price

level * are assumed to be exogenous.



25. The sample-period starting date was dictated by the nonavailability of

data on the variable 5* prior to 1974:12.



26. The assumption of perfect foresight cannot, by itself, yield a unique

exchange rate path; some terminal condition is required in addition. The

terminal condition assumed in simulation is described below.



27. Simulations were performed on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology

TROLL system using a linearized version of the model.


                                                                        experiments.
28. Note that the same terminal condition is imposed in all three simulation/

The assumption behind this procedure is that the transitory interventions have

a negligible effect on the economy's position two years after their termination.
