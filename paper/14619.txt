Hospitals As Hotels: The Role of Patient Amenities in Hospital Demand

                                              ABSTRACT

Amenities such as good food, attentive staff, and pleasant surroundings may play an important role
in hospital demand. We use a marketing survey to measure amenities at hospitals in greater Los Angeles
and analyze the choice behavior of Medicare pneumonia patients in this market. We find that the mean
valuation of amenities is positive and substantial. From the patient perspective, hospital quality therefore
embodies amenities as well as clinical quality. We also find that a one-standard-deviation increase
in amenities raises a hospital's demand by 38.4% on average, whereas demand is substantially less
responsive to clinical quality as measured by pneumonia mortality. These findings imply that hospitals
may have an incentive to compete in amenities, with potentially important implications for welfare.

1     Introduction
There is persuasive evidence that quality of care in‡uences hospital demand.
Tay (2003) has found, for example, that demand among heart-attack patients
is substantially higher at hospitals with advanced capabilities for cardiac
care. This evidence implies that analysts and policy makers must consider
clinical quality as well as geography in de…ning markets for hospital care.
Furthermore, such opportunities for di¤erentiation in clinical quality may
have important implications for welfare in competitive equilibrium. For
example, hospitals might engage in a "medical arms race" by competing for
physicians and their patients on the basis of costly and welfare-dissipating
investments in medical care [see, e.g., Robinson and Luft (1985); Dranove
and Satterthwaite (2000); Gaynor and Vogt (2000); Kessler and McClellan
(2000)].
     Hospitals may also di¤erentiate themselves in another dimension of qual-
ity, amenities. Indeed, Newhouse (1994) likens the hospital enterprise to that
of an airline, for which good food, attentive sta¤ and pleasant surroundings
are plausibly important aspects of the overall service. Yet good measures of
such amenities have been lacking for hospitals. Thus, …ndings of substan-
tial productive ine¢ ciency among American hospitals may in fact point to a
substantial role for amenities [Newhouse (1994)].1
     In the market that we study, greater Los Angeles, there is circumstantial
evidence of competition in amenities. For instance, a Beverly-Hills-based
physician group acquired Century City Hospital in west Los Angeles in 2004.
The group invested nearly $100 million in improvements to medical care and
patient amenities, with "…ve-star personalized service" including a concierge
and nightly turn down; bedside internet portals and ‡at-screen televisions
with movies on demand; and gourmet organic cuisine prepared and served
by the sta¤ of chef Wolfgang Puck [Costello (2008)]. This hospital …led for
bankruptcy in August, 2008.
     Nearby, the Ronald Reagan Medical Center opened in June, 2008, at a
cost of $830 million [UCLA Health System (2008a)]. UCLA built this hospi-
tal to meet new mandates for seismic safety. Even so, an aggressive market-
ing campaign emphasizes its "hospitality." [UCLA Health System (2008b)]
Where UCLA’s previous hospital lacked private rooms, the new facility’s
   1
     Zuckerman et al. (1994) attribute nearly 14% of total costs in U.S. hospitals to pro-
ductive ine¢ ciency. Their analysis, like others, does not account for hospital amenities.



                                            2
"large, sunny, private patient rooms not only feature magni…cent views and
daybeds for family members, but also wireless Internet access for patients
and guests, multiple outdoor play areas for children, and a host of other
unexpected amenities." Such amenities include massage therapy and "hotel-
style" room service for meals.
    Our aim here is to develop the …rst systematic evidence on the role of
amenities in hospital demand. We use a survey conducted by a healthcare
market-research …rm to measure amenities at hospitals in greater LA. We
then analyze the choice behavior of Medicare fee-for-service patients with
pneumonia in this market. These patients are especially likely to exercise
choice among hospitals. In addition, we need not measure, nor deal with
the endogeneity of, their out-of-pocket costs, because these costs are uniform
across hospitals. A well-suited measure of clinical quality — namely, risk-
adjusted mortality rates for community-acquired pneumonia — is also widely
available for hospitals in greater LA.
    To preview our …ndings, the mean valuation of a one-standard-deviation
increase in amenities is positive and substantial. In addition, a one-standard-
deviation increase in amenities raises a hospital’s demand among these pa-
tients by 38.4% on average, whereas demand is substantially less responsive
to clinical quality as measured by pneumonia mortality
    In the next section, we describe our approach to analyzing the role of
hospital amenities. Our empirical …ndings are presented in section 3. We
then o¤er some conclusions in a …nal section.


2     Analytical approach
We analyze the demand for hospitals in greater Los Angeles among Medicare
fee-for-service patients with pneumonia. To do so, we motivate a model of
patient choice behavior and hospital demand that accounts for amenities as
well as clinical quality. We then introduce our measures of these dimensions
of hospital quality. Finally, we describe the empirical analysis.

2.1    Patient choice behavior and hospital demand
We assume that Medicare fee-for-service pneumonia patients choose the hos-
pitals that maximize their utility. This kind of assumption has been main-
tained in a variety of studies of hospital demand and performance [Luft


                                      3
et al. (1990); Gowrisankaran and Town (1999); Kessler and McClellan (2000);
Town and Vistnes (2001); Kessler and McClellan (2002); Capps et al. (2003);
Gaynor and Vogt (2003); Geweke et al. (2003); Tay (2003)].
     There is reason to believe that many patients are able to select their hos-
pitals, and that Medicare fee-for-service pneumonia patients are especially
able to do so. These patients are constrained neither by provider network,
nor as a general matter by ambulance transport. Even so, these patients
are frequently admitted by physicians whose privileges are limited to a small
number of, and potentially only one, hospital. Yet patients may choose doc-
tors partly on the basis of admitting privileges [Dranove et al. (1992); Tay
(2003)]; indeed, hospitals actively seek to refer potential patients to physi-
cians [Gray (1986)]. Burns and Wholey (1992) have analyzed the role of
doctors in demand by accounting for the proximity of their o¢ ces to, and
their prior use of, hospitals. While patients are more likely to receive care
at hospitals favored by their physicians, patient attributes and preferences
nevertheless in‡uence choice. Consistent with this reasoning and evidence,
a market-research …rm has found that 58% of patients admitted for an ill-
ness (versus surgery or an accident) chose their hospitals themselves, while
another 9% selected from options presented by their physicians [National
Research Corporation (1986)].
     In choosing among hospitals, the utility that patient i expects from hos-
pital h consists of systematic and idiosyncratic components, denoted U ih and
 ih , as follows:
                                 Uih = U ih + ih                             (1)
The likelihood that a patient chooses a hospital is then2 :

                            lih      Pr (Uih       Uih0 8h0 6= h)                         (2)

    We assume that a patient values hospitals according to their characteris-
tics. In particular, systematic utility is speci…ed as:

  U ih =   d;i Distanceih   +     p;i P riceih +

                                   c;i Clinical    qualityh +   a;i Amenitiesh   +   h;   (3)

in which Distanceih is the distance between the patient’s home and a hospi-
tal, and is an amalgam of additional hospital characteristics, which patients
   2
    In our empirical model in Section 2.3, any two hospitals have equal utilities with zero
probability.

                                               4
may observe but we as researchers do not. The patient’s tastes for distance,
price, clinical quality, and amenities are characterized by the d;i , p;i , c;i ,
and a;i parameters.
    Previous research has consistently found that patients have a strong pref-
erence for hospitals that are close to their homes. As to prices, Gaynor and
Vogt (2003) analyze the demand of privately funded patients for California
hospitals in 1995 and estimate an average price elasticity of 4.85. Prices do
not a¤ect the hospital choices of the Medicare patients studied here, as we
explain in section 2.3.
    There is also considerable evidence that clinical quality in‡uences hospital
demand. Luft et al. (1990) analyzed hospital choices for patients with a
variety of surgical procedures and medical conditions (including pneumonia)
in three metropolitan areas in California in 1983. For 5 of 7 procedures and
2 of 5 conditions, demand was signi…cantly lower at hospitals with higher-
than-expected rates of complications and mortality.3 When New York began
to report cardiac mortality rates in the early 1990s, the market shares of
hospitals with low rates grew [Mukamel and Mushlin (1998)].
    More recently, Tay (2003) has studied hospital choice in urban California,
Oregon and Washington in 1994 among elderly Medicare patients with acute
myocardial infarction, or heart attack. Prompt transport to a hospital is
critical for this life-threatening condition. Even so, many patients willingly
passed by hospitals near their homes to be treated at hospitals with advanced
cardiac care. Tay estimates that demand increased by nearly 88% on average
when hospitals developed a capability for angioplasty or coronary bypass
surgery. Gaynor and Vogt (2003) …nd that patients prefer high-tech, as well
as teaching, hospitals.
    We argued in the introduction that hospital patients plausibly value
amenities such as good food, attentive sta¤, and pleasant surroundings. Yet
there is no direct evidence on the role of patient amenities in hospital de-
mand. Tay (2003) did …nd that demand is greater at hospitals with more
nurses per bed, but nursing may be an input into both clinical quality and
amenities. Good measures of hospital amenities have been unavailable.
   3
    Demand was higher at hospitals with low clinical quality for 2 procedures and 1
condition. Pneumonia demand was unrelated to pneumonia mortality. Iezzoni et al.
(1996) has found that outcomes measures are sensitive to the risk-adjustment method.
Based on the measure of pneumonia mortality used in this analysis, demand is substantially
higher at hospitals with high clinical quality.



                                            5
2.2       Measuring amenities and clinical quality in greater
          Los Angeles
We measure hospital amenities based on the Healthcare Market Guide (HCMG).4
The National Research Corporation (NRC), a healthcare marketing-research
…rm, promotes the HCMG to hospitals and others as the "most sophisticated
and comprehensive consumer market intelligence." The HCMG summarizes
the results of an annual NRC survey of households in the 48 contiguous
states. Sample households are invited — by mail prior to 2005 and over
the internet since — to complete self-administered questionnaires, and re-
sponses are weighted according to household characteristics to ensure their
representativeness within each market area. We were able to access the 2002
HCMG for the Los Angeles-Long Beach, Orange County, and Riverside-San
Bernardino primary metropolitan statistical areas; these MSAs contain the
greater Los Angeles hospital market, as de…ned in the next section.
    The HCMG reports the weighted numbers of respondent households in
each MSA who named hospitals as their …rst choice for best accommoda-
tions/amenities and other attributes (see Appendix Table A1). We aggre-
gate responses across the three MSAs, weighting by the number of households
in each MSA in the 2002 American Community Survey. Table 1 describes
our measure of amenities at the 117 hospitals studied, namely, the percent-
age of survey respondents naming each hospital as their …rst choice for "best
amenities." This measure ranges from a minimum of zero percent (at 28
hospitals) to a maximum of 16.1 percent.
    We measure the clinical quality of hospitals with their mortality rates for
patients with community-acquired pneumonia. This measure is well-suited
to an analysis of choice behavior among pneumonia patients. As others
have recognized, patients are fundamentally concerned with health outcomes
[see, e.g., Luft et al. (1990); Mukamel and Mushlin (1998); Gowrisankaran
and Town (1999); Kessler and McClellan (2000); Geweke et al. (2003)], and
death is not infrequent among pneumonia patients. Yet there is evidence that
mortality for pneumonia and other conditions in hospitals throughout the
U.S. is weakly correlated with process-oriented measures of clinical quality
(e.g., oxygenation assessment within 24 hours of admission) [Werner and
Bradlow (2006); Bradley et al. (2006)].
    Pneumonia mortality rates are widely available for California hospitals.

The California O¢ ce of Statewide Health Planning and Development has
computed 30-day mortality rates [California O¢ ce of Statewide Health Plan-
ning and Development (2004)]; a risk-adjustment model accounts for varia-
tion across hospitals in observed determinants of patient severity.5 We av-
erage rates over the years 2000-2004, because rates are unavailable for some
hospitals in some years6 , and averaging may smooth these noisy outcomes
[McClellan and Staiger (1999)]. As Table 1 shows, pneumonia mortality
ranged from a minimum of 6.6 percent to a maximum of 19.6 percent at 117
sample hospitals.7 Hospitals with low pneumonia mortality tended to have
slightly better amenities in this sample ( = +0:086).
    These rates proxy for patient information about the clinical quality of
hospitals. Pneumonia mortality rates were …rst publicly reported only after
the patients studied made their hospital choices. Even so, patients may be
reasonably well informed about clinical quality from their physicians, friends
and families [Harris and Buntin (2008)]. Evidence that patient choice was
related to hospital mortality in the absence of public reporting is consistent
with this view [Luft et al. (1990)]. In addition, in the context of health insur-
ance, Dafny and Dranove (2008) …nd that Medicare patients were somewhat
aware of the quality of health plans prior to the dissemination of plan report
cards.
    In a sensitivity analysis, we consider an alternative measure of clinical
quality motivated by the prior research described in the preceding section.
In particular, we measure clinical quality by the percentages of HCMG survey
respondents naming hospitals as their …rst choice for the latest technology
and equipment. Summary statistics for this measure are reported in the
appendix.
   5
     OSHPD computes and publishes pneumonia mortality rates for two risk models. We
use the rates that account for do-not-resuscitate orders.
   6
     A hospital’s rate is not reported in any year if there were fewer than 30 patients in
the analysis sample, or the hospital closed or changed ownership, during the year.
   7
     If mortality were reported throughout greater LA, the numbers of hospitals and pa-
tients in our benchmark analysis would increase from 117 to 130 and from 8,721 to 9,077,
respectively. The number of patients averaged 74.5 at hospitals for which pneumonia
mortality was reported, versus 27.4 at hospitals whose mortality was not reported.

2.3     Empirical speci…cation
In analyzing the role of amenities in hospital demand, we estimate a mixed-
logit model of hospital choice by maximum simulated likelihood. To do
so, we use discharge abstracts for California hospital patients compiled by
the California O¢ ce of Statewide Health Planning and Development. For
each hospital stay, these abstracts identify the hospital from which a patient
is discharged. In addition, they report a variety of patient characteristics,
including principal diagnosis and other medical conditions; payer; age, gender
and race; residential zip code; and source of admission (e.g., from home).
    In the benchmark analysis, we consider Medicare fee-for-service pneu-
monia patients discharged from general acute-care hospitals in greater Los
Angeles in 2002. Los Angeles hospitals have been widely studied [Luft et al.
(1990); Gowrisankaran and Town (1999); Town and Vistnes (2001); Geweke
et al. (2003); Tay (2003); Romley and Goldman (2008)]. In addition, as
discussed in the preceding section, risk-adjusted pneumonia mortality rates
are widely available for LA hospitals during this time frame.
    The benchmark sample includes 8,721 patients who resided in metropoli-
tan LA’s …ve counties and were admitted with a principal diagnosis of pneu-
monia to one of the 50 hospitals nearest their homes [Tay (2003)].8 A small
number of patients chose more distant hospitals, yet this restriction on the
choice set facilitates estimation of the choice model. The sample also ex-
cludes patients whose age, gender or race was masked for privacy reasons;
patients whose reported zip code could not be matched to a zip-code data-
base are likewise excluded [ESRI (2001)]. In addition, we exclude patients
who were not admitted from home, because choice in other settings (such
as nursing homes) may have been in‡uenced by unobserved factors [Geweke
et al. (2003)]. Patients who were less than 65 years old are also excluded.
Finally, we exclude patients whose nearest hospital did not belong to the
greater Los Angeles market. Summary statistics for this patient sample are
reported in the appendix.
    These patients chose from 117 for which the benchmark measures of clini-
cal quality and amenities in the preceding section were available (see Appen-
   8
    The 50 hospitals closest to each patient includes any facilities whose clinical quality
was not available, that is, hospitals that are themselves excluded from the choice analysis.
  The ICD-9-CM code for a pneumonia patient begins with the numbers 481, 482, 485,
486 or 4838. The ICD code of heart-attack patients (whom we consider in an alternative
analysis) begins with 410.


                                             8
dix Table A3). Our de…nition of the greater LA market excludes hospitals in
the Ventura and Palm Springs Hospital Referral Regions [Dartmouth Med-
ical School, The Center for the Evaluative Clinical Sciences (1998)], as well
as some remote hospitals. In an earlier study, we found that the excluded
hospitals did not compete with hospitals in our market [Romley and Gold-
man (2008)]. Kaiser Permanente hospitals have also been excluded, because
these facilities did not regularly admit Medicare fee-for-service patients.
     Under the model presented in section 2.1, the likelihood that a patient
chooses a hospital is equal to the likelihood that a hospital maximizes her
utility in equation 1. We assume that idiosyncratic tastes for hospitals are
distributed i.i.d. type-1 extreme-valued and that all potential patients elect
to receive care at some hospital. Then, conditional on systematic utility
U ih , the choice likelihood takes the logit form [McFadden (1974)]:
                                       .X
                                 eU ih      0
                                              eU ih0 ;                      (4)
                                                  h

       Systematic utility in equation 3 simpli…es as:

   U ih =     d;i Distanceih   +   c;i Clinical   qualityh +   a;i Amenitiesh   +   h   (5)

    Hospital prices can be excluded from systematic utility because Medicare
insures fee-for-service bene…ciaries for almost all of the costs of inpatient
care [Tay (2003)]. This feature of the analysis is convenient. Researchers
generally cannot observe hospital prices (as opposed to unadjusted charges.)
Furthermore, under plausible models of oligopolistic competition, a hospital’s
price is correlated with the unobserved characteristic h , so that an instru-
ment would be needed for price [Berry et al. (1995)]. Under our approach,
amenities are valued in utils, and their value may be compared to the value
of clinical quality (or proximity to home.)
    For the distance between a patient’s home and a hospital, we calculated
straight-line distances between hospital street addresses and the centroids
of patient zip codes.9 Our measures of clinical quality and amenities were
described in the preceding section. We use the negative of the pneumonia
mortality rate, because higher clinical quality corresponds to lower mortality.
   9
    The latitudes and longitudes of zip centroids in the year 2000 were obtained from
a commercial GIS database [ESRI (2001)]. Hospital geocoordinates were reported in a
2006 regulatory database [California O¢ ce of Statewide Health Planning and Development
(2006)]. We used an online geocoding tool to determine the locations of hospitals that
ceased operation after 2002; see http://geocoder.us/.

                                              9
   We allow for heterogeneity in patient tastes for clinical quality, amenities
and distance as follows:
                           75+ years 75+ years
  x;i   =       x;0   +    x        Di         + Fx emale DiF emale + Black
                                                                      x     DiBlack          (6a)
                                   + CDI
                                       x CDIi + Income
                                                    x      Incomei + x xi ; x =          c; a; d

where the dummy variable Di75+ years indicates whether a patient is 75+
years old, and DiF emale and DiBlack are de…ned similarly. Household income
is estimated from Census data on a patient’s zip code, following Geweke
et al. (2003).10 The Charlson-Deyo index CDIi measures poor health based
on other medical conditions reported in the discharge abstract [Quan et al.
(2005)]. Age, gender, race, income and health have been found to be related
to hospital choice in prior research [see, e.g., Gaynor and Vogt (2003) and
Tay (2003)]. Finally, xi is a random component of the taste for x that we
as researchers do not observe.
    The empirical analysis proceeds in two stages. These stages correspond
to the following restatement of equation 5:

        U ih =            d;i Distanceih   +   c;i        c   Clinical qualityh              (7a)
                                                      +       a;i    a   Amenitiesh +   h;

            h   =         c Clinical   qualityh +     a Amenitiesh       +   h               (7b)

in which x denotes the mean taste for hospital characteristic x in the pa-
tient sample. Hospital-speci…c h parameters embody the mean valuations
of each hospital’s clinical quality and amenities, as well as the unobserved
characteristic h .
    In the …rst stage, we estimate the parameters of the choice model, namely,
the hospital-speci…c h parameters in equation 7a together with the taste
parameters of equation 6a.11 To do so, we de-mean the patient characteristics
  10
     We …rst match the …ve-digit zip code of a patient’s home to the …ve-digit Zip Code
Tabulation Area (ZCTA) de…ned by the Census to approximate U.S. Postal Service zip
codes. Where there is no match, we match the patient to the ZCTA whose centroid is
nearest to the centroid of her USPS zip code. We then estimate average income among
black and non-black households headed by persons aged 65-74 and 75 or older within
the ZCTA. The Census reports the number of households within income intervals (e.g.,
$35,000 to $39,999), and we use the midpoint of each bounded interval (and a value of
$280,000 for the unbounded highest-income interval) to compute an average. When there
are no black households within a ZCTA, we use average income among all racial groups.
  11
     A normalization on h is required. We set h = 0 for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.

                                                     10
in equation 6a and interact them with distance, clinical quality and amenities.
The parameters on these interactions then indicate deviations from mean
tastes according to patient characteristics.12
    The choice likelihood in equation 4 is conditional on systematic utility,
which is random due to the random components of tastes in equation 6a.
The unconditional likelihood that a patient is observed to choose a hospital
in equation 2 is therefore:
                             Z              !
                                   eU ih
                       lih =     P U 0 f ( i) d i;                         (8)
                                   h 0 e ih


where f ( i ) is the joint density of the random tastes. This model of hospital
choice belongs to the mixed-logit class, which can approximate any random
utility model to any degree of accuracy [McFadden and Train (2000)]. Mixed-
logit models do not exhibit independence of irrelevant alternatives or the
restrictive substitution patterns of the logit [Train (2003)].
    The parameters of our model are estimated by maximum simulated likeli-
hood [Hajivassiliou and Ruud (1994)]. We assume that f ( i ) is multivariate
standard normal; the parameter x in equation 6a is therefore the standard
deviation of the random taste for x. The likelihood that each patient chose
the observed hospital is then simulated by taking repeated draws on random
tastes and averaging over the resulting likelihoods for each of the draws. We
use 50 shu- ed Halton draws. In simulating a mixed-logit model, Halton
draws can be more accurate than a larger number of pseudorandom draws
[Bhat (2001)]. Hess and Polak (2003) describe the construction of shu- ed
draws and …nd that such draws outperform standard (as well as scrambled)
Halton draws; Chiou and Walker (2007) show that shu- ed draws may be rel-
atively e¤ective in revealing a lack of identi…cation in a mixed-logit model.
    The choice analysis cannot separately identify the components of h . In
the second stage, we determine the mean valuations of clinical quality and
amenities. To do so, we regress equation 7b by OLS using estimates of h
from the …rst-stage choice analysis. This analysis delivers unbiased estimates
of c and a if clinical quality and amenities are uncorrelated with the unob-
served product characteristic h . This kind of assumption has been widely
  12
     For example, in comparison to the mean valuation of amenities in the patient sample,
a black female younger than 75 and of average income and health has a value of a;Black +
  a;F emale    a;75+years .
   When patient characteristics are demeaned, the constant in our speci…cation of the taste
for distance is equal to the mean distaste for distance in the sample. That is, d;0 = d .

maintained in empirical studies of di¤erentiated-products demand [see, e.g.,
Nevo (2001) and Gaynor and Vogt (2003)].
     In the hospital setting, there is evidence of a "volume-outcome relation-
ship" in which adverse health outcomes such as mortality are less common at
hospitals with high patient volume [Luft et al. (1987)]. One explanation for
such a relationship is that patients prefer hospitals with high clinical quality,
i.e., c > 0. An alternative explanation is that "practice makes perfect."
Under this explanation, clinical quality is positively correlated with h , if
patients choose hospitals based on characteristics that researchers do not ob-
serve. Estimates of the mean valuation of clinical quality based on equation
7b could then be biased upward. In the case of pneumonia, however, the
evidence for a volume-outcome relationship is weak at best [Lindenauer et al.
(2006)].13


3      Findings
In this section, we …rst present our …ndings on the role of amenities in patient
utility. We then describe our …ndings on the role of amenities in patient
utility and hospital demand. We also considered clinical quality as a basis
of comparison. In doing so, we analyzed one-standard-deviation increases
in clinical quality and amenities. Elasticities would often be unde…ned,
because the measure of hospital amenities is frequently zero. In addition,
standardization is useful because the variability of these dimensions of quality
di¤ers, with clinical quality being more variable in the benchmark analysis.

3.1     Amenities and patient utility
Table 2 summarizes the value of improvements in hospital amenities and
clinical quality for the benchmark analysis described in section 2. The
results of this analysis are reported in full in Appendix Tables A5 and A6.
    Within the sample of Medicare pneumonia patients, the mean valuation
of a one-standard-deviation increase in hospital amenities is +0.486 utils,
while the mean valuation of a one-standard-deviation reduction in pneumonia
  13
    Recent studies that have carefully assessed the direction of causality between volumes
and outcomes suggest that practice sometimes does make perfect, for instance, in the per-
formance of coronary bypass surgery [Gaynor et al. (2005); Gowrisankaran et al. (2006)].



                                           12
mortality is +0.173 utils. The standard error of each of these estimates is
0.111— in a regression of two standardized covariates, their standard errors
are necessarily equal. This apparent preference for amenities over clinical
quality is statistically signi…cant at a 10% level. We are unable, however, to
precisely estimate marginal rates of substitution between these dimensions
of hospital quality.
    This evidence that amenities are valued more highly than clinical quality
is surprising insofar as mortality would seem to be of paramount concern to
most patients. Our analysis may understate the value of clinical quality.
As noted in section 2.2, mortality rates proxy for patient information about
clinical quality. In addition, patients may recognize that quality information
is subject to sampling variability and discount apparent di¤erences. Finally,
there is evidence that people systematically overstate low-probability mortal-
ity risks while understating high-probability risks [Lichtenstein et al. (1978)].
Pneumonia mortality averaged 12.5% at the hospitals studied. Patients may
underestimate the average level of pneumonia mortality and, moreover, may
"under-react" to di¤erences across hospitals. Our analysis is informative
about the role that clinical quality has played in hospital choice, insofar as
mortality rates are a good proxy for patient information about clinical qual-
ity. In any event, patients do appear to value amenities.
    The value of quality improvement varies across patients, as Table 2 also
shows. When the index of poor health increases by a standard deviation
from its mean level, the value of a standardized increase in clinical quality
increases by nearly half.14 In addition, African Americans value clinical
quality less highly than others. Indeed, for African Americans with average
health status, etc., the estimated value would be 0:133. We have not
formally tested whether this estimate is statistically distinguishable from
zero. This estimate includes sampling variability from the second-stage
analysis of the mean taste for clinical quality, as well as the …rst-stage analysis
of hospital choice based on tastes among blacks and non-blacks for clinical
quality [Murphy and Topel (1985)].15 We do note that the standard error of
the taste for clinical quality among blacks is substantial (see Appendix Table
A5).
    Our mixed-logit model of hospital choice also allows for randomness in
  14
       (0:263 0:173)h /0:173 corresponds to a i51:9% increase:
  15                             Black  Black
        0:133 = c c + 1                 c       ; in which c is the standard deviation of
                                    Black
clinical quality at hospitals and           is the proportion of blacks in the patient sample.


                                               13
tastes. There is substantial variation in unobserved tastes for clinical quality.
None of the other relationships between patient characteristics and the two
dimensions of hospital quality is statistically signi…cant at a 10% level.

    Alternative speci…cations We …rst considered an alternative measure
of clinical quality, namely, the percentage of HCMG survey respondents who
named hospitals as their …rst choice for the latest technology and equipment.
The estimated value of clinical quality based on this measure is negative but
indistinguishable from zero, as shown in Table 3. The value of amenities
continues to be positive and substantial, however.
    We also compared pneumonia patients to heart-attack patients, as shown
in Table 4. Clinical quality is again measured on the basis of pneumonia mor-
tality, because a measure of mortality related to cardiac care was not widely
available.16 The value of clinical quality among these patients is estimated
to be nearly twice as large as among pneumonia patients: 0.338 vs. 0.173 at
the mean. Heart-attack patients also value amenities; indeed, the value is
higher than for pneumonia patients. Nevertheless, the estimated marginal
rate of substitution of clinical quality for amenities is nearly forty percent
lower for heart-attack patients (1.72 vs. 2.81), consistent with the view that
more acutely ill patients should value clinical quality more highly in relation
to amenities. We also considered having the latest technology/equipment
as a measure of clinical quality for heart-attack patients but found the mean
value to be indistinguishable from zero.

3.2     Amenities and hospital demand
We used the results of the benchmark choice analysis to assess the role of
amenities in hospital demand. To do so, we aggregated the predicted likeli-
hoods of patient-level hospital choices up to expected hospital-level demand.
We …rst determined the impact of a standardized increase in each hospital’s
amenities on its own demands and that of its competitors. This counter-
  16
     The California O¢ ce of Statewide Health Planning and Development has estimated
risk-adjusted mortality rates for coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG) for the period
2000-2002 [California O¢ ce of Statewide Health Planning and Development (2007)].
While pneumonia mortality was reported for 117 hospitals in greater LA, CABG mor-
tality was available for only 35 hospitals. When we analyzed the choices of heart-attack
patients among these hospitals with clinical quality measured by CABG mortality, the
value of clinical quality was indistinguishable from zero.


                                          14
factual holds …xed the locations of patients and hospitals and their other
characteristics, including the amenities of competitors as well as the clinical
quality of all hospitals. Table 5 summarizes the results.
    When amenities increase by one standard deviation, a hospital’s demand
among the pneumonia patients studied increases by nearly 38.4% on aver-
age in greater LA. For competing hospitals, demand decreases by 8.4% on
average at facilities located within 2 miles, by 3.5% at facilities that are 2-5
miles distant, by 1.0% at facilities that are 5-10 miles distant, and by 0.02%
at facilities more than 10 miles away. The impact is smaller at more distant
hospitals because patients strongly prefer hospitals close to home. As others
have found, hospitals tend to compete more intensely with their geographic
neighbors.
    We also determined the impact of standardized increases in clinical qual-
ity. A hospital’s own demand increases by 12.7% on average. The estimated
impact of increased clinical quality is smaller than the impact of increased
amenities, much as we found in the preceding section that pneumonia pa-
tients value lower reported mortality rates less than improved amenities. The
impact on the demand for competitors again decreases with distance, from
2.7% on average at facilities within 2 miles to only 0.01% at facilities farther
than 10 miles.


4    Conclusions
This study has assessed the role that amenities play in hospital demand.
Analyzing the hospital choices of Medicare pneumonia patients in greater
Los Angeles, we found that the mean value of amenities is positive and
substantial. In addition, a one-standard-deviation increase in a hospital’s
amenities increases its demand among the patients studied by 38.4% at the
average hospital. A standardized increase in clinical quality (as measured
by lower pneumonia mortality) increases a hospital’s demand by only 12.7%
on average. These …ndings indicate that hospitals may have an incentive to
compete in amenities, with potentially important implications for welfare.
    The welfare consequences of competition among hospitals in clinical qual-
ity have been widely studied [see, e.g., Robinson and Luft (1985) or Kessler
and McClellan (2000)]. These analyses were motivated in part by a concern
that limited price competition under fee-for-service reimbursement could lead
to a wasteful "arms race" in medical services, with more intense competition


                                      15
resulting in greater waste. As managed care has grown in importance,
there is evidence that hospital demand is responsive to price. For example,
Gaynor and Vogt (2003) found that the elasticity of demand averaged 4.85 at
California hospitals in the mid-’90s. This result is consistent with positive
price-cost margins.
    Imperfect competition in amenities need not result in a welfare-maximizing
equilibrium. Consider a hospital’s incentives to deviate from the social op-
timum in its provision of amenities. On the one hand, we have found that
increased amenities steal business and thus net income from competing hos-
pitals. A hospital ignores this impact on the welfare of competitors and may
therefore provide too many amenities. On the other hand, a hospital may
be unable to appropriate the full value of improved amenities to patients,
potentially resulting in too few amenities. A hospital supplies the optimal
level of amenities only if these o¤setting incentives cancel. Similar reasoning
applies to the supply of clinical quality.
    These observations are of considerable relevance to public policy. Under
Medicare’s prospective payment system, reimbursement for medical services
and amenities are bundled. Such reimbursement is neutral with respect to
the potential trade-o¤ between the supply of clinical quality and amenities,
and the incentive to supply each turns on their private bene…ts and costs to
hospitals. As the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services increasingly
pursue "value-based purchasing" [U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (2007)], the social bene…ts and costs of amenities and clinical qual-
ity, and the provision of each in market equilibrium, become all the more
important. These are worthwhile directions for future research.

Notes: Results correspond to benchmark analysis. Measures of clinical quality
and amenities are described in Table A1. Amenities and clinical quality are
collinear with and embodied in hospital δ. All patient characteristics are de-
meaned relative to benchmark patient sample; distance "intercept" is therefore
mean distaste. * indicates statistical significance at the 10% level, ** at 5%, and
*** at 1%.
