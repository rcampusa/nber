                                              ABSTRACT

        The role of schooling and school quality in the economy has become very confused, in part
because of attempts to argue different positions on educational policy. Research demonstrates that school
quality has a strong impact on individual earnings, on the distribution of income, and on overall economic
growth. In contrast to these long run factors, today’s school quality has little to do with current business
cycles or unemployment rates. This paper emphasizes the importance of school quality – measured by
math and science test scores – on economic growth. While U.S. growth has been strong over the 20th
century, it has not been the result of high quality schooling relative to that in other countries. Instead
other factors such as open labor markets and high quality colleges and universities appear to have masked
the mediocre performance by U.S. students.

           The Long Run Importance of School Quality
                                      By Eric A. Hanushek

        The early 1990s saw the height of the East Asian miracle. The economies of Japan,

Korea, and other countries of the region were expanding at rates that dwarfed those of the United

States and OECD countries. Simple projections saw these economies as overtaking and

surpassing the U.S. economy within short periods of time. And, in the soul searching that

accompanied concerns about this blow to national pride, new attention was focused on the U.S.

educational system. Thus, when the East Asian countries lost their luster, many educators

breathed a sigh of relief. The U.S. economy entered into a record breaking period of high

employment and recession free growth during the 1990s, while Japan found high unemployment

and recession to be a persistent fixture of the period. The economic trends have, however, been

frequently misinterpreted. Many commentators appear all too eager to jump on almost any

economic news and to link it to today’s schools. Any pattern of bad economic results

demonstrates to some that the education system is broken, while any economic good news

provides others with confirmation of the superiority of the U.S. education system. Sorting out the

various facets of interaction of the education system with the economy is important because it

focuses attention on some important policy issues that will have substantial impact on our future

well-being while eliminating some of the spurious but oft-repeated arguments.

        Research shows an increased importance of worker skills. This increased importance of

skills appears in its effects on the earnings of individuals and on the subsequent distribution of

income in the economy. And, central to the discussion here, worker skills and school quality

importantly influence growth of the national economy. The irrefutable fact is that the pattern of

economic growth has huge ramifications for society, so that things that affect growth deserve

special attention.




                                                  1
        The education system is central to the development of skills, a fact long recognized by

parents, policy makers, and educators. And, over the past century, the United States led the world

in the expansion of its education system. This expansion education has contributed to the pre-

eminent position of the U.S. economy in the world. Nonetheless, concerns exist about the future.

The concerns revolve around the knowledge of graduates and the quality of the schools. There is

little evidence that the K-12 education system in the United States is in fact competitive in the

world economy or that it can be counted on to fuel future U.S. economic growth. These are

matters that we should take very seriously.

        The fact that other aspects of the U.S. economy are sufficient to compensate for the

mediocre quality of its schools should not be taken as justification for allowing the current state to

continue. The quality of schooling has a clear impact on both individual earnings and the growth

of the overall economy, and the available evidence suggests that improvements in the schools

would translate into substantial long run gains.



Observations about the Economy and School Quality


        Confusion about the relationship between schooling and economic outcomes has existed

for some time. Part of the muddled ideas can be related to the language and perspective of A

Nation at Risk (National Commission on Excellence in Education (1983)). Written during a

recession, it implied that the general state of the economy could be directly traced to performance

of the educational system. A variety of writers who have taken the position that there are no

overall problems with U.S. schools have picked up this rhetoric coupled with improved economic

conditions. For example, Alfie Kohn (2000), responding specifically to A Nation at Risk, writes:

        “As proof of the inadequacy of U.S. schools, many writers and public officials

        pointed to the sputtering condition of the U.S. economy. As far as I know, none

        of them subsequently apologized for offering a mistaken and unfair attack on our



                                                   2
        educational system once the economy recovered, nor did anyone credit teachers

        for the turnaround.”

        And, Gerald Bracey (2002) takes the argument one step further. Noting that a variety of

people from before and after A Nation at Risk had argued for improving schools in order to

maintain U.S. economic strength, he says, “None of these fine gentlemen provided any data on

the relationship between the economy's health and the performance of schools. Our long

economic boom suggests there isn't one – or that our schools are better than the critics claim.”

        With the confusion created by the statements of both politicians and educational

commentators, it is useful to review what we know about the relationship between education and

the economy. Economists have devoted considerable attention to understanding how “human

capital” affects a variety of economic outcomes. The underlying notion is that individuals make

investment decisions in themselves through schooling and other routes. The accumulated skills

that are relevant for the labor market from these investments over time represent the human

capital of an individual. The investments made to improve skills then return future economic

benefits in much the same way that investing in a set of machines (physical capital) by a firm

returns future production and income. In the case of public education, parents and public officials

act as trustees for their children in setting many aspects of the investment paths.

        In looking at human capital and its implications for future outcomes, economists are

frequently agnostic about where these skills come from or how they are produced. While we

return to this below, it is nonetheless commonly presumed that formal schooling is one of several

important contributors to the skills of an individual and to human capital. It is not the only factor.

Parents, individual abilities, and friends undoubtedly contribute. Schools nonetheless have a

special place because they are most directly affected by public policies. For this reason we

frequently emphasize the role of schools.

        The general human capital perspective immediately makes it evident that the real issues

are ones of long run outcomes. Future incomes of individuals are related to their past


                                                  3
investments. It is not their income while in school or their income in their first job. Instead it is

their income over their working life.

        The distribution of income in the economy similarly involves both the mixture of people

in the economy and the pattern of their incomes over their lifetime. Specifically, most measures

of how income and well-being vary in the population do not take into account the fact that some

of the low income people have low incomes only because they are just beginning a career. Their

lifetime income is likely to be much larger as they age, gain experience, and move up in their

firms and career. Importantly, any noticeable effects of the current quality of schooling on the

distribution of skills and income will only be realized years in the future, when those currently in

school become a significant part of the labor force.

        Importantly, if interested in how the skills of workers affect the overall economy, one

cannot just consider the new graduates that count; it is the mass of older workers who are the

current driving force of the economy. In other words, most workers in the economy were

educated years and even decades in the past – and they are the ones that have the most impact on

current levels of productivity and growth if for no reason other than the fact that they represent

the larger share of active workers.

        While many noneconomists have difficulty in sorting out long term growth from short

run business cycles, it is absolutely necessary to do so in this case. In particular, if we look at the

course of the business cycle – the current levels of economic activity relative to what is

potentially possible – we would not expect, say, the level of unemployment at any point in time to

relate at all to the current quality and outcomes of our schools. Unemployment reflects aggregate

demand for workers relative to the aggregate supply of workers, and it is influenced by a wide

variety of aspects of the private economy and of government activities. Monetary and fiscal

policy as opposed to current school programs and spending drive the business cycle.

        It is true that, for any level of unemployment, young workers will typically have a higher

rate of unemployment. This phenomenon reflects the generally lower experience levels and


                                                   4
degree of attachment of young workers with any firms. And differences in the skills and

preparation of individuals clearly influence who suffers unemployment at any point in time. But

the overall level of unemployment cannot be influenced significantly by those currently in school

or recently graduating from school.

        In simplest terms, the contemporary tracking of the economy – either at an individual

level or at an aggregate level – will not tell us much about the schools of today. Thus, for

example, the fact that unemployment is lower on any given day in the United States as opposed to

Japan or Korea says virtually nothing about the relative quality of schools in the different

countries. It might instead say something about the quality of current fiscal and monetary policy

or about the extent of labor market and trade barriers across countries. And, it might even bear

some relationship to the human capital investments made in past periods – when the full spectrum

of workers in the labor force was attending schools and investing in skills. Yet it stops short of

providing an indication of school outcomes and quality as developed by the policies and

operations of today’s schools.


Evidence on Economic Impact of School Quality


        Much of the early development of empirical work on human capital rightfully

concentrated on the role of school attainment, that is, the quantity of schooling. This focus was

natural. The revolution in the United States during the 20th century was universal schooling.

Moreover, quantity of schooling is easily measured, and data both over time and across

individuals on years attained are readily available. Today, however, policy concerns revolve

much more around quality issues than quantity issues. The completion rates for high school and

college have been roughly constant for a quarter of a century. On the other hand, the standards

movement has focused on what students know as they progress through schools. The debates and

court cases about “adequacy” highlight concerns about both the distribution of outcomes and the




                                                 5
levels of performance that are achieved. Issues about what students know when they graduate

from high school are specifically ones of quality, not quantity of schooling.



Individual productivity and incomes

        It is useful to establish some facts about the value of “quality.” One of the challenges in

understanding the impact of quality differences in human capital has been simply knowing how to

measure quality. Much of the discussion of quality – in part related to new efforts to provide

better accountability – has identified cognitive skills as the important dimension. And, while

there is on-going debate about the testing and measurement of these skills, most parents and

policy makers alike accept the notion that cognitive skills are a key dimension of schooling

outcomes. But it still remains an issue about how important any such measured quality might be,

particularly if we are moving toward paying more attention to tested performance of students.

        Until recently, little comprehensive data have been available about differences in

cognitive skills and any related economic outcomes. Such data are now becoming available so

that some of the fundamental questions about quality measurement can be addressed.

        There is mounting evidence that quality – generally measured by test scores – is

positively related to individual earnings, productivity, and economic growth. While focusing on

the estimated returns to years of schooling, early studies of wage determination tended to indicate

relatively modest impacts of variations in cognitive ability after holding constant quantity of

schooling. More recent direct investigations of cognitive achievement, however, have suggested

generally larger labor market returns to measured individual differences in cognitive

achievement. For example, Bishop (1989, 1991), O'Neill (1990), Grogger and Eide (1993),

Blackburn and Neumark (1993, 1995), Murnane, Willett, and Levy (1995), Neal and Johnson

(1996), Murnane et al. (2000), Altonji and Pierret (2001), and Murnane et al. (2001) each find




                                                 6
that the earnings advantages to higher achievement on standardized tests are quite substantial.1

While these analyses emphasize different aspects of individual earnings, they typically find that

measured achievement has a direct impact on earnings after allowing for differences in the

quantity of schooling, the experiences of workers, and other factors that might also influence

earnings. In other words, higher quality as measured by tests similar to those currently being

used in accountability systems around the country is closely related to individual productivity and

earnings.

         An additional part of the return to school quality comes through continuation in school.

There is substantial United States evidence that students who do better in school, either through

grades or scores on standardized achievement tests, tend to go farther in school (see, for example,

Dugan (1976); Manski and Wise (1983)). Rivkin (1995) finds that variations in test scores

capture a considerable proportion of the systematic variation in high school completion and in

college continuation, so that test score differences can fully explain black-white differences in

schooling. Bishop (1991) and Hanushek, Rivkin, and Taylor (1996), in considering the factors

that influence school attainment, find that individual achievement scores are highly correlated

with continued school attendance. Neal and Johnson (1996) in part use the impact of

achievement differences of blacks and whites on school attainment to explain racial differences in


1
 These results are derived from quite different approaches. All of the investigations begin with a general
analysis of the determination of individual earnings and then provide information about the separate
contribution of measured cognitive skills. Bishop (1989) considers the measurement errors inherent in
most testing situations and demonstrates that careful treatment of that problem has a dramatic effect on the
estimated importance of test differences. O'Neill (1990), Grogger and Eide (1993), Bishop (1991), and
Neal and Johnson (1996) on the other hand simply rely upon more recent labor market data along with
more representative sampling and suggest that the earnings advantage to measured skill differences is
larger than that found in earlier time periods and in earlier studies (even without correcting for test
reliability). Murnane, Willett, and Levy (1995), considering a comparison over time, demonstrate that the
results of increased returns to measured skills hold across simple analysis and error-corrected estimation.
Murnane et al. (2000) and Murnane et al. (2001) employ representative samples but also introduce other
measures of individual skill. Blackburn and Neumark (1993, 1995) do not focus on ability per se but
concentrate on possible biases in the estimated return to years of schooling. Altonji and Pierret (2001)
show that the rewards to cognitive skills increase with experience as employers have an opportunity to
observe skill differences. This finding has clear implications for other research into the effects of measured
skills.



                                                      7
incomes. Behrman et al. (1998) find strong achievement effects on both continuation into college

and quality of college; moreover, the effects are larger when proper account is taken of the

various determinants of achievement. Hanushek and Pace (1995) find that college completion is

significantly related to higher test scores at the end of high school. Each of these investigations

highlights the independent role of achievement in affecting the schooling choices and investment

decisions of individuals.

         The role of schooling and human capital in altering the distribution of incomes in society

has also received considerable attention. The idea of relating distributional outcomes to school

quality was a key element of the War on Poverty. Through schooling it was hoped that family

poverty would not be transferred to the next generation – specifically, that high quality school

investments could overcome deficits originating in the home. Researchers have focused on skill

differences as being important in, for example, explaining the patterns of black-white earnings

differences or the expansion of earnings differences among people with the same levels of

schooling (e.g., O'Neill (1990); Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1991, 1993); Murphy and Welch

(1992); Pierce and Welch (1996)). These analyses have emphasized the growing rewards to skills

and have developed the implications of this for wage inequality. Owing to lack of sufficient data

over time, they have mostly not looked directly at measured cognitive skills.2 Nonetheless,

building on the findings about individual earnings, it is reasonable to conclude that variations in

cognitive skills have a direct impact on variations in the distribution of incomes.

         This discussion has concentrated on the importance of skill differences, particularly those

measured by tests of cognitive knowledge. As such data have become available, research has

underscored the importance of skills in determining economic outcomes for individuals. Thus,

for the individual, research offers a clear answer to a fundamental question that has recently been

voiced: Do differences in observed and measured achievement matter? Yes!

2
 Identifying the changing impact of measured ability on the distribution of outcomes over time is also a
very difficult problem, particularly given the structure of available data; see Cawley et al. (2000), Heckman
and Vytlacil (2001).


                                                     8
Economic growth

         The relationship between measured labor force quality and economic growth is perhaps

even more important than the impact of human capital and school quality on individual

productivity and incomes. Economic growth determines how much improvement will occur in

the overall standard of living of society. Moreover, the education of each individual has the

possibility of making others better off (in addition to the individual benefits just discussed).

Specifically, a more educated society may lead to higher rates of invention; may make everybody

more productive through the ability of firms to introduce new and better production methods; and

may lead to more rapid introduction of new technologies. These “externalities” – influences on

others of individual education outcomes – provide extra reason for being concerned about the

quality of schooling. Because this is so important and because it has received little attention, we

give this feature of the economy the most attention here.

         The current economic position of the United States is largely the result of its strong and

steady growth over the 20th century. Strangely, over much of the period after World War II,

economists did not pay as much attention to economic growth as they did to macroeconomic

fluctuations. In the past 15 years, economists have returned to questions of economic growth.

While a variety of models and ideas have been developed to explain differences in growth rates

across countries (see Barro and Sala-I-Martin (1995)), they invariably include (but are not limited

to) the importance of human capital.3

         The effect of differences in growth rates on economic well-being is easy to see. Figure 1

begins with the value of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in the year 2000 and shows its


3
 Some have questioned the precise role of schooling in growth. Easterly (2002), for example, notes that
education without other facilitating factors such as functioning institutions for markets and legal systems
may not have much impact. He argues that World Bank investments in schooling for less developed
countries that do not ensure that the other attributes of modern economies are in place have been quite
unproductive. As discussed below, schooling clearly interacts with other factors, and these other factors
have been important in supporting U.S. growth.

U.S. income would increase from $34,950 to $57,480 – or more than a 50 percent increase over

the period. If it were to grow at two percent per year, it would reach $94,000 in 2050! Small

differences in growth rates have huge implications for the income and wealth of society.

        The empirical work supporting growth analyses has emphasized school attainment

differences across countries. Again, this is natural because, while compiling comparable data on

many things for different countries is difficult, assessing quantity of schooling is more

straightforward than most.

        The typical study finds that quantity of schooling is highly related to economic growth

rates. But, again, quantity of schooling is a very crude measure of the knowledge and cognitive

skills of people. Few people would be willing to assume the amount learned during the sixth

grade in a rural hut in a developing country equals that learned in an American sixth grade. Yet

that is what is implicitly assumed when empirical analyses focus exclusively on differences in

average years of schooling across countries.

        Recent work by Dennis Kimko and me (Hanushek and Kimko (2000)) goes beyond that

and delves into quality of schooling. We incorporate the information about international

differences in mathematics and science knowledge that has been developed through testing over

the past four decades. And we find a remarkable impact of differences in school quality on

economic growth.

        In 1963 and 1964, the International Association for the Evaluation of Education

Achievement (IEA) administered the first of a series of mathematics tests to a voluntary group of

countries. These assessments were subject to a variety of problems including: issues of

developing an equivalent test across countries with different school structure, curricula, and

language; issues of selectivity of the tested populations; and issues of selectivity of the nations

that participated. The first tests did not document or even address these issues in any depth.




                                                  10
These tests did, however, prove the feasibility of such testing and set in motion a process to

expand and improve on the undertaking.

         Subsequent testing, sponsored both by IEA and others, has included both math and

science and has expanded on the group of countries that has been tested. In each, the general

model has been to develop a common assessment instrument for different age groups of students

and to work at obtaining a representative group of students taking the tests. An easy summary of

the participating countries and their test performance is found in figure 2. This figure tracks

performance aggregated across the age groups and subject area of the various tests and scaled to a

common test mean of 50.4 The United States and the United Kingdom are the only countries to

participate in all of the testing. There is some movement across time of country performance on

the tests, but for the one country that can be checked – the United States – the pattern is consistent

with other data. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in the United States

is designed to follow performance of U.S. students for different subjects and ages. NAEP

performance over this period shows a sizable dip in the 1970s, a period of growth in the 1980s,

and a leveling off in the 1990s. This pattern on NAEP, displayed in Appendix Figure A1 for 17-

year-olds in math and science, closely matches the international results and provides support for

the validity of the international tests.5

         Our analysis is very straightforward. We combine all of the available earlier test scores

into a single composite measure of quality and consider statistical models that explain differences


4
  The details of the tests and aggregation can be found in Hanushek and Kimko (2000) and Hanushek and
Kim (1995). This figure excludes the earliest administration and runs through the Third International
Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) of 1995. Other international tests have been given and are not
included in the figure. First, reading and literacy tests have been given in 1991 and very recently. The
difficulty of unbiased testing of reading across languages plus the much greater attention attached to math
and science both in the literature on individual earnings and in the theoretical growth literature led to the
decision not to include these test results in the empirical analysis. Second, the more recent follow-on to the
1995 TIMSS in math and science is excluded from the figure simply for presentational reasons.
5
  The NAEP tests, like the international tests, consist of a series of separate examinations for different
age groups. The NAEP patterns do differ some by age group with younger students showing more
improvement than older ones. The same age differences hold in the international examinations, as shown
in Figure 5 below, and the averaging across age groups buoys up the U.S. position in the aggregations of
Figure 2.

in growth rates across nations during the period 1960 to 1990.6 The basic statistical models,

which include the level of income, the quantity of schooling, and population growth rates, explain

a substantial portion of the variation in economic growth. Most importantly, the quality of the

labor force as measured by math and science scores is extremely important.

         One standard deviation difference on test performance is related to one percent difference

in annual growth rates of per capita GDP. As shown in Figure 1, the impact of such a difference

in growth rates is very large. One percent higher growth – say, two percent versus one percent

per year growth – over a 50-year period yields incomes that are 64 percent higher!! Moreover,

adding other factors potentially related to growth including aspects of international trade, private

and public investment, and political instability leaves the effects of labor force quality unchanged.

         One common concern in analysis such as this is that schooling might not be the actual

cause of growth but, in fact, may just reflect other attributes of the economy that are beneficial to

growth. For example, as seen in Figure 2, the East Asian countries consistently score very highly

on the international tests, and they also had extraordinarily high growth over the 1960-1990

period. It may be that other aspects of these East Asian economies have driven their growth and

that the statistical analysis of labor force quality simply is picking out these countries.

Nonetheless, if the East Asian countries are excluded from the analysis, a strong – albeit slightly

smaller – relationship is still observed with test performance. This test of sensitivity of the results

seems to reflect a basic importance of quality, one that contributes also to the observed growth of

East Asian countries.

         Another concern might be that there are other factors that affect growth such as efficient

market organizations are also associated with efficient and productive schools – so that again the

test measures are really a proxy for other attributes of the country. In order to investigate this, we


6
  We exclude the two TIMSS tests from 1995 and 1999 because they were taken outside of the analytical
period on economic growth. We combine the test measures over the 1965-1991 period into a single
measure for each country. The underlying objective is to obtain a measure of quality for the labor force in
the period during which growth is measured.


                                                    12
concentrate on immigrants to the U.S. who received their education in their home countries. We

find that immigrants who were schooled in countries that have higher scores on the international

math and science examinations earn more in the United States. This analysis makes allowance

for any differences in school attainment, labor market experience, or being native English

language speakers. In other words, skill differences as measured by the international tests are

clearly rewarded in the United States labor market, reinforcing the validity of the tests as a

measure of individual skills and productivity.

           Finally, the observed relationships could simply reflect reverse causality, i.e., that

countries that are growing rapidly have the resources necessary to improve their schools and that

better student performance is the result of growth, not the cause of growth. As a simple test of

this, we investigated whether the international math and science test scores were systematically

related to the resources devoted to the schools in the years prior to the tests. They were not. If

anything, we found relatively better performance in those countries spending less on their

schools.

           In sum, the relationship between math and science skills on the one hand and productivity

and growth on the other comes through clearly when investigated in a systematic manner across

countries. This finding underscores the importance of high quality schooling and leads to a more

detailed consideration of the growth of the United States economy.


Why has U.S. growth been so strong?


           We started this discussion by recounting America’s successful economic growth during

the 20th Century. Yet, looking at Figure 2, we see that the U.S. has been at best mediocre in

mathematics and science ability. Regardless of the set of countries taking the test, the United

States has performed in the middle of the pack or below. Some people find this anomalous. How




                                                    13
could math and science ability be important in light of the strong U.S. growth over a long period

of time?

         The answer is that quality of the labor force is just one aspect of the economy that enters

into the determination of growth. A variety of factors clearly contribute, and work to overcome

any deficits in quality.7 Nonetheless, just because American growth has been strong, the schools

remain a concern. Better schools would, by the available evidence, reinforce and amplify the

other advantages that have supported the strong and consistent growth of the U.S. economy.

         This section describes some of the other contributing factors. It does this in part to

understand more fully the character of economic growth but more importantly because it

highlights some issues that are important for thinking about future policies.



Economic structure

         Almost certainly the most important factor sustaining the growth of the U.S. economy is

the openness and fluidity of its markets. The U.S. maintains generally freer labor and product

markets than most countries in the world. The government generally has less regulation on firms

(both in terms of labor regulations and in terms of overall production), and trade unions are less

extensive than those in many other countries. Even broader, the U.S. has less intrusion of

government in the operation of the economy – not only less regulation but also lower tax rates

and minimal government production through nationalized industries. These factors encourage

investment, permit the rapid development of new products and activities by firms, and allow U.S.

workers to adjust to new opportunities. While identifying the precise importance of these factors

is difficult, a variety of analyses suggest that such market differences could be very important



7
  These other factors may also be necessary for growth. In other words, simply providing more or higher
quality schooling may yield little in the way of economic growth in the absence of other elements such as
the appropriate market, legal, and governmental institutions to support a functioning modern economy.
Past experiences investing in less developed countries that lack these institutional features demonstrates
that schooling is not itself a sufficient engine of growth.

explanations for differences in growth rates (see, for example, Krueger (1974); World Bank

(1993); Parente and Prescott (1994, 1999)).

        Because of the generally favorable institutional conditions, U.S. growth has been strong,

even if some of the underlying factors are not as competitive. In other words, the economic

structure can mask problems within the economy. But this does not deny the fact that improving

our schools and the quality of our labor force would enhance growth and incomes.



Substitution of quantity for quality

        Over the 20th century, the expansion of the education system in the United States

outpaced that around the world. The United States pushed to open secondary schools to all

citizens. With this came also a move to expand higher education with the development of land

grant universities, the G.I. bill, and direct grants and loans to students. In comparison to other

nations of the world, the United States labor force has been better educated even allowing for the

lesser achievement of its graduates. In other words, more schooling with less learning each year

has yielded more human capital than found in other nations that have less schooling but learn

more in each of those years.

        This historical approach, however, appears on the verge of reaching its limits. Other

nations of the world, both developed and developing, have rapidly expanded their schooling

systems, and many now surpass the United States. Figure 3 shows secondary school completion

rates for both OECD countries and a selection of others in 1999.8 Remarkably, the United States

trails a large number of other countries in 1999 and falls just slightly below the OECD average

completion rate. The United States gains some by having rates of college attendance above the

typical OECD country. Nonetheless, as summarized in Figure 4, U.S. students are not likely to

complete more schooling than a significant number of other developed and developing countries.

        The past advantage of the United States in amount of school completed has gone away as

other nations discovered the importance of schooling. Thus, going into the future, the U.S.

appears unlikely to continue dominating others in human capital unless it can improve on the

quality dimension.



Quality of U.S. colleges

        The analysis of growth rates across countries emphasizes quality of the elementary and

secondary schools of the United States. It did not include any measures of the quality of U.S.

colleges. By most evaluations, U.S. colleges and universities rank at the very top in the world.

No direct measurements of quality of colleges across countries exist. However, there is indirect

evidence. Foreign students by all accounts are not tempted to emigrate to the U.S. to attend

elementary and secondary schools – except perhaps if they see this as a way of gaining entry into

the country. They do emigrate in large numbers to attend U.S. colleges and universities. They

even tend to pay full, unsubsidized tuitions at U.S. colleges, something that many fewer

American citizens do.

        A number of the economic models of economic growth in fact emphasize the importance

of scientists and engineers as a key ingredient to growth. By these views, the technically trained

college students who contribute to invention and to development of new products provide a

special element to the growth equation. Here, again, the United States appears to have the best

programs. If this view is correct, U.S. higher education may continue to provide a noticeable

advantage over other countries.

        But the raw material for U.S. colleges is the graduates of our elementary and secondary

schools. As has been frequently noted, the lack of preparation of our students leads to extensive

remedial education at the postsecondary level, detracting from the ability of colleges and

universities to be most effective.




                                                16
Interpreting the Evidence on Quality


         The measurement of student outcomes has been pulled in two different directions. On

the one hand, the movement toward standards and testing has emphasized the need to test student

performance and to use information from those tests in judging the accomplishments of both

students and schools. On the other hand, a segment of the school policy community has argued

against the current testing – either because it does not measure attributes they think are important

or because the test outcomes are irrelevant.

         One aspect of this discussion is to demonstrate that differences in performance on

existing tests have significant implications for both individual and aggregate success.

Performance on standardized tests of math and science is directly related in individual

productivity and earnings and to national economic growth.

         None of this says that the existing tests are the best possible. It just indicates that the

existing tests indicate something real, something that has important ramifications for individuals

and the economy.9

         Further, just because this dimension is important does not mean that other dimensions

could not also be important. In fact, some research suggests that there are other important quality

dimensions for individuals (e.g., Murnane et al. (2001)). Similarly, to the extent that aggregate

growth is fueled by invention, creativity is likely to be important, and this may differ from

measured cognitive skills. To be useful, however, these other dimensions must be identified and

measured, and thought and analysis must go into determining how these dimensions might be

improved. Currently a variety of people argue that schools do more than produce reading, math,

and science – which schools undoubtedly do. But such arguments do not deny that cognitive


9
  Note, however, that most of the existing analysis has relied on test results where the scores might be
regarded as a reflection of the student’s true ability. It goes without saying that, if tests were artificially
inflated, say by cheating or emphasizing just the mechanics of test taking, they would not reflect skill
differences. In such a case, the relationship between measured scores and economic outcomes might
disappear.


                                                        17
skills are also important. And they do not say what should be done if one wants to enhance these

other, currently unmeasured areas.10

           Finally, this discussion has not pursued the issue of where the measured skills come from.

We have learned through extensive research that families, schools, and others contribute to the

knowledge of students. The foregoing analysis has simply considered the skills of individuals

and how those skills translate into economic outcomes. The issue facing the United States is how

to align policies that will enhance those outcomes.

           It is interesting in this light that international evidence, like that for the United States,

does not show test scores being strongly related to school resources.11 As mentioned previously,

the international math and science scores used in the analysis of growth rates are not related to

spending or other measures school resources such as pupil-teacher ratios (Hanushek and Kimko

(2000)). These statistical results simply reinforce well known differences such as the very large

class sizes in East Asian countries. Similarly, looking within countries that participated in the

1995 TIMSS, there is no systematic pattern to resource usage within these countries and student

performance (Hanushek and Luque (2003)).

           In contrast, a large body of evidence suggests that schools do have a large influence on

student outcomes (see review in Hanushek (2002)). It is just that high quality schools are not just

those that spend the most or have the smallest class sizes.

           One final aspect of U.S. performance is important. United States students start out doing

well in elementary grades and then fade by the end of high school. Figure 5 shows the slip that

occurs over time in comparison to other countries participating in the TIMSS math and science
           10
            Bracey (2002) phrases his discussion in terms of “competitiveness,” measured by the Current
Competitiveness Index developed by the World Economic Forum. He correlates this index with current
scores on the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). The most telling points, he
believes, are that TIMSS scores are not perfectly correlated with this index and that the U.S. ranks highly
on the index. He goes on to explain why the United States ranks well on the competitiveness index by
essentially the factors discussed for growth rate differences: higher quantity of education, greater college
attendance, retaining our scientists and engineers (while attracting foreign immigrants), securing favorable
rankings of its economy by international businessmen, and having greater innovative capacity.

because it represents the input of college, because it sets the stage for science and engineering

skills, or because it is important in its own right for workers in the labor force – schools in the

United States are not keeping up in the preparation of students.


Conclusions


        In February 1990 in an unprecedented meeting of the nation’s governors with President

George H. Bush, an ambitious set of goals was set for America’s schools. Number 4 was that by

the year 2000, “U.S. students will be first in the world in mathematics and science achievement.”

By 1997, as it was evident that this goal was not going to be met, President Clinton returned in

his State of the Union speech to the old model of substituting quantity for quality: “We must

make the 13th and 14th years of education -- at least two years of college -- just as universal in

America by the 21st century as a high school education is today” (Clinton (1997)). The quality

goal, while perhaps more difficult to meet, appears to be the better approach than reverting to our

past practice of emphasizing just quantity of schooling.

        A variety of commentators, dead set against any fundamental changes in the nation’s

schools, rely on a combination of simplistic arguments: the poor performance of U.S. students

does not matter because the tests are not valid; we could improve our scores if only we devote

more resources to our public schools; or, schools cannot be expected to deal with the problems of

learning that emanate from the home. Bracey (2002) goes one step further. He ends his

discussion of how competitiveness of economies is uncorrelated with student performance by

warning that innovation may be inversely related to student achievement: “We should think more

than twice before we tinker too much with an educational system that encourages questioning.

We won't benefit from one that idolizes high test scores. It could put our very competitiveness as

a nation at risk.” No evidence is presented, however, to demonstrate that creativity is lessened by




                                                  19
improving the mathematics and scientific skills of students. Nor does he speak to the costs placed

on those individuals who neither reap rewards for exceptional creativity nor have the skills

necessary to perform in the modern economy.

        Research underscores the long run importance of high achievement of our students and

our future labor force. Higher achievement is associated both with greater individual productivity

and earnings and with faster growth of the nation’s economy. It no longer appears wise or even

feasible to rely on more years of low quality schooling.
