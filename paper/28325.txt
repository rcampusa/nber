Promoting Platform Takeoff and Self-Fulfilling Expectations: Field Experimental Evidence

                                         ABSTRACT

The theoretical literature on platforms and network effects predicts that the initial growth and
takeoff of a platform crucially depends on the market's expectations of the future installed base.
This paper tests this claim, reporting on a field experiment in which invitations to join a newly
launched platform were sent to 16,349 individuals and included randomized statements regarding
the future expected installed base (along with disclosures of the current installed base). I find
evidence consistent with subjective expectations playing a crucial role in shaping early adoption
and platform takeoff. Statements regarding expectations of the future installed base more
significantly affected adoption than did disclosures of the current installed base. Statements of
larger numbers of expected users caused more adoption than did smaller numbers. Statements of
a smaller installed base of users (whether current or expected) led to lower demand than did
stating nothing at all. The effect of stating subjective expectations by the platform became
insignificant once the current installed base grew larger. The response of adoption to expected
numbers of users reveals patterns consistent with the long-theorized chicken-and-egg problem
and self-fulfilling expectations. The findings have significant implications for the effective
promotion, marketing, and "evangelism" of new platform ventures.

1.   Introduction

Society now relies on online platforms as essential infrastructure for many economic, social, scientific,

health, education, and cultural activities (Evans and Gawer 2016, Parker et al. 2016, Ting et al. 2020).1

Continued innovation and service expansion in this area will require ongoing successful launches of new

platform ventures (Furman et al. 2019). Unfortunately, most platform ventures fail to take off (Noe and

Parker 2005, Evans and Schmalensee 2010). Theory suggests that this is because potential users are

reluctant to adopt platforms that do not already have a large installed base and network effects: the well-

known chicken-and-egg problem.2 The theory suggests that influencing consumers' expectations of future

platform growth can help overcome this problem. Consumers who believe that a platform will eventually

take off will join the platform and thereby catalyze network effects (e.g., Katz and Shapiro 1985). Shapiro

and Varian (1999) write, "Managing consumer expectations is crucial in network markets. Your goal is to

convince customers... you will emerge as the victor. Such expectations can easily become a self-fulfilling

prophecy when network effects are strong." Besen and Farrell (1994) specify that "expectations about the

ultimate size of a network are crucial." This study tests this theory.

        The idea that expectations can be self-fulfilling has become standard in the theoretical literature on

platforms (Hossain and Morgan 2009). When deciding whether to adopt a platform with network effects, a

consumer's best decision is to do what others do.3 The theory implies a large-scale coordination problem

(e.g., Schelling 1960), whereby adopters should attempt to collectively adopt one platform, or another (if

  The growing importance of platforms as a modern approach to organization is reflected in research attention from a
growing number and variety of researchers and disciplines (e.g., Ghazawneh & Henfridsson, 2013; Iansiti & Lakhani,
2017; Suarez and Kirtley, 2012; Nambisan et al., 2017; Rietveld & Schilling, 2020; Rysman, 2009; Sundararajan,
2017; West, 2003).

Stummer et al. (2018).

  Consider a market with two potential adopters, A and B. In this example, adoption costs are $1, and benefits are $2
if everyone adopts or $0 otherwise. There are two possible equilibria: "nobody adopts" and "everyone adopts."
                                                                   Consumer B

                                    Adopt              (-1,0)                        (1,1)
                               Not Adopt                (0,0)                       (0,-1)


                                                              2
there are competitors), or none.4 If adopters cannot explicitly coordinate or communicate, this multiplicity

of possible equilibria creates fundamental uncertainty and ambiguity about which market outcome will

emerge. Accordingly, adopters cannot "look forward and reason back" as in usual rational expectations

(Hossain and Morgan, 2013) and expectations are subjective. Therefore, conventional means of influencing

rational expectations--e.g., economic signaling and pre-commitments--should not work as usual.

        Absent rational expectations, theorists instead appeal to "focality" as the concept determining the

eventual market outcome. A focal equilibrium (or "focal point") is the choice to which most people default

and which individuals expect others will choose (Schelling 1960, Mehta 1994). Therefore, focality and

expectations are closely intertwined. The platforms literature is silent on how focal expectations are formed

or influenced. Instead, theory has proceeded by presuming consumers follow some focal rule. Most models

in the literature assume, for example, that consumers choose the economically efficient outcome (e.g.,

Farrell and Klemperer 2007).5 In contrast, discussions of chicken-and-egg problems often implicitly

presume that consumers tend towards non-adoption as a default. More recent advances have begun to

consider alternative focal rules' competitive implications, such as adopting according to past market share

(Suleymanova and Wey 2012, Hagiu and Spulber 2013, Hagiu and Halaburda 2014, Halaburda and

Yehezkel 2019, Halaburda et al. 2020).

        The empirical research does not yet study expectations in early platform growth. Instead, most

empirical models specify adoption as a function of the current or lagged installed base within a static

framework.6 Several exceptional studies estimate models with perfectly-forward-looking consumers (Dubé

et al. 2007, Rysman et al. 2011, Ryan and Tucker 2012). These approaches should be better suited to

  Market coordination problems are either explicit or implied throughout literature on platforms, standards, and
network effects (Augereau et al., 2006; Fang et al., 2020; Farrell & Klemperer, 2007; Farrell & Saloner, 1988; Hagiu
& Spulber, 2013; Simcoe, 2012)

  Related literatures examines whether markets get locked-in to inferior platforms (e.g., David 1985, Hossain and
Morgan 2009, Hossain et al. 2011, Liebowitz and Margolis 2014) and when do markets tip (Cantillon & Yin, 2007;
Ellison & Fudenberg, 2003; Hossain & Morgan, 2013).

studying mature markets when eventual outcomes are clear. Thus, the theorized role of expectations in

coordinating earliest moments of adoption remains untested. This is the focus of this study.


2.     Research Design

This study builds on a stream of field experiments studying platform adoption (e.g., Sun et al. 2019, Bapna

and Umyarov 2015). I most closely build on Tucker and Zhang's (2010) field experimental framework for

studying whether network effects exist on a large, mature Chinese B2B platform (Appendix A). Here I

study whether exposing 16,349 individuals to experimentally assigned statements regarding future installed

base (while controlling for the current installed base) affects adoption decisions in the context of an early

platform launch campaign.

2.1.    Context

The product development platform in this study was created to serve students and alumni of a large US

university. This large R1 research-oriented university has approximately 20,000 undergraduate and 10,000

graduate students and has nationally ranked engineering, computer science, and business programs. The

Princeton Review indicates that 25th and 75th percentile SAT scores of admitted students are 690 and 790.

         The platform mimics today's in-person hackathons' essential features, where people meet,

exchange ideas, and design prototypes. Distinct from usual hackathons, however, the platform was launched

to achieve grander scale and wider access to greater numbers of participants than a typical hackathon. The

platform now numbers over 5,500 participants. On the platform, individuals collaborate to design IoT-

related products ("applications"). IoT refers to systems that connect machines, infrastructure, and consumer

products and the intelligence created by those elements' data collection and networking. Collaborators can

develop their own ideas or respond to challenges issued by the platform or companies. Users were not

charged to participate on the platform but may have experienced non-pecuniary costs in the process of

learning about the platform and signing up. Further, in this context, signing up also implied the opportunity

cost of participating in a three-week part-time development project.




                                                          4
           The experiment centered on the initial campaign to attract a critical mass of users within the first

60 business days following launch. Ensuring many users joined the platform was vital because the platform

depends on interactions among users and forming teams to work on new projects. Platform developers also

believed that adopters might respond to the number of companies on the platform.

2.2.     Experimental Protocol and Treatments

2.2.1.     Observable Potential Market

This experiment focused on a key risk set of potential adopters. This group included 16,349 students and

past graduates of the university with backgrounds in engineering, computer science (including data science

and information systems), and sciences (including natural sciences and mathematics). Table 1 summarizes

the characteristics of this group. In identifying potential adopters before the launch of the platform, both

adoption and non-adoption could be observed and recorded.7


                                                       <Table 1>


2.2.2.     Invitations to Join the Platform

Each participant received an email invitation to join the platform (Appendix B) over the 60 business days.

Those who did not initially open the invitation were sent a reminder seven days later. The emails included

a brief description of the platform and invited the recipient to click-through to learn more and consider

joining.

2.2.3.     Platform Sign-Up

Clicking-through from the email to the platform provided a description of the Internet of Things and of the

development activity that would take place on the platform. The description stated, too, that participating

on the platform could foster interactions, support learning of new skills, and lead to cash prizes. The

platform also presented a prominent "join and participate" button and could sign-in to become a member

 The platform embedded other experiments and A/B tests during its launch in a way that was entirely orthogonal to
and had no effect on this analysis.

using their LinkedIn credentials. LinkedIn API-accessible information and photographs then auto-

populated their platform member profiles.

2.3.     Treatments and Random Assignment

The experimental treatments consisted of varying messages within the invitation to join (see Appendix B):

          1. Expectation message: "We expect <#> users and <#> companies to join this year."

          2. Installed base disclosure: "To date, <#> users and <#> companies have joined."

          3. Total potential market scale statement: "The university community comprises 20,000 students,

              200,000 alumni, and 2,000 staff and professors. There are also 4,000 affiliated companies."

          4. Early adoption emphasis statement: "This is an invitation for early adopters."

          Most central to the research question is statement (1) regarding the expected installed base.

Statement (2) discloses the current installed base and provides a useful control and a basis for comparing

the magnitude of effects with statement (1). Statements (3) and (4) provide further means of interpreting

the effect of statement (1), as discussed in Section 3.3.

2.3.1.    Messages of Expected Installed Base

To ensure that statements were neither arbitrary nor misleading, stated expectations corresponded to the

platform developers' own forecasted scenarios. In relation to users, these scenarios included: 2,500 (low),

10,000 (medium), and 25,000 (high) users. For companies, these scenarios included: 10 (low), 25 (medium),

40 (high), and 100 (very high) companies.8 Different scenarios were combined in different treatments to

generate independent variation in numbers of expected users and expected companies (see Figure 2, panel

III). Platform developers decided on possible combinations to avoid nonsensical combinations (e.g.,

combinations of very lowest with highest scenarios, expectations lower than current levels) and to limit the

complexity of implementing the treatments.




8
  The additional scenario for companies reflected greater uncertainty regarding the number of companies and
potentially important differences in the operating model to support these different numbers. Nonetheless, the ratio
between the lowest and highest scenarios was 10X for both users and companies.

                                                             6
2.3.2.    Disclosures of Current Installed Base

To avoid deception, disclosures of the current installed base were based on the true current number of users

across the 60-day campaign. To acquire a nonarbitrary number of companies in the current installed base,

users were asked whether their companies would likely sponsor a challenge.

          To then generate independent variation in numbers of users and companies, these values were each

intermittently and alternately updated from day to day (rather than tracking real-time values) to ensure

multiple numbers of users for each number of companies and vice versa.

2.3.3.    Random Assignment Procedure

Platform developers randomly assigned individuals to treatments based on the following principles.

Individuals in the study group were first randomly assigned to receiving invitations across the campaign's

60 days. Each day, individuals were randomly assigned to receive a statement of expectations of the future

installed base (statement 1) or not, and disclosure of the current installed base (statement 2). Those receiving

statements of expectations were then randomly assigned to receive a particular combination of scenarios

for particular numbers. Everyone was randomly assigned to receive statements (3) or (4), both, or neither.

Panel III of Figure 2 summarized all possible combinations.

2.4.     Randomization Checks

Randomization should ex-ante lead to equal treatment groups. Figures 1 and 2 explicitly check for balance

ex-post. Figure 1 describes the observable characteristics of individuals assigned across the 60 days. Figure

2 describes the observable characteristics of individuals assigned across all treatment combinations.

Characteristics are statistically identical in each case.

3.      Results

3.1.     How does Stating Expectations of Installed Base Affect Adoption?

A probit model of the following form is estimated to relate the decision to adopt or participate on the

platform and the experimental treatments:9


                                        {! = 1}                                                               
                = ("  ! + # ! + $ !
                       +% ! + & !
                        +' ! + ( ! )

           The function  is the cumulative standard normal distribution function. Individuals are indexed by

i. The  terms are the coefficients to be estimated. X is a vector of individuals' characteristics and controls.

The remaining variables relate to the treatments (Table 1). The model is estimated by maximum likelihood.

           Model (1) of Table 2 reports estimates with just the ExpectationsStated indicator and a constant

included in the model. The average effect of stating expectations on the probability of participation is

statistically significant and negative. The effect translates to approximately a 1% drop in participation

relative to a 5% average participation rate, or one-fifth impact. Model (2) adds time controls (quadratic time

trend and day-of-week dummies), field of study (sciences omitted), gender, and graduation year. Adding

these controls has no impact on the estimated effect of stating expectations.

           Model (3) replaces ExpectationsStated with the InstalledBaseDisclosed indicator, and model (4)

does the same while including all controls. The coefficient estimated on InstalledBaseDisclosed is

statistically zero. Including ExpectationsStated and InstalledBaseDisclosed at once, as in models (5) and

(6), leads to the same coefficient estimates as when estimating them separately. Therefore, these results

confirm that statements about expectations had a causal effect on participation.




9
    All reported probit models generate similar patterns if estimated as linear probability models.

                                                                 8
                                                              <Table 2>


3.2.      How Does Stating Different Levels of Expectations Affect Adoption?

This section evaluates whether stating different scenarios for future installed base affected platform

participation. Model (1) of Table 3 includes ExpectationsStated and adds first and second-order polynomial

terms for numbers of expected users and expected companies stated. Coefficient estimates indicate a

positive concave relationship between participation and ExpectedNumUsers, and a negative convex

relationship between the participation and ExpectedNumCompanies. Estimates are insensitive to the

inclusion of model controls or not, or inclusion of the current installed base, as in model (3). Consistent

with Table 3 results, coefficients on the current installed base are insignificant, as in models (2) and (3).

           Table 4 presents the relationship re-estimated with the different expectations scenarios specified as

dummies in a linear probability model to reveal effect magnitudes explicitly. Controlling for the current

installed base measures or not, as in models (1) and (2), finds similar results.10 The negative convex

relationship with ExpectedCompanies is driven by higher adoption in the lowest scenario (10 companies

expected). The positive concave relationship with ExpectedNumUsers, also reported graphically in Figure

3, shows that stating the lowest scenario (2,500 users) leads to statistically lower participation than making

no statement at all. Point estimates increase with higher scenarios, but with large confidence intervals.


                                                              <Table 3>


                                                              <Table 4>


                                                             <Figure 3>




10
     Controls are not included in this most flexible specification, as they lead to large standard errors.

                                                                   9
3.3.   Validation of Interpretation

The significant effects of statements of expectations might be capturing a response to a statement of large

scale per se. To check this possibility, all prior models were re-estimated with a variable capturing an

objective indication of market scale. This is an indicator switched on for statement (3): "The university

community comprises 20,000 students, 200,000 alumni, and 2,000 staff and professors. There are also 4,000

affiliated companies." I find that being randomly assigned to receive this statement has statistically zero

effect on participation rates and does not alter prior results. Therefore, the analysis of expectations does not

appear to be capturing scale of the potential market, but rather expectations of what those in the potential

market might choose to do.

        Similarly, an indicator variable associated with the statement, "This is an invitation for early

adopters," was found to be insignificant. This is consistent with subjects receiving these invitations already

being well aware of the early stage of adoption without further prompting.

3.4.   Is the Market More Susceptible to Focal Cues in Early Periods?

The theory suggests that subjective expectations are most important in early market coordination. To assess

this possibility, I compare estimates when the stated installed base exceeds 1,000 users or not.

        The breakpoint of 1,000 users first requires justification given that earlier models did not detect a

relationship with NumCurrentUsers. To more closely scrutinize this relationship, I re-estimate the

relationship with each level of NumCurrentUsers as a dummy in a linear framework, reported in Figure 4.

        Individual coefficients are mostly insignificant. Nonetheless, statistical facts appear in the results.

For example, participation is lower with the lowest levels of disclosed installed base than when stating

nothing at all (analogous to earlier results, related to stating user expectations).

        Most relevant to the breakpoint choice, each point estimate of coefficients for 1,000 users or greater

has a higher value than the point estimate for not stating the installed base at all. If these values after 1,000

users were in fact the same as those when not stating the installed base, the likelihood of observing this

pattern would be (½)^21--or virtually zero.



                                                           10
                                                      <Figure 4>




          Models (1) and (2) of Table 5, therefore, compare model estimates for those cases in which the

disclosed installed base exceeded 1,000 versus not. Consistent with the theory, expectations terms become

insignificant, where the stated installed base exceeded 1,000 users.


                                                       <Table 5>


3.5.    Does Stating Expectations Affect Heterogeneity of Responses?

Here I investigate whether statements of the expected future or disclosed current installed base affected

variance in outcomes. I re-estimate the probit model, allowing for model variance to vary as !$ =

{exp(" + # ! + $ ! )}$ , where  terms are parameters.

The variance parameters, along with main model, are estimated simultaneously using maximum likelihood.

          Mean model estimates are unaffected by this alternative specification. Table 6 reports the variance

model estimates. As in model (1), stating the current true installed base lowers variance, all else being equal.

Stating subjective expectations increases variance. Similar results are found when allowing mean model

terms to interact with an indicator for greater than 1,000 users, as in model (2), or when estimating each

variance coefficient in separate models.


                                                       <Table 6>


4.     Discussion of Results

This section discusses the findings reported in the preceding section.

4.1.    Subjective Expectations are Crucial in Earliest Periods of Takeoff

          The results include an array of patterns that are each consistent with the theory's predicted role of

subjective expectations in the earliest periods of platform launch. Exposing individuals to statements of



                                                           11
expectations of the future installed base shifted adoption rates by one-fifth relative to average levels

(Section 3.1). The effect of expectations was more significant than disclosing the actual installed base size

during early takeoff (Sections 3.1 and 3.2). The large causal effects of statements of expectations ceased to

be significant once the disclosed installed base grew past 1,000 users (Section 3.4).

         The statements of expectations to which adopters responded were themselves highly subjective and

uncertain (varying between low and high scenarios by a factor of 10X) (Section 2.3.1). Nonetheless,

adoption rates varied systematically according to the scenario to which individuals were exposed (Section

3.2).

         Also consistent with subjective heterogeneous responses to these statements, exposing individuals

to statements of expectations led to increased variance in the estimation model (Section 3.5). (By contrast,

disclosures of the true current installed base reduced variance, consistent with converging expectations.)

4.2.    Self-Fulfilling Expectations and the Chicken-and-Egg Problem

The shifts in adoption rates with expected future users' statements are also consistent with the long-

theorized chicken-and-egg problem (see Section 1). Stating low expectations for future users caused lower

adoption than stating nothing at all. Stating low current users caused lower adoption than stating nothing at

all (Section 3.2 and Figure 4). It appears it is better for the platform to allow uncertainty to linger rather

than to alleviate uncertainty in a way that confirms a platform has or expects few users. Also consistent

with self-fulfilling expectations, stating either optimistic expectations of the number of users or stating high

numbers of current users results in higher adoption than does stating lower numbers (Section 3.2).

         When stating high user expectations, rates of adoption do not rise to a level of becoming statistically

different from those when stating no expectations at all within the observed variation here. It remains a

question whether stating still higher expectations or perhaps otherwise making more persuasive statement

could have led adoption to become statistically higher. When stating high numbers of existing users,

adoption rates statistically exceeded those when not stating anything.

         Thus, these results lend support to longtime untested claims of focal expectations shaping platform

takeoff (e.g., Farrell and Saloner 1985, Katz and Shapiro 1985, Farrell and Klemperer 2007, Hagiu and

                                                           12
Halaburda 2011, Suleymanova and Wey 2012, Zhu and Iansiti 2012, Halaburda and Yehezkel 2018,

Halaburda et al. 2020).

        These results, summarized in this subsection and the earlier subsection 4.1 reflect tests of general

theory regarding platform adoption in a context of multiple equilibria and a market coordination problem.

Therefore, these results should generalize to relatively typical platform conditions, i.e.: where user benefits

come mostly from network effects (rather than stand-alone benefits), where adoption is costly, and potential

adopters are not able to explicitly coordinate their adoption decisions.

4.3.   Negative Cross-Side Interactions in a Collaborative Contest Platform

        The analysis also found negative cross-side interactions between user adoption and expected

numbers of companies (Section 3.2). This result adds to prior findings of negative network effects (e.g.,

Church and Gandal 1992, Economides 1996, Augereau et al. 2006, Tucker and Zhang 2010), and is notable

for being consistent with the platform's institutional design, supporting collaborative challenges.

        A negative cross-platform network effect in this context is consistent with the addition of more

companies effectively splitting-up users across multiple challenges, with the effect of reducing users' ability

to find and collaborate with others. This result is also consistent with users possibly preferring that the

platform emphasize users' learning, development, and community networking (Section 2), rather than

emphasizing problem-solving for companies.

4.4.   The Ability of a Platform to Influence Expectations

While this study's primary thrust was to test the role and nature of expectations in shaping platform takeoff,

the research design approach was to influence expectations. That expectations could be influenced--at all--

much less by the platform, is a novel and consequential finding. Particularly, we find that simple, subjective,

uncommitted, and costless ("cheap talk") statements broadcasted by the platform could influence market

expectations in early platform takeoff. The generalizability of this result and the ability and means for other

platforms to similarly influence expectations depends on the underlying mechanisms. Here, I speculate on

three plausible explanations.



                                                          13
         Statements Serve as Coordinating Devices? A first possibility, closest to the theory, is that the

platform's statements served as focal cues and coordinating devices (Schelling, 1962; Mehta, 1994; Sitzia

and Zheng, 2019). For example, adopters could have made adoption decisions under the expectation that

some fraction of others would act in accordance with the broadcasted statements. This interpretation

presumes that (i) the statements were deemed highly focal by adopters, and (ii) adopters engaged in higher-

order reasoning to assess and respond to others' expected behavior.

         This explanation of the salience of platform's statements leading to some measure of coordinated

decisions is closest to the theory (Section 1). It is akin too to findings from coordination games in the lab,

in which labels and language to describe alternative actions have been shown to significantly increase the

likelihood of coordination (e.g., Mehta et al. 1994a, Bacharach and Bernasconi 1997, Parravano and

Poulsen 2015). In this light, the current results might be likened to prior characterizations of platforms as a

leader with a coordinating role within their "ecosystems" (Boudreau, 2017; Boudreau and Hagiu, 2009;

Gawer and Cusumano, 2002).

         Statements Serve as Information? An alternative explanation is that users perceived the platform's

statements as genuinely informative, at least to some degree, and users respond accordingly. This

interpretation requires that (i) the platform indeed had private information on future adoption (despite the

fundamental uncertainty of market coordination) and (ii) potential users had some basis to believe the

platform's statements were credible (otherwise users might expect a platform will always make optimistic

statements).11

         In this context, perhaps users believed the platform's central network position between alumni and

students led adopters to think the platform was able to carry out meaningful market research.12 (This was




11
   The long tradition of research on cheap talk and coordination games (e.g., Crawford and Sobel 1982, Farrell and
Rabin 1996) shows that a player in a coordination game can send a no-cost, uncommitted, and unverifiable message
to induce others to coordinate on a particular choice--so long as players' interests are somewhat aligned. However,
in this context, the platform is not a player in the game, but effectively a third-party observer of market coordination.
12
   Strictly speaking, the communication of adopters' intent to a platform with market research involves a similar
problem of sending a credible message regarding uncommitted future choices.

                                                               14
not true in this case, and the true high degree of uncertainty of platform developers was reflected in the

wide-ranging scenarios described in Section 2.3.) In this context, users could also anticipate that the

platform would disclose information truthfully. The platform both had a valuable reputation to uphold and,

as a university, would act in the interest of students and alumni. Indeed, strenuous efforts were made to

avoid deception (Section 2).

        Statements Serve as Persuasion? A third explanation is that boundedly rational adopters responded

to plausible statements at face value. They were persuadable and indeed persuaded, despite the absence of

a fully rational basis for accepting the statements as truly informative. This interpretation might be

especially relevant in early market coordination with (i) an ambiguous and uncertain decision environment,

and in which (ii) potential adopters are perhaps boundedly rational and susceptible to persuasion.13

        In this context, for example, the credulity of adopters could have been influenced by plausible

statements coming from a sociologically legitimate authority--a university-sponsored platform. Outside of

this context, this interpretation implies there could be considerable scope for talented and charismatic

communicators and storytellers to deploy rhetoric and moral suasion to generate optimistic beliefs within

an ambiguous decision environment.


5.   Conclusion

        Central to platform adoption theories is the idea that market expectations can play a role in

determining whether a new platform venture takes off or not. This paper implemented a first systematic

empirical investigation of the causal role of expectations in the launch of platform ventures. We investigated

this question using a field experiment embedded in the launch campaign of a platform for a collaborative

hackathon, during which the platform grew to several thousand users.

        The study's results of Section 3 and summarized in Section 4 confirm a series of patterns that are

consistent with subjective expectations playing a crucial role in the earliest platform growth and takeoff.



13
  Large literatures on persuasion point to a range of behavioral, cognitive, economic, and socio-psychological
mechanisms that far exceed the scope of this study.

                                                         15
Also consistent with theory, the patterns are consistent with the existence of a chicken-and-egg problem in

early adoption and that expectations can be self-fulfilling. Optimistic expectations of the future installed

base of users might help overcome this problem and negative expectations will deter adoption. In this

particular instance, the platform's stating nothing regarding the future installed base of users was more

helpful to stimulating growth than stating low expectations

        Perhaps most important of all, I found--in this context--that simple, subjective, uncommitted, and

costless ("cheap talk") statements broadcasted by the platform could influence market expectations in early

platform takeoff. In Section 4, I speculated on the mechanisms underlying this finding, suggesting that

platform's statements could work as a coordinating device, as information, or as persuasion. Better

understanding these mechanisms and the extent to which other platforms might influence expectations--

and how--remains an area of much needed future research.

        The findings here imply important implications for managers, investors, entrepreneurs, and

marketers. Platform growth and takeoff involves more than just acquiring adopters one-at-a-time; to

succeed in takeoff, a platform must coordinate multiple adopters to join the platform, at once, under most

typical circumstances. Influencing the market's focal expectations of the future installed base's size is a

means of getting this done. Consistent with the findings, leading platforms often use media and events to

socialize optimistic commonly-shared narratives of the future (see, for example, Lucas-Conwell 2006,

Kawasaki 2015) and pessimistic narratives about competitors (Pfaffenberger 2000, Raymond 2001, Egyedi

and Hommels 2019). This emphasis on nuanced issues of shaping beliefs and expectations (Section 4.4)

may explain why 2,330 chief marketers on Linkedin now describe themselves as "chief evangelists."
