                                   ABSTRACT


     This paper develops a formal model of the timing and pricing of new

equity issues, assuming that managers are better informed than new

investors about the quality of the firm.   Firms will prefer to issue equity

when the market is most informed about the quality of the firm.     This

implies that equity issues tend to follow information releases, such as

earnings announcements.   The model also predicts a relation between the

timing and pricing of equity issues.   The price drop at the time of the

equity issue announcement should increase in the time since the last

information release, and the price drop at issue should increase with the

time since the last information release or issue announcement.     We teat

the predictions of the theory on a sample of NYSE, AMEX and OTC firms who

issued equity over the period 1978-1983. We find evidence that there is a

clustering of equity issues following earnings announcements and annual

reports, and also that the price drop at the time of the equity issue is

increasing in the time since the announcement of the issue.

1. Introduction

  Recent research emphasizes the importance of asymmetric information in

explaining the pricing of seasoned new equity issues.    This paper develops

a formal model that extends these ideas to suggest that asymmetric

information also has interesting implications for the timing of new issues

(when new equity issues will he announced and brought to market), and the

relation between the pricing and timing of new issues.   We test the

predictions of the theory on a sample of New York Stock Exchange (NYSE),

American Stock Exchange (AMEX), and Over the Counter (OTC) firms who

issued equity over the period 1978-1983.

   The importance of asymmetric information in pricing equity issues is

suggested by the fact that the stock price of a corporation issuing shares

falls an average of approximately 3% at the announcement of the issue

[Asquith and Mullins (1986) and Masulis and Korwar (1986)] and 0.65% at

the actual issue [Mikkelson and Partch (1988)]. One explanation for this

is that insiders with superior information about the firm have an

incentive to issue shares when the firm is overvalued.    Outsiders are

aware of this, and consequently lower their evaluation of the issuing

firm's quality, and thus the price they will pay for the firm's shares.

This creates a "lemons market" [Akerlof (1970) and Myers and Majluf

(1984)]   in new equity issues.

   Previous authors [e.g., Leland and Pyle (1977) and Myers and Majluf

(1984)] have studied new issues taking the degree of information asymmetry

as given.    Our model rests on the observation that the information

asymmetry between insiders and outsiders is not fixed over time.    For

example, firms regularly disclose information in the form of earnings

announcements and audited annual reports.1   If a firm csn issue risky
                                            2

securities when the market is most informed,      it will do so, since the

share price decline from an equity issue will be lower when information is

more symmetric.    Thus,   to the extent that firms have discretion in the

timing of issues of risky securities, we should expect to see these issues

clustered after information disclosures such as annual reports, quarterly

earnings announcements, or dividend declarations.

   Section 2 formalizes these ideas with a model in which firms with a

positive NPV project choose whether or not to issue equity to finance the

project.    Some of these firms can also choose the timing of the equity

issue.     These firms have "durable" projects, while other projects

"evaporate" if not undertaken immediately.2 Project arrivals are

observable, but outsiders do not know their durability.       Firms also have

assets in place, the true value of which is publicly revealed at regular

information announcements, but which is otherwise known only to managers.

   To understand the model, consider the case in which all projects are

durable, so postponing an equity issue has no impact on project value.          If

all firms were to issue equity whenever a new positive NPV project

arrived, the market price of equity would be the fair price for the

average firm, and equity issues would coincide with project arrivals.

However, firms with high quality assets in place will find it optimal to

wait to issue equity until the market learns the true value of the firm,

at which time the firm will receive     a   higher than average price for the

newly-issued equity.       Only low quality firms would ever issue before firm

value is revealed, so the market price for new equity issues prior to an

information release is below that for the average firm.        It follows that
                                       3

in equilibrium all firms wait until information is released to issue

equity when waiting is costless.

   Matters are more complicated if some firms cannot costlessly wait

before issuing equity.   At least some firms with evaporating projects will

issue equity immediately, despite an equity price decline, in order to

avoid losing the project.   The very best quality firms with evaporating

projects may choose to forego the investment opportunity.     Poor firms with

durable projects can profitably masquerade as firms with evaporating

projeccs by issuing equity prior to an information release, while the best

firms with durable projects will wait until an information release before

issuing equity.3   The net effect is that equity issues are concentrated

more heavily after information releases.

   In this model pricing and timing are related.   The model implies that

the observed price of firms issuing equity declines with the time since

the last information release.   Thus, in equilibrium, the price of equity

issued before an information release is lower than the average price of

equity issued after an information release.

   The theory leads to several readily testable hypotheses:

   •   On average, equity issues will be clustered after information

releases such as annual reports, earnings announcements and dividend

declarations.   There should be few issues immediately prior to these

events.

   •   The price drop at announcement of a new issue will be negatively

related to the time between the announcement date and the last information

releaae date.   Similarly, the price drop at issue will be negatively
                                         4

related to the time since the last information release or issue

announcement.

     In Section 4 we test these and related hypotheses.   In all four

quarters, we find support for the hypothesis that equity issue dates are

more frequent after earnings announcements than later in the quarter.       We

also test for an increase in the percentage price drop as a funrtion of

the time since the last earnings report.     We find the that the time

between announcement and previous information release has a positive but

insignificant effect on the magnitude of the announcement price drop.       The

time between the announcement of the issue and the actual issue, however,

has a positive and significant effect on the size of the issue price drop.



2.    The Model

     In this section we develop a model in which

     1.   Investors and managers are asymmetrically informed about the value

          of assets in place;

     2.   The degree of this asymmetry changes over time; and

     3.   An equity issue   is necessary in order to undertake a project.

The information asymmetry gives rise to a lemons market for equity.

Consequently, in deciding whether and when to issue equity, managers weigh

the cost of issuing (which can change over time) against the value of new

projects.

     In this setting we are interested in answering two questions:      first,

what is the aggregate distribution over time of equity issues, and second,

how are the price drops at announcement and issue related to the timing of

information releases?    Initially we assume that the announcement of an
equity issue and the actual issue occur simultaneously. In Section 3 we

relax this assumption.     We allow only equity financing, but a similar

analysis should apply to risky debt.



a.   Assumptions

     Firms offer to sell equity to investors, who attempt to infer the

quality of the selling firm.     We assume the following:

     Investors.    Investors are risk-neutral. They know the distribution of

firm types, but they do not observe the type of a particular firm.

     Firms.   Firms are run by risk-neutral managers, who are assumed to act

in the interests of existing shareholders.4 Firms have assets in place

with value a.      They also potentially have new projetts with a known

positive5 net present value of    , requiring   K in outside capital.6

Project arrivals are random and observable by investors, and firms have at

most one projett at a time.     There are two kinds of projects.             The

fraction 8 of firms are "type d" and have "durable" projects.                Type d

firms have a choice of either issuing equity immediately, or costlessly

waiting to do so.     The remaining fraction (1-8) of firms are "type e",

with "evaporating" projects that must be financed immediately or foregone.

Project arrivals are uniformly distributed over time.             The probability

that a project is durable is independent of a and of the project arrival

time.   There are an infinite number of firms with projects arriving at

each instant. Under these assumptions, investors know the distribution of

firm types at each point in time.

     Information.   At fixed points in time (t—O,l,2,   .   .   .) firms   make an

announcement which fully reveals the true value of existing assets.7                  For

example, between times 0 and 1, firms learn either that their assets in

place are worth
                           a0
                                + r or
                                         a0
                                              -
                                                  r.8   At any time t (0   t   1) within the

interval, the fraction of firms with high or low asset quality is given by

p(t)/2,    with dp(t)/dt > 0.             At time 1 there is a fully revealing

announcement, and the process starts over again.9

   Investors appraise firms conditional on their information release

dates, so we need only consider a single pattern of release dates.

Because the intervals are identical, and there is symmetric information at

the end of each interval, we can restrict attention to the interval (0,1].

We assume a zero interest rate.

   The probability distribution of asset values at time t (Ostl)                      is given

in Table 1:

b. Equilibrium Equity Valuation

   Here we show how the equilibrium price of new equity is determined as a

function of when it is issued, and look at some properties of the

equilibrium.             First we define an equilibrium.


Definition:          A   rational expectations equilibrium is a set of prices and

quantities at each time such that:                      (a) The value of the equity that
                                                             7

investors buy is consistent with their expectation of its value,                                (b)    all

firms that can profitably issue equity at this price do so, and                                (c)

investors buy all equity issues as long as they expect non-negative

profits.


   The nature of the equilibrium depends upon the parameter values.                                   In

order to focus on the simplest case which produces interesting dynamics,

we assume that


                        r   <   fi   <   2r.



In Appendix     A   we describe the general case.

   Let
         V denote the market's expectation at                     time t of a firm's total

asset value net of new capital, conditional both on the arrival of a

project and on the firm issuing equity at time t.                           Vt
                                                                                 is given by


                                               ÷ $
                        Vt           E(m)

         is the rational expectation of a, conditional on all available time
E(a)
t information, and conditional on equity being issued.                             Investors will

provide K in return for a share of the firm                       s,   if
                                                                            s    solves the equation


                        K —                              +
                                s[E(m) +             $       K]



This implies that



                                     K/(K+V)

At time    1,   investors learn the true value of a, hence E1(m)=a1.

c. The Decision to Issue Equity

      We now study the firm's decision about whether to issue equity.                      For

type e firms, the choice is simple:               given a price, they either issue

equity immediately or not at all.             For type d firms, the choice is more

complicated:     they either issue equity immediately, or defer the issue

until some future time.           Here we characterize the optimal decision for the

different types of firms.

      Consider first the decision to issue at the end of the interval, when

managers and investors are symmetrically informed about the value of

assets in place.       Any type d firm which did not issue equity previously

can profitably issue equity at time 1.                 The firm can issue shares worth K,

and the value of the firm to existing shareholders will be                       = a   +
                                                           V1

Similarly, a type e firm with a project arriving at time 1 can issue

shares worth K, yielding existing shareholders a               +   fi.     Clearly   the type e

firm will always find it profitable to do so.

      The decision rule for issuing equity prior to time 1 depends upon

whether the firm is type d or type e.

      Evaporating Frolects.        If type e firms do not issue equity at time t

(when the project arrives), the project evaporates.                      These firms will

issue equity if the value to existing shareholders from issuing exceeds

the value-from not issuing shares, i.e., if


                (1 -                   + K] > a
                       s)[a   +   fi




Rewriting this using (4) gives


(5)
Thus, for a given                the incentive to issue equity is decreasing with a
                         V,
and K and decreasing with            fi.



     Durable   Prolects.         Firms with type d projects have the choice of

issuing equity at time t, or at some later time.                    These firms plan to

issue equity when they expect the market's valuation of their equity to be

the greatest.       At time 1, the true value of the firm is known, so a

necessary condition for a type d firm to issue equity at time t' prior to

information release is that                     > V1.   From (2), this holds if
                                           V,

                a   <        -
                        Vt


Thus, a durable firm will issue equity prior to information release only

if the market's expectation of its value for assets in place exceeds the

true value.     A sufficient condition for type d firms to issue equity at

time c is that      Vt > Vt'       for all t' such that t       <   t'   S   1.



d.    Description of the Equilibrium

     In order to describe the equilibrium, we need to know precisely which

firms issue equity at each point in time, which in turn depends on the

valuation function,                Fortunately, the behavior of each firm type can
                    Vt.

be characterized.

     Equations (5) and (6) have two major implications.                      First, the better a

firm's type, the less incentive it has to issue equity,                       given        Second,
                                                                                      V.
the incentive for type e firms to issue equity is greater than that for

type d firms, since if a project will evaporate, there is a greater

incentive to take it immediately.                  These implications are stated formally

and proved in Lemma 1 (all lemmaa are stated and proved in Appendix B).
                                               10

     Because the incentive to issue equity is decreasing with the true value

of the firm,         the equilibrium valuation of a firm issuing equity can never

exceed that of the average firm with an investment project.                Thus,   Vt
     +   fi.    As a result, firms with durable projects and with average or
a0

better-than-average asset quality never issue equity except when their

asset quality is publicly revealed at an information release.                The worst

type e firms will always issue equity, because they can never be

undervalued.         Given assumption (1), Lemma 2 shows that type e firms with

average quality assets always issue.               The best type e firms, however, may

either issue equity or allow their project to evaporate. These firms will

not issue when the cost of pooling with lower quality firms is great

relative to the value of the project.

     The uncertainty about the behavior of the high quality type e firms

raises the problem of non-uniqueness of the equilibrium at some points in

time.          The market's valuation of new issues is higher when the highest

quality evaporators issue equity than when they do not issue.                It can

happen that if the high quality firms do not issue equity,                then the

equilibrium valuation of issuing firms is so low that it is not optimal

for the high quality firms to issue.               If they did issue equity, however,

they might raise the average issuer quality enough to make it optimal for

them to issue equity.          In order to eliminate this multiplicity, we will

focus solely on the highest price equilibrium, which is the equilibrium in

which the best quality evaporators issue equity whenever, conditional on

their issuing equity, it is optimal for them to issue.

     We can now write down a candidate valuation function                  We know that
                                                                     V.
type e firms with a — a0 or a — a0         -   r    will issue equity immediately,

while type d firms with               a   —          —   +               r never issue before time 1.

                 - (a0-r+$)p(t)/2                       (a0+)(l-p(tfl(l-S)
(7)         Vt                        p(t)/2            + (l-p(t))(l-8) + p(t)(l-S)/2


If the high quality evaporating firms do not issue equity, i.e.                                    ,   if V        in

(7) is less than             +   r,    the valuation is
                        a0

                                  +
                   (a0-r+)p(t)/2    (a0+)(l-p(tfl(l-6)
(8)
          Vt               p(t)/2 + (l-p(t))(l-8)




      Theorem 1 shows that (7) and (8) indeed describe the equilibrium

valuation function, with (8) in effect only if (7) falls below a0 +                                         r.



Theorem    1:    There exists a decreasing equilibrium valuation function on

the interval [0,1) given by (7) and (8).                                This is the highest equilibrium

valuation function.


Proof:    At time 0 there is no asymmetric information.                                    Thus, p —   0,   and

(7) reduces to           +   ,   which by                (1) exceeds a0 + r.           Thus,   the best
                   a0

evaporating firms issue at time 0.                          Because p'(t)         >   0,   (7) [and (8)] are

both decreasing in t.            As p increases,
                                                               V can become            low enough that the

high-quality evaporating firms no longer issue equity.                                      This causes
                                                                                                            V to
jump discretely downward, as (8) replaces (7).                                   (For 6 sufficiently large,

as p(t) approaches 1,
                                 V approaches a0                -   r    +   .   Because of     the assumption

that     < 2r, the best type e firms then cease to issue equity.)
                                            12

      Thus,   given the assumption that the worst type durable firms issue

equity immediately, Vt strictly decreases over time.          This implies that it

is in fact optimal for the worst type durable firms to issue equity

immediately, since they can not obtain a higher issue price by waiting.

By construction, this equilibrium valuation function is the highest

equilibrium valuation function.//


      Note that for values of $ and   r   which do not satisfy (1), the valuation

function will also be non-increasing on [0,1).          Also, V1 will be greater

than the valuation over the previous interval (Lemma 3).

      Theorem 1 characterizes the price behavior of firms issuing equity, but

a related question is how the quantity of firms issuing equity behaves

over the interval.      At an information release (e.g., time 0 or 1), there

will be a surge of equity issues as average and high-quality durable firms

issue to finance projects that arrived over the previous interval (Lemma

3).     Immediately thereafter, the number of issues decreases discretely, as

the better durables receiving new projects again postpone their issues

until the next information release.         If the best type e firma atop issuing

equity at time t', then there is another discrete fall in the number

issuing at t'.       (If the model permitted many values for assets in place,

there would be smaller, more frequent drops in the quantity of firms

issuing equity.       Firms would cease to issue equity as the market valuation

fell below the value of their assets.)           Between these falls, however, the

number of issues actually increases. This occurs because the proportion

of the worst type d firms in the issuing population increases amoothly

over time.
                                        13


     Finally, the greater the percentage of durable firms, the lower is Vt

at any t on (0,1) (Lemma 4).    On average, firms with durable projects

which issue equity before time 1 have a smaller a than firms with

evaporating projects which issue equity.     Thus, an increase in 5 has two

effects:   first, with no change in investment policy across types of

firms, there is a decrease in the weight given to the higher quality firms

in (7) and (8).     Second, thia decrease in Vt may cause higher quality

firms not to issue equity, which further lowers    V.

e.    The Price Drop st the Equity Issue Announcement

     Theorem 1 implies that the market valuation of a firm conditional on

receiving a project and announcing an equity issue declines with the time

since the last information release.    The observed price drop at the

announcement of an equity issue, however, is the difference between the

valuation of the firm conditional upon receiving a project, and that

conditional upon receiving a project and issuing equity.     The valuation

decline in Theorem 1, and the price drop at the equity issue, can differ

if there are firms which receive a project but do not take it.      In this

section we study the price drop at the announcement of an equity issue and

show that the magnitude of the drop increases with the time since the last

information release.

     We have seen (Lemma 2) that if   > r, the only type firm which would

possibly forego a project in equilibrium is type e with a           +   r.    The
                                                               00

condition for this firm to issue equity is that    V from   (7) exceeds the

market valuation of these firms if they do not issue equity, 00     +    r.    (7)

exceeds        + r if
          00
                                                                14


                                                Sp(t)/2
(9)            $ -   7      >   7
                                          (l-6)+6p(t)/2

Given   fi,   r,   and 6, whether high quality type e firms issue equity depends

                                                                                                  For p(t)
upon the fraction, p(t), of firms which have learned their type.
                                                                 bad type
sufficiently small, the lemons problem is unimportant, since few

d firms will issue.

      Consider a point in time when                       (9)   holds, so that all projects are

taken.        Conditional only upon receiving a project, the average valuation

of firms is                 =         +    $;    conditional upon issuing equity, the value is
                   V'           a0

(7).    Thus, the price fall from issuing equity prior to an information

release is


                                                  Sp(t)/2
                            -         =    7
(10)               Vt           Vt              (l-6)+Sp(t)/2

The price drop is increasing in p and hence in the time since the last
                     10
information release.

      When (9) does not hold, high quality type e firms forego the equity

issue.        The valuation of a firm conditional upon project arrival,

reflects the fact that some projects will not be taken:



                     —
                            (a0
                                     + 7 +       $)&p(t)/2 + (a0 + r)(l-5)p(t)/2            +


                                     (ao   +    $)(l-p(t))(l-6)      +
                                                                         (ao
                                                                               +   -
                                                                                       r)p(t)/2
                        —            + $ -       $(1-6)p(t)/2
                                00



The valuation conditional upon the announcement in this case is given by

 (8), which may be rewritten as
                                                      15


                                            rp(t)/2
               —        +      -
(11)               m0                 p(t)/2 +     (l-p(tfl(l-8)

The price drop at issue is thus


                                              rp(t)/2
                                                    (l-p(tfl(l-6) p(t)(1-S)/2
                         -                                         -
                    Vt       Vt         p(t)/2 +


Using (9), (12) can be shown to be positive and increasing in t.

     For the price drop to be increasing in the time since the last

information release, it remains to show that the price drop is greater

immediately after the high quality type e firms drop out than immediately

before.    This requires that (12) be greater than (10) when (9) holds as an

equality.


Theorem   2:    The magnitude of the price drop at the time of issue increases

with the time since the last information release.

Proof:    When high quality type e firms issue,                (10) is the drop,   which is

increasing in t.             When type e firms do not issue, (12) is the drop, which

is increasing in t.                Comparing (10) and (12) when (9) holds with equality,

(12) can be shown to be
                                      larger.1,,



3.   Price Behavior When the Announcement and Issue Do Not Coincide

     In the previous section we examined the behavior of firms in deciding

whether and when to issue equity,                  as well as the equilibrium path of the

stock price, conditional on issuance,                  treating the announcement and the

issue as occurring simultaneously.                   In practice, there are usually several
                                                16

weeks between the two dates.       Hence before turning to the empirical tests,

we must explicitly consider the price behavior at each of the dates.

   In this section the model is modified with the assumption that there is

an exogenously given interval between announcement and issue, but that the

projects of evaporating firms do not lose value when waiting this fixed

interval.        There are two possible alignments of the three dates (equity

announcement, equity issue, and information release), which must be

considered separately.       The firm may announce and then issue equity

without an intervening information release, or there may be an information

release between the announcement of the equity issue and the actual issue.

Figure 1 shows these possibilities:

   a
Equity   Issue Announcement       Information Release                     Equity Issue


   We derive the equilibrium price drop for firms both at the announcement

of an equity issue and at the actual issue.              The ultimate price drop, as

well as the decision to finally issue equity, depends upon whether there

is an intervening information release.               The model suggests that the price

drop at announcement is larger, the longer the time between the
                                            17

announcement and the previous information release.         Similarly, for firms

which have an information releaae between the announcement and the issue,

the price drop at issue is larger, the longer the time between the issue

and the information release.       We allow firms to withdraw from an announced

issue if it is optimal to do ao.

   To anticipate the results, we show that there will be a price drop at

the announcenent of the equity issue if there will not be a fully

revealing information release prior to the issue.         Depending upon

parameters, there may be a price drop at the actual isaue.            This can occur

because a firm which announced an iaaue learns that its value has

increased, leading it to withdraw.         If there are withdrawals, the

magnitude of the price drop will be increasing in the time between the

announcement and issue.



a. Information Release Preceding Announcement and Issue

   In this case, the only type d firms which announce the intention to

issue are those with a = 00    -
                                   r,   since the other type   d   firms schedule the

announcenent so that the issue occurs immediately after an information

release.     Let ta denote the time of the announcement and t. the time of
                                                             1

the issue.    Since p(t) is a deterministic function,     it is known at t

whether (9) will hold at the time of the issue.        If (9) does hold at t.,

all type e firms will issue, and hence will announce their intention to

issue.   Thus,   the price drop at announcement is given by (10).         There is

no subsequent price drop at the time of issue, since all firms issue which

announced they would.
                                            18

   Suppose on the other hand that at ta it is known that (9) will not hold

at t. Then type e firms with a        + r will not announce an issue. All
                                   a0
other type e firms, as well as type d firms with a — a0 - r, will announce

an issue.    The price at snnouncement will be given by (11).         In between

times ta and t., however, some of the type e firms which had not

previously learned their asset quality will learn that their assets are

high quality.      Since (9) does not hold,      they will withdraw their announced

equity issue.      The valuation at t. will also be given by (11), but with p

evaluated at t. rather than        t.   The price drop at issue will be


(13)           -
                   Vta   Tp(t)/[(l-S)(l-p(t)) + p(t;/21
                           -
                               rp(t.)/[(l-5)(l-p(tj) +
which is negative since p is increasing in          t.   The magnitude of the price

drop is increasing in t5
                               -
                                   t.
b.     Informatiom Release Between Announcement and Issue

     In this case, when a firm announces an equity issue, it is known that

the information asymmetry will be elimimated prior to the actual equity

issue.     To take an extreme case,     suppose that it was announced that the

firm would issue equity at the same time as the information release.            In

this case;- there would be no drop in price at the announcement, because at

the time of the issue there would be no information asymmetry.

     The key insight is that firms which announce an equity issue at time ta

< 1 are no longer pooled at the time of the issue, t. > I, since their

type is revealed at the information announcement.            Hence, all firms with

projects will announce an issue.11         At the issue date the market evaluates
                                         19

them conditional upon their type as of time 1.           The only relevant

information asymmetry at the time of the issue is from news about asaets

in place which becomes known after time       1.


   Since all firms announce the issue, in theory there should be no price

drop.   This result depends upon the information release fully revealing

all information.     In practice, there will always be some remaining

asymmetry, and some firms know they will not issue, hence they will not

announce an issue.    Since there is now a pooling problem again, the price

will drop at the announcement of the issue.          Nevertheless, because of the

intervening information release, the price drop should be less than if

there were no intervening release.                       -




  Which firms will go through with      the equity offering?         The analysis is

the same as before, except that all evaluations of type are relative to

    the asset quality which is revealed at time           1.   The only type d firms

which issue at t. are those which learn they have a —    - r.  For the
                                                      a1
type e firms, some will learn that they have a — 01 + r, and their

issuance decision at        will depend upon whether (9) holds.        Thus,   there
                       ta
will generally be a price decline st the issue date, and the magnitude of

the price decline will increase with (t.       -
                                                   1),   the time since the last

information release.

  We have- seen in both cases in this section that firms may optimally

withdraw from an announced issue.     Mikkelson and Partch (1988) study

withdrawals and find that 10% of announced common stock issues are

withdrawn.   They report that in 80% of the withdrawn security offers in

their sample, "unfavorable market conditions or a low stock price" were

cited as reasons for the withdrawal.      This withdrawal of an announced
                                        20

offer can occur in our model when firms receive new private information,

which increases the dilution from issuing shares at the pooled price.     The

price drop for firms which issue shares is offset by a price increase for

firms which withdraw their offer.



4. Statistical Implications and Tests

a. Data Overview

  We obtain the dates of seasoned underwritten primary and secondary

equity issues for the period 1978-1983 from Drexel Burnham Lambert's

Public Offerings of Corporate Securities (various years)   .   The reported

company names are used to match issue dates with company stock price and

financial data from the CR52 daily master, returns (NYSE/AMEX,     and

NASDAQ), and Quarterly Compustat (Industrial and Full Coverage) files.

The sample includes 1247 equity issue dates (646 are for NYSE/AMEX firms

and 601 are for OTC firms) obtained from Drexel's Offerings, although a

smaller sample remains after matching and screening for missing

observations.12    Observations are omitted for any of the following

reasons: inability to match company name with CRSP or Compustat, missing

data, or apparent data errors (for example the second quarter earnings

announcement date preceding the first quarter earnings announcement
           --
date).13

b.        Hypotheses and Tests

     We test the implications of the model by investigating the timing of

equity issues relative to regular quarterly information releases, and by

testing whether the announcement and issue date price effects of the

offering depend on the timing of the offer date.       The information releases

on which we focus are quarterly earnings announcements.

      The first set of teats concern the timing of equity issues.     The

hypotheses which we teat are ma follows (Hni denotes null hypothesis i and

       denotes alternative hypothesis i):
Hmi


      Hypothesis 1:   The Timing of Equity Issues

                 issues are uniformly distributed over time.          Equity
      Hn: Equity                                                Ha:

      issues are clustered in periods immediately following information

      releases.


      The model implies that we should reject Hnl in favor of Hal since a

subset of firms (high value type d firms) will postpone equity issues in

order to avoid being pooled with poorer firms, and high value type e firms

may also forego projects when information becomea too asymmetric.           The

null hypothesis of a uniform distribution reflects our assumption that

projects arrive randomly over time (although they are not necessarily

funded wheb they arrive).      Of course,   the actual extent of clustering

depends on the underlying distribution of project arrivals, the durability

of projects, how relevant the information is, and the extent to which

information release dates can be adjusted.

      We test for whether the distribution of iaaues is uniform using the

                                                          For a given equity

issue, let DBR be the totsl number of days between the information release

immediately prior to the issue and the information release immediately

after the issue (BR denotes "Between Releases").        Also, let DI be the

nuisber of days between the information release immediately prior to the

issue and the date of the equity issue.         Under the null hypothesis, DI/DBR

-   U(0,l)   (where U(x,y) denotes a uniform distribution on the interval

             We test                    the cross-sectional distribution of
[x,y]).                Hn1 by comparing
          to the 11(0,1) distribution.
DI/DBR
     Results are reported for the following groupings of information events:

     a.   quarterly earnings reports (all quarters)

     b.   quarterly earnings reports (individual quarters: ql, q2, q3, q4)

     c.   annual reports

In each case days between releases              is the actual number of days

between the reported information events.         Sample size varies because of

earnings data availability, and because the quarter of the issue could not

be determined for some firms.       Table 4 summarizes the results.    The null

hypothesis of a uniform distribution is rejected for the combined

quarterly data, the annual data, and in most of the individual quarters.

     In the model there is no distinction between announcements which

resolve more or less of the asymmetry. In reality one would expect to

find meastirable differences in the amount of information conveyed by

different announcements.        The finding that equity issues are not uniformly

distributed across the year is consistent with the intuition that because

of more detailed reporting and auditing requirements, fiscal year-end

earnings announcements and the annual report together resolve more of the

asymmetry in information than intra-year quarterly announcements.

   Although we reject the uniform distribution for earnings announcements,

we also wish to know whether there is clustering after information events.

If there is clustering, the density of        should be skewed to the
                                       DI/DBR
left,   and hence histograms of issue dates relative to the last information

release should be downward sloping.    Figures 2-5 (corresponding to the

events in Table 4) are basically consistent with this description:      issues

trail off toward the end of each quarter and at the end of the year)4

However, while the theory suggests that we should see many issues shortly

after an information release, the histograms suggest that issues are

fairly evenly distributed over the early to middle part of most quarters.

In fact,   at the beginning of the first quarter the number of issues

appears to be significantly below average.     A potential explanation for

the first quarter drop lies in the fact that the releases of the annual

report and 10-K typically follow the earnings announcement for the fourth

quarter by several weeks [Wilson (1987)].            This waiting period coincides

reasonably closely to the period during which the there is a lull in

issues.        This evidence suggests then that firms avoid issuing equity

shortly before an information release, although they do not hurry to issue

immediately after an information release.

     We also consider the effect of firm size on a firm's propensity to

issue around earnings announcements.            Since information tends to be

starter for saall firms, it may be that small firms have a greater

incentive to issue equity when fresh information is released.                To test

this idea, we regress D1 (days between announcement and issue) on firm

size,   as measured by market value of equity.          If small firms are more

anxious to issue when information is fresh, the correlation should be

positive.        The results of two simple cross-sectional regressions are

reported in Table 5.         The regression results support the hypothesis that

smaller firms are more likely to issue closer to an information release.

 Hypothesis 2:        The Stock Price Reaction to the Timing of Issue

        Announcements and Issues.

 Case   1:   Regular Information Release Precedes Announcement of Issue.

       The fall in the stock price upon announcement of the equity issue
 Rn:

 is independent of the timing of the announcement relative to

 information releases.           Also,   the price drop at issuance is unrelated to

 the timing of the issue relative to announcement or information

 release.             The fall in stock price upon announcement of the issue is
                Ha:

 smaller the more closely the issue is expected to follow an information

 release.       Also, the fall in the stock price on the actual date of

 issuance is smaller the more closely issuance follows announcement of

 the issue.

 Case 2: Regular Information Release Falls Between Announcement of Issue

 and Issue Day.         H:   -   same as case 1.
                                                   Ha:
                                                         The fall in the stock price

 on the actual date of issuance is smaller the more closely issuance

 follows the regular information release.




Dllowing the results of Sections 2 and 3, we expect to reject Rn2 in

avor of   Ha2   for each case.

 We use standard event study methods to estimate the stock price

action to       the announcement and completion of the equity issues.        We then

se cross-sectional regressions to estimate the relation between the

ricing effects and the time between the event and previous information

aleases.     For the announcement of the equity issue, we define the event

sy as the day on which the earliest announcement, related to the issue,

ppears in the Wall Street Journal.            For the actual issue, we define the
                                              26

event day to be the issue date.               We define abnormal returns on asset

i on day t,               as the difference between the rate of return on asset i
                   A.t
on day                                 on a value-weighted market portfolio on that

defined      as the value-weighted portfolio of NYSE/AMEX stocks.      For firms

trading Over the Counter, Rmt is defined as the value-weighted portfolio

of OTC stocks.           Abnormal returns computed in this manner are commonly

referred to as "market adjusted returns" [see Brown and Warner (1985)].

The average abnormal returns,               for the twenty-one day period

sample.          The t-statistics provided in Table 6 are calculated for each day

using a cross-sectional estimate of the variance of abnormal returns.

Simulation results in Collins and Dent (1984) indicate that this method of

calculating t-statistics leads to appropriate inferences in experimental

designs similar to ours)5

significantly negative abnormal returns on days -2, -3, and -4 and some

          For the announcement of the issue, day zero is the day on which the
          earliest appearance, in the Wall Street Journal, of news of the issue.
b
          n is the number of firms with observed returns on that day relative to
          the event. There are some firms for which we could not locate
          announcement dates. Therefore, n is less around the announcement day
          than around the issue day.

                    r=ro
are   plotted in Figures 6 and 7.           For the announcement date we plot the CAR

from     = -200 to T = 100 while for the issue date we plot the CAR from



-20 to T = 20.       There is a large increase in the CAR prior to the

announcement of the equity issue (36.75% from -200 to day -4), followed by

a drop around the announcement day (-2.33% from -4 to 0) and a slight

increase in the two weeks after announcement (1.27% from 0 to +10).                There

is no noticeable trend in the CAR after day +10.               The negative abnormal

return upon announcement of the equity issue is consistent with past

empirical evidence and the hypothesis that equity issues convey

unfavorable information about the value of assets in place.               In the

twenty-one trading days up to and including the actual issue date there is

an average abnormal return of -1.92% which is realized mainly in the week

prior to the issue.        Following the issue, there is an average abnormal

return of 1.88% from day 0 to day +20.

  Our interest is in relating the timing of both the actual equity issue

and announcement to the size of the price drops on the two event days.                 By

Theorem 2, firms which announce an equity issue further from the

information release should suffer a larger price drop.                Also, from the

discussion in Section       3,       it is clear that we need to treat separately the

case where the information release precedes the announcement and issue,

and the case where it is between them.                In the former case, the model has

two predictions: (a) a negative relation between the price change upon

announcement of the issue and the time between the announcement and the

last regular information release and (b) a negative relation between the

price change at issuance and the time between issue and announcement.                    In

the latter case the model predicts: (a) no correlation between the price

change at announcement of the issue and the time between the announcement

and the last regular information release and (b) a negative relation

between the price change at issuance and the time between issue and

announcement.

   We test these propositions by regressing measures of abnormal returns

around the event day on the relative time between the information release

and announcement of the equity issue or on the time between the issue day

and announcement of the issue.      We estimate the abnormal return due to the

event asset i as the sum of the abnormal returns on days -l and 0, A(i)

   The regressions we run all have the form

where   A5   is the abnormal return at announcement of the issue, A5 is the

abnormal return at the actual issue day,        T(i)   is the number of days

between the last regular information release and announcement,             T(i)         is

the number of days between issue and announcement or between issue and

information release, depending upon the case, and           i7(i)   is an error term.

        is a noisy measure of the abnormal return due to the event since it
A(i)
is composed of the abnormal returns associated with the event

(announcement or issuance) as well as abnormal returns associated with
                                                29

other unrelated events over a two-day window.                Since the variability of

abnormal returns is likely to vary across different firms, we estimate the

regressions using weighted least squares (WLS) where each asset's

observations are weighted by the inverse of the standard deviation of the

its abnormal return.          This standard deviation is estimated from the time-

series of abnormal returns from days -200 to -21 and +21 to +100 relative

to the announcement of the issue.            As a diagnostic check, the squared

residuals from ordinary least squares estimates of (14) are regressed on

the time-series estimates of the variance.              The t—statistics on the

variance are on the order of 2.5 to           6.     This indicates the presence of

heteroscedasticity and justifies the use of WLS.                Our estimates of (14)

are reported in Table 7.

   For Case     1,   where the information release precedes announcement of the

issue,   T(i)    is the number of days between the announcement and issue.

                                      0 for both the regression of A      on          and the

(t-statistic =       -0.92)   while the issue day estimate of          is significantly


below zero (t-ststistic            -3.50).

   For Case 2, where the information release is between announcement and

issuance,   T(i)      defined as the number of days between the last regular

information release and the issue day.               The model implies that *1        — 0   for

the announcement day regression and that *1 C 0 for the issue day

regression.      We find that our estimates of              are positive for the

announcement day and negative for the issue day.                Neither is significantly

different from zero.16

Theory predicts that the price drop at announcement should be unrelated to

     if there is to be a fully revealing information release prior to the
Ta
actual issue, and this is consistent with the insignificant
                                                                          l        (If the

information release is not fully revealing there should still be a price

drop --          the   magnitude of which is unrelated to Ta --   at   the issue


announcement, and this shows up as the negative intercept.)

     Although most of the preceding discussion has focussed on postponing

equity issues until after information releases, firms may also speed up or

delay information releases to more closely precede equity issues.                   For

instance, firms have a window of 90 days in which they can file an annual

report after the fiscal year end.             Because of this flexibility, we expect

that the variation in the number of days between information releases

immediately prior to equity issues will be higher than the average

variation in the number of days between information releases.                 Thus we

have:


     Hypothesis 3:           Timing of Information Releases

     H       :   The variance of the days between information releases is not
         m
     affected by the event of an equity issue in the following quarter.                   Ha:

     The variance of days between information releases is greater than

     average when equity is issued in the following quarter.


We test this hypothesis by comparing the overall variance of the time

between consecutive quarterly earnings announcements with the variance in

the time between the two announcements immediately prior to an equity

5. Conclusions

   In this paper we explore the implications of information asymmetries

for the timing and pricing of equity issues, and find evidence supporting

the theory.     In particular, we find that

   1.      Firms tend to issue equity earlier within a quarter rather than

           later.

   2.      Firms are least likely to issue equity in their fiscal-year fourth

           quarter, immediately prior to the annual report.

   3.      Almost no firms issue equity in the first few weeks after the

           announcement of the fourth quarter's earnings.       This is likely due

           to the lag of several weeks between that earnir s announcement      and
                                                            -




           the release      of the annual   report.

   4.      The share price decline at the time of an equity issue is

           increasing in the time since the announcement of the equity issue.

   We have focussed upon earnings announcements as information-revealing

events, but firms can release information in other ways.          Earnings

announcements are appealing because there is ample evidence that they do

convey information, they are mandated, and there is only a limited degree
                                      32

to which they can be manipulated.   Firms can also engage in voluntary

information releases, for which credibility problems arise.   An

interesting extension of this paper would be to arudy the effects of
                                                                   issues.

                                    Appendix          A
   The discussion in Sections 2 and 3 assumed that r < $ <                               2r.         In this

appendix we consider equilibrium for the other possible values of $.

   8 > 2r    The equilibrium in this case is simpler than that in the text.

         is always the lowest possible equilibrium valuation for firma
a0-r+
issuing shares.     The highest quality type e firms will issue if                                     +   r,
their value conditional on not issuing is less than the equilibrium

valuation, which is at least 00      -   r   +   $>       m0
                                                               -   r   +   2r.     Thus, the highest

quality type e firms always find it optimal to issue equity.                                   The

equilibrium valuation is therefore given always by (7).                                The equilibrium

valuation is decreasing over time,           since (7) is decreasing over time.

   $ <   r   In this case the highest quality type e firms never find it

optimal to issue equity.       If they did issue equity, the greatest possible

equilibrium valuation is given by 00 +            $.      Their        value conditional upon

not issuing is
               m0
                    +   r.   Thus, they will never issue.                        Equation (8)

therefore gives the equilibrium valuation initially.                             At some point,

depending upon parameters, the type e firms with a = 00 may drop out, in

which case the equilibrium valuation would simply be
                                                     00
                                                                                   -    r +    /3.

     Lemma 1:         i) If a firm with assets worth 0* does not issue equity, then

no firm of the same type (d or e) with a                   >    0*       will issue     equity.     ii) If a

firm with assets worth 0* does issue equity, then all firms of the same

type with lower a will issue equity.                   iii) For any given 0*,               if    a type d

firm issues equity, then type e firms with the same a will also issue

equity.

     Proof. (1) and (iii)             follow from (5) and (6).                  (ii) follows for


evaporating firms from (5).                 For durable firms, suppose that a firm with a

=   0* issues        equity.     If a firm with      a' <   a* does not issue equity it must

violate (6).            But if 0*     satisfies    (6), so must a** < 0*




     Lemma 2:

           -   r +j3V          <a0+, 0<           t<l.
               type d firms with a           00
                                                  or a =
                                                           00
                                                                +    r    never issue equity before

               time 1.

iii.           Type e firms with a                and with a — 00           -   r   always issue equity.
                                             00
Proof.          (i) If all firms issued equity, then the fair valuation would be

       =        + fi. At         —          (6) is violated for durable firms with a
                                                                                                      =
V*         00              Vt        Vt*,                                                                 00
+ r,    so they will not issue equity.                From Lemma           1,   it will never be the

case that        a   higher a firm issues equity when a lower a firm does not.

Since at least one type does not issue equity, Vt < Vt*.                                As for the lower

bound, the rational value for firms issuing equity can not be lower than

the value for the worst type.

                                     + $, (6) is   violated for type d firms with a
     (ii)       Since
                         V<     a0
so those firms do not issue equity.

   (iii)   Follows      from (5), the fact that $ > r, and from part (i).
                                                                          //



  Lemma 3:       The average valuation of firms issuing equity at time 1

exceeds      +   43,   and the number of firms issuing equity is greater at time

1 than at time t, for 0          <   t < 1.

  Proof:     By Lemma 1, Vt < m0          +   43.   All        type e firms with new projects

issue equity at time        1,   SO the average value for these is m0 +                 43.   All    type

d firms which have received projects between time 0 and time 1, and which

have a           issue equity at time 1.             The lowest quality type d firms have
           a0,

already issued equity when projects arrived, and thus there are fewer of

these firms than of high quality type d firms.                        So for type   d   firms,      the

average valuation is greater than a0 +                   43.


   There are as many evaporating projects and newly arriving worst quality

type d projects at time 1 as at time                t.         In addition, those type d firms

with a                   not issued previously, do so at time 1.                                     the
           a0 which have                                                                  Thus,


quantity of issues is greater at time 1 than at any time in the interval

between 0 and 1.



   Lemma 4:       The equilibrium price path for issuing firms is non-

increasing in S on (0,1).

   Proof:     At any given t, the only firms issuing equity are type e firms

and the lowest quality type d firms.                 If there is a decrease in the

relative quantity of type d firms, the average quality of firms which

potentially issue equity rises, and this cannot reduce the equilibrium

price at t.

1.   An additional posaibility is that firma may voluntarily disclose

     information at the time of a new issue.     One would expect voluntary

     disclosures both to be costly and to suffer from problems of

                                                                             then
     verifiability. If such disclosures were costlessly verifiable,

     models based upon asymmetric information could not explain the equity

     price drop at the time of an issue.

2.   When all projects evaporate if not financed, the model is similar to that

     in Myers and Majluf (1984).

3.   This is similar to the idea that firms always find it advantageous to

     disclose all relevant information when it is free to do so [Grossman

     (1979), Milgrom (1981), Fishman and Hagerty (l987)[

4.   For a discussion of alternative    managerial   decision rules, see Myecs and

     Majiuf (1984).

5.   The management of an overvalued firm may optimally choose to finance a

     negative NPV project. Taking into account the existence of negative NPV

     projects would strengthen our prediction that the equilibrium equity

     price will be higher after    information releases, because firms with


     negative NOV projects lower the average quality of issuers when the

     market is uninformed.     With an infinity of firms, however,   including

     these firms would reduce the extent to which new issues are clustered

     sfter information events, since they could issue equity at any rime.

6.   It is possible to allow firms to also have financial slack (e.g. cash and

     marketable securities),    as in Myers and Majiuf (1984).    However,    as long

     as the amount of slack is publicly known, the market evaluates      the firm

     conditional   on the quantity of slack, and this adds nothing    to the
                                                38


      analysis.     Firms with sufficient     slack do not issue equity.

7.    Firms plan information       releases   in advance because producing a credible

      signal is costly, and gathering the necessary information takes time

      (e.g., accountants work for several months preparing             a 10K report).       The

      existence    of SEC disclosure rules requiring the periodic release of

      information also suggests that some information release dates are

      anticipated    hy both insiders and outsiders.

8.    The assumption that the change in asset value is binomially distributed

      is made for convenience,      but is not essential.         Similarly,     could be

      made stochastic without changing the qualitative             results.

9.    The assumption that investors learn the truth at time I is made for

      simplicity.     If management's information were modelled as a refinement of

      inveator's    information    at t=0, and if the information       at t=l refines the

      investors'    information,   similar results would follow.

10.   In this equilibrium,    evaporating     firma issue equity immediately.

      Receiving a project and not issuing equity thus reveals a firm to be

      durable.     Is there any advantage     to durable firms waiting to reveal their

      durability,    and then issuing equity?        The answer is no.        If the market

      ever believed that a firm waiting and then issuing equity could not be

      the worst type, then the worst type would have an incentive                to wait and

      pretend to be a durable firm with a            °o•   This   belief by the market

      would guarantee a valuation of at least          a + /3,    which is better than the

      worst durables could obtain by pooling with the evaporating firms.                 But

      once the worst durable firms wait to issue equity, it is advantageous for

      the better durable firms to wait until their type is revealed.                Thus,    in

      equilibrium the worst durable firma would be revealed as being the worst
                                          39

      by issuing equity.   The only Nash equilibrium is for the worst durable

      firms to pool with the evaporating firms, and for the better durable

      firms to defer issuing equity until the next information announcement.

11.   All type d firms will announce an issue because of the chance that after

      time 1 they will learn that their ssset quality is 00   -
                                                                  r,   in which case

      they will proceed with the issue.     (If their assets are worth 00 Ct 00 +

      r, they will withdraw, which we assume to be costless.)      Similarly, type

      e firms will want to issue, though they may later withdraw if they learn

      that they have assets worth 00 + r.

12.   For each test,   as many observations were retained as was feasible.      Thus

      sample size varies substantially across tests.    The largest source of

      data loss was gaps in the Compustat data.

13.   We required that successive earnings announcements be no less than 40 an

      no more than 180 days apart.   Observations not meeting this critetion

      were omitted.

14.   Because 51% of the firms have December fiscal-year ends, we constructed

      separate histograms for December fiscal year ends and all other fiscal

      year ends.   There appeared to be no significant difference between the

      two.

15.   We also estimate the t-statistics using a time-series estimate of the

      variance of average abnormal returns.    The results are essentially the

      same as those reported in the paper.

16.   We have included additional regressors in cross-sectional regressions

      like (14), such as the relative size of the primary and secondary

      components of the equity issue (% of previously outstanding equity) and

      the size of the firm.    The coefficients on these variables are not
                                     40

significantly different from zero.
