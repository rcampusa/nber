Skill Compression, Wage Differentials and Employment:
Germany vs the US

NBER Working Paper No. 7610
March 2000

                                          ABSTRACT



       Germany's more compressed wage structure is taken by many analysts as the main cause of
the German-US difference in job creation. We find that the US has a more dispersed level of skills
than Germany but even adjusted for skills, Germany has a more compressed wage distribution than
the US. The fact that jobless Germans have nearly the same skills as employed Germans and look
more like average Americans than like low skilled Americans runs counter to the wage compression
hypothesis. It suggests that the pay and employment experience of low skilled Americans is a poor
counterfactual for assessing how reductions in pay might affect jobless Germans.

                   Skill Compression, Wage Differentials and Employment:
                                       Germany vs the US


       The most popular explanation for the smaller creation of jobs in Germany than in the US in
the 1980s and 1990s is the “wage compression” hypothesis that institutionalized wage setting
compressed the wage structure in Germany relative to the market determined wage structure in the
US. Higher pay in the bottom rungs of the earnings distribution in Germany (and other EU
countries), the argument goes, cut off low skill jobs, particularly in the service sector. The
implication is that only by reducing pay and increasing inequality can Germany and the EU achieve
US levels of employment and unemployment (Siebert 1997).

        There is empirical plausibility to this argument. As table 1 shows, the distribution of
earnings is much narrower in Germany than in the US and much of the difference between US and
German employment per adult is found in the service sector. In addition, during the period when the
employment-population rate fell in Germany relative to the US and when the German unemployment
rate rose relative to the US unemployment rate, the dispersion of pay rose in the US but held steady
in Germany. Thus the wage compression story seems to fit both the cross-section and time series
evidence.

        But there is another potential explanation for the difference between the US and German
wage structures which runs counter to the wage dispersion explanation of joblessness. This is that
the distribution of skills is itself more compressed in Germany than in the US (Nickell 1997, Nickell/
Bell 1996, Nickell 1998). If less skilled workers are more skilled in Germany than in the US while
German and American skilled workers are similarly skilled, some of the narrow dispersion of wages
in Germany would represent a compression of skills. Measured in “efficiency units”, the German
wage distribution would be more dispersed than nominal wages indicate, cutting the ground under
the wage compression argument.

       So, how different are the German and the US skill distributions overall and among types of
workers? To what extent do skill differences explain the lower dispersion of wages and return to
education in Germany than in the US? Are low-skilled workers better paid in Germany than in the
US because they are more skilled or because Germany relies on institutions to set wages?

        These are difficult questions to answer, in large part because we lack good measures of labor
skill across countries. The most commonly used measure, years of schooling, is not directly
comparable between the US and Germany because the two countries have very different educational
systems. German education involves apprenticeships, which differ greatly from formal schooling in
the US, so that it is necessary to develop some mapping between apprenticeships and formal
schooling to make valid comparisons. The content or quality of German education and American
education also differs. Even ideal measures of comparable education, moreover, may not fully
capture the workplace competencies that underlie individual productivity and wages.
                                                                                                 2
       In this study we deal with these problems by developing equivalence classes between US and
German schooling and by using scores on the quantitative part of an adult literacy test to contrast
workplace competencies. We combine information on employment, wages, and schooling from the
Comparable German American Sectoral (CGAS) Database with data on literacy skills, income, and
schooling from the OECD’s Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) for the two countries.

         The CGAS is a two-country comparative study of employment and wages of workers in
comparable industry and occupation cells for the period 1970 to 1995. It takes data from the US
Census of Population, the Current Population Survey, and the German Mikrozensus and social
security files (Beschaeftigtenstatistik) to develop employment and wages for workers in comparable
detailed demographic, education, occupation, and industry cells. The CGAS lacks observations on
individuals, but it has information on workers in enough cells (theoretically up to 1.2 million cells
per year, though some cells are empty and others have too few observations to be useful) to provide
substantial cross-section and time series variation in relevant variables (for more details see
Freeman/Schettkat 1998).

        The International Adult Literacy Survey is a multi-country study that measures the ability of
adults to understand and use printed information through reading, writing, and numeracy, in their
workplace and daily life. It is the first major international study focused on the workplace-related
literacy skills that workers have. It includes data on employment, unemployment, income, and other
socio-economic variables. Germany and the US were two of the countries in the initial seven-
country study.

       We find that:

       1. Measured in equivalent skill units or in literacy scores, Germany has a more skilled work
          force than the US, with a more compressed distribution of skill. This contrasts with the
          picture found in nominal years of schooling, which show that Germany has fewer years of
          education and a more dispersed distribution of those years.

       2. The principal difference in skills between American and German workers is in the bottom
          rungs of the skill or education distribution, where Americans have much lower literacy
          skills than Germans. While about half of this difference is due to low skilled-immigrants
          to the US, many native-born Americans still have very low skills.

       3. The widespread belief that American schools do not work well notwithstanding, each
          year of schooling in the US adds more in literacy skills than a year of schooling in
          Germany. But the US trails Germany by so much in skills at the lowest levels that it does
          not attain equality in skills until the 15th year of education.

       4. The narrower dispersion of skills in Germany than in the US explains only a modest
          proportion of the lower dispersion of wages in Germany, leaving a considerable role for
          institutional factors in compressing the German wage distribution.
                                                                                            3
       5. Jobless Germans have comparable skills to employed Germans and to Americans in the
          middle of the US skill distribution, while jobless Americans have lower skills than
          employed Americans.

         In short, comparisons of the dispersion of wages and relative wages based on measured
wages exaggerate US-German differences in the distribution of earnings in “efficiency units”. But
even skill adjusted, Germany has a more compressed wage distribution than the US. What casts
most doubt on the wage compression hypothesis is the fact that jobless Germans have about the same
skills as employed Germans and look more like average Americans than like low skilled Americans.
 In the skill dimension, German joblessness has little of the structure that one would expect if it were
due to a distorted wage structure.



Skill Distributions Measured by Equivalence Groups

        The most readily available measure of skills across countries is years of schooling attained. If
all school systems operated more or less similarly, years of schooling would be a reasonable
indicator of the skills obtained from the formal educational system. The United Nation's
International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) would measure accurately skill
attainment across countries.

        But schooling systems differ greatly across countries in such things as: the length of the
school year and school day, amount of homework, class size, quality of teachers, and curriculum. As
a result a year of schooling in one country does not produce the same human capital as a year of
schooling in another. Differences in the skills young persons obtain from their home and social
environment also produce differences in workplace competencies. Young persons with nominally the
same schooling score differently on standardized international tests of attainment.

        Because Germany relies on apprenticeships to teach young persons work relevant skills, it fits
poorly into standard international classifications. Apprenticeships combine part-time schooling and
part-time on-the-job training. If one compares Germans and Americans with the same number of
years of full-time schooling, the Germans will have superior skills because their apprenticeships give
them additional schooling. Thus, our first task for comparing US and German distributions of skills
is to develop an equivalency between Germany’s skill creation through apprenticeships and years of
schooling and American skill creation through formal schooling.

       Figure 1 shows the equivalence scale that we have established. Most analysts will probably
agree with our setting Americans with master’s degrees or more and Germans with university
degrees as equivalent; and setting US bachelor’s graduates and Germans with Fachhochschule
Arbitur + Fachhochschule as equivalent. By these scales, Germans have a higher proportion of
workers in the highest skill category while Americans have a higher proportion in the second highest
group. Taking these two groups together, the US has relatively more highly skilled workers than
Germany.
                                                                                                 4
        In the least skilled groups we have put Germans with no certificate and Americans who have
not graduated high school. The difficult question is how to treat Germans with some completed form
of apprenticeship and Americans with high school degrees or with some post-secondary education
but no bachelor’s degree. Apprenticeship gives Germans more skills than American high school
graduates with no additional training. We categorize those with Hauptschule and Apprenticeship as
comparable to US high school graduates; those with Realschule + Apprenticeship; Abitur as having
13 years of schooling; those with Hauptschule + Meister as having 14 years; and those with
Realschule + Meister as having 15 years of schooling.

         The resultant distribution of workers by level of skill differs greatly between the two
countries. The vast bulk of Germans are in the second skill category while Americans are more
widely dispersed across groups, with 45 percent falling into the lowest skill category. Overall,
Germans are somewhat more skilled, due to the large fraction of Americans in the lowest category,
and have a more compressed distribution of skills, due to the concentration of Germans in the second
skill category.1

         If our equivalency scales are roughly correct, Americans with just a high school degree
should have literacy scores roughly equal to those of Germans with less than upper secondary
education, whereas Germans with less than upper secondary education should have scores roughly
equal to the mean score for the US. This turns out to be the case (Freeman and Schettkat, 1999).
Fifty percent of Germans who have not completed upper secondary education scored in the upper
levels of the document scale (t levels 3 and 4/5, by the OECD classification) compared to only 17.1%
Americans who did not graduate from high school (OECD 1997, Literacy Skills 156). Thus, placing
Germans with less than upper secondary education on a par with American high school graduates,
and Germans with more education on a par with Americans with some post-high school education
fits the distribution of literacy scores. Although we did not create the equivalence scales to equate
literacy scores, the quantitative literacy scores in figure 1 show that three of our four groups have
similar scores for Americans and Germans, though the lowest skilled Americans have lower scores
than the lowest skilled Germans.

        How much of the narrower distribution of earnings in Germany than in the US might be
attributable to differences in the distribution of skills?

     To answer this question, we performed a two-part analysis. First we regressed ln wages on
dummy variables for our measures of skill from figure 1

                  (1) ln W = a + b2 D2 + b3 D3 + b4 D4 +σv

         1
            The comparison of levels of schooling depends on the units we attach to the four categories. Using US
years as a guide, we give 11 years to the first group 14 years to the 2nd category, 16 to the 3rd category and 19 years
to the 4th category. Then we get 13.4 for the US and 14.1 for Germany. The comparison of the distributions is more
transparent. The squared deviation of the difference between the proportion of persons in each category and the
0.25 that would be in a category in a uniform distribution for the US is 0.08 compared to a comparable statistic of
0.26 for Germany.
                                                                                                                      5

where the lowest skill group is the deleted group and where Di reflects the ith skill group and bi is its
estimated effect on earnings relative to the deleted group. Then we used the resultant regression
coefficients to examine the impact of the difference between the US and German distributions
among the groups on the standard deviation of ln earnings of workers in the two countries.

        Line 1 of table 2 shows the “raw” standard deviation of ln wages in Germany and the US
across cells in the CGAS: one measure of the phenomenon to explain.2 By this metric, the dispersion
in the US is 0.13 ln points higher than in Germany. Line 2 records standard deviations of residual
earnings from the simple regression of ln wages on dummy variables for skill groups. The standard
deviation in the US falls by 0.07 ln points while that in Germany falls by 0.05 points, reducing the
difference in standard deviations by just 0.02 ln points or 15% of the initial difference.

         But the standard deviation in residual earnings differ not only because the distribution of
skills differs between the two countries but also because returns to skill differ, potentially for reasons
independent of the actual skills. Taking the variance of equation (1) we get:

(2) σ2 lnW = b2 2 σ 2 D2 + b32 σ 2 D3 + b42 σ 2 D4 + 2b2b3 σ2 D2D3 + 2b2b4 σ2 D2D4 +
              2b3b4 σ2 D3D4 + σ 2 v

        Line 3 of table 2 records the b coefficients on our three skill equivalence groups from the ln
earnings equation. Being in the 2nd skill category rather than the first (omitted) group has a larger
impact on earnings in Germany than in the US, implying a greater skill differential in Germany than
in the US among workers in these groups. The differential between the 3rd and 2nd skill groups and
between the 4th and 3rd skill groups is, on the other hand, larger in the US. The biggest difference in
the structure of earnings occurs at the upper end of the skill distribution, where Germans earn a
smaller premium than Americans.3

        Line 4 of table 2 computes the dispersion in earnings that each country would have if it had
its own returns to skill, reflected in the b coefficients, but the distribution of skills of the other
country, and its own residual variance of earnings. That is, we replace the σ 2 Ds in equation (2)
with the σ 2 Ds from the other country. Since so many Germans are in the 2nd skill category, giving
the US the German distribution of skills reduces the dispersion of earnings in the US, while giving
Germany the US distribution of skills raises the dispersion of earnings in Germany. The standard
deviation of ln wages in the US would be 0.02 points lower if the US had the German skill
distribution while the standard deviation of wages in Germany would be 0.05 points higher if

        2
            These figures are based on cells that vary by years of schooling, age groups, industry, occupation, and
gender, immigration status. Since they give all persons within a cell the same wage, they understate the standard
deviation in ln wages in both countries.
         3 The original source for wages in the CGAS is the Beschäftigtenstatistik, which is censored at the high
wage end because of the ceiling for social security contributions (see Möller for a discussion). Therefore, we
underestimate wage dispersion in Germany. Whether this leads to overestimation of German-US difference in wage
dispersion is not clear because fringe benefits (not measured as wages) are more important among high-income
Americans.
                                                                                                       6
Germany had the US distribution of skills. Thus, from 10% to 17% of the US-German difference in
the standard deviations of earnings across cells can be attributed to differences in the distribution of
skills.4

        That taking account of skills in this fashion eliminates only a modest proportion of the
difference in the dispersion of pay between the US and Germany can be demonstrated in another
way. Line 5 of table 2 gives the standard deviation of ln wages within skill categories for the
countries. There is surprisingly little difference in the standard deviations for the lowest skill group,
but the US has 0.12 ln units higher standard deviation of pay in the key 2nd skill group and even
higher standard deviations of ln pay in the next two categories. Again, the greatest difference in the
dispersion of pay between the US and Germany occurs in the upper part of the skill distribution, not
in the lower part.


schooling tells a different story

        What if we use reported years of schooling rather than our skill equivalence groups in the
analysis, treating years of schooling as comparable between the countries?

        In this case, the quantity measures of skill would contravene the skill compression story.
Figure 2 shows that the distribution of years of schooling for Americans is higher on average and
more concentrated about the mean than the distribution of years of schooling for Germans.

        But if the actual skill of workers with the same years of schooling in the two countries differs,
comparing the distribution of years does not properly test the skill compression claim. Indeed, the
skill compression hypothesis would predict that with such a metric, wages by skill group would
differ between the countries. Skill compression would show up in lower returns to schooling in
Germany than in the US, reducing the overall dispersion of pay by an amount roughly comparable to
the amount that of reduction in dispersion that we obtained in table 1.

       In part, the CGAS data bear out this prediction. We regressed ln wages on years of schooling
across CGAS cells in 1995 and then decomposed the variances of ln wages into the parts due to: the
variance in educational attainment; the square of the coefficient on schooling in an ln earnings
equation; and the variance of the residual in earnings from the equation:

        (3) σ 2 lnW = b2 σ 2 S + σ 2 v

        The standard deviation of the residuals from these regressions, σ 2v measure the dispersion of
wages within a country for workers conditional on the value of a year of schooling, b, and the
dispersion of years of schooling, σ 2 S. Differences in overall dispersion of wages between the US
and Germany can be attributed to differences in the three components.

        4
          This is without taking account of how the different distribution of skills might affect the
return to skills.
                                                                                                      7

        Line 1 of table 3 shows again the “raw” standard deviation of ln wages in Germany and the
US across cells in the CGAS. Line 2 records standard deviations of residual earnings from the simple
regression of ln wages on years of schooling. The standard deviation in the US falls by .08 ln points
while that in Germany falls by .05 points. As a result the dispersion in schooling and in its returns
explains 18 percent of the greater standard deviation in ln wages in the US than in Germany.

         Lines 3 to 5 show that it is the higher returns to schooling in the US that explains the
reduction in the difference of standard deviations of ln wages. Line 3 records coefficients on years of
schooling in the earnings equation: it is 0.11 across cells in the US compared to 0.07 across cells in
Germany. By contrast, line 4 documents that the standard deviation in years of schooling is lower in
the US than in Germany, which by itself would make dispersion of wages less in the US. Line 5
shows that the standard deviation of ln wages in the US would fall by .04 points to 0.42 if schooling
had the same return in the US as in Germany. Conversely, the standard deviation of ln wages would
rise by 0.05 points in Germany if it combined the US return to schooling, the German dispersion of
schooling, and the German residual variance. Using the other countries distribution of schooling but
the own returns to education only change the standard deviation of ln wages by 1% (line 6). While
these results are roughly consistent with the skill compression hypothesis if we interpret the lower
coefficient on years of schooling in Germany as reflecting smaller differences in “real skills” by level
of schooling in Germany, most of the difference in standard deviations occurs among workers with
similar years of schooling.

         In sum, our measure of equivalency scales of skill lends some support to the skill
compression story, but if we use years of schooling as our measure of skill, we must assume that
differences in returns to schooling are due to differences in skills to interpret the relation between
years of education and wages in a similar fashion. If we had no other measure of skills, it would be
hard to convince the skeptic that skill compression is that important. But we have one additional
way to compare skills between Americans and Germans: in terms of literacy scores on the OECD’s
adult literacy survey.



Skill Distributions Measured by Literacy Scores

        In the early 1990s the OECD developed the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS),
which used the same survey instrument to measure the ability of adults to understand and use printed
information through reading, writing, and numeracy, in their workplace and daily life. It is the first
major international study focused on the literacy skills that workers have and use at workplace.
Although the IALS paper-and-pencil tests do not fully reflect workplace productivity -- a diligent
pleasant employee may do more in trade or services than someone who fills out forms -- they offer a
potentially better measure of skills in Germany and the US than years of educational attainment.

      Figure 3 shows the distribution of literacy scores in Germany and the US. By inspection, the
German skill distribution is more symmetrical and concentrated around the mean than the US skill
                                                                                                   8
distribution. The standard deviation of the scores is nearly twice as large in the US (0.30) as in
Germany (0.16). The main reason for this is that a substantial number of American workers but
virtually no Germans have exceptionally low scores. Indeed, while the mean and median of the skill
distributions differ by just 7-8 points, at the 25th percentile Americans score 29 points lower than
Germans, while at the 5th percentile, they score an amazing 77 points lower.

        One reason why the US has so many workers with exceptionally low scores is that about 13
percent of Americans in the IALS are immigrants. Immigrants averaged 217 on the literacy score –
60 points below non-immigrant Americans, and were disproportionately represented among those
with exceptionally low literacy scores. By contrast, just 8% of Germans taking the IALS were
immigrants (age group 20-64 years), and these immigrants averaged 271 on their literacy score, just
24 points below non-immigrant German citizens. If we eliminate immigrants from the sample, the
standard deviation in literacy scores among Americans falls sharply, from 0.30 to 0.23 while the
standard deviation in literacy scores among Germans is unchanged at 0.15. Thus nearly half of the
difference in the dispersion of literacy skills between the US and Germany is due to the low literacy
skills of US immigrants. Even so, there remains a sizable 0.08 difference in the standard deviation
of skills of the native born between the two countries, again concentrated in the lower tail of the
distribution.

         Figure 4 shows starkly the difference in the skill distributions between the two countries for
native born persons (panel A). It records the ratio of the literacy scores of Germans to Americans at
the same percentiles for each distribution. Ratios greater than 1 indicate that Germans have higher
literacy at that point in the distribution, while ratios less than 1 indicate that Americans have higher
literacy. The line for all workers, including immigrants shows a huge German advantage in skills in
the lowest percentiles, falling to near equality around the middle of the distribution, and then falling
to a slight disadvantage in the highest percentiles. But the graph for immigrants shows an even
more stark difference (panel B): German immigrants are much more skilled in the lower rungs of the
skill distribution and somewhat more skilled in the upper rungs. The line for non-immigrants is the
closest to 1.0 in the figure, though even here, low skill Americans do more poorly than low skill
Germans.

       How should we interpret the exceptionally low literacy scores of low skilled American
immigrants? Given the huge immigration into the US of persons with very limited schooling, largely
from Mexican and Latin America, the scores arguably represent a true measure of skills. But to
some extent, the scores reflect the fact that the native language of immigrants is not English,. By
concentrating in immigrant enclaves, many persons largely illiterate in English can function in their
own language. From this perspective, the low scores exaggerate the poor skills of these workers.



Schooling and literacy scores: the skill formation of schooling

        Thus far we have looked at schooling and literacy scores as separate measures of skill. But
these two measures are highly positively correlated. Education produces higher levels of literacy;
                                                                                             9
persons with high “innate” literacy scores invest in education more than others. Does the link
between schooling and literacy differ between the US and Germany?

        To analyze the link between schooling and literacy scores, we turn to the IALS. The raw
IALS data show that Germans have relatively few years of schooling but reasonably high quantitative
(other) literacy scores. In part, however, this is due to the fact that IALS counts formal schooling
only, ignoring the years of apprenticeship, which Germans obtain. To correct for this we compared
years of schooling in the CGAS, inclusive of apprenticeship, and years of formal schooling in the
IALS and developed an adjustment procedure for correcting the IALS observations to take account
of apprenticeship. The procedure is described in appendix A. We use this corrected years of
schooling measure throughout this study.

        Table 4 records the quantitative literacy scores of non-immigrants with different years of
schooling. We exclude immigrants because most of them have received schooling elsewhere and
because the scores of US immigrants arguably understate their skills. The table gives the mean
quantitative score in each group, the score of the 5th 50th and 95th percentile and the standard
deviation of the scores. There is a clear association between schooling and literacy scores in the
table: the mean level of quantitative literacy rises monotonically with years of schooling in both
countries. In the underlying observations for individuals the correlation between years of schooling
and the literacy score is .57 for the US and .35 for Germany.

        There are two noticeable differences in the relation between schooling and literacy between
Americans and Germans. First, at the lowest levels of schooling, Germans have much higher
quantitative scores than Americans, while at higher levels of schooling, Americans have modestly
higher scores than Germans. The big difference in skills occurs at the bottom of the education
distribution. Second, the standard deviations in the table shows a much wider dispersion in literacy
scores within schooling categories in the US than in Germany, concentrated also among low
education groups.

        The concentration of US-German differences in literacy scores at the lower rungs of the
education ladder suggests that years of schooling in the US are more effective in producing skills
than years of schooling in Germany. To examine this, we take years of schooling as given and
regress literacy skills on years and other demographic factors:

       (4)QUANT = a + b S + cAGE + v,

where QUANT is the measure of quantitative literacy, S is the years of equivalent schooling; AGE is
the age of the person.

          Table 5 gives the results of this regression. The most striking finding is that years of
schooling have a greater effect on QUANT in the US than in Germany. An extra year of schooling
adds about 12 score points in the US compared to only about 4 points in Germany. German workers
are on average more skilled because of the larger constant term in the regressions. One interpretation
is that this reflects more effective primary schooling (which everyone in both countries receive) in
                                                                                                    10
Germany. This is confirmed by dummy regressions in columns IV. We included a 'drop-out' dummy,
which has a significant negative coefficient in the US but is insignificant in Germany.5 Another is
that German families or culture gives students more literacy skills, schooling aside. The difference in
the constant terms is sufficiently large that the US passes the German skill level on average only at
about 15.years of schooling.


        Age coefficients are negative but small in both countries When we include an interaction
term for age and education the age coefficient becomes significantly positive in the US. Since we
cannot distinguish between age and cohort effects, this difference also allows for alternative
interpretations. It could be that Americans start with less skills and catch up as they age. Or it could
be that older generations of Americans are more literate than comparably educated younger cohorts.
To the extent that literacy scores in fact measure workplace competency, the high age coefficient in
the US fits with the high age-earnings profile that developed in the 1980s and 1990s.

        Columns III in the table pursues the impact of age and education on skills by adding an
interaction term to the regression. The interaction is negative for both countries, suggesting that age
and education are substitute ways of acquiring skills or, alternatively, that education has improved its
effectiveness over time, so that the education of older cohorts was less productive in raising skills.
The interaction is also larger in the US than in Germany, implying that whatever underlies this
pattern – age or cohort effects – has been more powerful in the US.

        What are the implications of these findings for the skill compression hypothesis?

       The narrower dispersion of quantitative literacy scores in Germany than in the US supports
the implication of our equivalence scales: that Germany has a narrower distribution of skills than the
US. The evidence that US schooling adds more to literacy than German schooling supports the skill
compression interpretation of the lower return to schooling in Germany. At least in part, Germany
has a smaller return to years of schooling because skills are more weakly associated with years of
schooling than in the US.

         But these calculations also highlight problems with the skill compression story. The
dispersion of wages but not the dispersion of skills differs most between the US and Germany among
persons in the highest skill categories. If we use the equivalent skill categories of figure 1, we obtain
a comparable pattern. In Germany the standard deviation of ln wages and of ln skills falls from the
least to the most skilled group, consistent with the skill compression story. But in the US the four
skill groups have similar standard deviations of ln wages (around 0.40) but very different standard
deviations of ln skills, which fall between the lowest group (0.33) to the highest group (0.16). The
higher dispersion of wages among the most skilled/educated Americans compared to the most
skilled/educated Germans does not seem to reflect differences in the distribution of skills among
those two groups.


5 We defined as 'drop-outs' those with 11 or less years of schooling in the US. For Germany we defined as 'drop-
outs' those with 9 or less years of schooling.

From Compressed Skills to Compressed Wages

       To what extent does the compression of skills in Germany than in the US contribute to the
lower dispersion of wages and return to education in Germany than in the US?

        We analyze this question by regressing the ln income on literacy scores and education in the
IALS. The IALS records personal income after taxes, which necessarily differs from the hourly
earnings in the CGAS. It differs between Germany and the US because the tax system differs
between the countries, and because time worked differs on average and across individuals in the two
countries. In addition, the IALS records the position of workers in the German income distribution
in 20 percentile categories, rather than actual earnings. To analyze incomes, we transformed the
percentile measures in the German distribution into incomes at that point in the distribution, and
used those numbers as our dependent variable for Germany. For comparability, we grouped the
incomes of individual Americans in a similar fashion. Thus, each worker in both countries is
assigned one of twenty income numbers, depending on where that worker fit in the national
distribution.

        There are three ways to model the link between wages and skills when we have both literacy
scores and years of schooling as potential indicators of human capital.

        First, assume that schooling and other factors determine literacy skills which in turn affect
wages: Schooling → Literacy Skills → Wages. This suggest that we regress ln wages on skills (with
other covariates) but not on schooling, and use the resultant b coefficient to assess the contribution of
the compression of skills in Germany on the standard deviation of ln wages.

       Second, assume that schooling and other factors determine wages, and that literacy skill is a
background factor that affects schooling: Literacy Skills Æ Schooling Æ Wages. This is the
standard human capital model with schooling dependent on skills.

         Third, assume that schooling and literacy scores are equally valid indicators of human capital,
so that the appropriate regression is ln wages on both measures (with other covariates). This model is
likely to attribute a smaller fraction of the dispersion of wages to skills since schooling is more
compressed in US.

        Table 6 presents the results of estimating these models.

        The two columns under model I give the results of estimating the model in which wages
depend on the quantitative literacy score and covariates but not on schooling. The standard
deviations in ln incomes given at the bottom of the table are higher than the standard deviations in ln
wages in table 2 because incomes vary with time worked as well as hourly wages. The dispersion for
all employees is 0.27 ln points higher in the US than in Germany. We experimented with limiting
the sample to non-immigrants, but this did not reduce the standard deviations for either country -- in
striking contrast to the huge effect of removing immigrants from the skill distribution in the US. This
                                                                                                   12
reflects the fact that almost any well-defined group of workers in the US has a wide distribution of
earnings. The estimated coefficients on the ln of the quantitative literacy score shows that literacy
pays off more in the US than in Germany with an elasticity that is more than twice as large among
Americans than among Germans. Because the regression fits the US data better than the German
data, the difference between the residual standard deviations is reduced to .21 (.778-.572) Finally, if
we replace the distribution of scores in Germany with the US distribution and the distribution of
scores in the US with the German distribution, but keep each country’s coefficients on ln scores, we
obtain the results in the bottom line. Increasing the dispersion of scores in Germany to the level in
the US has virtually no effect on the standard deviation of earnings because the coefficient on ln
score in the earnings equation is small. Reducing the dispersion of scores in the US to the German
level has a small effect in reducing the US dispersion. The only way one can get noticeable effects
of changing the contribution of scores to the country dispersions in ln income is if we were to
postulate that Germany/the US had both the other country’s dispersion of scores and estimated
impact of scores on ln income. In this case, we would get a rise in dispersion of ln incomes in
Germany of .06 points and a fall in the dispersion of ln incomes in the US of .05 points.

        The estimates of models II and III tell much the same story, with regard to the effects of
changing the distributions of years of schooling (model II) or years of schooling and test scores
(Model III) on the dispersion of ln incomes. Because years of schooling is less dispersed in the US
than in Germany, there is a slight increase in the US dispersion of ln incomes and a slight decrease in
the German dispersion when we switch the dispersion of scores. With the dispersion of scores and
the dispersion of years of schooling working in the opposite direction, we get very little impact in
Model III.

        Still, taking account of the difference in literacy scores does have a substantial effect on one
German-US difference in ln income. In the regression of ln income on years of schooling alone
(with covariates), we obtain coefficients of 0.103 in the US and 0.043 in Germany. Inclusion of
literacy skills reduces the effect of schooling on earnings in the US by 0.027 points and reduces the
effect of earnings in Germany by 0.003 points. Thus, .024 points of an initial .060 difference in the
effects of schooling on earnings is attributable to the intervening effect of scores. Put differently,
40% of the difference in the impact of schooling on incomes between the countries is attributable to
the differential pattern of skills across schooling groups.

         In short, the narrower distribution of skills in Germany than in the US does not account for
the bulk of the difference in dispersion of income between the two countries. There remains a
sizeable difference in the distribution of incomes that presumably represents the effects of Germany's
institutional wage setting vs the US's market wage-setting. The next question to ask is whether this
difference is associated with the composition of joblessness in the two countries.
                                                                                                  13

Skills and Joblessness

        If the institutionally determined compressed wage structure in Germany cut off labor
demand for low-skilled workers while the flexible wage structure in the US allowed low skilled
persons to find work we would expect that a larger proportion of the jobless would be unskilled in
Germany compared to the US.

         Table 7 shows the distribution by literacy scores of the employed and unemployed and of
persons out of the labor force in Germany and the US in the IALS data. What stands out in the table
is the greater difference in quantitative literacy scores among the groups in the US than in Germany.
The mean score for the unemployed and out of the labor force groups in the US are substantially
below the score of the employed; whereas German unemployed and out of the labor force persons
have scores only modestly below those of employed Germans. Hence, unemployed Germans have
skills much greater than unemployed Americans – indeed scores comparable to those of employed
Americans. And virtually no unemployed Germans have scores as low as those of unemployed
Americans. Among the unemployed the 5th percentile of the German unemployed scores as high as
the 40th percentile of the American unemployed. For the employees, the gap is smaller the score of
the 5th percentile of the German employees is only reached by the 20th percentile of the American
employees.

       This pattern is inconsistent with the wage-compression hypothesis. In Germany, where the
wage structure is supposedly so compressed as to price out low skill workers, they are reasonably
highly skilled, whereas in the US where flexible wages are supposed to reduce structural
unemployment problems, the unemployed are much lower skilled than the employed.

        This does not, however, mean that the less skilled are not more likely to be jobless in
Germany than the more skilled. Figure 5 rearranges the literacy-job status data to show the rates of
employment for persons with given levels of literacy skills. In Germany as in the US those with
greater literacy scores have higher employment rates (and lower unemployment). Indeed, the gap
between the least skilled and more skilled is somewhat steeper in Germany than in the US, as the
wage compression hypothesis would predict. But there are exceedingly few Germans in those low
skill categories. In this sense, the data support the Nickel-Bell argument that Germany does not
have many low skill jobs because it lacks truly low skill workers.



CONCLUSION

Analysis of the difference between German and US employment rates and dispersion of wages has
generated two competing explanations of why Germany has lower employment: the wage
compression hypothesis and the skill compression hypothesis. Our examination of the distribution of
skills in Germany and the US has shown that Germany does indeed have a more compressed
distribution of skills than the US, due to the absence of a lower tail of less skilled workers, as is
                                                                                                 14
found in the US. But the compression of skills explains only a modest proportion of the compression
of wages in Germany compared to the US. Adjusted for skill, the German distribution of wages
remains more compressed than the American distribution. But the skills of the German unemployed
are too high for unemployment to be generated by the compressed wage structure and are sufficiently
higher than those of low skill Americans to raise doubts about inferring what might happen to
German employment were Germany to increase the dispersion of pay to US levels.

The dummy for the US is 11 or less years of schooling, i.e. it covers those regarded as dropouts.
For Germany the dummy is 9 years or less of schooling since 11 years of schooling would be quite
substantial in Germany. Those with 9 years or less of schooling may be regarded as a 'dropouts' in
Germany.

Appendix A: Adjusting the IALS Years of Education

        The IALS counts years of education only if schooling is 'full-time education'.6 Since
apprenticeships are a combination of part-time schooling (1 or 2 days per week) and practical training,
apprenticeships do not count as years of 'full-time' education. Thus many persons in the IALS are counted
in the categories ‘9 and 10 years of education’ (56%). By contrast, in the CGAS, which includes
apprenticeship years as part of schooling many persons are counted in categories ’12 and 13 years of
schooling’ (49%). Thus the actual length of the education of Germans with an apprenticeship (as well as
the classification in ISCED, see below) is misleading. Many Germans appear to have less education than
they actually got.

        Since job-relevant skills are build-up during apprenticeships the classification of education in IALS
is a misleading and will bias upward the 'scores' of Germans with low years of education. This may explain
why Germans with low years of education score as high as the average American who has many more years
of schooling.

       Including apprenticeships in years of education will shift many Germans from 9/10 years of
education to 12/13 years. To correct for the exclusion of the apprenticeship education in German years of
education we adjusted years of education for non-immigrants as follows.

         The ideal adjustment would be to simply add 3 years to the education of Germans in the IALS who
reported having served apprenticeships. But the IALS contains no data on this.7 So we randomly assigned
an extra three years to enough Germans with 9 and 10 years of schooling to replicate the CGAS
distribution at the lower level of the skill ladder. Specifically, we draw a random sample of 44% of those
with 9 years of education in IALS who had a quant-score8 of 228 or higher. We used the limit of 228
(which is the score of the 5th percentile for those with 12 years of education in original IALS) on the
assumption that those with an apprenticeship score on average higher than those who completed 9 years of
'full-time' education only. For the group with 10 years of 'full-time' education we followed a similar
procedure. Here the lower score-limit was 235 (the value of the 5th percentile of those with 13 years of
schooling in original IALS). We decided to expand the 13 years of education to the share found in CGAS
rather than reducing the groups of ten years of education in original IALS to the share in CGAS.


The small number of people who reported 11 years of education in IALS are very difficult to fit into the
German education system. In some tabulations we gave them 11 years; in others we dropped that groups
from the data because any reclassification seemed to be arbitrary. This made no substantive difference in
our results.

6
 Questions asked in IALS (German questionnaire)
Question 10 explicitly asks 'Insgesamt Schulbesuch, Vollzeit-Berufsschule, Universitaet'
Question 12 asks: 'Welchen hoechsten allgemeinbildenden Schul- oder Hochschulabschluss haben
Sie?
Question 15 asks for 'abgeschlossene Lehre' but is not included in the IALS files.
    7
     Additional variables A9 and A11 do not help because they refer to the type of the level 2 and level
3 education. The ‘abgeschlossene Lehre’ question is not included in the ILAS files.
    8
        'quant' is the mean of 5 variables measuring the scores in quantity tests in IALS.
