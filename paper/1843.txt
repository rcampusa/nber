                Content Protection and Oligopolistic Interactions




     In oligopolistic situations content protection can have unexpected effects

as it changes the nature of interactions between input suppliers. With a duop—

dy, it does so in a manner that makes the foreign firm wish to match price in-

creases and decreases of the domestic firm. Domestic input suppliers can there-

fore. lose from such policies, even when set at free trade levels. The relation

between input demands, the form of protection, and the degree of substitution

between inputs is shown to define the effects of content protection and to pro-

vide the basis for understanding who might lobby for protection in different

environments.

                                         INTRODUCTION


      In this paper we analyze the effects of content protection schemes in

an oligopolistic setting.         Although much work has been done on such schemes,

it has been confined to the polar cases of compet ition and monopoly.

Content protection has qualitatively di fferent ef fects in oligopolistic

markets because it alters the nature of i nteracti ons between firms.                  In

contrast to th e results derived under competition and monopoly, we show that

under certain conditions content prote ction, even when set at free trade

levels, must 1 ower the profits of dome stic input supplies. We relate these

conditions to the form of the protecti on scheme, and characteristics of the

market on the demand and supply side.

      The point that protection schemes act differently i n different market

structures can be made more clearly by ide ntifying three effects of any

restriction in     01   igopolistic   markets.        In   a competitive framework, any form

of protection works by altering the mar ket demand and/o r supply functions

wherever the constraint is binding.              If    the constraint is set so that it is

just bindino at the free trade levels,                 tw ill   not alte r the demand and/cr

supply functi ons at equilibrium and so th e free trade e quilibrium must

remain an equ ilibrium.1 In other words, in competitive                  mar k et s


restri c tions affect equilibrium only by bei ng restrictiv e. We call this the

"C" ef fect.

      I   n the c ase of domes tic monopoly and foreign competition, even

restr ct ions which would not have produced any effect under competitive

condi t ions h ye sig ni fi cant effects.         These arise bec ause such restrictions

alter demand or /and supply conditions at points aside from the unconstrained

equi I ibrium   p oint.   Hence, they can af fect the monopo lists            choice. In this
manner, restrictions can have significant effects by their sheer presence.

This p oint was made in Bh agwati (1965).         We call this the "ti" effect

     In    an oligopoly mode 1, not onl y does the eff ect present in the

                                                     each agent is affe cted in
compet itive and monopoly models exi st, but because _____

the ma nner the monopolist was in t he previous par agraph, the actions of all

agents can change. As th e outcome depends on all agents interacti ng,              an


additi 0 nal effect arises.      This pa mt was mad e in Krishna (1984), and we

call th is   the "I" effect.     Notice that in the    ol i   gopoly case, both "C" and

M"   eff ects also exist.      Al though the "ti" eff ects of protection at fre e trade

levels cannot but benefit domestic producers, the "I" effects can be h armful

if they work against the "N' effec ts. "C" eff ects are local effects wh ile N0

and 01U effects are globa1 effects like those of a change in regime.

Therefo re, they are likel y to be v ery importa nt.           We analyze content

protect ion schemes which are just binding at the free trade levels.                The "C"

effect is therefore elimi nated, wh ich allows us t o focus on the "ti" and "I"

effects.

      Intermediate good markets provide a natural product differentiation

through the production function for the final good.               They also provide

simple examples of products bei ng complementary or subst i tutable in demand,

i.e., of demand for an input fa Iling or rising in respon se to an increase in

the other inputs price, as well as of "unusual" slopes o f best re sponse

functions. We do not r estri ct ourselves for this reason to consi dering only

substitute goods or par ticularl y sloped best response fu nct ions.

      We consider content protec tion schemes specified in physical te rms as

well as in value—added terms.           We find that the effect o f content pr ot     ec t ion


schemes depends upon t hree fact ors, the first being the form of the scheme,

namely whether it is specified in physical or value added terms. The second




                                    2
is the degree of substitution between inputs, namely, whether the

elasticity of substituti on ex ceeds one or not.               The third is whether an

input's demand rises or falls when the oth er i nput's pric e rises——i.e.,

whether inputs are subst i tute s or comp 1       eec nts   in demand.

     If content protecti on is sp ecified in physical ter rns, we show that

equilibrium pri ces tend to rise, but that the domestic firm loses from

protection if t he inputs are corn plements, but gains if they are substitutes.

If content prot ection is speci fi ed in value added term s, the results are

identical to th ose of ph ysical c ontent protection as I ong as the elasticity

of substitution   cx ccc d 5   one.     Th ey are rever sed if it is less than one, so

that price tend   to   fall, and the domestic fi re gains f rom protection if the

inputs are comp lements, and 1 05 e s if they ar Cs ubstitutes.

     In Section 2 we set up t he model which is used in Sec tion 3 to study

physical conten t protect ion          and in Section   4t o   st udy val ue added content

protection. In Section 5 we disucss the ef fect £ of physic al conten t

protection when there is an additional fact or              such as doe estic lab or, which

is competitivel y supplied.           Finally, we ana lyre the incent ives for    lobby i n g

efforts on the part of labor and producers in the context of this model. We

offer a few comments on our results in the concluding section.
                                               SECTION 2

                                               The Model

        In this section we exami ne the factors which affect the demand for

intermediate inputs in imperf ect ly competitive markets. We assume that there

are two intermediate inputs, whi ch combine to produce the output of the

final good. One of the input Si s produced by the home country, while the

other is produced by the fore i gn country. Both inputs are produced at a

given constant marginal cost.                We assume that the technology for the

production of the final good i s th at of constant returns to scale, and that

the final product is competiti vel            y   supplied by domestic firms. Throughout

we asue that the demand for the final product is given by a well behaved

downward sloping demand funct ion                 We will denote foreign variables with "*s.

Thus, w and w* are the prices of the inter mediate input s, and z(w,w*) and

z*(w,w*) are their demands.              r and r* are the constant marginal costs of

producing the inputs              0(p) gives the demand for the f inal product as a

function of its own price, p.

        As we assume co nstant returns to scale in the production of the final

good, the unit cost function for the production of the fi nal good is

independent of the 1 evel of output and depends only on in put prices.               It is

also homogeneous of degree one in them. Unit cost is den oted by c(w,w*) and

w/w*    = (..    Of course       c(w,w*) has the usual properties, n amelv,     c (w,w*)
                                                                                 w

a(i.)    and c     w,w*)     =   a*CW), where a and a* are the unit input coefficients.

As usual, subscripts on functions denote partial derivati yes with respect to

the subscripted variable.

    Demand for z consi sts of the product of the amount of z needed to produce

one unit of the final product,                a (>   and the total amount of the final

product produced, D(p ).             Due to the assumption of perfect competi tion in




                                         4
the fin al           product market we know that p                              c(w,w*). Hence:
       (1   }
                                   z(w,w*)      = a(t.J)D(c(w,w*>)                    and

       (2                          z*(w,w*)           a*(W)D(c(w,wn>.
Note th at demand for input s is a derived dem and.                                          Input prices affect demand

through two channels: via the input coeffici ents and via demand for the final

product          which depends upon unit production costs.                                    Profit functions for

domesti c and foreign input 5Uppliers are theref ore given by:

       (3 )                        rT(w,wI)     =

       (4                                       =


            w   *)    an d         B*(w) are the best respons e functions of the domestic and

frei gn         firms.,      to a giver price charged by their                           competitor. They are           def   i red
by the fj rst order condi t                    i or   5:

      (6)                    TT*     (w,B* (w)>            0,
respecti v ely.              Nash equi librium is defined by both (5> and (6> holding, so

that each price charged is a best response to the other.

       It is often thought that if c ompetitic n between firms in vol                                       yes.   choosing
prices and the products are substi tutes for one anoth Cr, then best response

functions must be upwar d                      sloping             One   ece ption to t his can         be fou nd      in
Bulow, Geanakoplos and Kl emperer (1985) who show th a t there i s litt le reason
to   associate a particul ar slope                          of the best          r e sp on   e function 5   wth    a

particular           strategic va r           j able.           It is also usually assumed th at            pro ducts are
substitutes in demand, but the market for intermediate goods can be shown to

provide natural examp les f complementary                                      goods and unusual slopes of the best

response functions.

       In the next sect ions we consider the effects of content protection and show

that this depends on the form of protection, whether inputs are complements or

substitutes, and whether o                            I

                                 3.1 Content Protection


      Content protection policies r equire that a given proportion of domestic

value added, or a given proporti on of domestic c omponents be embodied in the

final product           The policy is enforced by setti ng penalties for non—

compl i ance.        These often t ake the form of tarif fs on imported intermediate

goods, and/or the removal of t ariffs on imports of the final good.

Throug hout we assume that the penalties are suf ficient to deter non—

compl i ance.        Theref or e, we do not need to specify the penalties themsel v   e 5.


We wil 1 first discuss content protection poli cies in g eneral           Then we    will
con si d   er the effects of a content protection scheme sp ecified i n physic al

terms.      Last 1   y we wil 1 consider value added schemes, a s they ar e more

complicated.

       Content protection schemes are means often used by developing countries

attempting to build a manufacturing base, and by developed countri es to

prevent the erosion of such a base in industries threatened by for ei           gn


competition. Taiwan has used such policies in the television and

refrigerator industries, while the U.S. has used them to revitalize its ship

building industry. Canada used them to protect her auto industry before the

Auto Pact.3 Among the more pernicious of such schemes seem to be the

content protection schemes that have been in existence in Australi a for the

auto industry for almost 25 years. These schemes have led to a

proliferation of models unwarranted by technological conditions and market

size and a cost almost double that of imports. For a very amusing and

informative history——see Gregory and Ho (1985). More recently, proposals

have been made to institute domestic content requirements on the automobile




                                      6
industry in the U.S.

        Content protect ion policies have been previously analyzed in the

literature, at both a theoreti cal and empirical level               •        The works of

Wonnacott and Wonnacott (1967 I, rlunk (1969), Johnson (1971), Corden (1971),

PicCulloch arid Johnson        (1973), Grossman (1981) and Mu ssa (1984) are in

particular worth menti oni         rig.   PicCulloch and Johnson p ointed out that a

content protection sch eec is basically a proportional ly distributed quota as

the ability to i mport F orei gn inputs depends on the u s of domestic inputs.

Content protecti on has been f avorably compared to a t arf                       in   Mussa (19E4).

The argument given ther e is t hat while content protec tion distorts the input

mix,    thereby   rai si ng   to sts, c osts rise less than under a tariff that leads

to the same i nput C               This is because foreign iripu t prices do nct rise in

the former ca se.        Mus S a   1984       also analyzes the impi ications for

technol ogi cal    prog res s of suc h scheses. Grcsean (19 1)                points out, acn
other things, that a C ont ent protection scheme which requires a given

proportion of value added to be dsestic, could actua ily reduce domestic

value added in some cases if the importable and domes tic inputs were
                     4
 complementary.

       None of the e>i sting work, to our knowledge, anal y              2   CS   the ef fects o

such schemes in cli gopolistic markets where               the results ar S very          different.

Oligopolistic markets differ froi perfectly competitive mar keto as a content

protection scheme, even one set at the free trade levels, c ar have a

significant impact.           In this they are simila r to instances where a

restriction creates a monopoly, and hence ha s an effect by its very

existence. Ananal ysis of oligopolistic mar kets differs from that of                          a

monopoly, as more t han one firm behaves strategically, and content

protection affects the behavior of all firms                  Hence, the equilibrium,              w h c h


depends on the strategic interactions of all firms, may change in ways which



                                          7
are not possible with a domestic monopoly and foreign competition. For

example, content protection at the free trade level cannot reduce the

domestic input producer's pr ofits if he is a monopolist and the forei gn

input is competitively suppl ied, as argu ed by Mussa (1994). This is because

he always has the choice of charging the free trade price. However, this

argument is not sufficient t o ensure tha t profits of the domestic pr oducer

must rise when the foreign i nput is also supplied under imperfectly

competitive conditions. Thi s is because the equilibrium may involve the

foreign firm charging a diff erent price from that charged under free
         5
trade.




                               B
                      3.2 Content Protection and the Profit Function.

          Consider the effect of a content protection scheme which requires that

the ratio of physical inputs,                    used in producing a unit of output
                        —6
be at least as great as u.                   Physical content protection schemes

might be possible to implement for goods like yarn where different fibers

are combined to produce yarn. We use Diagram 1 to illustrate our arguments.

In it, F(z,z*) = I            traces out the efficient combinations of                 z   and z*
needed to make a unit of final output. The combinations of inputs which

both make a unit of output and give                    > &   is   given by the shaded

area in Diagram I.           If w exceeds (4 in Diagram 1, the content

protection scheme can be seen to be binding, and alw), a'(w) are the

unit input coefficients.             If w is less than            (4,   it   is not binding,'

and unit input choices are the unconstrained ones. The ratio (w) in
                                                                                      a*
the absence of any protection is depicted in Diagram 3 by a downward sloping

curve such as BB' for obvious reasons. The constraint makes this

the line BED.

       We will define the profit function in the presence of a scheme as a

composite of the unconstrained profit function, n(w, w') and the profit

function on the assumption the constraint is binding, ii 1w, w*).                          On the

assumption the constraint is binding, minimized unit costs of production are

given by clw,w*)            wa(w) + w*a*(w).          c(w,w*) exceeds cw,w*), except when
w = w, the point at which the constraint just bites, where it is equal to c(w,w*).

      Let n(w,w*) and n*(w,w*) denote the profit functions for the home and

foreign firms respectively on the assumption that the scheme is binding so that:

    (7)     n(w,w*)     =   (w—r)a(w)D(aU4)w      +   a*(w)w*)     and

    (8)     rv*lw,w*) =     (w*—r*)a*(w)D(a(w)w        +   a*Cw)w*).

             A               A
      Let n(w,w*) and n*(w,w*) be the profit functions of the domestic and




                                         9
foreign firm when the content protection scheme is imposed. The scheme is binding if
                                                                                                                                    A          A

                 Having defined the profit functions, Ti and n*, we need to

                                      Throughout t his section, we will assume that n and n,                                                       n* and n*,

The propert ies of n and n* ca nnot be assumed1 but must be derived from their

exceed IT                         when evaluated at points where the constraint just binds. This is

Ti* it is easy to see that ri                                                             must be concave if ri* and               are concave.9

ifl, and the nonconcavity of n is that the best response function of the foreign

firm must be continuous, while that of the domestic firm need not be. These
                    A
characteristics   of n and ifl help us to characterize the form of the best

responses of each firm in the presence of a content protection scheme. We

turn to this task in what follows.

                           3.3 Content Protection and Best Responses

        Under a content protection scheme 11                                         is       either ii   or n and the switch

between them is made along                                     =    (.3   where they are equal to one another.

This switching between profit functions makes characterization of the best

response functions slightly tricky. First we will derive the best response

associated with n(w,w*}, which we denote by B(w*). Define B(w*) as the

best response function associated with n(w,wt). B(w*) is, as before, the

best response function associated with n(w,w*). B*(w), B*(w) and B*(w)

are defined analogously. B,B* and B,B* are depicted in Diagram 5)0

        As n(w,w*) is made up of segments of 11 and n, and 11                                                 switches from n

to n at (.3 =         w, B must be either B or B or lie along the kink at w W.

However, for B to lie along the kink, n must be upward sloping and 11 must

be downward sloping at the kink. This possibility has been ruled out.

Therefore, B(w*) is either 8(w*) or B(w*). Moreover, Lemma I which follows

characterizes the conditions when it is one or the other.

Lemma 1     Take a given value of w* and let ii

                                                                                              , nw   be evaluated at w =    Un.

        Lemma 1 is obvious once                                it         is   drawn as in Diagram 4 .              fl

Since n*(w,w*) is known to be concave in tfl for a given w, the best response

functi on B*(w) must be continuous. Moreover, B*(w*) can be completely

characteri :ed as follows in Lemma 2.

                                3.4 Eouilibrium with Content Protection

          In order to determine the ef fects of content protection, we need to

characterize t he equilibrium. We are now in a position to do so.                                                         We will

consider the e ffect of restric tions set at the free tra de 1 evels. Since we are

interested i n the effect of a content protection scheme on interactions b et ween

firms, we wi 11 assume that in the absence of any protec ti                                                  on    there are no

asymmetries between the firms and that a unique stable pure strategy equilibrium

exists when 8,8* or                     are the best response functions.                                          We have therefore

assumed tha t B and *               inters ect    only once.         Si   nce there a re no asymmetries

between the firms, and since the rest riction i s set at fr ee trade levels, B

and * must intersect along the W line

          The st ability of the free trade equilibri um ensures that Bw*) lies above

the W line, when ifl < w*N and bel ow it when w * > w* .
                                                                                                N       Therefore, nw must be
positive al ong the W line if w* < WI                            Hence    Ti

and B(w*) m ust lie above the w li ne when w* K                                        .        By arguing analogously
                                                                          wIN
about BCw) and B*(w), it becomes obv ious that the intersection of B(w*) and

(wA,w*A) in Diagram 5.                 We also k now, by our assumpti ons of symmetry, stability

and single intersection of B and 8*, that B(w*) must lie above the w

line when w* <                      and below it whe n w* > w *.

           Now,       if w* cw*N, Leema 1 en sure s that B(w*)                             =    B(w*) since both                ii

for values of w* between WIN and

     Now we turn to the shape of B*(w).                  If w K wNc B*(w) must lie below the

w line    due to the stability assumption we made. Hence, n*                                   along the (4

equal B*(w).     If   w > wA then both                 and TT*     are negative along                        the (4

This is a pci nt where the reac tion function jumps. Recall                             that        B(w*) can only

jump when w* lies between                and w*A.

     Diagram 5 illustrates an equilibrium under the content protection scheme.

The domestic producer randomiz es between the two pri ces                               and w2, whereas the

foreign produ cer sets the price w*1. Although the d omest                        i c      producer's best

response func tion has only one jump here, there is a possib ility that it has

more jumps.     However, since jumps can only occur when w*N ( w* K w*, the price

charged by th e foreign firm in any equilibrium must r ise du e to the content

protection scheme.        Also, if the products are complements, the domestic firm's

profits must fall since the profits along B(w*) in this region are lower than

the forei gn firm's prof its.          The pr oportion of value added domestically, or

domestic input use coul d rise or fa 11 as well.

        Our arguments have allowed us to show that domestic profits rise or fall

due to a phys ical content protection scheme, set at the free trade level,

accordi nq to whet her the products were substi tutes or complements.                                 In doing so,

we used the 4 act that an equilibrium in mixed strategies existed.

Al terna tively   7i t    can be seen to existS in fl iagram 5 by noting that we only

need to show tha t there exists a randomizat ion between w1 and                                   avai lable

it is easy to f md a convex combination of a positive and neqat lye number

        Theorem 1 states our main results for this section:

Theorem 1: The effect of a physical content prot ection scheme                              set at the free

trade level, is to raise domestic profits if the products are substitutes, but

to lower them i + they are complements. Forei gn prices always rise, although

average domesti c prices need not always rise.                        The proportion of value added and

total domestic input use could, likewi se, rise or fall.                                          n

        This result makes some intuitive sense when the effect of content

                                                   "   MI'
protection is dec omposed into the "C",                      and        I" effects previously

mentioned.     If th e restriction is set         at    th e free trade level, there are by

definition no "C" effects.            Irrespecti ye of whet h er products are substitutes or

complements, the home firm wants to raise its price, since content protection

makes the demand funct ion + acing it less elastic for higher prices, although it




                                        16
doesn't alter demand at the free trade equilibri                 urn.


        Hence the "M° effect for the domestic firm               causes w to rise.   This is

represented by the movement from the free trade                  equilibrium to M in Diagram 5.

Notice that profits cannot fall due to the N" effect. The forei gn firm, on the

other hand, doesn't want to change its price from                       and no TMN" effect

operates on it.

        The "I" effect consists of the movement + rom the N point to the new

eq u ii i b r i urn.    Since the restriction makes the foreign firm respond to price

increases by i ncreas ing its price, the intera ction effect tends to raise wi, and
                                                          13
can raise        or    lower w from the N position.            Although the "N" effect raises

the    home firm 's prof i ts, the             I" effect tcwar ds higher foreign prices tends to

lower them if the pro ducts are complements, b ut raise them if the products are

substitutes.            In the latter ca se both N and I effects work in the same dir cc        t i   or

and domestic profits rise.                  In the former cas e, they work in opposite

directions.            Nor eover     the "I" effect dominat es the "N" effect and domestic

profits fall             The ef    fect   on fo reign profits is less clearcut, and it is

possible for foreign profits to rise or fall.

         So far, we have restricted ourselves to an analysis of physical content

protect ion.           In the next section, we build on this in our analysis of value

added content protection.

constraint is binding            even when it really is not, so that the unit input

coefficients are given by a(w,oc) and a'((4u)                                  Thus     c(w,w*,cd   equals

point when the const raint just binds, lowers aW, ) by more than it lowers

a(.'J).          This impi ies that the input demand function under the assumption the

constraint binds is locally more elastic than the unconstrained one.1

Thus, at p oir,ts where the constraint just binds, n(w,w*,c) <

       Using Lemmas 1' and 2', one can show that the equilibriurn must be similar

to that in Section 3.                           The only difference; are that B(w) K     and the

jump in B occurs below                               Therefore, if the product; are mubstitutes,

a value added scheme set at free trade levels lowers the equi librium profits of

the domestic firm.                            If the products are complements, domestic profits rise. The

results of Section 3 are seen to be reversed when a value add ed scheme is

considered and C K 1.                           Notice also the tendency for prices to fall in

equilibrium, as opposed to their tendency to rise when C > 1.                           Diagram 6

illustrates the equilibrium when C K 1.

     When Y < 1, the M" effect on the domestic producer causes him to lower

his price. As the restriction gives the foreign producer an incentive to

lower his price in response to a lower domestic price, foreign price falls.

If the goods are complements this raises domestic profits. Since the M.

effects always raises profits, both M" and JO       effects   work in the same

direction, and domestic profits rise.      If the goods are substitutes, the "I"

effect of lowering foreign prices arid hence domestic profits, works      against
the 'M effect and in fact outweighs it so domestic profits fall. The

effect on foreign profits is again less clear.

     We suinnarize the main results in this section as Theorem 2.

Theorem 2

     The effect of a value added content protection scheme, set at the free

trade level, depends on whether the elasticity of substitution, i,       is   more

or less than one, as well as whether the products are substitutes or

complements.    If O > I foreign prices rise,and if the products are

substitutes, domestic profits rise, while if they are complements, domestic

profits fall.    If iT <   1, foreign prices fall, and if the products are

substitutes, domestic profits fall, but they rise if the products are

complements. As before, average domestic prices, foreign profits, and

domestic input use could rise or fail.

        In th is section we extend our model to allow for the presenc e of an

additional competiti vely suppli ed domestic input s uch as labor.                            Our purpose

is twofold.           First, to allow some insight into how the addition of another

factor affects our earl ier results.                   Sec on d,   to analyze the possib le conflicts

of interest th at might arise bet ween 1 abor and producers, and how these differ

from the case where the foreign input is compet itvely sup p1                           ied   We consider

the effects of          ph y si cal   content protecti on.

        The impor tant fact or to mod el is the pos sibility of substitution between

the competitiv ely suppl ied input a nd t he two others. This is done by assuming
                  *
that    z and z        produce a composi t e inte reedi at e input :, so that x = 0 (z, 2*).

c(w, w*) is it s price.               x, and I abor, L, toge ther produce the final g ood, V

and V =       F(G(z,    2*),   L).     Both x and t he final good are produced accor ding to a

input requi r ements of L and x need ed to make a unit of the final good                            w h en



input prices of L and x are q and c.                    Define T(q, c(w, w*)) to be the unit

cost of production, which equals p, the price of the final good.

Of course,

        T(q, c(w, w*) =          cf(q/c)   +    qb(q/c).
Thus:

        n(w, w*) = (w—r) a(w)f(q/c) D(T(q,c)) and

        r*(w, w*) =        (w*_r*)a*(W)f(q/c)D(T(q,c))
        Labor is completely supplied with elasticity X.                        Hence,

        The ef fect of an increase in c on the equilibrium price of labor

depends on the sign of Y—c). This is because increases in c both lower

        Physical content protection                             as before, changes the uni t inputs used in

production of x to a and a* when the constraint is binding.                                  It is also

binding in the same region as previously. The key feature needed for the

where the constraint just binds. As before, the only difference between

TT       and n is that a change in w changes a but not a.                               Now since neither the
    w           is



responsiveness of n to q and c, nor the responsiveness of q to c and c to w

is affected by this differential responsiveness of a and a to changes in

is,      this   feature must carry over, and all the results in Section 3 go through

when interpreted in terms of inputs being substitutes or complements                                      in

The pattern of winners and losers is            ther efore         different in the two market

indicates that there will be no incent i ye to lobby for cbntent protection in

the elasticities of substitution, as            it       1   eads to cut throat competition and

                                            CONCLUSION


        Content protection can benefit a country by lowering input prices and

thereby outp ut pr ices if the effect of lower i nput prices outweighs the

effect of di stort ions in inp ut use.            It might also benefit a country by

transfering forei gn profits to domes tic hands, even if inp ut prices rise.

The most fav orabl e case for content protection woul d seem to be made if

input    prices fell and profit s rose, which is p ossi b le. Ho wever, even in

this case, s i     nce     is small, the inc rease in c ost     S   due to distortions in

input use is      uk ely    to be lar ge and the price     of   th e final product could


well rise.       The likelihood of wel far e improvements through such policies

does rot see my ery great. If domesti c producers and labor are                thought of as

lobbying for      pr   otection in t he hope of higher profit level s, our analysis

rakes    it   cle ar that they would not always wish to lobby for them, even if they

are not set at unduly restricti ye          1   evel s.


        The ba sic idea we have foc used upon in this paper is that cont ent

protection in an oligopolistic world changes the environment in whi ch fi ras

compete, an ds o affects their strategy. We have used a simple mode 1 to obtain

some intuit ion about the natur e and determinants of these changes.                 Our


results sug ges t that substitut ion possibilities b etween inputs and the

responsiven ass of final demand to price determine in a fairly compi icated

manner the      ef f   ects of such pro tection. These impi ications differ signficantiy

from those der ived from models of other market structures.

        We do hay e some ideas con cerning future work along our lines.              Firstly,

different oligopoly models are notoriously prone to give different results and
                                                                                     18
it would be interesting to see what such changes in the model yield •                       We

choose to model the game as a price game in this paper because the effect of

protection      on input     demand by firms producing the final product is clearcut in




                                       28
such games.

     Secondly, we only consider symmetric situations. We have no doubt that

pure strategy   equi 1 ibri a    can ex ist in non —symmetr i c situations, and that

practically an y result d esi red can be obt ained by incorporating the

appropri ate asymmetr y.        However, this is precisely why we only allowed

asymmetries that an se due to the           + or   mo +   the prot ection itself. One

asymmetry wh ich seem Si nteresti ng is the one which results from changi ng the

level of the constra i   nt     from the free tr ade level          This tends to incr ease the

extent of th e "C" ef fec ts and th eref 0 re affects t he extent of "M" and

effects. We would 1 ike to under stand su ch intera ctions better.

     Finally    althou gh we have a nal      yt ed    the effects of content protection

policies, we would 1 ike to point out the principle behi nd our analysis is a

much broader one, with many other applications.

1. However, it is conceivable that new equilibria could be created.

2. The demands for intermediate goods can be like those for complementary final
goods, although the inputs are themselves substitutable in production. This
is because the demand for intermediate good S is a derived demand. While an
increase in one inputs prices causes subst itution away from it, and hence an
increase in demand for the other input it also lo wers the demand for the
other input as the cost of production of th e final good rises. I his increase
in cost rai ses the price of the final good and low ers its demand, which
reduces bot h input demands. Thus1 the el ast icities of demand for the final
good , and f substitution in product ion, a-, are important in de termini ng
whether mt ermediate good demands are compl emen t 5 or substitutes. They are
substitutes if a- — e > 0 and complements if a-

proof.
     Best response functions could be upward or downward sloping. In the case
where 0 and e are constants, an examination of the second derivatives TT     and
                                                                         ww*
      shows that they have t he same sign as (7—E:) (7—1) about the Nash
 ww*
equilibrium. This therefore gives the sign of the slope of the best response
functions, as long as second order conditions hold. However, a case thought of
as possible "a priori" — nam ely ii    >  0, and TI     <  0, (7< 1, and < a) is

not possible in the CESICED case. This can be seen by noticing that in this
case the elasticity of z wit h respect to w is always less than 1. Hence, no
interior maximum to profits exists.

3. See Johnson (1963).

4. In his paper complementarity is defined by the marginal product rising with
the use of the other input. This is always true if there are only two
inputs and constant returns to scale.

5. The point that interaction effects can change equilibrium in surprising ways
has been made by Krishna (1934) in her analysis of voluntary export
restrictions and tariff —quota non equivalence under oligopoly. Our analysis
is based on her work.

6.  We assume throughout that the penalty for non—compliance is so great that
compliance is ensured. Therefore, the actual penalty is irrelevant.

7. Notice that the preceding would be true even if the constraint was set in
terms of using at least a to produce a unit of output.

B. It is also easy to verify that n(w,w*) < n(w,w*) if w<4*, but that the
reverse is not necessarily so when w>(.*.

9. The proof consists of showing that 11*is the minimum of two concave
functions and therefore concave. These functions are n* and a function which
is n* for w* below W/w and the tangent plane to r* at ..J/w for w* above
.J/w.


10. B and * are downward sloping as long as El is not too convex. They are
positively sloped if D is convex enough as in the constant elasticity case.

on this pictoral representation and we say more about this later on.

11. It would be incorrect to define B(w*) to be B(w*) whenever n(B(wt) ,w*)
exceeds n(B(w*) ,w*) , but to be B(w*) if the reverse is true, a nd to be
both B and B if the two prof it levels_aLe equal. This is due to the —
possibility that n(B(w*),w*) exceeds rUB (w*),w*     but B (w*) exceeds tan.
In this event, B(w*} = B(w')     For this to occur both nil, must exceed

zero along w = w.

12. See Dasgupta and Maskin (1982).

13. Noti ce that the restriction has changed the nature of interactions between
firms.   Irrespective of whether best response functions are upward or downward
sloping in the absence of the restriction, it becomes optimal for the foreign
firm to raise price in response to price increases.

14. Formally, a*(c41u) will be defined by F;a*(W,cd d (cx, (4) b        = 1,
and a(w,cx) =d(w,cx)a*(w,cd where d(L) = =                 If Ll>J
these are the cost minimizing input coefficients. If (4< (4, the constraint
is not binding, so the cost minimizing inputs wil 1 be a(W) and a*U$).
However, we will define c(w,w',cd as being equal to wa(W,cx) + w*a*(W,cx)

15. Another way of seeing how z (w,w*,cd and z (w,fl) differ is to notice
that the only difference between them lie in he differing response of afta)
and a(w, cx) to changes in w for a fixed w           If C>1, an in cr ease in w lowers
a(t4, cx) by le ss than it lowers a(w) so that z is less elasti c than z.
Also, as the constraint binds for hig h w's the input d e sand function is made
less elastic for input price i nr ease s so that profit maxim i 1ation requires
    _________ i n w. Similar'y, z
an increase                             is a lso less elastic than z but as the
constraint bi nds for low w           there is no incentive to change price on the
part of the f oreign producer.        If C    1, an increase in w makes a(W,cx)
fall by more    than a(W)  and z  i s  more  elastic than z. However, as the
constraint bi nds for low w, lowering price is profitable for the gomestic
poducer. As the cons trant binds on the foreign firm for high w , and as
z   is more elastic than z       there is no reason for the foreign firm to
change its price.

16. This is not possible in the CES—CED example mentioned earlier, as 1>C>e was
not consistent with a bounded profit function.

17. This uses the facts that a = TrIr,*        and 0 = n*0*.        Also, for the
          a    —a           0
                               = 1—a                               1—a

for 0, 0*, q, i)*      interms of a and C , using the previous equalities,
gives r =   aI(l+C),    n* = ciC/(1+C), 0= C/(l+C) and 0* = lI(l+C).
Adapting these results when Y             F(C(Z,Z*) L) gives the next equation
                                                                                  lci

where c     c(w,w*), the unit cost of making the composite input, and q
is the price of labor. If          is the elasticity of substitution between
the composite input and labor, then            =   I(l-4),    flf

            and 0 = 11(1-4).       These relations are used later on as well.
