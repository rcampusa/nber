We use the implementation of a new prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient rehabilitation
facilities (IRFs) to investigate the effect of changes in marginal and average reimbursement on costs.
The results show that the IRF PPS led to a significant decline in costs and length of stay. Changes
in marginal reimbursement associated with the move from a cost based system to a PPS led to a 7
to 11% reduction in costs. The elasticity of costs with respect average reimbursement ranged from
0.26 to 0.34. Finally, the IRF PPS had little or no impact on costs in other sites of care, mortality, or
the rate of return to community residence.

       INTRODUCTION

       Between 1988 and 1997, post-acute care was the fastest growing category of

Medicare spending with an average annual growth rate of 25% (MedPAC, 2003). The

Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and subsequent Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999

attempted to control the rising spending and costs by shifting payments to providers from a

cost basis to prospective payment systems (PPSs). However, the switch to a prospective

payment system has two potential, and possibly competing, effects on costs. First, the switch

to prospective payment reduces marginal reimbursement for additional services thereby

creating incentives to reduce costs. Second, and perhaps a less appreciated fact, is that a

switch to prospective payment could also affect the average reimbursement that a facility

receives. An increase in average reimbursement levels could in principle lead to an increase

in costs (Hogkin and McGuire, 1994). Therefore, it is uncertain whether a switch to

prospective payment that reduces marginal reimbursement but increases average

reimbursement would result in cost savings

       Under a prospective payment system that leads to cost savings, the approach chosen

by providers to reduce costs could have implications for health outcomes. In particular, cost

savings that are achieved by reducing the amount of beneficial care provided might increase

the risk of adverse health outcomes (Cutler, 1995; Shen, 2003). Prospective payment-induced

reductions in beneficial care could also have spillover effects for providers in other settings;

for example, patients who are discharged “too early” due to prospective payment and suffer

adverse health outcomes might end up obtaining additional care from providers in other

settings. On the other hand, providers that respond to prospective payment by providing




                                                                                                   3
care more efficiently could generate savings without affecting health outcomes and costs of

care in other settings.

        In this study, we examine the impact of the inpatient rehabilitation facility

prospective payment system (IRF PPS) on the costs of care and length of stay in inpatient

rehabilitation facilities (IRFs). The IRF PPS changed payments in two fundamental ways.

First, it switched the payments from a cost-based system to a prospective payment system.

Second, although the IRF PPS was intended to be budget neutral, we find evidence that in

practice it significantly increased the average reimbursement received by IRFs. To

disentangle the impact of changes in marginal and average reimbursement, we take

advantage of the timing of the IRF PPS and of the fact that different IRFs experienced widely

divergent degrees of changes in average reimbursement under the new payment system,

depending on the payment levels they received in the pre-PPS period. We also examine

whether the IRF PPS had spillover effects on the use of other post-acute and acute care

providers, and whether it affected health outcomes including return to community residence

and mortality after an IRF stay.

        We find that the implementation of the IRF PPS was associated with a decline in

resource use (both costs and length of stay) for patients receiving inpatient rehabilitation

following a stroke, hip fracture, or lower extremity joint replacement. We also find strong

evidence that both marginal and average reimbursement matter. Finally, we find no evidence

of spillover effects on providers in other settings or adverse health outcomes for patients.

        The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. First we describe the key features of the

IRF PPS. Next, we briefly discuss the anticipated effects of changes in marginal and average




                                                                                               4
reimbursement associated with the IRF PPS. We then describe our data and empirical

strategy. The last two sections present the results and conclusions.



THE IRF PPS

        Prior to the implementation of the IRF PPS, IRFs were paid on a cost basis up to a per

patient limit that varied substantially across facilities and was based on each facility’s

historical costs (Chan et al., 1997). The facility-specific limits were determined by

calculating average costs per patient during each IRF’s base year of operation: facilities

opening after this rule went into effect had incentives to inflate their costs during their initial

period of operation and thus had higher payment limits than older facilities. Various

attempts were made to bound the payment limits, for example by imposing caps, but facilities

were still able to petition to have these caps waived (CMS, 2002). Accordingly, there was

wide variation in payment limits: as we describe below, in 2001 approximately a third of

IRFs had payment limits below $13,000 per patient while the top third had limits above

$17,000. The cap in the final year of TEFRA was set at just under $22,000, and 16 IRFs

successfully made a case to have payment adjustments made that exceeded this cap.

        Under the IRF PPS, IRFs receive a prospective payment for each patient. Patients are

assigned to a CMG based on their rehabilitation impairment (e.g., stroke, hip fracture, joint

replacement, etc.), comorbidities, functional status and length of stay, and each CMG has a

payment weight based on the expected resource use for patients in that category. The

payment for a patient depends on the patient’s CMG and on facility characteristics such as

rural location and percentage of low-income patients (CMS, 2001; Carter et al., 2004). A




                                                                                                  5
national conversion factor is used to obtain the dollar amount of the payment. There is also

an outlier payment system, but it is designed to affect only three percent of payments.

       Beginning in January 2002, all IRFs were required to start administering the IRF

Patient Assessment Instrument (IRF PAI), which is used to assess functional status for the

purpose of CMG assignment. However, each IRF actually transitioned to the IRF PPS at the

beginning of its fiscal year, which could occur any time during the 2002 calendar year. Thus

some IRFs had more time to anticipate and plan for the transition to the IRF PPS. In

summary, all facilities expected a virtual elimination of marginal reimbursement following

the implementation of the IRF PPS in January 2002. However, the effects of the IRF PPS on

average reimbursement varied across facilities. Facilities with low pre-PPS annual payment

limits expected the highest increase in average reimbursement and facilities with high pre-

PPS annual payment limits expected little or no change in average reimbursement.



EXPECTED IMPACT OF THE IRF PPS

Changes in both marginal and average reimbursement could have significant effects on

provider behavior. Hodgkin and McGuire (1994) develop a model of how hospitals’ intensity

of treatment responds to changes in average and marginal reimbursement. Increasing

intensity of treatment (akin to increases in quality of care) attracts new patients to the

hospital but also increases the marginal costs of providing care. They consider two types of

hospitals -- a pure profit-maximizer and a hospital that derives utility from both profits and

intensity of care. They show that whether or not a hospital is a pure profit-maximizer, it

responds to increase in marginal and average payment by increasing the intensity of care.

The intuition is that increasing average reimbursement increases intensity because hospitals




                                                                                                 6
want to attract and admit profitable new patients. Similarly, increasing marginal

reimbursement makes increases in intensity less costly as hospitals recover some of the costs

with increased payments. Ellis and McGuire (1996) show that in addition to changing the

intensity of treatment hospitals might also change the severity or type of patients they see

(selection effect). The changes in treatment intensity could also affect patient outcomes and

have spillover effects on providers who provide similar services. For example, patients

discharged “too early” due to payment change at a particular provider might be at higher risk

of suffering adverse health outcomes and also might end up obtaining care from providers in

other settings who provide similar services. Again, however, providers could respond to

prospective payment by providing care more efficiently and thus not affect health outcomes

or costs of care in other settings.

        Several papers have estimated the impact of changes in reimbursement such as the

switch to acute care PPS in 1983 on hospital costs and selection (See Frank and McGuire,

2000 for a review). However, the health economics literature on the impact of PPS on

patient outcomes is more limited (some prominent exceptions are Staiger and Gaumer, 1992;

Cutler, 1995; Shen, 2003). Finally, we know of no study that evaluated the spillover effects

of payment system changes on providers in other settings.

        This study adds to this literature by disentangling the impact of changes in average

and marginal reimbursement for inpatient rehabilitation care. We evaluate the impact of

changes in average and marginal payments on intensity of care (costs and length of stay per

episode), patient characteristics, patient outcomes (mortality and return to community

residence) and spillover effects for acute care and other post acute care providers. Based on

the above literature we hypothesize that the impact of the implementation of the IRF PPS




                                                                                                7
would depend on how the IRF PPS affected the average and marginal reimbursement for

each facility. The decrease in marginal reimbursement after the implementation of the IRF

PPS would tend to reduce costs of IRF care and also might increase adverse health outcomes

and the amount of services consumed after IRF care. This change in IRF costs, outcomes and

amount of post IRF care services would be mitigated by an increase in average

reimbursement. In other words, the decreases in IRF costs and increase in adverse health

outcomes and post-IRF costs would be greatest for IRFs that experienced the least increase in

average reimbursement under the IRF PPS and smallest for IRFs that experienced the

greatest increase in average reimbursement.



METHODS

Data and Study Sample

        We examined episodes of IRF care for three groups of Medicare patients discharged

from acute care hospitals between January 1, 2001 and June 30, 2003 and admitted to IRFs

within 30 days of their acute care discharge: stroke patients; hip fracture patients; and lower

extremity joint replacement patients. These 3 impairments account for roughly half of

admissions to IRFs and represent the 3 largest groups of patients using inpatient

rehabilitation.

        We used a 100% sample of Medicare acute care hospital claims for the study period

to identify stroke patients as those with a principal diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage

(diagnosis code 431.xx), occlusion and stenosis of precerebral arteries with infarction

(433.x1), occlusion of cerebral arteries with infarction (434.x1), or acute but ill-defined

cerebrovascular disease (436.xx). We identified hip fracture patients using principal




                                                                                                  8
diagnoses of fractures of the neck of the femur (820.xx). Hip fracture patients whose

fractures could be due to bone metastases or who suffered major trauma to a site other than a

lower extremity were excluded. We identified lower extremity joint replacement patients

using the diagnosis related groups for joint replacement procedures, but excluding patients

classified above as hip fracture patients and those with reattachment procedures (procedure

codes 84.26, 84.27 and 84.28.)

        We then linked a 100% sample of Medicare cost report, enrollment and claims data

for acute care hospitals, IRFs, skilled nursing facilities and home health care so we could

identify patients who used inpatient rehabilitation; construct episodes of IRF care (see

below); and assess costs, length of stay, and Medicare payments for services used in acute

and post-acute care settings during an episode.1 We also linked these data with the

Minimum Data Set (MDS) data on the universe of nursing home stays to ascertain whether

each study patient was in a custodial nursing home before or at the end of the IRF episode.

        We excluded a small fraction of patients from our analyses. Patients who died in the

acute care hospital or within 30 days of hospital discharge were dropped since their use of

post-acute care was effectively truncated. We also dropped patients admitted to IRFs that did

not treat any patients in the pre-PPS period (i.e., 2001), patients who were residents of

nursing homes prior to their acute admission since they would not be expected to return to

community residence, and patients for whom Medicare was not the primary payer for their

acute care stay since we likely lacked complete information on their use of care.

        The final analysis sample consisted of 108,692 patients with episodes of IRF care

following a stroke; 92,142 following a hip fracture; and 229,705 following a lower extremity

joint replacement. These patients were admitted to 1,145 different IRFs; 38% of these IRFs

transitioned to the IRF PPS in the first quarter of 2002, 9% in the second quarter, 37% in the

third quarter, and 16% in the fourth quarter.

Episodes of IRF Care and Study Outcomes

        For each patient in the study sample, we constructed an episode of IRF care that

began with admission to an IRF facility and ended 60 days after admission to IRF. (The

results were qualitatively similar with episodes of 90 days.) We obtained the costs of the

initial IRF stay in each episode as follows. First, we used claims data to determine the

charges incurred in each department within the IRF. Next, we estimated the costs incurred

by multiplying the charges for each department by the cost-to-charge ratio for the

department, obtained from Medicare cost reports and then summed the departmental costs to

obtain total costs. We also used claims data to obtain the length of the initial IRF stay in

each episode. Details of the cost calculation are available in Carter et al. (2002).

        We also calculated Medicare payments for each IRF stay. For stays in 2001 (the pre-

PPS period), we calculated payments by multiplying the cost of the episode by a facility-

specific payment-to-cost ratio, estimated using data on costs and Medicare payments from

the cost reports. Payments for stays under the IRF PPS were determined by using the IRF

PPS rules to simulate payments. Specifically, we classified each IRF patient into a CMG

based on their impairment group and functional status reported at admission to the IRF, used

the payment weight for each CMG and the published conversion factor to calculate the base

payment, multiplied the base payment by a facility-level adjustment based on the

characteristics of the IRF, and adjusted payments for unusual cases including short stay

transfers and outliers (Carter et al., 2002).




                                                                                               10
        For each 60-day IRF episode, we used claims to calculate Medicare payments for care

received in other settings including readmissions to acute care hospitals, SNFs, long-term

care hospitals, and home health care.

        Finally, we used the Medicare and MDS data to identify each patient’s clinical

outcome at the end of the IRF episode, i.e., 60 days after admission to IRF. We classified

patients into two categories: (1) returning to the community (i.e., alive and receiving no

institutional care) or (2) dead or institutionalized (i.e. staying in an acute care hospital or

post-acute care facility (IRF, SNF, or long-term care hospital), staying in a custodial nursing

home, or dead).

Empirical Methods

        For all analyses, we defined the pre-PPS period as the four calendar quarters from

January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2001 and the post-PPS period as the 10 quarters from

January 1, 2002 through June 30, 2003. In several analyses, we also classified IRFs into one

of three mutually exclusive categories, with a roughly equal number of facilities in each

category, based on their annual payment limit in pre-PPS period: payment limit less than

$13,000; payment limit between $13,000 and $16,999; and payment limit greater than or

equal to $17,000. Facilities in the lowest pre-PPS payment category experienced the highest

increase in average reimbursement as a result of the PPS.

        We conducted descriptive analyses to compare costs, length of stay and payments for

IRF care in the pre-PPS and post-PPS periods. We also estimated two different sets of

multivariate regression models to examine changes in the level and rate of growth of costs

and length of stay between the pre-PPS and post-PPS periods. The multivariate analyses

allow us to examine the drivers of changes in costs and length of stay while controlling for




                                                                                                  11
patient and IRF characteristics. To account for the skewed distributions of costs and length of

stay, we logarithmically transformed these variables for the analyses. We conducted separate

analyses for each tracer condition (hip fracture, joint replacement and stroke).

         In the first set of regression models, we examined the percentage change in average

IRF costs (or length of stay) between the pre-PPS and post-PPS period controlling for patient

and IRF characteristics and a pre-existing quarterly time trend. Thus, in these models the key

independent variable was an indicator variable for the post-PPS period, and the coefficient on

this variable measures the percentage change in costs (or length of stay) between the pre-PPS

and post-PPS period.2 Using the three categories of facilities that we defined based on pre-

PPS payment limits (see above), we tested whether decreases in costs and length of stay

following implementation of the IRF PPS were greatest for IRFs that experienced the lowest

increase in average reimbursement under the PPS and smallest for IRFs that experienced the

highest increase in average reimbursement.

         In the second set of regression models, we use instrumental variables (IV) estimation

to disentangle the impact of changes in average and marginal reimbursement on costs. We

estimate the following IV model using two-stage least squares.

              Log ( AveragePayment ) = α + δ PPS * PPS + δ pre * paylimit * PPS + δ * X + θ f + η (1)


         2
            The analysis described above measured the impact of the IRF PPS on cost (or length of stay) by
allowing for a break in the level of costs in the first quarter of 2002. We tested the robustness of our results by
estimating models that assessed changes in growth rates and levels at two time points: (1) the first quarter of
2002, when all IRFs began administering the IRF PAI and could anticipate transitioning to the IRF PPS, and (2)
the beginning of the fiscal year for each facility, when the IRF PPS was actually in effect. The results of this
more complex model were similar to the results from the simpler model reported in the paper. In particular,
consistent with the results reported in the paper, we found statistically significant declines in the levels and
growth of costs for patients in all 3 study impairments. Moreover, most of the decrease in costs was
“anticipatory” in that it occurred in the first quarter of 2002. This “anticipatory” decline is costs is also
confirmed by Figures 1 and 2 which show a substantial and immediate dip in the level of costs and length of
stay in first quarter of 2002. Complete results from this more complex specification are omitted in the interest of
brevity.




                                                                                                                12

where, AveragePayment measures average reimbursement; PPS is an indicator variable

indicating whether the data are from the post-PPS period; paylimit is the pre-PPS payment

limit; X is a vector of covariates that includes a linear time trend and patient characteristics

(described in detail later); and Y is the outcome of interest (log costs). θ f and λ f are facility

fixed effects; they control for any systematic differences across IRFs including their pre-PPS

payment limits and other facility-specific characteristics.

        Several points are noteworthy. First, following the implementation of the IRF PPS all

facilities experienced an arguably exogenous and identical change in marginal

reimbursement; specifically, marginal reimbursement was driven down to zero as all

facilities were paid prospectively following the IRF PPS. Therefore, β PPS identifies the

causal effect of reducing marginal reimbursement to zero. In addition, following the IRF

PPS all facilities also experienced a change in average reimbursement. However, the

magnitude of the change in average reimbursement was not identical across facilities; rather,

it depended on the pre-PPS payment limit. Thus, paylimit * PPS is a valid instrument for

average payment as it is driven by exogenous changes in average reimbursement introduced

by the IRF PPS and it is a strong predictor of average reimbursement (as we’ll show in the

results). Therefore, β avg measures the elasticity of costs or length of stay with respect to

average reimbursement. Finally, note that the above model includes facility level fixed

effects and a rich set of demographic and patient characteristics that we describe next.

        The individual or patient level covariates in the regression models included the

patient’s age, gender, race, and location of residence (categorized as a metropolitan county, a




                                                                                                   13
county adjacent to a metropolitan area, or county not adjacent to a metropolitan area). The

models also included a large set of clinical variables tailored to our stroke, hip fracture, and

joint replacement patients intended to control for the severity of each patient at discharge

from the acute care hospital. The clinical variables included the following 13 chronic

comorbidities: primary cancer with poor prognosis, metastatic cancer, chronic pulmonary

disease, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, severe

chronic liver disease, diabetes mellitus with and without end-organ damage, chronic renal

failure, nutritional deficiencies, dementia, and functional impairment (Iezzoni et al., 1994;

Buntin et al., 2005)

       The clinical variables also included 21 types of complications that were likely to have

arisen during the acute stay, be important for a Medicare population, and have a continued

effect after acute care discharge: pulmonary compromise; post-operative gastrointestinal

hemorrhage; cellulitis or decubitus ulcer; septicemia; pneumonia; mechanical complications

due to a device; implant, or graft; shock or cardiorespiratory arrest in the hospital; post-

operative acute myocardial infarction (AMI); post-operative cardiac abnormalities other than

AMI; post-operative derangement; coma; procedure-related perforation or laceration; venous

thrombosis and pulmonary embolism; wound infection; acute renal failure; delirium; sentinel

events; iatrogenic complications; stroke (for joint replacement and hip fracture patients only);

hip fracture (for stroke patients only); and other miscellaneous complications (Iezzoni et al.,

1994; Buntin et al., 2005).

       We also created several condition-specific clinical variables. For hip fracture and

joint replacement patients, we created indicators of the type of surgical procedure the patient

received. Hip fracture patients were classified as having no surgery, internal fixation, a




                                                                                                14
partial or total hip replacement, and/or a revision of a previous joint replacement. We also

classified the location of the fracture. For joint replacement patients, we created indicators

for hip or knee replacement, and for whether the patient received multiple replacements. For

stroke patients, we created indicators for hemorrhagic stroke and for variants of ischemic

stroke.

          Finally, the regression models included an indicator for each IRF (i.e., a facility

“fixed effect”) to control for both measured and unmeasured facility characteristics.



                                             RESULTS

Descriptive Data

          There was a substantial increase in average payments to IRFs, ranging from 18% for

joint replacement patients to 23% for stroke patients, following implementation of the IRF

PPS (p<.01) (Table 1). However, there was variation in the magnitude of increase in average

payments in the pre-PPS period: IRFs with the lowest pre-PPS payment limits experienced

the highest increases in average payments under the IRF PPS, whereas IRFs with the highest

limits experienced the lowest increase in payments. This difference in the change in average

payments was statistically significant (p <0.01) and is consistent with the notion that IRFs

with the highest payment limits experienced the most financial pressure under the IRF PPS.

          Table 2 compares mean costs and length of stay for IRF admissions in the pre-PPS

and post-PPS periods. There was a small but statistically significant increase in costs for

joint replacement and hip fracture patients (p<.01). Mean length of stay for the initial IRF




                                                                                                 15
stay decreased by 5% to 6% for patients with all 3 study impairments (p<.01).3 Finally, the

data show that mean Medicare payments for acute or post acute care after the initial IRF

admission increased by 6% to 9% across the 3 study impairments. There was no statistically

significant change in rates of return to residing in the community 60 days after the initial IRF

admission.

         Table 3 shows a remarkable similarity in the patient population before and after the

IRF PPS. The distribution of IRF patients according to age, gender, race, Medicaid status,

and location of residence did not change significantly after the IRF PPS was implemented.

Moreover, the changes in the clinical variables were minor and did not exhibit any pattern

suggesting a significant change in the severity or complexity of IRF patients.4



Mean IRF Costs and Length of Stay Before and After the IRF PPS

         Figures 1 and 2 show trends in mean costs and length of stay for the period January 1,

2001 through June 30, 2003. The trends in the raw data are striking. As shown in Figures 1

and 2, mean IRF costs and length of stay per patient were rising rapidly in the pre-PPS period

in all IRFs and for all 3 study impairments. However, there was a substantial and immediate

decline in the level of costs and length of stay beginning in the first quarter of 2002 following

the IRF PPS. It also shows that facilities with “low” (< $13,000) pre-PPS payment limits




3
  The sharp decrease in length of stay but negligible increase in costs is most likely explained by rising input
   prices. We estimate that input prices actually increased by 4.8% between the pre-PPS and post-PPS period:
   we calculated the input price increase by using CMS’s quarterly moving averages from Q1:2001 through
   Q2:2003 for the market basket inputs used by inpatient rehabilitation facilities. Since the actual increase in
   payments was lower than 4.8%, and length of stay declined, this suggests that real resource use per discharge
   declined following the implementation of the IRF PPS – a finding also confirmed by multivariate results.

  We also observed a remarkable similarity in patient population before and after IRF PPS even when facilities
   were classified according to their pre-PPS payment limit: payment limit less than $13,000; payment limit
   between $13,000 and $16,999; and payment limit greater than or equal to $17,000.


                                                                                                               16
experienced a smaller decline in costs and length of stay compared to facilities with “high”

(>$17,000) pre-PPS payment limits.

        Table 4 shows the results from the first set of regressions. The results show the

percentage change in IRF costs and lengths of stay after the implementation of the IRF PPS,

adjusted for a pre-existing time trend (constant growth rate), changes in patient

characteristics and changes in characteristics of IRFs, by the pre-PPS payment limit

categories. Notably, IRFs with the lowest pre-PPS limits experienced the smallest decrease

in costs for the initial IRF stay under the IRF PPS. Thus, the mean costs of treating stroke,

hip fracture, and joint replacement patients fell by 6.2% (p<.01), 2.7% (p<.01), and 2.6%

(p<.01), respectively, in IRFs with payment limits less than $13,000 after the IRF PPS was

implemented. By contrast, the costs of treating stroke, hip fracture, and joint replacement

patients fell by 9% (p<0.01), 6.8% (p<0.01), and 6.3% (p< 0.01), respectively, in IRFs with

the highest pre-PPS limits. For all 3 study conditions, the change in costs experienced by

IRFs with the highest payment limit was significantly different (p<.05) from the change in

costs experienced by IRFs with the lowest payment limit.

       The bottom panel of Table 4 presents results from our multivariate analysis of length

of stay. The results are consistent with the cost results and show that length of stay declined

following the implementation of the IRF PPS. The results also confirm our previous finding

of a positive association between changes in payments and costs. Consistent with results for

costs we find that facilities in the lowest payment category (that experienced the highest

increase in payments) experienced the smallest decrease in length of stay. In IRFs with the

lowest payment limits the mean length of stay for stroke, hip fracture, and joint replacement

patients fell by 8% (p<.01), 4.5% (p<.01), and 3.2% (p<.01), respectively, after the IRF PPS



                                                                                                17
was implemented. However, the drop in mean length of stay was even greater in IRFs with

the highest payment limits: 9.8% for stroke (p<.01), 7.5% for hip fracture (p<.01), and 5.6%

for joint replacement (p<.01).

       In summary, the findings from both the raw data and the costs and length of stay

regressions strongly suggest that resource use declined following the implementation of the

IRF PPS and the decline in resource use was lesser in facilities that experienced the highest

increase in average reimbursement. In other words, the results suggest that both marginal and

average reimbursements matter—the elimination of marginal reimbursement (marginal

reimbursement is zero under the IRF PPS) led to a decline in costs and length of stay,

however, this decline in resource use was mitigated by the increase in average reimbursement

following the IRF PPS.

       Table 5 shows the results from the instrumental variable (IV) regressions that

disentangle the impact of changes in average and marginal reimbursement on costs per

discharge. The coefficient on the PPS variable measures the causal effect of reducing

marginal reimbursement to zero. The coefficient on Log(Avg. Payment) measures the

elasticity of costs with respect to average reimbursement or payment. In addition, we report

the first stage F-Statistic for paylimit * PPS .

       The first stage F-statistics reported in Table 5 shows that our instrument is very strong

predictor of changes in average reimbursement. In other words, these results confirm that the

magnitude of the change in average reimbursement following IRF PPS was not identical

across facilities and depended critically on the pre-PPS payment limit. Thus, paylimit * PPS

is a valid instrument for average payment as it is driven by exogenous changes in average




                                                                                             18
reimbursement introduced by the IRF PPS and it is a strong predictor of average

reimbursement.

       The results in Table 5 show that cost per discharge for stroke, hip fracture, and joint

replacement patients fell by 11% (p<.01), 8% (p<.01), and 7% (p<.01), respectively, due to

the decrease in marginal reimbursement following IRF PPS. The table also shows that costs

also respond to changes in average reimbursement – a 100% increase in average

reimbursement for stroke, hip fracture, and joint replacement patients would increase costs

by 26%(p<.01), 34%(p<.01), and 28%(p<.01), respectively.

Spillover Effects and Outcomes

         Mean Medicare payments for acute and post-acute care services received after IRF

discharge increased by 5 to 7 percent after the IRF PPS was implemented for all 3 study

impairments (Table 6). However, there was no clear relationship between IRFs’ annual

payment limits in the pre-PPS period and cost spillovers to other providers. For all 3 study

conditions the change in mean Medicare payments following IRF PPS was not statistically

different between facilities with high (> 17,000) and low (< 13,000) pre-PPS annual payment

limits. These results were conformed in the multivariate analysis that controlled for a pre-

existing time trend, patient characteristics and facility fixed effects (results not shown in

table). In addition, there was no meaningful change in the use of post-IRF care as measured

numbers of days in an acute care or post acute care facility following the initial IRF

admission. Thus, the small increase in post IRF payments following the implementation of

the IRF PPS most likely reflects Medicare’s annual increases in payment rates (to account for

input price inflation) rather than changes in resource use.




                                                                                                19
       Table 6 also shows that the changes in costs and length of stay following the

implementation of the IRF PPS had little or no impact on the rate of return to community 60

days after the initial IRF admission. We also found no changes in mortality rates following

IRF PPS and no evidence of differential impact on outcomes based on a facilities pre-PPS

payment limit. Finally, the results from multivariate analyses of outcomes were consistent

with results in Table 6 (results not presented).

                                           CONCLUSIONS

       We used the implementation of a new prospective payment system for inpatient

rehabilitation facilities to investigate the effect of changes in marginal and average

reimbursement on costs and length of stay. The results show that the IRF PPS led to a

significant decline in costs and length of stay. Changes in marginal reimbursement associated

with the move from a cost based system to a PPS led to a 7 to 11% reduction in costs across

the three conditions that we studied. The elasticity of costs with respect average

reimbursement ranged from 0.26 to 0.34.

       The evidence for a causal effect of the IRF PPS on these outcomes is two-fold. First,

we observed sizable declines in the levels and growth rates of costs and length of stay

directly coinciding with the beginning of the transition to the new payment system in January

2002. Second, the decreases in costs and length of stay were greatest for IRFs that

experienced the smallest increase in average reimbursement under the IRF PPS, and lowest

for IRFs that experienced the most increase in average reimbursement. This is consistent

with more pronounced responses among facilities experiencing the strongest incentives to

curb resource use. In addition, we did not find evidence of a change in the types of patients

receiving inpatient rehabilitation following the implementation of the IRF PPS—a finding




                                                                                                20
supported by another study using more detailed clinical data and measures of functional

status (Carter and Paddock, 2004).

       The reductions in resources devoted to IRF patients raise questions about spillover

effects on other providers and outcomes. However, we found that implementation of the IRF

PPS did not coincide with a change in resource use at other acute and post-acute care

providers during the 60 days following a patient’s admission to an IRF. Moreover, in

contrast to the findings for IRF costs and length of stay, we found no evidence that changes

in Medicare payments to other acute and post acute care providers were related to the degree

of financial pressure faced by IRFs. Finally, we found that the changes in resource use

following the implementation of the IRF PPS had little or no impact on patient outcomes as

measured by mortality rates and rates of return to residence in the community 60 days

following IRF admission. The implication of these findings is that, when given incentives to

do so, IRFs were able to improve their efficiency, producing similar outcomes for similar

patients but using fewer resources and days of care.

       It is important in evaluating these findings to understand the limitations and context

of this study. First, this study examines IRF costs, length of stay, and outcomes for a year-

and-a-half following the implementation of the IRF PPS. The data show a marked decline in

costs following the implementation of the IRF PPS but continued growth thereafter, albeit at

slower rates. It will be important to monitor long-term trends as more data become available.

We also acknowledge that more sensitive measures of functional status or quality of life

might have captured changes in outcomes, but such data are not nationally available.

         Our findings do, however, clearly demonstrate that IRFs responded to both changes

in average and marginal reimbursement associated with the IRF PPS by reducing their costs




                                                                                                21
and length of stay consistent with the level of financial pressure they faced. Fortunately

these changes do not appear to have had adverse consequences in terms of poor health

outcomes or increased costs in other facilities.
