                             SUMMARY



     Given the current corporate tax structure in the U.S., inflation

may have an important impact on the production decisions of firms,

notably the choice of capital durability.

     This paper presents a model of competitive behavior in which

firms may choose the durability of their capital goods. We find that

in the presence of inflation, the taxation of corporate profits may

influence both the choice of asset life and the market value of equity.

In particular, the failure to index depreciation allowances depresses

share values and biases the choice of asset life toward greater dur-

ability.

     Integrating this analysis with the traditional one-sector monetary

growth model, we study the general equilibrium impact of inflation on

such long run characteristics of the economy as output per capita

and the real rate of return received by investors.

I. Introduction

         One of the most important aspects of the one—sector monetary
growth model developed by Tobin (1965) is the analysis of the effect
of inflation on the steady-state          capital intensity and        real   interest

rate. Tobin showed that, by lowering the real return on money, in-

flation makes real capital more attractive as an asset and                   leads   to

capital deepening and       a   lower real rate of return.        By including per-
sonal and    corporate income taxes        in the specification of this model,

Peldstein (1976) has       found   that   the   failure to index   these     taxes   for
inflation   may   also   have a substantial       impact   on the economy s steady—

state    characteristics. One aspect of           the problem which    has    not been

adequately    explored is the effect of inflation           on the production deci-

sions of firms.

         The current structure of the U.S. corporate income tax has the
effect of greatly distorting investment decisions among various assets.
The investment tax credit may be applied to purchases of certain equip-
utent,   but not structures. Even in the absence            of inflation, deprecia-
tion schedules    used for tax purposes         do not mirror   true   economic de-

preciation.1 With  the advent of inflation, this distortion is com-
pounded by the fact that these schedules are based on the original or
"historic" cost and not the replacement cost of the capital being de—
preciated.2
         In the next section, we present a model of competitive firm be-
havior when the durability of capital is subject to choice by the firm.
A steady-state growth path will have two important characteristics when

there is no corporate     taxation. First, firms will evaluate capital

invesents     of d.iffering durability using the same discount rate.
Second, the market va.lue of a firm will exactly equal the reproduction
cost of the capital assets which it owns.
       The results     axe extended in Section III to the case where there
is   a corporate income    tax. In the   presence of inflation, the taxation

of corporate profits may influence both the choice of asset life and
the market value of corporate equity. It turns out that market value
will equal reproduction cost if the tax schedule for asset depreciation
corresponds to true economic depreciation, measured at replacement
cost. The effective tax rate on corporate income will be independent
of the choice of asset life if the depreciation schedule is a linear
combination   of   such "replacement cost depreciation" and inediate ex-
pensing.    When depteciation   allowances mirror capital decay, but are
not   indexed for inflation, share value is depressed and the choice of

asset life is biased toward greater durability,

        In Section IV, we integrate our analysis of the firm     with   the

traditional   one—sector monetary   growth model.    We derive in Section V

the effect of inflation on     the characteristics of   the steady state.

For   the case in which   depreciation   allowances are properly indexed,
an increase   in theinflation rate leads to an increase in capital
durability. The ability of firms to vary asset life causes greater
capital deepening, and a smaller decline in the real rate of return,
than occur in earlier models from an increase in inflation. Additional

analytical results, supported by findings from a nunerical simulation
                                                                          3




in Section VI, indicate that the failure to index depreciation allow-
ances may induce a further shift to the use of more di.rable assets
under inflationary circi.mistances.

II. The Choice of Asset Life
        We consider the steady state of a growing economy with one pro-
duction sector, in which we assume there is perfect competition and
constant returns to scale in production. Firms produce output using
two factors, capital and homogenous labor. The price of new capital
goods at time t is, of course, equal to the price of all "other" goods,
denoted p. The wage rate is w. The rate at which p and w inflate is
denoted ir.   Savings by individuals may take the form of money or firm
equity. The government issues money, which carries a fixed a nominal
return of zero, arid raises the rmirider of its required revenues
through lump sum taxes and the taxation of corporate income.3 The rate
at which equity holders discount nominally measured flows from the firm
is r.
        Capital goods decay exponentially at a constant rate, 6. Rowever,
6 is variable ex ante, and subject to choice by the firm. We assume
that increases in 6 increase the flow of capital services per unit of
time from a unit of capital, such increases being subject to diminish-
ing returns. This flow is represented by the function A (6) (A' > 0,
A" < 0). Gross output is defined by:

(1) G         H(KS,L) ; H, EL? H > 0 ; H, E < 0
where H is homogenous of degree one in its two inputs, labor, L, a-nd

capital services, KS. Let               be the nominal invesent at time t,

and      the   corresponding decay rate chosen by the firm. Then the net

net capital stock remaining from this investsent at time s >                         t   is

                    •      Thus, total capital services at time s are:



                                            -S   (s—t)
(2)     KS         f5 A('S) (I/P)e                       dt

        Corporate profits are taxed at rate r, after the deduction                         of

wages and depreciation allowances. We denote as D(x,S) the deduction
permitted    per dollar of initial invesent for an asset of age x
                                     -
which decays    at rate 5.
        In the model we are nsidering, with no uncertainty or market
imperfections, the firm's objective is the maximization àf the current
wealth of shareholders through the maximization of its own present

value, which is:

where p =       r—lr   is the real discount rate and

is    the    present   value of    depreciation allowances for a unit     of   new

capital which          decays   at rate S.

         Before    simplifying (4), we introduce a concept which will aid in
understanding firm behavior.            of "effective capital" be
                                           Let a unit

that amount of capital which is needed to provide one unit of capital
services per unit time. The size of a unit of effective capital is
          where d is the decay rate of the capital in question.
Similarly, the price of a new unit at time t is:

               =
(6)                Pt1A
         In a steady state, the value of               chosen by firms will be con-
stant over time. Thus,        if we define the net capital stock avaiJ.ale
at    time    t in output units:
                                                                                         6




(7)         =
                 !     (I/p)et5)ds
then capital services at time t are               =             .     Since conditions
(4.1) and    (4.2)    must   hold    for all t, we may   differentiate       them with

respect to t     to   obtain   conditions which also     must       hold.   Substituting

these    back into the original conditions and using (7), we rewrite the
first-order conditiáns (4) (dropping time subscripts):

(8.1)        =   0



(8.2) HK(S)KL) =               c/p


(8.3) HL)K1L) =                w/p


where


(9) c =                      (l-rz)/(1-t)

is the shadow price of capita]., rasured in effective units, referred
to by Jorgenson (1963) as the "user cost of capital." We may interpret
the optimal steady-state production behavior of the firm, outlined in
(8), as having two steps. In the first step, described by equation
(8.1), firms minimize the implicit cost of capital services, c, by
their choice of 5. Once this is done, labor and capital services are
combined to maximize profits, with their marginal revenue products
being equated with their marginal costs.4
         Swan (1970) has studied the problem of firms                 which perform    the

first of the productive steps described above, the creation of capital

services through choice of 6, for the special case in which r =                       0.     In

this situation, (8.1) simplifies to:
                                               I




(10) p+6               —

                            3p   /6

which    is   precisely the condition derived by Swan.

         We    next discuss the        firm    value which results from the optimiza-
tion   process. Substituting             (7), (8), and (9) into (3), we          obtain:




                   00 (1-rz) + tf 0e fL I D(t—s)ds dt
                                    -rt
(11) V           p K


Thus,.   the   ratio   of   firm value to the reproduction cost of its net cap-

ital stock iS5:



(12)     q =      (l—tz) +       (pK) -1rfe -rt
                                             !I5D(t—s)ds             dt


When    there a.re no       corporate taxes,       q   =   1, so that the market value of
a   firm   eçua..ls the replacement        cost of its tangible assets.


III. Taxation and           Depreciation
         With the advent of corporate taxation,                  firm behavior   changes due

to changes       in the capita.].      rental price, c. If we define the firm's

"implicit discount          rate"     to be:
(131 v = (p+) (1—rz)/(l—r)                —




then   it is easily verified that firms behave exactly as they would in a
world without taxation, using v rather than                      as the relevant discount
rate, Since investors still recei a rate of return equal to p, the
effective corporate tax rate may be defined as:

(14)     8   = (v—p)/v

of course, if        t =   0, then =      p   and 8 = 0.       When r > 0, the magnitude

of 8 depends        on the depreciation scheme followed. Further, 8                 may   vary
according         to the rate   of capital decay chosen.

         Suppose that the actual tax            laws allowed a fraction e         of all

capital      to   be expensed,6 with the remaining              capital   allowed true econom-

ic depreciation, measured at current                  replacement    cost. The value of z

for expensed capital is one, since the full                    deduction    is received im-

mediately.         From a   dollar of capital purchased at tine t, the amount

available at time s is                   e    (s—t)
                                                            The value of such capital at
current prices is found by multiplying this term by p. Multiplying
the resulting term by             gives the value of D(s—t,c5) for economic,
replacement-cost depreciation:


(15)     D(st#S) =           se5t)
The    present value of         such   allowances     is:



(16) ZR =
Thus, the total value of z per unit of capital would, in the case with
a fraction e expensed, be:

(17)    Z      =   e +    (1—e)/(p+d)


Substitution       into   (13) gives;


(18) v


The effective tax rate is, therefore:


(19)    8          r(1—e)/(l—Te)


which   is not dependent on 5.                 tax rate varies
                                        The effective            from   zero,
when    full expensing is followed, to r, when e =
        Now,   consider the case where depreciation allowances mirror true
decay of capital, but are measured at original or "historic" cost. The
deduction allowances are:


(20) DH(s_ttS)

The present value of such allowances is:


(21)           =


Substitution       into (13) yields:


(22)    v = /(l—r)          +
                                irrz/(l—r)
                                                                                    .LL)




and, from     (14):



(23)     8=     (tp + lrrzH)/(p +    1rTzH)


We   may observe      two   things. Pirst, if     ir >   0, 8 is greater   than r, the
value of the effective tax rate when the depreciation schedules are
indexed [see (19)]. This extra "tax" may be understood by viewing the
stream   of tax savings       from depreciatiort deductions as coupon receipts
from a nominally       denominated   asset.. In the absence of inflation, this
asset has present value tzE/(l_t), since the tax savings are not,

themselves, subject to taxation.              When the price level increases by

rr, the real value of this asset decreases, since it is not indexed, at

rate ir, which involves a real cost of lrTzHJ(l_r),             which appears   on the

right-hand size of (22), along with            the   real, before—tax, cost of

funds, / (1—v).          importance is the fact that the size of this
                       Of equal

"depreciation asset" and hence its annual loss in value due to infla-
tion, increases with . Thus, d8/d > 0, and the choice of asset dur-
ability is biased toward the choice of long—lived assets with low
values of 5.
       We now consider the effect of corporate taxation on the value of

q, the ratio of a firm's market value to the reproduction cost of its

capital stock.

       When replacement cost economic depreciation is allowed, the

value of q is:
C24)           =
                     (.ltzR)   + (p   K)                                        dt



which, using (7), yields:



(25)    qR—          (l—Tz)
                         R
                            +          —l
                                    oa tpKz
                                  (pK)    QQR
                                                            1.

The    equality between capita.]. reproduction cost and firm value is main-
tained.
        When firms are permitted to expense purchases of capital irmtedi-
ately, z =         1, and the second term on the         right-hand side   of (12)   dis-
appears,    since no capita]. currently           owned by the firm has any deprecia-
tion allowances remining. Thus, q =                   1 —   r. For a scheme in which
firms    may   expense a fraction e of          new purchases,    following   replacement

cost depreciation for the rest, the               value of q is:

(26) q               e(1—r) +    (1—c)     =   1—re



         When allowances are not indexed but otherwise reflect economic
depreciation, q drops below unity with the advent of inflation. The
precise value of q depends on the age structure of a unit of a firm's
capital    stock. The older a unit of capital is, the                lower   the price
level at which its depreciation allowances are computed. This makes
older capita]. less desirable than new capital, which has a price per
unit of    Pt at time t. Thus,             the average valuation per    unit   of firm—
held capita]. must be           lower than     p, and will    decline as the average

age    of the      net   capital stock increases.
                                                                                   12




        In   a steady state, a representative firm           increases   its real in-

vestment at each ment in time at              rate n, the growth    of the labor
force in the economy. Thus, the firm investment                flows at times   t and s
are related by:

(27)               =
                         's" )e5t)
Therefore, the net capital stock at time s is:

(28) K = f(I5/p)e_fl(S_t)e•(S_t)dt                       =   (I/p)/(n+d)

For the case of historic cost depreciation, we may use (20), (21), and
(27) to express q as:

(29)         =           +   (pK) Tfef(I/p)ep5et_5)ds dt
                 l—rzR


Equation (29) may be si1ified with the aid of (28) to yield:

(30)         =               +                       =
                 (l_rzH)         TzHfl_7r/(n++1r)]

which   confirms that q < 1, for ir > 0, and that q decreases as n de-
creases, since the average age of the firm's capital stock increases.
        Thus, even if depreciation allowances do appropriately reflect
economic depreciation, the failure to index such allowances influences
corporate activity in two important ways. First, the effective corpor-
ate tax rate becomes systematically related to the durability of capi-
tal used in production, with a higher rate being assessed on short-
                                                                                  13




lived assets. Second, the market             value of a representative corpora-
tion drops below       the   replacement value of its capital stock. These

two    results will,   in turn,     influence   the characteristics of     the steady
state    growth path of the economy.

IV. Steady—State Behavior
         In this section, we incorporate the foregoing analysis of the
firm into a neoclassical growth model. A complete presentation of the
basic model may be found in Solow (1970).
         In a steady state, gross output may be expressed as a function
of the capital stock, labor in use, and capital decay rate:

(31)             G(KL6)            H(A(6)K,L)

The corresponding value of          net output is      less capital decay:

(32)             F(K,L,5) = G(K,L,6) — 6K


        Since the functions G and F are homogenous of degree one in K
and L, we may divide by L to write each in intensive form:

         G   =   g(k,6)          h(A(6)k)


         N   =   f(k,6)      —   g(k,6) — 5k

        Using (13) and (34),        we may   rewrite the   first-order   conditions
for firm optimization, (3), more conveniently as:
(35.11 f =            k


(35.2) k =

(35.3)        f =


         We   assume that the economy has a population growing at rate n,
with labor supplied inelaztically,8 and that government expenditures
comprise a fixed fraction, y, of net output. These expenditures are
financed, in part, by expanding the money supply at a nominal growth
rate, g. The rest of the required revenue is raised through taxes,
including the corporate income tax. Letting m and T represent real
money balances and taxes per capita, the government budget constraint
is:

(36) yf(k,5) =             gm   +   T



Disposable      income is defined to be gross income, less taxes and             capital
losses in the value of money and equity holdings. Money balances                   de-
cline in value at the           rate     of inflation,   so   that the per capita loss on

money    balances is:

(37)      m
               =    im.                                                             -




Per    capita      losses in the value       of equity could    be calculated directly.

However, there        is   a much       simpler   way. Since the net capital stock must

grow at rate n, gross invesent must satisfy:
                                                                                              15




(38)
          It       (n+cs)Kt


After accounting for new invesent, the real value of equity in the
economy must also       grow    at   rate n:



(39)
          (Vt/p)        n(Vt/pt)

Since new invesents raise firm value by the exact                       amount   of   their

cost, the drop in value of current equity holdings, in per capita terms,
must therefore be:

               =   (n+)k -    nqk    =   [6 +      (l-q)n]k

         Disposable income as defined above is:

(41)


In a steady state, real money balances must                   grow at   rate n. Thus,

g   —   iT = n, and we may    substitute       (36), (37), and     (40) into (41) to
obtain:



(42) d =           (1—,y•)f(k6) + xm     —
                                             n(l—)k

Mote that when there          are no   corporate taxes, or when          depreciation    al-

lowances mirror       true    capital decay valued at current prices, the last

term in (42) drops       out.
         At any    time, real   private wealth, representing equity and money

balances, must grow at rate n                Let     be the fraction of disposable
                                                                                   16




income    saved,   that is, allotted to increases in wealth. Then:


         ,d =      n(m+qk)


The    fraction of their portfolios which individuals            seek to hold in

real    money balances is denoted L/ (1-94. Therefore:

(44) m           Lqk


From (42)—(44), we;get:


(45)     f(k,5)/k =                           + (f—) = aq      + b


In   general, c may be sensitive to the real rate of return, p, and
would    be expected to depend negatively on both              and ir. Thus,   a is a

function    of     and ir. 3y the assumptions stated above, b is fixed.
         Since all gross output is either invested, consumed by the
government, or consumed by the private sector, total private and public
consumption per capita is:

(46) C =         g(k,S)   —
                              (n+t5)k   =   f(k,5)   —   nk

For any particular assumption about the structure of depreciation al-
lowances, equations (12), (13), (35), (45), and (46) comprise a system
of seven equations in eight unknowns: k, p,                   , ,
                                                              w/p,   q, C, and rr.
By dropping (35.3) and substituting (13) into (35.1) and (35.2), we
obtain a system in k, p, S, q, C, arid r. By differentiating this
system with respect to r, we may assess the impact that a change in the
                                                                                       i-


rate of inflation has on the steady-state values of the other five
unknown variables.

V. The Effect of Changes in
           We first consider            the case in which the depreciation schedule is
a   combination of expensing and               replacement   cost economic   depreciation.
Under      this    regime, the system         defined   at the end of the previous sec-

tion reduces to:


(47.1) k = p(l—re)/(l—T)


(47.2)             =    0
             f
(47.3)       f/k    =       aq + b


(47.4) q =             l—re


(47.5) C = f            —       nic


Totally differentiating this system with respect to ir, we obtain:

(48.1)             =    a       •

where:

               =   (L.)                     k)

                               p0
                   qk

The first thing to notice about (48) is that if the liquidity prefer-
ence function, 2. (and hence a), is not dependent on , then the system
is completely insulated from the rate of inflation. In general, as
long as 2. < 0 and 9. < 0 < a , aIT and aQare both less than or equal
          1T


to zero.
      By the definition of net output, we have:


(50    1) f =
(50.2)   f=            h"(]A')2   + h'kA"


(50.3)         =       h"AA1k +
                                                                                    19




In the present case, f 0, so that f,               f, and         are   all nega-

ttve and


(51)      ff —      f       h"h'kA2A"


is   positive. Thus,        <   0.   Since the term (kf'—f) equals      [(Ak)h'-h],
it   is negative by the    assumption that h is convex. It follows          that
     <   0.   Therefore, dk/dlT > 0, d/dr   <   0, and dd/d,r < 0.   Total con—
sumption, C, increases with the increase in the capital-labor ratio
    > n, which is the condition that holds when Ic is below the

value    which would yield a "golden rule" growth path on which C would
be at a maximum.9
          As in earlier models in which the      choice   of asset life was not
considered, inflation induces a desire on the          part   of individuals to
shift their portfolio holdings from money to equity, and this leads to
an increase in the capital-labor ratio and a decline in the real rate
of return. Here, however, the capital deepening is accompanied by a
shift to the use of more durable capital goods. As p            declines,   the
user cost of capital (see (9)] declines proportionally more for
capital with all values of —durab1e capital. Firms alter their
production behavior to take advantage of this tilting of relative
prices.
                   of firms to choose , with the resulting increase in
         The ability

asset durability, leads to a greater increase in Ic, and a smaller de-
crease in p, than would occur if          were fixed. To demonstrate this,
                                                                                       20




we first    observe that if 6 were fixed, then condition (47.2) would no
longer hold, and would be replaced by the equation 6 =                5.   Differen-
tiating the new system with respect to ir, we obtain:


(52.1)                       a          —   a   --

(52.2)                  =    (i1.)f
                               q kk dir
so   that     has been           replaced   by f. It is easy to show that
—
dk      dp d

        dir dir6
         We now   consider the case in which depreciation allowances follow
actual economic depreciation but a.re not indexed. The relevant system
of equations is:

(53.1)                  /(1—r) + 1TzH/(l)


(53.2) f6 =             kir(T'—)   (÷ir)/(++d)2

(53.3)      f/k =        aq+b

(53.4) q =          1    —




(53.5)      C=      f    —   nk


It is difficult to determine without ambiguity the effects of an in-
crease in ir beginning at positive              rates of inflation.   For this pur-
                                                                                           22.




pose,    we present a ni.erica2. simulation                  in the next section. We   con-

sider analytically               the   special case of a change     in r starting at r =    0.
         When   ir =   0,    the steady—state described by (53) is identical to

that    described by (47) when economic              depreciation is followed (e =      0),
so   that we may assess the additional inflationary impact coming from
the    failure to index by comparing results derived from the two sys-
tems. Totally differentiating (53), we obtain:

(54.1)                 (a —
                                     rzA4]

                =1- (p+)

(55)      and
                                                                                           22




                 =
             4        n+6


        As discussed in Section III, the onset of inflation causes q to
drop    below unity because older units of                capital have depreciation al-
lowances     which are          smaller,   in real    terms, than those given for new

capital. Thus the average market value of the capital stock must be

lower than if it were all new capital, or if depreciation allowances

were indexed.

         The remainder of the results depend on the signs                  of    and

Clearly, 13      is   less than or equal            to unity, and may be   negative. How-

ever,   without knowing more about the production function, there is

little more we can              say.   Using the definition of a, and      the   fact that

   <    1, it follows that I4 must be positive if:


(56)         r/(l—c)        —
                                 2;fl/(L)        <p/(n+S)

where    r    and           are the    elasticities of a and      2 with   respect to p.

Since    2./(l+Z.) will be quite small relative to unity (see note 10), con-
dition (56) will hold unless the                   interest elasticity of savings is ex-

ceptionally high. For example, if we ignore the second term on the
left—hand side of (56), and set a = 0.1, p = 0.06, n = 0.02, and d

0.1, the base values used in the following section's simulation, then
(56) will hold as long as n                  <    0.45, a value which is higher than any
empirical     estimates of                 and   much higher than most.
                                                                                23




         Therefore, asswning     >   0,   the failure to index depreciation
allowances leads initially to greater capital deepening resulting from
inflation. This effect is due in part to the drop in q. Since the
capital stock is "cheaper," the same amount of savings buys more of it.
It is even more certain that the lack of replacement cost depreciation
leads to a greater shift to long—lived assets. Not only will the in-
crease likely to occur in dk/dir lead to this, but so will the heavier

effective taxation of short-lived assets, which         introduces   a second

term on the right—hand side of (54.3). Since             is of ambiguous     sign,
we cannot   be   sure of the additional    impact on do/dir.
      We may briefly swnma.rize the result of this        section.    If the

demand   for money is unresponsive to the      rate of inflation,    then   proper

indexing    of depreciation aLLowances completely insulates the economy
from inflation. When liquidity preference does depend on ir, then
d/dir < 0. As in previous analyses, dk/d'ir is positive arid dD/d7r
negative. However, the increase in k is larger, and the decrease in
p smaller, than would be the case were the asset durability fixed.
      When depreciation allowances are not        indexed, the onset of in-

flation will likely lead to even more capital deepening, and a greater
shift to more durable capital, both because of the added increase in
dk/dir, arid because the s'infjtion tax" falls more heavily on short—
lived assets. It is not clear whether these results will still hold
at high levels of inflation. We therefore proceed to a numerical sin—
u.lation.

VI. An Example

         Let gross output be governed by a modified Cobb-Douglas function:


(57)       g(k,5)

In our    earlier    terminology, A(6) =      6           The   equilibrium   conditions

(53) become:


(58.1)                 —
                           6   = /(l—r) +


(58.2)                     —         () c)/(d)2
(58.3)               — 6         aq + b


(58.4) q = 1 — irrd/((+6+ir) (n+6+ir)]

For    simplicity,   we consider the case in which a is            fixed. Note that
a   is the gross capital share and          will be larger than the share of

capital in     net production.
         Reasonable values for the         U.S. economy for the real growth rate,

n, and     rate of corporate taxation, , are 0.02 and 0.4r respec-
         the

tively. Using values for y and of 1/3 and 0.1, and assuming 9. to be
small relative to unity,10 we may use (45) to calculate a and b, ar-
riving   at 0.27 and 0.03, respectively. We choose values for the pro-

duction parameters 8, a, and              which, at   =   0,    yield acceptable re-
sults for 6, the      rate     of capital decay, g, per capita output, and
                                                                                          25




the net ma.rginal product of capital. Christensen and Jorgenson (1969)
have    estimated 6       for the period     1929—1967 in the     U.S. Their estimates
were 0.056       for non—residential structures and. 0.138 for producers'

durab].es.       We therefore      choose   0.10 as the value     for   6 at ir   0. We
also set          equal to 0.10, a value        roughly   in line   with   recent esti-

mates by Feldstein          and Sers (1977). We set per             capita output    at

10,000 dollars. The resulting values of the production parameters are:


         8=       112.47

(59)         =    0.50

         B   =    0.25


Table 1 presents simulation results for steady-state inflation values
ranging between 0 and 0.2. Since capital decays exponentially, we in-
clude half-life as a measure of capital durability. Because a =                       0 in

this    example, proper indexing means that r does not influence the sys-
tem. Thus, the       results       in Table 1 for ir =    0   correspond   to those for

all    values of         for the   case   in which replacement cost depreciation is
allowed.

         For low   values    of    ir, the results corroborate      our previous
findings: q declines, k increases, and 6 declines. Because of the
increase in k, C increases. The net marginal product of capital,

is   virtually unchanged, but p            declines   sharply because of the      increase

in 9 due to the "inflation tax."

       We can see that, once in.flation reaches 10 percent, additional
increases   in ir may not have the same effects; In particular, q begins
to rise again and k falls, along with C. The marginal product of cap-
ital increases, so that ceases to decline. However, the increase in
capital dura.bility continues, with asset life increasing an additional
13.4 percent between inflation rates of 10 and 20 percent.
       One should be hesitant to draw firm conclusions from this simple
example. However, it does illustrate the impact that the failure to
index depreciation allowances can have on the choice of asset life, as
well as other relevant economic variables.

VII. Conclusion
       In this paper, we have introduced the choice of asset life into
the neoclassical monetary growth framework, and have explored how this
choice may be influenced by the structure of depreciation allowances,
                                                                     27




particularly tlie fact that such allowances are generally not indexed
to account for inflation. Our results, summarized in the introduc-
tion, should serve to emphasize the importance of this question.

            3.    We thus do not consider the corporate financing decision
between debt and equity, and the interaction of corporate and personal
capital income taxes on this decision, under inflationary conditions.
Such a       study is quite complex in itself, and well                beyond the scope of
this paper.          A treathent   of   this   question      can   be found in Feldstein,
Green,       and Sheshinskj   (1978).

            4. Since we have assumed constant returns to scale in produc-

tion, equation (8) defines only the optimal                    ratio between capital
services         and labor, and not     the level of        each. Further, (8.2) and
(8.3) may be         solved independently for this ratio, and must              give   the

same       value in   equilibrium.

            5.   Note that q differs from the          marginal increase in firm       value
resulting         from an additional dollar      of investment.  veri-  It is easily
fied that, at an optimum, the latter tmist always equal unity. In the
language         of Tobin and Brainard (1977),         we   are measuring the average
and not the marginal value of "q."

Karberger (1976k for the case in which ir = 0.
