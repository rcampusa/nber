Using data from the NLSY97 we analyze the impact of education on health behaviors, measured by
smoking and heavy drinking. Controlling for health knowledge does not influence the impact of education
on health behaviors, supporting the productive efficiency hypothesis. Although cognition, as measured
by test scores, appears to have an effect on the relationship between education and health behaviors,
this effect disappears once the models control for family fixed effects. Similarly, the impact of education
on smoking and heavy drinking is the same between those with and without a learning disability, suggesting
that cognition is not likely to be a significant factor in explaining the impact of education on health
behaviors.

   I.       Introduction

         Schooling impacts health outcomes. More educated people are healthier than the less

educated (Grossman 2006, 2008). This positive relationship between education and health is

robust whether one analyses aggregates (e.g. mortality or morbidity rates), or micro units (e.g.

individuals’ self-reported health status, or sick days).

         If the effect of education on health is causal, then the impact of education on individual

well-being is pronounced. For example, it is well-established that education raises wages (Card,

2000). It is also documented that an improvement in health is associated with increased labor

productivity, and that an improvement in health outcomes of a given generation produces an

improvement in health of their offspring (see Currie, 2011 and the literature she cites). This

means that an increase in education not only has a direct positive impact on the earnings of the

individual, but it also has an additional effect on productivity and earnings through an

improvement in health. These increases in earnings improve the well-being of the individual in

addition to the increase in utility generated by enhanced health. Improved education and health

also have an impact on the level of education and health of the individual’s children, transmitting

the benefit of enhanced education to the second generation (Currie and Moretti, 2003; Sacerdote,

2002).

         In standard models of health production, schooling has a causal impact on health because

schooling increases the efficiency of health production (Grossman 1972, 1975). An alternative

hypothesis, which is also consistent with the observed positive relationship between schooling

and health, is that of the allocative efficiency. According to this hypothesis, more educated



                                                  1
individuals choose input allocations that produce more output (better health) than those who

have less education (see Rosenzweig and Schultz 1982, and the papers discussed in Grossman

2006). Under allocative efficiency, education expands individuals’ knowledge base about health,

and an increase in health knowledge alters health behaviors (i.e., consumption of health inputs

with both positive and negative marginal products, such as medical care and cigarette smoking),

which in turn influence health outcomes.

       This paper has two aims. First, it investigates whether education has an impact on input

allocation through its impact on health knowledge. Specifically, we employ, for the first time in

this literature, a panel data set to analyze the validity of the allocative efficiency hypothesis. Our

basic framework is similar to Kenkel (1991), where the impact of schooling on health inputs is

estimated. If the influence of schooling on health is working through allocative efficiency (i.e.,

if schooling improves allocative efficiency by increasing the health knowledge of the individual),

schooling should have little or no direct effect on health inputs in a regression that controls for

health knowledge. Kenkel (1991) uses cross-sectional data from the 1985 National Health

Interview Survey (NHIS) and focuses on health inputs (behavior) such as smoking, drinking and

exercise. His data set also contains information about the knowledge of the subjects regarding

the health consequences of smoking, drinking and exercise. He finds that inclusion or exclusion

of measures of health knowledge does not alter the magnitude of the education coefficients in

regressions that explain health behavior, indicating that allocative efficiency is not the main

reason schooling is related to health behavior. The same approach was taken by Cutler and

Lleras-Muney (2010), who employed cross-sectional data from the NHIS to investigate the

impact of knowledge about health risks on the relationship between education and health




                                                  2
behaviors. They too found that health knowledge has only a modest impact on how education

impacts health behaviors.

        Our study differs from Kenkel (1991) and Cutler and Lleras-Muney (2010) in two

important ways. First, we employ a panel data of individuals, rather than a cross-section.

Specifically, each person in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-97 (NLSY97) was asked

questions on health knowledge both in 1997 and 2002. This allows us to investigate the impact

of health knowledge on health behavior by netting out time-invariant individual-specific

unobservables that may impact both the intensity of the demand for health knowledge and the

demand for health behavior. Second, the design of the NLSY97 has generated exogenous

increases in the amount of schooling for different individuals in the sample between the two

survey years. As explained in detail in the data section, two identical individuals who were both

surveyed in 1997 and 2002 could have received significantly differential amounts of schooling

(up to 24 months) between these years due to the timing of the 1997 and the 2002 surveys. Thus,

individuals are exposed to differential amounts of schooling between the two surveys, which is

not related in any way to their personal or family background characteristics.1 We find that

accounting for health knowledge has no impact on the relationship between education and health

behaviors.

        The second goal of the paper is to investigate the extent to which cognitive ability is

responsible for the impact of education on health behavior. Cutler and Lleras-Muney (2010)

analyze how the impact of education on health behaviors is influenced by the inclusion of


1
 Also, the NLSY97 allows us to employ the number of months attended to school by the individual as a measure of
education. As explained in more detail in the Data section below, the number of months attended to school is
measured with a high degree of precision, and it better captures the individual’s exposure to schooling. The
conventional measure of education (years of completed schooling) contains substantial measurement error,
generated by the timing of the survey, in a sample of young adults who are still in school.


                                                       3
various sets of variables to regression models. Using cross-sectional data sets, they find that the

impact of education on health behaviors is diminished (but not eliminated) if income, health

insurance and family background are controlled for, but that the extent of risk aversion or

discounting for the future have no impact on the estimated coefficient of education. They also

run regressions of health behavior on education with and without a measure of cognitive ability,

and investigate how the estimated coefficient of education is altered. They find evidence

suggesting that cognitive ability, measured by the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery

(ASVAB) score, accounts for about 20 percent of the impact of education on the demand for

health inputs.

       The use of the NLSY97 allows us to employ the ASVAB score, as well as another

alternative measure of conceptual thinking ability and cognition (PIAT), to investigate the same

question. While we obtain similar results as Cutler and Lleras-Muney (2010) using the ASVAB

or the PIAT score as a measure of cognitive ability, entertaining the premise that test scores such

as ASVAB are impacted by family background (Cunha and Heckman, 2007; Heckman et al.,

2006; Hansen et al., 2004 ) and controlling for family fixed-effects produces the result that

cognition, as measured by ASVAB or PIAT, does not influence the impact of education on

health behavior.

       An arguably exogenous measure of cognitive ability is an indicator of whether the

individual suffers from a learning disability such as dyslexia or attention disorder. For any given

amount of schooling, individuals with learning disability are expected to learn less in school in

comparison to their peers who have no such disability. If learning in school is a determinant of

the influence of education on health inputs, then a particular increase in schooling would have a




                                                 4
smaller impact on health behavior for those with learning disability. However, our results show

that learning disability does not influence the impact of schooling on health behaviors.

       In section II we describe the empirical implementation. Section III presents the data.

Section IV incudes the discussion of the results, and Section V is the conclusion.



       II. Empirical Specification

Consider equation (1) below


(1)    Hi = β0 + β1Educationi +Xiβ2 + εi

       where H stands for the demand for various health inputs which are deleterious to health,

(such as the demand for cigarettes) for person i. Education represents the level of schooling of

the person, X is a vector of control variables, and ε is a standard error term.

       Equation (2) is similar to equation (1), but it includes an additional variable,

HealthKnowledgei, which measures the extent of the knowledge of person i regarding the health

input H. For example, if H stands for consumption of cigarettes, HealthKnowledge measures the

extent of the person’s knowledge about the health risks associated with smoking.



(2)    Hi = δ0 + δ1Educationi + δ2 Health Knowledgei + Xi δ3 + ωi.


       Kenkel (1991) and Cutler and Lleras-Muney (2010) estimate versions of equations (1)

and (2) and investigate the difference between the estimated β1 and δ1; i.e. the extent to which

Health Knowledge alters the impact of education on health inputs. Both papers employ cross-




                                                  5
sectional data sets and they find that health knowledge has a modest (Cutler and Lleras-Muney)

or negligible (Kenkel) impact on health behavior; that is, β1 is not appreciably different from δ1.2

           In this paper, we employ panel data, which allow us to measure the demand for health

inputs, the amount of schooling, and the extent of input-specific health knowledge of individuals

in two time periods. Specifically, the respondents of the NLSY97 were asked questions about

their health behaviors. Furthermore, information is obtained from survey participants regarding

their health knowledge in the 1997 and 2002 waves of the survey along with information on

schooling. Time variation in the data allows us to entertain a specification as depicted by

equation (3A) where the demand for health inputs for person i at time t depends on the same set

of variables as in equation (2), and on an individual-specific, time-invariant heterogeneity

component μi.


           (3A) Hit = δ0 + δ1Educationit + δ2Health Knowledgeit + Xit Ψ1 + μi +ωit


           Because the health knowledge questions were administrated only in 1997 and 2002, we

will employ data from these years. A valuable feature of the data is that among individuals who

took the survey in 1997 and again in 2002, there is substantial variation in the distance between

the timing of the survey. For example, while some individuals were surveyed as little as 4.5

years apart, the difference between the two surveys was more than 6 years for some others.3

This exogenous variation in the distance between the two interviews translates into variation in

schooling received by individuals between the two surveys.


2
  Kenkel also runs instrumental variables regressions where health knowledge questions are instrumented with
whether the individual received advice from a physician on life-style-related topics and for smoking, years of
schooling completed after 1964 (the year of surgeon general’s report on smoking), as well as indicator variables for
occupation and industry and whether the person is employed in a health field. He obtains results similar to OLS
(with larger standard errors), and concludes that the OLS results are not biased because of endogeneity.
3
    The mean difference between the two surveys is 68 months.

                                                         6
        Time-differencing Equation (3A) allows us to eliminate individual-specific

unobservables (μi) that may be correlated with health behaviors as well as education and health

knowledge. In equation (3B) ∆p stands for p-month difference, where p represents the number

of months between the surveys, which is different for different people.


(3B)    ∆pHit = δ1∆pEducationit + δ2∆pHealth Knowledgeit + ∆pXitΨ2 + ∆pωit


        The vector X contains time-varying attributes of the individual. Because a higher value

of (∆p Education) embodies the effect of increased schooling as well as aging, we also control for

the difference in age between the two survey years. As mentioned earlier, Cutler and Lleras-

Muney (2010) attribute some of the observed relationship between education and health to

cognitive ability. They argue that schooling improves cognition and enhanced cognitive skills

alter health behaviors and improve health outcomes. Along the same lines, Auld and Sidhu

(2005) find that controlling for test scores has an impact on the estimated impact of education on

self-reported health.4


        To test this hypothesis, we estimate regressions very similar to Cutler and Lleras-Muney

(2010). Specifically, we run cross-sectional models depicted by Equation 4 below.


        (4)      Hi = γ0 +γ1Educationi + γ2 Cognitive Abilityi + γ3 Health Knowledgei +XiΨ3 + υi


where, following Cutler and Lleras-Muney (2010), Cognitive Ability is measured by the

ASVAB score. Equation (4) allows us to investigate the sensitivity of the impact of education on

health behavior (γ1) to the inclusion/exclusion of Cognitive Ability. Note that as was the case in

Cutler and Lleras-Muney (2010), the ASVAB score of each individual is constant over time.

4
 Auld and Sidhu (2005) use adjusted-AFQT scores as a measure of ability and find that schooling has an effect on
health only for those with low schooling, and in particular with low ability.

                                                        7
Thus, although each individual contributes two observations (one from 1997, the other from

2002), equation (4) is a pooled cross-section. In addition to ASVAB, we also employ the

Peabody Individual Achievement Test (PIAT) as an alternative correlate of cognition.


       To test this conjecture in a different framework, we hypothesize that if cognition matters,

the impact of education on health behaviors should be different between those who a have

learning disability and those who do not. That is, if education improves cognition which in turn

impacts health behavior, an additional amount of education should have a smaller impact on

health behavior among those who have a learning disability. More specifically, the coefficient

γ2 should be negative in Equation (5) below, mitigating the impact of education on health

behavior.


       (5)     ∆pHit = γ1∆pEducationit + γ2 (∆pEducationit x Learning Disabilityi)


               + γ3 ∆pHealth Knowledgeit + ∆pXitΨ + υit


       We have information, obtained from parents, on whether the individuals in the sample

have a learning disability such as dyslexia or attention deficit disorder. This is arguably an

exogenous indicator of the extent of cognitive difficulty of the individual. Note that the main

effect of learning disability on health behavior cannot be identified in this specification because

the indicator of learning disability is time-invariant.


       III. Data and Measurement of Variables


       The data are obtained from the NLSY97, which contains a nationally representative

sample of 8,984 youths who were aged 12–16 as of December 31st 1996. The respondents have

been followed annually since the survey was initiated. The cohort born in 1983 was asked health

                                                   8
knowledge questions in the 1997 and 2002 waves of the survey. Therefore, the bulk of our

analysis uses data from these two waves.

        The 1997 wave of the NLSY97 was administered between January 1997 and May 1998,

and the 2002 survey was administered between November 2002 and July 2003. This means, for

example, that a 9th grader in the 1997 wave could have been interviewed 54 months later in the

2002 wave of the survey, while another 9th grader could have been interviewed 78 months after

the first survey. As the timing of the surveys is random and, therefore, not correlated with

student or parent attributes, this design implies that the second student could have been exposed

to 20 additional months of schooling in comparison to the first student (Altindag, Cannonier and

Mocan, 2011).5

        Table 1 provides the summary statistics of the variables employed in the analysis. Health

behavior variables are cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption. Cigarettes per Day stands for

the average number of cigarettes smoked by the individual during the last 30 days. Smoker is an

indicator for smoking participation (smoked at least one cigarette per day). Cigarettes per Day

among Smokers gives the number of cigarettes smoked among smokers. One Pack per Day is a

measure of heavy smoking. It takes the value of one if an individual has smoked at least twenty

cigarettes per day in the thirty days prior to the interview, and zero otherwise. Heavy Drinker is

an indicator that takes the value of one if an individual has consumed more than sixty alcoholic

drinks in the last thirty days6. Summary statistics in Table 1 suggest an increase between the two

waves in smoking participation, number of cigarettes smoked per day and heavy alcohol




5
  The difference in exposure to schooling in this example is 20 months rather than 24 because there is no schooling
in summer months.
6
  This cut-off of sixty drinks is not arbitrary. According to Dawson, Grant and Chou (1995), individuals who
consume more than 2 drinks every day are considered heavy drinkers.

                                                         9
consumption for the individuals in our sample. Note also that average age has increased from 13

to 19 between the two survey waves.

         We measure schooling by the number of Months Attended, which is the cumulative

number of months the individual has attended any type of school (kindergarten to college) since

the first interview in the 1997 wave.7 This variable is created using monthly schooling status

information available in the schooling event history of each wave of the NSLY97 between 1997

and 2002 waves. Another schooling measure we employ is Highest Grade Completed. We

prefer Months Attended to Highest Grade Completed because the latter does not measure

schooling with precision. For example, consider the case where some respondents are

interviewed right after the end of the school year and others are interviewed right before the end

of the school year. Those who are interviewed when the school was in session (but close to the

end) will report a value for the number of years of completed schooling which is one year fewer

in comparison to those who are interviewed right after the end of the school year. However, the

actual difference in terms of schooling is much smaller than one full year of schooling. Similarly,

years of completed schooling will not reflect the true difference in schooling for two students

who are interviewed in different months of the same academic year. Such measurement error

would generate attenuation bias in the estimated coefficient of years of completed schooling.

Nevertheless, we use both measures because it is not possible to employ Months Attended in

cross sectional regressions as explained below.

         The variables Smoking Knowledge and Drinking Knowledge indicate the proportion of

correctly answered questions about health risks of smoking and drinking, respectively. For

Smoking Knowledge, the questions gauge whether the individual has correct information about


7
  However, none of the individuals in our sample is in kindergarten or in primary school at the time of the first
interview.

                                                          10
the connection between smoking and heart disease, and smoking and AIDS. For Drinking

Knowledge, the questions are based on the connection between drinking and liver disease, heart

disease, arthritis, addiction to alcohol, and harm on unborn child. The list of the questions and

the correct answers are listed in the Appendix. Summary statistics in Table 1 indicate that most

of the individuals have high levels of health knowledge about both smoking and drinking. The

proportion of correct answers has increased between 1997 and 2002 in case of smoking.

          We use the ASVAB score, as is the case in Cutler and Lleras-Muney (2010). About 80

percent of the respondents in the NLSY97 sample took the computer-adaptive form of the Armed

Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) test. The ASVAB test consists of 12 subtests

that measure vocational aptitude in areas such as arithmetic reasoning, assembling objects, auto

information and so on. The variable used in our analysis is constructed based on age adjusted test

scores of individuals in four sub tests: mathematical knowledge, arithmetic reasoning, word

knowledge, and paragraph comprehension as obtained from the NLSY97 data set.8 The final

variable is the percentile in which the individual’s test scores fall in comparison to other ASVAB

takers.

          As an alternative test score, we utilize individual’s PIAT (Peabody Individual

Achievement Test) math assessment scores. Specifically, we use the individual’s percentile score

for the PIAT. The version of PIAT administered for the NLSY97 respondents involved

answering several mathematics questions. The difficulty of the questions is age-adjusted.

Ninety-four percent of the individuals in our sample took the PIAT test during the 1997 wave.


          Learning Disability is an indicator for whether the individual has a learning disability.

This varaible is constructed based on parents’ report, who were asked the following question.

8
 These four substests are used by the Department of Defense to calculate AFQT scores (Armed Forces
Qualification Test scores).

                                                   11
“Does your child now have or has [he/she] ever had a learning or emotional problem that limits

or has limited the kind of schoolwork or other daily activities [he/she] can perform, the amount

of time [he/she] can spend on these activities or [his/her] performance in these activities?” If the

parent answered in the affirmative, a second question was asked as follows. “ What (is/are) the

condition(s)? (Select all that apply.) Learning disability (i.e., dyslexia) or attention disorder;

Emotional/mental problem or behavior problem; Eating disorder like anorexia or bulimia;

Mental retardation; Other (Specify).” We coded our Learning Disability variable to take the

value of one if the parent declared the existence of learning disability (i.e., dyslexia) or attention

disorder. In our sample about nine percent of the individuals have learning disability. This is

consistent with the findings of a CDC report by Pastor and Reuben (2008) who find that about

eight to nine percent of all children aged between six and eleven have learning disorders.


        Time-dependent variables shown in Table 1 are included as control variables in the

empirical analyses. All individuals in the sample are born in 1983.9 However, due to the

differences in the interview date, there is variation in Age. On average, respondents age by about

6 years between the two survey waves. Household Income is deflated by 1,000. Unsurprisingly,

none of the individuals in the 1997 wave were married, and very few were married as of the

2002 wave. Cumulative Hours Worked measures the total number of hours an individual has

worked in the labor market. Household Size gives the number of individuals in the respondent’s

household.

        The remaining variables in Table 1 are time-invariant individual characteristics. They are

included in cross sectional sections as control variables. We present summary statistics of these

variables to provide information about the sample. For example, about half of the sample consist

9
 This is because of the design of the survey. Only individuals in the cohort born in 1983 are asked health knowledge
questions. These individuals make up our estimation sample.

                                                        12
of males. Individuals who identify themselves as Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black make up 20%

and 26% of the whole sample, respectively.



IV. Results

The Influence of Health Knowledge

       The results obtained from estimating equation (3B) are presented in Table 2. In this

specification, all variables are in first-differences. For example, Months Attended stands for the

change in the number of months the individual attended school between the two survey years.

For each health behavior, two columns of results are presented. The odd-numbered (even-

numbered) columns exclude (include) individual’s health knowledge about the health behavior.

For example, columns (1) and (2) report the regression results where the dependent variable is

whether the person is a smoker. Both columns are based on the same specification except that

column (2) controls for smoking knowledge, and column (1) omits it.

       Education has negative impact on smoking, both at the extensive and intensive margins,

and on the propensity to drink heavily. Note again, that we analyze the propensity for heavy

drinking because questions on drinking knowledge are based on heavy drinking (see the

Appendix). An increase in Months Attended by one school year (9 months) decreases the

propensity to smoke by 2.7 percentage points (0.3 x 9), which translates into a 12% decline. A

one-year increase in schooling (9 months) reduces the daily number of cigarettes smoked by one

cigarette for everyone. The same increase in schooling reduces the daily number of cigarettes

smoked among smokers by 0.8 cigarettes (by about 11%), and it reduces the propensity for being

a heavy drinker by about one percentage point (about 20%).




                                                13
       Marriage has a negative impact on the number of cigarettes smoked as well as on the

propensity to drink heavily. The number of hours worked in the labor market is positively

associated with smoking and also with heavy drinking.

       An increase in knowledge about smoking has a negative impact on cigarettes smoked per

day, and an increase in drinking knowledge has a negative impact on heavy drinking. However,

inclusion of the knowledge variables does not change the estimated coefficients of education.

       The last row of Table 2 presents the percent change in the estimated coefficient of

education due to the inclusion of health knowledge. Inclusion of smoking knowledge reduces the

size of the education coefficient trivially (by about one percent) in two of the five models. The

change is virtually zero for smoking participation, heavy smoking and heavy alcohol

consumption.

       Table 3 presents the same specifications as in Table 2 with one difference: here the

change in education is measured by the change in the highest grade completed . As discussed

earlier, this is not as accurate a measure of acquired schooling as Months Attended which is used

in Table 2. However, we present the results using highest grade completed as well, because later

in the paper cross-sectional regressions can only be run using highest grade completed as the

measure of schooling. As can be seen, the results are consistent between tables 2 and 3.

       These results show that accounting for health knowledge does not eliminate or reduce the

impact of education on health behavior. Thus, they indicate that allocative efficiency is not

likely a primary mechanism through which education impacts health inputs.

Cognition

        In this section, we present the results of the analyses that investigate whether variations in

cognitive ability is the reason behind the impact of education on health behaviors. Table 4A

presents the results obtained from estimating versions of Equation (4). ASVAB is a measure of

cognitive ability; it stands for the percentile ranking of the individual’s ASVAB score, ranging

from 0 to 100 where higher scores represent higher ability (Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2010).

Education is measured by the highest grade completed. We cannot use Months Attended as the

measure of education in these regressions. This is because, to replicate Cutler and Lleras-Muney

specifications we run cross-sectional regressions in this specification using data from 1997 (the

first wave) as well as from 2002. These are the two years in which health knowledge questions

were administered. The Months Attended variable measures the number of months the individual

has attended any school since the first interview; and the number of months of school attendance

prior to the first wave of interviews in the NSLY97 has not been recorded. Thus, we employ

Highest Grade Completed as the measure of schooling, which is reported both in 1997 and in

2002.

        As Table 4A demonstrates, education has a negative impact on unhealthy behavior, but

controlling for the ASVAB score reduces the magnitude of the coefficient of education. For

example, an additional year of schooling reduces the propensity to smoke by 4.4 percentage

points in column (1) when the model does not include ASVAB, but the marginal effect of

schooling is -0.037 when the model contains ASVAB (column 2). The same is true for cigarettes

smoked per day and cigarettes smoked per day among smokers. These results are consistent with

those reported by Cutler and Lleras-Muney (2010).




                                                 15
          It is plausible that the ASVAB score is not a reliable indicator of cognitive ability. For

example, Cunha and Heckman (2007), Heckman et al. (2006) and Hansen et al. (2004) stress that

a person's schooling and family background at the time tests are taken affect test scores.

Although we control for some family background characteristics in the regressions reported in

table 4A, it is likely that important family attributes are omitted. Thus, we re-estimate Equation

(4) by controlling for family fixed-effects. Identification is obtained off of variation between

siblings who have different cognitive ability as measured by ASVAB scores. The results are

displayed in Table 4B. The impact of education on being a smoker is substantially reduced in

this specification; and the same is true to a lesser extent about the number of cigarettes

consumed. However, in this specification the coefficient of education is insensitive to the

inclusion of the ASVAB score. Put differently, after controlling for family fixed effects,

variations in cognitive ability does not influence the impact of education on health behavior.


          We repeat the same exercise using the PIAT (the percentile score of the individual’s

Peabody Individual Achievement Test) score, instead of ASVAB.10 The results are displayed in

Table 5A. Inclusion of the PIAT score reduces the magnitude of the estimated education

coefficient slightly. For example, in column 1 of Table 5A we observe that an additional year of

education reduces the propensity to smoke by 3.9 percentage points. The regression result,

reported in column 2 controls for the PIAT score; and in this specification the impact of an

additional year of education is to reduce the smoking propensity by 3.5 percentage points.

Similar results are obtained for most outcomes reported in Table 5A. However, when we add

family fixed-effects to these specifications, we observe that inclusion or exclusion of the PIAT

10
     PIAT and ASVAB are highly correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0.72.




                                                     16
score has no impact on the estimated education coefficient (Table 5B). In other words,

controlling for cognition, as measured by the PIAT score, does not alter the relationship between

education and health behaviors in models that control for unobserved family attributes.


       To analyze whether the results are altered if we employ a different, arguably more

exogenous measure of cognition, we estimate models where an indicator for learning disability

of the individual is employed. To make the results comparable to those obtained from the

regressions with ASVAB and PIAT, we first use cross-sectional data from 1997 and 2002 and

employ Highest Grade Completed as the measure of schooling. The results, which are presented

in Table 6 show that controlling for learning disability does not alter the estimated coefficient of

education.

       Table 7A presents the models that perform the same analysis, but here the panel nature of

the data is exploited. These models are based on equation (5). We use the Months Attended in

these regressions. Once again, exposure to additional months of schooling between the two

survey years reduces the propensity to smoke, the number of cigarettes smoked and the

propensity to be a heavy drinker. However, the impact of schooling is not different between

students with and without learning disability. Table 7B estimates the same specification as in

Table 7A, but uses Highest Grade Completed as the measure of schooling to investigate if the

results are sensitive to the measure of schooling. The inference does not change. Controlling for

learning disability does not alter the relationship between education and health behavior.

Furthermore, the marginal effect of education on health behaviors is the same between those who

have a learning disability and those who don’t. These results suggest that cognition does not

impact the education gradient in health behaviors. More specifically, the results don’t lend




                                                 17
support to the hypothesis that education increases cognition, and enhanced cognition and

intelligence enable people to make better health decisions.



V. Summary and Conclusion

       Using a panel data set of young individuals from the NLSY97, we pose two questions.

The first question is whether schooling increases the efficiency of health production. Productive

efficiency hypothesis suggests that education has a direct impact on health, much like the impact

of technology on production. More educated people are more efficient producers of health,

perhaps because the marginal products of health inputs differ by education. An alternative

hypothesis is that of allocative efficiency, where more educated people make different choices

about health inputs; i.e., they allocate inputs differently which in turn produce more health

output. Under allocative efficiency, education has no direct influence on health as the impact of

education is only working through the pathway of health inputs. For example, education

provides knowledge about the benefits or harmful effects of health inputs (such as nutrition or

smoking) and this knowledge alters health behavior and health outcomes.

       To investigate the relative validity of these hypotheses, we estimate models of health

behavior, where the change in various measures of smoking and heavy drinking between the two

survey years are regressed on arguably exogenous increases in educational attainment between

the same years and on the change in the relevant health knowledge. We find that health

knowledge has an impact on health behavior, but that accounting for health knowledge does not

eliminate or reduce the impact of education on health behavior. This finding supports the

productive efficiency hypothesis.




                                                18
       We also investigate whether cognitive ability is responsible for the impact of education

on health behavior. Using the ASVAB and PIAT scores as alternative measures of cognitive

ability we find that accounting for ability reduces the impact of education on health behavior,

suggesting that cognition partly explains the relationship between education and health

behaviors. However, test scores such as ASVAB and PIAT are known to be noisy measures of

cognition that may be impacted by family attributes (Cunha and Heckman, 2007; Heckman 2006;

Hansen, Heckman and Mullen 2004). In fact, regressions that control for family fixed-effects

show that inclusion or exclusion of ASVAB or PIAT scores have no impact on the estimated

impact of education on health behavior.

       In addition, we perform another test to investigate how cognitive ability impacts the

relationship between education and health behaviors. The test involves a comparison of health

input demands of two individuals who are observationally identical except for one dimension:

one of them has a learning disability such as dyslexia or attention disorder. The individual with

the learning disability is expected to learn less in school compared to the individual without the

disorder for a given level of schooling. If what is learned in school is a determinant of the

influence of education on health inputs, then a particular increase in schooling would have a

smaller impact on health behavior for those with learning disability. However, our results show

that learning disability does not influence the impact of schooling on health behaviors. An

increase in schooling has the same impact on health behaviors for those who have a learning

disability as for those who don’t have a learning disability. These findings suggest that cognition

is unlikely to be a primary factor in explaining the relationship between education and the

demand for health inputs.

 Notes: Highest Grade Completed is the number of years of schooling the individual has completed. The outcome variables are listed at the top of columns. Piat is the individual’s percentile
 score in the math section of the PIAT test. Health Knowledge is measured as the share of the correct responses individual provided to the questions related to potential health risks of smoking
 or of heavy alcohol consumption. Results are obtained using OLS. Standard errors clustered at the individual level are presented in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance at 10%,
 5% and 1% levels, respectively. a The sample include individuals who were smoker in the 1997 wave or in the 2002 wave.
 b
   Indicator for whether individual drinks more than 2 alcoholic drinks every day for a month as defined by Dawson (1995).

Notes: Months Attended is the cumulative number of months the individual has attended any school. The outcome variables are listed at the top of columns. Odd (even) numbered columns
exclude (include) Health Knowledge (Smoking or Drinking). Learning Disability is an indicator that takes the value of one if the parent of the individual reported that the individual has a
learning disability such as dyslexia or attention deficit disorder. Health Knowledge is measured as the share of the correct responses individual provided to the questions related to potential
health risks of smoking or of heavy alcohol consumption. OLS is applied to the first differenced data. Robust standard errors are in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance at 10%,
5% and 1% levels, respectively.
a
  The sample include individuals who were smoker in the 1997 wave or in the 2002 wave.
