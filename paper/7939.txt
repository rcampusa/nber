1     Introduction

1.1      Motivation

From a contractual point of view, the employment relations that emerged by the early 1960s in
manufacturing ﬁrms in the United States and Japan represent two distinct cases.1 In particular,
the employment relations that developed in large, unionized American manufacturing establish-
ments tended to be based on an explicit, elaborate, and legally enforceable collective agreement
between an employer and the locals of craft/industrial unions. Employment practices concern-
ing blue-collar workers in these establishments were characterized more in terms of narrow and
well-deﬁned job demarcations, ﬁnely graded wages linked explicitly to job grades, low invest-
ment in ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital, promotions based on well-deﬁned seniority rules combined
with objective merit ratings, and limited, but contractually established, job security governed
by seniority rules. Disputes over implementation and interpretation of a collective agreement
were typically brought before a legal third party through a formal grievance mechanism.2
    By contrast, the employment relations observed in large, unionized Japanese manufacturing
ﬁrms tended to be based on an implicit (i.e., contingent on unveriﬁable variables) and ambigu-
ous (i.e., leaving many contingencies unspeciﬁed) collective agreement between an employer and
an enterprise union, which was self-enforced through long-term interactions and reputational
concerns. Employment practices on the shopﬂoor in those ﬁrms tended to incorporate broadly
and ambiguously deﬁned jobs, high ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital investment, periodic wage raises
and promotions based (not only on seniority but) crucially on subjective performance evalua-
tions, various non-wage beneﬁts beyond the legal obligation, and implicit long-term employment
guarantees for regular workers. Joint labor-management councils were widely used among man-
ufacturing establishments in order to facilitate prior consultation, and most disputes over a
collective agreement were settled internally and informally without appealing to a legal third
party.
    Given the distinctiveness of contemporary employment relations in American and Japanese

   1
     The following observations are derived mainly from Aoki (1988); Evans (1971); Hanami (1979); Koike (1988);
OECD (1993, Chapter 4); Shirai (1983); Tachibanaki (1992).
   2
     As shown in a well-known study by Macaulay (1963), implicit contracts and long-term relations were also
important in the U.S. manufacturing industry. Two remarks are in order. First, his work focuses primarily on
interﬁrm contracts such as supplier-buyer relations, whereas the focus of this paper is employment contracts in
large, unionized ﬁrms, to which the above characterization applies more aptly. Second, the above statement is
comparative rather than absolute, in contrast to the Japanese counterparts.



                                                      1
manufacturing ﬁrms, one might conjecture that they have been diﬀerent since the onset of indus-
trialization. Yet, historical studies of labor relations in the respective countries indicate that,
contrary to the commonly held view, employment relations in large manufacturing establish-
ments at the beginning of this century were similarly characterized by high job turnover, low
work commitment, and highly competitive labor markets.3 Why, then, did distinct employ-
ment relations eventually evolve in Japan despite the conscious eﬀort of the Japanese govern-
ment to adopt western institutions and technologies during the early stage of industrialization?
Even more intriguing, during the 1910s and the 1920s, employment relations in major Ameri-
can manufacturing ﬁrms apparently developed toward “employer paternalism,” which aimed at
stable workforces, company-wide employee representation, and cooperative labor-management
relations.4 As Figure 1 shows, the average turnover rate of manufacturing workers in the U.S.
was comparable to that in Japan during the late 1920s and 1930s, in contrast to the postwar
period during which the two numbers exhibited a signiﬁcant diﬀerence. A further puzzle then
arises: could American manufacturing ﬁrms have developed employment relations similar to
those observed in Japan today, and if they could have, what prevented them from doing so?
      These questions motivate a comparative analysis of the evolution of employment relations
in American and Japanese manufacturing ﬁrms, yet, to my knowledge, there are few studies
that explicitly employ a comparative approach.5 Among the existing literature that refers to
the origins of the labor relations in the U.S. and Japan, three dominant views have emerged.
      The ﬁrst view argues that the distinctiveness reﬂects inherent diﬀerences in culture, tradition,
and social customs between the two societies derived from the pre-industrial era.6 This view,
the cultural thesis, implicitly assumes that intrinsic values or dispositions unique to each society,
such as individualism or collectivism, remained invariant over time. The distinctive nature of
the two sets of employment relations was, thus, claimed to be pre-determined by those values,
and the argument often suggests economic ineﬃciency of the resulting institutions.
      The second view, the historical contingency thesis, attributes a discontinuous change of
institutional development to a unique historical event such as war or depression.7 It hypothesizes

     E.g., Jacoby (1985, Chapter 1); Gordon (1985, Chapter 1).
  4
     E.g., Brody (1980, Chapter 2). The similarity between the employment relations in the U.S. and Japan in
the 1920s was emphasized by Chūma (1987).
   5
     Notable exceptions are Chūma (1987) and Jacoby (1993).
   6
     E.g., Abegglen (1958); Ōkouchi (1972); Hayami (1996).
   7
     E.g., Brody (1980, Chapter 2); Lichtenstein (1982); Baron, Dobbin & Jennings (1986); Okazaki (1993);
Okazaki & Okuno-Fujiwara (1997).



                                                     2
that a critical branching point was the result of an event or an actor exogenous to private
agents (i.e., employers and workers) in the economy. In particular, the analysis typically treats
government intervention triggered by these events as exogenous, and presumes compliance of
private agents to the government without examining private incentives to do so.8
       The third view, the economic rationality thesis, claims that the institutional diversity is a
result of the rational responses of private agents to speciﬁc economic conditions (e.g., endow-
ments, technologies, market demands) due largely to the diﬀerent timing of industrialization.9
This view implicitly assumes the exogeneity of technology and other economic conditions. In
contrast to the culturalist view, it generally points to “technological determinism” that is free
from cultural and social constraints, emphasizing the universal applicability and economic ra-
tionality of the observed institutions under given economic conditions.
       The common approach underlying these three views is to identify the exogenous factors (e.g.,
culture, government intervention, or technology) that had a predominant and unilateral impact
on the development of employment relations in the respective countries.10 However, none of
these views in isolation provides a consistent explanation for the historical developments of em-
ployment relations in both the U.S. and Japan from the beginning of this century to the postwar
period. On the one hand, the cultural thesis cannot explain both employer paternalism in the
1910s and the antagonistic labor-management relations observed in the 1950s in the U.S.; nor
can it explain the remarkable transformation of work norms among production workers that
Japan went through during the ﬁrst half of this century. The historical contingency thesis, on
the other hand, can explain why the Great Depression and New Deal labor legislation shifted
the institutional trajectory of the U.S., but not why the serious depression and drastic labor law
reforms in postwar Japan did not change Japan’s trajectory. Finally, the economic rationality
thesis can account for simpliﬁed job deﬁnitions and low human capital investment in American
ﬁrms from the viewpoint of mass production technology; however, it fails to explain why am-
biguous job deﬁnitions and high human capital investment persisted in Japanese ﬁrms after the
1950s when mass production technology was enthusiastically adopted from the U.S. Thus, our

     Needless to say, the classiﬁcation of the dominant views oﬀered here is much simpliﬁed to highlight their main
points: most existing studies take a delicate blend of the respective views and, to various degrees, acknowledge
the complexity and richness of history. In particular, important exceptions are the works by Gordon (1985)
and Jacoby (1985), emphasizing the interplay among management, labor, and the government in describing the
evolution of the employment relations, respectively, in Japan and in the U.S.

challenge is to develop a theory that produces a consistent account for the long-run evolution of
employment relations in these two countries. To overcome some of the limitations of the above
views, this paper provides a new conceptual framework by bringing a comparative perspective
and game-theoretic insights to a historical analysis.11


1.2      Employment Systems as Multiple Equilibria

In this paper, we examine employment relations in private ﬁrms within the broader context
of an employment system, in which these ﬁrm-level employment practices (e.g., employment
contracts, job design, wages and compensations, promotion schemes, corporate training pro-
grams) are inseparably interrelated with economy-wide labor institutions (e.g., labor markets,
trade unions, labor laws, state welfare programs, social norms). More generally, we concep-
tualize an “employment game” with three players: management, labor, and government. An
employment system is then viewed as an equilibrium outcome of the game, consisting of a set
of mutual best responses of the three players and the beliefs that support those responses. In
other words, government actions are endogenously determined, reﬂecting government objectives,
strategic interplay with private agents, and preexisting economic and social conditions. Using
this conceptual framework, we empirically investigate the co-evolution of ﬁrm-level employment
relations and economy-wide labor institutions.
       The recent applications of game theory to the studies of economic institutions have brought
new insights in understanding contemporary employment systems in the U.S. and Japan by
viewing them as two diﬀerent equilibria.12 At the ﬁrm level, repeated strategic interactions
between an employer and a worker shape employment relations contingent on production tech-
nology, labor market conditions, and government labor policy. The recent literature of incom-
plete contract theory indicates that, in the presence of non-contractable variables intrinsic to
the employer-employee relationship, two qualitatively diﬀerent contractual arrangements may
result.13 An explicit contract equilibrium is based on an explicit and legally enforceable employ-
ment contract and players’ beliefs that the interests of labor and management are inherently
in conﬂict. By contrast, an implicit contract equilibrium relies on an implicit and long-term

employment contract that is self-enforced through a reputation mechanism and players’ beliefs
that cooperation between labor and management is mutually beneﬁcial.
    At the economy level, the government sets labor laws and provides social welfare given its
objectives, aﬀecting the strategy sets and payoﬀs of management and labor. At the same time,
ﬁrm-level employment relations impact government payoﬀs through changing industrial pro-
duction, the income distribution among constituencies, and the demand for social welfare. In
addition, the presence of unveriﬁable variables in private employment relations aﬀects enforce-
ment costs of government regulations. The strategic interactions between private agents and
the government give rise to equilibrium employment systems, where the presence of strategic
interdependencies among players often leads to a multiplicity of such systems.14 From this point
of view, the employment systems that had emerged by the early 1960s in the U.S. and Japan
were examples of two diﬀerent equilibria, each of which constituted a set of mutually reinforcing
institutions, as described below.15
    In the U.S. employment system, explicit and elaborate employment contracts in large man-
ufacturing ﬁrms were reinforced by the well-developed legal enforcement mechanism provided
by the state; at the same time, as more ﬁrms in the economy relied on explicit contracts, the
state’s return from providing a legal system to enforce such contracts became higher. High job
turnover among American workers was complementary to the existence of active labor markets
and unemployment insurance, both of which increased workers’ outside options. Government
incentives to provide unemployment insurance, in turn, were greater when more workers re-
entered the labor markets. Moreover, there was a prevailing belief among American employers
that mid-career job changers were those who possessed more experience or high ability and were
seeking a higher wage. This belief encouraged more employers to hire from the labor markets,
which induced more workers to participate.
    By contrast, in the Japanese employment system, implicit and ambiguous employment con-
tracts in major manufacturing ﬁrms were complemented by joint labor-management consultation
and enterprise unions, which provided internal enforcement mechanisms. The commitment to
long-term employment was reinforced by the absence of competitive labor markets, which re-
duced the outside options for both employers and employees. At the same time, the practice of a

  14

Roberts (1994).

     The following observations are derived mainly from Cole (1971); Gordon (1982); Mincer & Higuchi (1988);
Lincoln & Kalleberg (1990); Topel & Ward (1992).

long-term employment relationship discouraged the development of labor markets for mid-career
job changers. The investment in ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital increased the value of long-term
commitment, while neither employer nor worker would have engaged in ﬁrm-speciﬁc investment
without such commitment. The modest level of social welfare beneﬁts provided by the state
enhanced the employers’ returns from and the workers’ appreciation of corporate welfare pro-
grams, while the generous corporate welfare beneﬁts, in turn, reduced the public demand for
state welfare programs. Finally, there was a widely-held belief that a mid-career job switch im-
plied a lack of loyalty and a loss of ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital. This belief further discouraged
both employers and workers from looking into the labor markets for better hiring or working
opportunities.


1.3      A Dynamic Process of Equilibrium Selection

Having characterized employment systems in the U.S. and Japan in the 1960s as two distinct
equilibria, to study the evolution of employment systems is to understand a dynamic process
of equilibrium selection. Unfortunately, classical game and contract theories shed little light on
the dynamic process of equilibrium selection in the presence of multiple equilibria. Generally,
the theories suggest that, provided the adjustment cost is small and there is no problem of
coordination, an economy can switch from one equilibrium to another at once, implying that
outcomes are ahistorical. Some theories indicate that, even if the adjustment cost is high, if
agents in the economy make their investment decisions under perfect foresight, then coordination
of expectations may determine an equilibrium regardless of initial conditions or history.16 In
conducting a historical analysis, this paper points to two empirically important key factors that
creates a role for history in the process of equilibrium selection.
      The ﬁrst factor is the existence of unanticipated events that exogenously change parameters
of the game or the nature of the strategic environment in which the players interact. We assume
that ex ante the players know neither the timing nor magnitude of an event. Once the event is
observed, however, it is assumed that the players respond rationally to a new environment. The
second factor is the existence of what we call institutional capital — including not only physical
capital, but also human capital, reputations, coordination, organizational knowledge, corporate
norms, and legal expertise — that accumulates over time and, thus, is not instantaneously
adjustable. We assume that institutional capital accumulates endogenously, as the players play

 16
      See Matsuyama (1991); Krugman (1991).


                                                 6
particular equilibrium strategies, in a way that reinforces and supports the current equilibrium.
Incorporating these two factors, this paper advances the following simple hypothesis in exploring
the dynamic process of equilibrium selection (see Diagram 1).
   There are initial conditions in the economy characterized by parameters of the game and
institutional capital that are determined by prior history. When an unforeseen event hits the
economy and changes the parameters, that induces endogenous strategic responses by manage-
ment, labor, and government. Importantly, the players derive their best responses contingent
on existing institutional capital that was formed without anticipating the event. As institu-
tional capital accumulated in the past shapes and constrains today’s decisions, it creates path
dependence. As a particular equilibrium is realized in the economy, there is accumulation of in-
stitutional capital associated with this equilibrium. This institutional capital, in turn, forms new
initial conditions for the next unforeseen event, upon which further institutional development
will be built.
   What is crucial in determining the direction of institutional development is the relative
size of the two factors, i.e., the unanticipated shock and the institutional capital. There is a
continuity in the institutional trajectory due to the cumulative nature of institutional capital.
As the players accumulate knowledge and skills that reinforce and stabilize existing institutional
structure, an employment system tends to converge to a given equilibrium. This is what we
call the self-reinforcing process of institutional development. Institutional change, however, can
arise from an unanticipated shock, which tends to trigger a shift in the strategic responses of
the players. When the size of a shock is suﬃciently large relative to the level of institutional
capital, the institutional trajectory may shift its course, diverging towards a new equilibrium.
This is what we call the process of bifurcation. A temporary shock may have a lasting impact
on subsequent institutional development by initiating an endogenous process that ampliﬁes the
initial eﬀect of the shock through capital accumulation.
   Based on the above hypothesis, this paper empirically explores the dynamic process of equi-
librium selection by tracing crucial historical developments in the U.S. and Japan from the
beginning of this century to the early 1960s. It studies the following sequence of historical
events: the First World War, the Great Depression, the Second World War, and the postwar
U.S. Occupation of Japan. We investigate the initial conditions reﬂecting institutional develop-
ment prior to each event, the nature of the unanticipated shock, the endogenous responses of
the players, the outcome of the strategic interactions, and changes in the nature and the level



                                                 7
of institutional capital.
         The ﬁndings of this paper emphasize the dynamics and complexity of the historical processes
that eventually brought about distinctive employment systems in the U.S. and Japan. Strategic
interdependency created a multiplicity of possible employment systems, while the role of history
selected a particular system among other possibilities. The paper, therefore, contributes to the
literature of institutional diversity and path dependence by providing an empirical investigation
and indicating a promising line of theoretical exploration.


2         Employment Systems at the Beginning of the Twentieth Cen-
          tury

2.1         Employment Relations in Manufacturing Firms in the U.S. and Japan

By the mid-nineteenth century, the factory system had become a dominant production mode in
most U.S. manufacturing industries. Factory workers frequently moved from one job to another
in search of higher wages, better working conditions, or just a change of environment. Unskilled
workers were particularly likely to quit, but skilled workers were also highly mobile, relying on
their own skills and remaining unattached to a particular workplace. Employment duration
was extremely short, due not only to voluntary separation, but also to regular dismissals by
employers in response to cyclical and seasonal demand ﬂuctuations. Consequently, job turnover
increased sharply when business boomed due to a large number of quits, and remained quite
high when business contracted due to a large number of layoﬀs. In most manufacturing factories,
foremen exercised considerable discretion over managing production and employment, including
hiring, ﬁring, job assignments, and wage determination. In order to meet production goals,
foremen often resorted to a “drive system” in which workers were induced to work harder by the
threat of discharge or other unfavorable treatment by the foremen. In other words, the level of
work eﬀort was controlled primarily by coercion and close monitoring by foremen. In summary,
employment relations for most American manufacturing workers were “unstable, unpredictable,
and frequently unjust.”17
         Drawing upon English legal conventions, an employment contract in the U.S. originally did
not allow a worker to quit before fulﬁlling the contract term, and breach of contract could result

    17
         Brissenden & Frankel (1920); Jacoby (1985), p.23.

in criminal prosecution. When a contract did not specify a deﬁnite term, a term was presumed
to be one year. By the 1890s, however, the “employment-at-will” principle — according to which
either employer or worker could terminate the contract at any moment without notice before the
term matured — had been widely established in the U.S. Even though an employment contract
speciﬁed a one-year term, a suit to recover damages for breach of contract by laborers was an
empty remedy. According to a contemporary economist, “[the employer] protects himself by
making contracts which he also can terminate at any time by discharging the workman without
notice. Thus the labor contract becomes, in eﬀect, a new contract every day and every hour.
It is a continuous process of wage bargaining. It carries no eﬀective rights and duties for the
future and is as insecure as it is free.”18
       In Japan, since the Meiji Restoration in 1868, industrialization had taken place at a rapid
pace. Factory production was adopted along with other Western institutions of capitalism. Al-
though quantitative evidence is thin, a variety of descriptive evidence suggests that high job
turnover was a characteristic of Japanese manufacturing workers, for both males and females,
in the early period of industrialization. The nation-wide factory survey, Shokkō Jijō (The Con-
dition of Factory Workers), published in 1903 by the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce,
reported: “Workers in heavy industry are less mobile than workers in the textile industry, yet
their mobility is much higher than that in Western countries. There are many workmen who
change their workplaces one after another; especially when the economy prospers and workers
are in short supply, they will readily switch to another factory seduced by a slight diﬀerence
in wages, and when the economy recesses, they will move to large factories.”19 It was not
only unskilled workers migrating from villages who were highly mobile. It was the norm for
craftsmen to accumulate greater skills through traveling widely and changing workshops. These
skilled workers tended to be proud of being independent and self-reliant. Accordingly, tenure of
manufacturing workers was extremely short; even in large establishments employing more than
1,000 workers, approximately half of the workforce stayed less than one year.20 A contemporary
Japanese engineer who had worked for an American company remarked in 1901 that, in Japan,
factory workers with some education had a strong tendency not to stay in one job but to try

  19
     Female workers were well-known for their extremely high job turnover and short tenure. For example, the
annual turnover rate in two major textile factories in 1902 were 192% and 120%. Nōshōmushō (1903), p.62,
pp.77–80, and p.231.
  20
     In 1902, the proportion of workers with tenure of less than one year was; 50% in Mitsubishi Shipyards
employing 5,066 workers, 63% in Ōsaka Iron Works employing 1,492 workers and 48% in Kure Naval Shipyards
employing 4,982 workers (Nōshōmushō (1903), pp.230–1).


                                                     9
out various jobs, in contrast to factory workers in the U.S. He further observed that American
workers were generally more loyal and diligent in carrying out their work obligations, compared
to Japanese factory workers who were prone to shirk whenever they could and, thus, required
constant supervision.21 Therefore, the behavior of Japanese production workers observed in the
early stage of industrialization oﬀers some evidence that contradicts the cultural thesis, which
emphasizes the diligence and loyalty of Japanese workers derived from Confucian traditions.
       Given the high mobility of workers, employers recruited workers whenever necessary and
determined wages based on skills and general experience. In large factories in heavy industry,
a skilled craftsman called oyakata (craftsmaster) held full responsibility for hiring and ﬁring,
job design and assignments, training, and wage determinations on the shopﬂoor. An oyakata
closely supervised his subordinate workers in their daily lives as well as in their job performance.
When a new worker entered a factory, after a short evaluation period (one week or less) during
which the worker performed several tasks, a wage rate was determined corresponding to his skill
level. Little wage distinction was made between a continuous worker and a mid-career entrant
provided their skill levels were equal, reﬂecting the existence of a highly ﬂuid labor market.
There were even professional middlemen who helped get workers for one ﬁrm from a rival ﬁrm.
Labor poaching (shokkōsōdatsu) among establishments within an industry was an unwelcome
but common practice.22
       The Japanese Civil Code allowed an employment contract to stipulate a binding employment
term up to ﬁve years. Given the high labor mobility of the period, however, a typical employment
contract was very simple, specifying no ﬁxed term of employment, under which employment
could be terminated at any time upon consent of both parties. Some large manufacturing
ﬁrms oﬀered a ﬁxed-term employment contract of three to ﬁve years, giving special status and
beneﬁts to highly skilled workers in an eﬀort to retain them. The contract often included a
compensation clause in case a worker initiated a breach of contract.23 Despite the binding
terms and compensation clause, many workers quit before completion of the term using every
pretext — from their own injuries and sickness to the death of their family members — or simply
departed without notice. Even those young apprentices who had been trained in a company for
some years often ran oﬀ to another factory for higher wages; they were observed to have “no sense

of morality.” Even though binding contracts were legally available, contemporary management
saw them as something that could not be counted on. A government oﬃcial also observed:
“the contract provision is seemingly assured, yet it is eﬀectively void; neither employers think of
strictly enforcing it nor employees have intention of obeying it from the beginning.”24 In other
words, the evidence indicates that there was a de facto employment-at-will principle in Japan
at the beginning of this century.


2.2     Early Labor Movements and Government Policies in the U.S. and Japan

In comparison to European countries, both the U.S. and Japan had much weaker traditions of
trade unionism. In the U.S., it was not until 1886, when the American Federation of Labor
(AFL) was formed, that craft unionism took root. The federal and state governments showed
little sympathy toward organized labor. In fact, associations of workers often met with criminal
prosecution for conspiracy until about 1890. After 1890, labor injunctions were the most common
action against organized labor in the U.S., where federal and state courts repeatedly applied
antitrust laws against workers’ collective actions such as boycotts, strikes, and picketing. The
government often allowed employers to use a private military force or directly assisted employers
during labor disputes to protect the employers’ property rights.25 Even though AFL membership
grew steadily, gaining support from skilled workers and reaching half a million by 1900, a vast
majority of American factory workers were unorganized, and the employers’ method of dealing
with workers was almost exclusively individual wage bargaining.
      The ﬁrst organized labor movement in Japan surged in the 1890s, leading to the formation
of the Ironworkers Union (Tekkō Kumiai), a craft union made up of independent and highly-
skilled workers in heavy industry who frequently moved between ﬁrms. The Ironworkers Union
aimed at propagating craft unionism to other trades under the inﬂuence of the AFL, although
the movement failed to take root under employer repression. The Japanese government also
took a deﬁnite position to repress labor disputes, arguing that a strike would cause not only a
loss for an employer, but also a loss for society, hurting the national economy and disrupting
international trade.26 In 1900, the Imperial Diet passed the Peace Police Law (Chian Keisatsu
Hō), whose Article 17 authorized the intervention of a police force in labor disputes and practi-

cally prohibited workers from engaging in any collective activities.27 After this enactment, most
existing unions were pressured to dissolve themselves under the unfavorable political climate.
         In summary, both in the U.S. and Japan, employment relations in large manufacturing
ﬁrms at the beginning of this century were characterized by simple and short-term employment
contracts, high labor turnover, a low level of mutual trust, and decentralized labor control
by immediate supervisors with often coercive means of enforcement. In both countries, labor
markets were ﬂuid and competitive, and wages were determined according to the general skills
and experience of workers. Organized labor in the U.S. and Japan similarly met heavy repression
by both the government and employers; thus, individual wage bargaining was the dominant
method of dealing with manufacturing workers in the U.S. and the exclusive method of dealing
with factory workers in Japan.


3         The Emergence and Development of Employer Paternalism

This section documents how the changes in economic, social, and political conditions during the
ﬁrst two decades of the twentieth century prompted management in large manufacturing ﬁrms
both in the U.S. and Japan to develop employer paternalism that aimed at inducing high work
eﬀort, ﬁrm-speciﬁc skill development, and reliability and loyalty of their workers.


3.1        Labor Problems and the Welfare Work Movement in the U.S.

By the turn of the twentieth century, capital had become highly concentrated in major industrial
ﬁrms in the U.S., and the size of manufacturing plants had expanded dramatically.28 As the
number of workers per establishment and the complexity of production organization increased,
coordination of workers in the production process became essential in utilizing capital to its full
capacity.29 At the same time, as the cost of production interruption became higher, manage-
ment was increasingly concerned with employer-employee relations and the prevention of labor
disputes.
         In the second decade of this century, the existence of “labor problems,” which referred to

and repeatedly to repress the labor movement until 1925.
  28
     Manufacturing employment grew from 2.7 million in 1880 to 4.5 million in 1900, and to 8.4 million in 1920.
By 1900, 1,063 plants employed 500 to 1,000 workers, and 443 plants employed more than 1,000 workers (Nelson
(1995), p.5).

high turnover, high absenteeism, and low morale of workers, began to receive wide managerial
attention in the U.S.30 As Figure 2 shows, the annual turnover rate of manufacturing workers
regularly exceeded 100 percent during the 1910s, and it was identiﬁed as a major factor hindering
productivity. High absenteeism and low industrial morale of factory workers were also widely
publicized. An economist of the time warned that the real cost of turnover was not simply
the cost of recruiting and training workers to ﬁll vacancies; it also included the deterioration
of workplace morale due to instability and the loss of productivity due to workers’ inadequate
skills.31 Employers in large establishments began to see the potential beneﬁt of fostering a stable
workforce and industrial morale on the shopﬂoor.
      At the same time, stimulated by British social legislation, progressive social reformers and
labor leaders in the U.S. began to campaign for the introduction of social insurance and old-age
pensions. An increasing number of state governments started to enact workers’ compensation
laws during the 1910s.32 In search of solutions to the labor problems and in order to preempt
further state regulation, a group of progressive employers engaged in a welfare work move-
ment, which consisted of a voluntary eﬀort by management to improve working conditions.
Well-known proponents of welfare work in the manufacturing industry were AT&T, Du Pont,
Proctor & Gamble, General Electric, Westinghouse Electric, Ford, General Motors, Goodyear
Tire & Rubber, Eastman Kodak, International Harvester, Standard Oil of New Jersey, Bethle-
hem Steel, and U.S. Steel, among other ﬁrms.33 A study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in
1916 deﬁned welfare work as “anything for the comfort and improvement, intellectual or social,
of the employees, over and above wages paid, which is not a necessity of the industry nor re-
quired by law.” Welfare programs proposed by big businesses indeed encompassed a variety of
activities. First, to improve basic working conditions in the factory environment, safety aids,
shower rooms, cafeterias, and drinking fountains were provided. Second, to enhance harmony
and cultivate loyalty, company magazines, company outings, educational lectures, athletic clubs
and other cultural activities were organized. Third, various pecuniary and non-pecuniary bene-
ﬁts attached to employment status or length of service were oﬀered, including seniority bonuses,
mutual associations with death and disability beneﬁts, pension plans, saving plans, discount
purchase, and company housing. Financial, medical and legal assistance in emergencies and

consultation on employees’ personal problems were also provided at the company’s expense.34
Lastly, large companies established private corporation schools — independent from public vo-
cational schools or union apprenticeship programs — to train their workers .35
       From a contractual viewpoint, welfare work was an implicit, discretionary, and long-term
employment contract designed and oﬀered unilaterally by management. The beneﬁts and re-
wards were contingent on unveriﬁable variables, such as eﬀort, attitude, reliability, and loyalty
of workers, or on non-contractable variables such as length of service.36 In providing the welfare
programs, management introduced a set of qualiﬁcations restricting workers’ eligibility. Welfare
plans often contained a clause stipulating “proper behavior,” or if not explicitly written, there
was still an implicit premise. Enrollment in welfare programs was not a right for every worker,
but a privilege granted to those who were selected. Management retained its authority and
discretion in deciding whether to qualify or disqualify a worker. Moreover, since the welfare
plans were beyond legal obligations and initiated unilaterally by the company, management
could discontinue them at any time with legal impunity.
       When Ford introduced its well-known proﬁt-sharing plan “ﬁve-dollar day” in 1913, the So-
ciological Department of the company took responsibility for investigating each worker’s living
conditions, personal character, saving behavior, and work attendance to check his eligibility.
Similarly, U.S. Steel oﬀered retirement beneﬁts to employees who had worked for the company
for twenty years, except in the case of employee misconduct or for other cause “suﬃcient in
the judgment of management.” In the majority of pension plans, management retained “the
exclusive right to grant, withhold, reduce or terminate the allowance in individual cases, or to
modify or abandon the plan altogether.”37
       The early movement of welfare work was promoted by a minority of prosperous and progres-
sive employers who emphasized the social obligation of big business in taking care of its employ-
ees. AFL President Samuel Gompers criticized the welfare work movement as “enveloped with
an atmosphere of charity and patronage that is most repugnant to virile, self-reliant workers.”38
Most workers were not convinced of management’s benevolence or goodwill, while most employ-

ers were not certain about the economic proﬁtability of welfare work. Moreover, even though
management could oﬀer implicit employment contracts, there was no enforcement mechanism
for making those contracts self-enforcing.
       During the First World War, departing from its hands-oﬀ policy, the federal government
intervened in allocating human and material resources in order to achieve maximum wartime
production. Wartime labor regulation had three main eﬀects on employment relations in the U.S.
First, it promoted labor-management cooperation and introduced an employee representation
plan within an establishment. Second, it elevated the status of organized labor and publicly
recognized the AFL as the representative of labor. Third, it improved wages and working
conditions of factory workers.
       As the war proceeded, the number of work stoppages surged, causing serious disruption of
wartime production. From the standpoint that any industrial disputes were against the public
interest, the federal government created the War Labor Board to mediate and prevent labor
disputes. The WLB recognized the equal rights of employers and employees to organize and
bargain collectively, and promoted the establishment of minimum wages and working conditions
in the war industries. Moreover, to facilitate the resolution of labor disputes at the establish-
ment level, the WLB introduced shop committees modeled on works councils in Britain, which
consisted of representatives of management and employees. In the essential war industries, the
WLB ordered the creation of shop committees in more than 125 establishments. Employers
who had previously dealt with individual workers were thus compelled to bargain with the shop
committee representatives elected by workers, although not necessarily with the independent
union representatives. Organized labor partially endorsed shop committees in the hope that
the movement would evolve toward trade unionism, while many employers were “fearing exactly
this result.”39
       Consequently, under wartime regulation, American labor won substantial gains in union
membership, wages and other employment conditions. As soon as peace returned in November
1918, however, employers demanded a reversal of labor’s gains. In particular, they immediately
eliminated most of the shop committees created under the WLB awards.

3.2      Industrial Relations Programs and Works Councils in the U.S.

Between 1916 and 1920, the number of labor disputes soared and union membership almost
doubled. The Russian Revolution in 1917 and the formation of the American Communist Party
in 1919 caused a “red scare” among American employers. Large-scale general strikes broke out
in 1919, and “the employers’ alarm was accentuated by the belief that American labor was in
danger of becoming radical.”40 In addition, reﬂecting the economic boom stimulated by the
war, the average annual turnover rate of manufacturing workers exceeded 100 percent in 1916,
1917, 1918, and 1920 (see Figure 2).
       Consequently, more and more employers recognized the importance of cultivating the loy-
alty and satisfaction of workers in order to circumvent labor disputes, reduce turnover, and
preempt the formation of unions. In 1920, the Special Conference Committee, a secret commit-
tee formed by prominent business leaders, acknowledged that “maintenance of harmonious and
helpful relationships throughout the organization ranks in importance with production, distri-
bution, ﬁnance, and other major functions of management.”41 Other employers declared that
the proﬁtability of their operation depended upon uninterrupted production and that the most
certain way to prevent the “economic waste of labor controversies” was to “build up within a
plant a reputation for fair dealing and for consideration of the interest of employees.”42
       Employer paternalism, initiated as welfare work, developed into a more formal and com-
prehensive set of practices known as “industrial relations programs” after the First World War.
Large manufacturing establishments began to combine welfare programs with centralized person-
nel management, which systematized welfare programs and restricted foremen’s abuse of power,
and employee representation plans, which allowed employees to elect their representatives within
an establishment and participate in the improvement of working conditions.
       Corporate welfare programs were expanded both in variety and scope during the 1920s.
Health and life insurance, pensions, dismissal compensations, paid vacations, proﬁt sharing, and
stock ownership plans were increasingly introduced for production workers in large establish-
ments. To receive those beneﬁts, management required workers to be loyal and continuously
employed for a speciﬁed period of time. A typical clause in pension plans, for example, read:
“If an employee, after leaving the service, voluntarily or by participation in a strike, shall be

reemployed, he shall be considered in his relation to the Pension System as a new employee.”43
Corporate welfare plans were increasingly formalized in the 1920s with ﬁxed rules of eligibility
and administration. The essence of corporate welfare programs, however, was their implicit and
discretionary contractual nature. Some employers promised not to reduce a pension once it had
been granted, although “that promise rested on the integrity of the company alone.”44 At the
same time, an increasing number of large companies began to centralize personnel management.
Careful screening in hiring became more important in order to select loyal and meritorious work-
ers; in particular, a so-called “yellow-dog contract,” an employment contract which required a
worker to sign a statement to neither join nor organize a union while employed, became a com-
mon management practice.45 Personnel management conducted exit interviews to study causes
of separation and kept labor turnover records. Management also began to encourage the devel-
opment of ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital. In order to provide workers with better career prospects,
management increasingly developed a policy of internal promotion by merit. An increasing
number of employers provided on-the-job training for blue-collar workers and training courses
for foremen.46
       In addition to extensive welfare programs and centralized personnel management, major
employers took the initiative to set up works councils. A works council was a form of employee
representation within an individual establishment, by which employer and employees would con-
sult and cooperate in improving the employees’ welfare and resolving potential disagreements.
As noted above, employee representation plans were widely introduced by the federal government
to encourage industrial democracy during the war, but a majority of the plans were eliminated
after the war. When the unionization threat and high labor turnover pressed management,
however, works councils were voluntarily adopted by a considerable number of ﬁrms. Between
1919 and 1922, 317 ﬁrms adopted works councils, including the well-known examples of Inter-
national Harvester and Goodyear Tire & Rubber. In 1922, there were 385 ﬁrms with employee
representation plans covering 725 establishments and 690,000 workers (see Table 1).
       A typical works council consisted of an equal number of management and employee repre-
sentatives with the latter elected by and among themselves. In all but a few works councils, the

     The Supreme Court validated yellow-dog contracts in 1917 in the famous case of Hitchman Coal & Coke v.
Mitchell (245 U.S. 229). This decision had an enormous impact on diﬀusing such contracts among anti-union
employers.

workers’ representatives held merely advisory power, while management retained authority over
ﬁnal decisions and veto power. In many instances, a plan was dominated by management: a
membership meeting was little more than an announcement of company policies, and its impact
was inconsequential. In some instances, however, works councils had a sizable impact on the
shopﬂoor management. Some employers reported signiﬁcant improvements in workplace condi-
tions and morale after introducing employee representation. Some works councils served to curb
foremen’s discretionary actions by introducing grievance mechanisms.47 Workplace safety and
productivity growth were found to be positively correlated with the existence of works councils.48
There were also cases in which employees’ suggestions on workplace organization and machine
improvement led to an increase in productivity and an improvement in product quality. Finally,
some works councils helped managers and workers to cooperate in a period of recession and
realized work-sharing and wage reduction without provoking labor disputes.49
       Contract theory suggests that an employee representation plan can play an important role
in enforcing an implicit contract. In order to provide management with an incentive to honor
its implicit promise, employees should be able, ﬁrst, to monitor management’s action and, sec-
ond, to exercise coordinated sanctions when an employer reneges on a promise. With respect to
the former, formalization of welfare programs, grievance procedures, participation of employee
representatives in administration, and information sharing with management all enhanced the
employees’ monitoring ability. With respect to the latter, while individual ability to inﬂict
punishment on management was severely limited in a large establishment, an employee rep-
resentation plan enabled employees to take plant-wide coordinated actions such as sabotage,
slowdown, and strike. Furthermore, if an employee representation plan could improve labor
productivity and, thus, increase economic returns from cooperation, then, other things being
equal, management would have a greater incentive to honor an implicit contract.


3.3      Beliefs and Reputations for Employer Paternalism in the U.S.

During the 1920s, there were two alternative views of employer paternalism that divided opinions
of employers, workers, and government oﬃcials in the U.S. One view was that the industrial

  47
      E.g., at Bethlehem Steel, over 65% of 2,316 grievance cases brought by the works council were settled in favor
of the workers. See Slichter (1929), p.413; Fairris (1995), pp.512–3.

relations program would bring high productivity, industrial peace, and improvement of workers’
welfare through their share in labor-management cooperation. The other view claimed that
employer paternalism was a disguised form of management’s domination in order to “divide and
conquer” workers and thereby maintain an unequal distribution of wealth between capital and
labor.
      From a game-theoretic viewpoint, both views have justiﬁcation, since each view corresponds
to beliefs that support a particular equilibrium under repeated interactions; the former beliefs
are consistent with a cooperative equilibrium, the latter with an adversarial equilibrium. It
is important to observe that managerial discretion, essential to employer paternalism, was a
double-edged sword. On the one hand, it enabled management to attain high labor productivity
by selectively rewarding workers for their eﬀort, skill, and loyalty. On the other hand, it created
distrust among workers that management would renege and appropriate the returns from coop-
eration. Corporate welfare programs could not be legally enforced due to their contingency on
unveriﬁable variables; thus, they required internal enforcement based on long-term interactions
and reputation mechanisms.
      The importance of reputation was, in fact, recognized by contemporary management. The
National Industrial Conference Board (NICB), a research board backed by major employers’ as-
sociations, contended that farsighted management should value industrial relations programs, as
they could improve relations with consumers and local communities that would impact product
sales and recruitability of potential employees. The NICB further observed that “a company
may still exercise its discretion in adopting a policy for dealing with employees, but when min-
imum requirements are ﬁxed by law the state will enforce compliance with its regulations, and
beyond such minimum requirements public opinion may exercise compulsion.”50
      To build goodwill with the public, progressive employers in the U.S. widely promoted the
ideology of employer paternalism via public speeches and the press during the twenties. To
employees, management repeatedly declared that the interests of an employer and employees
were mutual and that management cared for the happiness of workers. To shareholders, the
proponents of welfare paternalism emphasized high economic returns from corporate welfare
programs, as they would bring the labor force and capital equipment to the “greatest joint
productive possibilities.” They further claimed that an individual worker represented a deﬁnite
investment opportunity, and appropriate human capital investment would “yield a fair return”

to employers.51
       Despite the employers’ campaign, many workers suspected that employers had hidden in-
tentions behind their benevolence. Some were afraid of becoming dependent on employers and
losing economic independence, which would make their positions more vulnerable. Most union-
ists believed that the employers’ sole objective was to undermine unionization eﬀorts and weaken
labor’s bargaining power; works councils, or “company unions” in their terminology, were por-
trayed as management-sponsored counterfeit organizations designed to displace real unions.52
To establish a good reputation with workers and the public, progressive employers had to prove
themselves trustworthy by their behavior; that is, by keeping their commitment in subsequent
periods.


3.4      Corporate Welfare Programs and Factory Committees in Japan

In Japan, high inﬂation triggered by the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05) gave rise to a sudden up-
surge of labor disputes in 1907.53 The public blamed the unfair distribution of wealth between
capital and labor, and the inhumane working conditions suﬀered by factory workers became
widely publicized. The unprecedented scale of labor unrest led both government and business
leaders to recognize the importance of labor-management relations. The government launched
factory legislation in 1909, aiming at establishing minimum working conditions in manufacturing
factories. Major employers ran a vigorous campaign against such legislation. They argued that
the traditional paternalism in Japan could be “naturally” extended to the employer-employee
relationship, where the employer’s mercy (jikei) should be reciprocated by the loyalty and devo-
tion of workers. A prominent manager at Mitsubishi, who was an early proponent of employer
paternalism, proclaimed that company welfare was more desirable than state legislation since
“once an order of the government comes in eﬀect, there is no kindness but a conﬂict of rights
and duties [in labor-management relations] and work itself would die out.”54 Although these
statements by management were more rhetorical than substantive, they capture the essence of
employer paternalism based on reciprocal trust and implicit promises, in contrast to government
regulations based on legalism.

      In 1906 there were 13 strikes and lockouts joined by 2,307 workers; in 1907, there were 60 strikes and lockouts

       Stimulated by the upsurge of labor disputes and the government’s move toward social leg-
islation, major employers promoted voluntary activities in the 1910s to improve the welfare of
their employees. Large establishments such as Mitsubishi Shipyards, Uraga Dock Company, and
Shibaura Engineering Work created a mutual-aid society that provided blue-collar workers with
various beneﬁts, such as sickness, injury, and death beneﬁts covering incidents both on and oﬀ
work. Most of these beneﬁts in large private factories exceeded the amount and coverage required
by the Factory Law, which was enacted in 1911 and enforced eventually in 1916. A shortage
of manufacturing workers during the Russo-Japanese War prompted the government to set up
vocational schools in order to systematically foster skilled workers. Private companies, such as
Shibaura Engineering Work and Ishikawajima Shipyards, began to send their workers to public
vocational schools at the companies’ expense.55
       The economic boom of the First World War brought about a rapid expansion of industrial
production in Japan. The number of male production workers in manufacturing establishments
increased dramatically between 1914 and 1919. Reﬂecting an acute labor shortage in heavy
industry, skilled workers were recruited or poached between factories, and the turnover rate of
workers increased sharply in 1916–18.56 Toward the end of the decade, the process of mecha-
nization advanced, and large private ﬁrms expanded their production scale substantially.57
       Despite the economic boom and labor shortage, high inﬂation and stagnant wages worsened
the living standards of Japanese workers during 1917–19.58 The number of labor disputes reached
an unprecedented level (see Table 2 and Figure 3), and the number of unions increased sharply
toward the end of the 1910s.59 In particular, the Japanese Federation of Labor, Sōdōmei, was
formed in 1919 based on existing craft unions. The newly formed unions forcefully demanded
legal recognition and the right to bargain collectively.
       As industrialization took oﬀ successfully in Japan, international recognition and high in-
dustrial growth became the government’s top priority. Responding to the foundation of the
International Labor Organization abroad and the surge of demand for collective bargaining at

     Hyōdo (1971), p.329. According to Gordon, the annual turnover rate in factories was roughly around 70 to
90%, some exceeding 100% (Gordon (1985), pp.87–9 and p.137).
  57
     In 1914–18, the number of factories with 1,000 or more workers increased from 85 to 160 and the percentage
of workers employed in those factories grew from 17% to 23% (Rōdōshō (1961a), p.117).
  58
     Real wages declined considerably in 1917–19. In particular, the price of rice shot up, causing the Rice Revolt
which spread across the country in 1918. Private companies, on the other hand, paid out high dividends to
stockholders during the war boom, which infuriated workers (Nakamura (1993), p.96).
  59
     There were 107 trade unions in 1918, 187 unions in 1919, and 273 unions in 1920 (NRUS (1959), p.424).



                                                        21
home, the Japanese government acknowledged in 1919 that it would not prevent “moderate”
labor unions from being established.60 In the same year, the government set up an independent
committee, Kyōchōkai, in order to promote “harmonious labor-management relations which
were of primary importance for industrial growth and peace of society.”61 Kyōchōkai proposed
the introduction of a “factory committee (kōjō iinkai),” modeled on employee representation
plans in Britain and the U.S. The government encouraged employers to voluntarily establish
factory committees in recognition of a need for some labor organization. The number of labor
disputes over the right to collective bargaining peaked in 1921, involving major manufacturing
establishments in heavy industry. Management ﬁrmly refused to recognize independent unions,
but compromised by establishing factory committees under its own initiative. Union leaders
initially supported the establishment of factory committees as a step towards the realization
of collective bargaining. As a result, more than a hundred private and state-owned companies
established factory committees by 1924 (see Table 3). In adopting factory committees, however,
management recognized the bargaining right exclusively with a group of its employees, while
excluding labor unions from the bargaining table. Furthermore, management tried to limit the
subjects of discussion to the enhancement of the workers’ welfare and productivity, excluding
wages, hours, and other working conditions. Union leaders soon came to perceive the factory
committee as an attempt to replace unions and pre-empt the labor movement.62
      After the First World War, Japanese business leaders sponsored various voluntary corporate
welfare programs, as shown in Table 4. In addition to a dining room, medical clinic, company
housing, discount purchases for daily necessities, and recreational and educational facilities for
the workers and their families, an increasing number of employers provided non-wage beneﬁts,
such as death, sickness, and injury beneﬁts exceeding legal requirements, life insurance, family
allowances, and saving plans. Large companies introduced attendance, seniority, and biannual
bonuses for blue-collar workers. The bonuses were given to workers whom management deemed
diligent, loyal, and decent-mannered. Retirement beneﬁts were provided to workers who retired
due to aging or sickness, who were dismissed by a company for business reasons, or who quit with
the company’s approval. The amounts of the beneﬁts were diﬀerentiated according to length
of service, reason for separation, and family considerations. Some companies also introduced

mandatory retirement.63 A periodic pay raise (teiki shōkyū) every three to six months was insti-
tuted in some large factories; the amount of the pay increase and the number of workers awarded
the raise were based on the worker’s skill, diligence and merit, under managerial discretion. As
a result, basic wages in large factories tended to increase with years of service.64
       As the mechanization of production proceeded and the volume of production increased, a job
category was divided into speciﬁc tasks within an establishment, and the skills of production
workers became increasingly specialized. Management invested in training and education to
foster loyal and reliable “in-house” workers. By the end of the 1910s, instead of using public
vocational schools, many large ﬁrms introduced company training programs for young workers.
To retain those who received training at the company’s expense, management designed appren-
ticeship contracts with various incentives. The Uraga Dock Company, for example, introduced
an apprentice contract that speciﬁed a three- to ﬁve-year training period with periodic wage
increases and a compulsory saving plan, which would return the savings plus interest only if
the apprentice completed the training and stayed with Uraga for ﬁve years afterwards.65 Fur-
thermore, management sought more direct control of work organization and labor management.
In large ﬁrms, oyakata (craftsmasters) were increasingly expelled or appointed as foremen and
placed within a ﬁrm’s managerial hierarchy. In an eﬀort to centralize personnel management,
major establishments created labor or personnel sections.66
       Management promoted harmonious and cooperative relationships between an employer and
employees within a factory under the ideology of employer paternalism (keiei kazoku shugi).
The management of Mitsubishi Nagasaki Shipyards claimed in 1921 that “fundamentally, there
is no special distinction between management and our workers. . . [W]e consider ourselves as
a unity of employees, of one large family.”67 Japanese management repeatedly emphasized
natural continuity between the Confucian tradition and employer paternalism; it was a conscious
reintroduction of “tradition” to a modern corporation, through which the management tried to
coordinate the beliefs of workers.
       Beginning in the late 1910s, employer paternalism based on corporate welfare programs,
centralized labor management, and factory committees increasingly prevailed in large manu-

facturing establishments in Japan. Despite the eﬀort of employers, a majority of production
workers, especially those who had skills, remained highly mobile and self-reliant. More than
half of the apprentices enrolled in in-house training programs in large factories left their compa-
nies after, if not during, the training period for better wage oﬀers. As long as workers remained
mobile, management had to keep hiring senior workers from the labor market in order to retain
enough skilled workers, contradicting its policy to value loyalty. And as long as there was a
demand in the labor market, workers kept moving among ﬁrms for better employment oppor-
tunities. Employers, too, behaved opportunistically at various times, arbitrarily eliminating
bonuses or periodic pay raises and occasionally conﬁscating employees’ savings.68
         In summary, when a small number of progressive employers in the economy initiated employer
paternalism, there were still strong incentives to renege on an implicit contract for both workers
and employers. As soon as one side deviated from an implicit promise, it was the best response
for the other side to deviate as well. It was not a simple task for employers and workers to
coordinate their actions and build mutual trust. Therefore, both in the U.S. and in Japan,
employer paternalism, initiated by a minority of employers in the late 1910s, required further
investment in reputational and other institutional capital if it was to prevail.


4         The Rise and Fall of Employer Paternalism under the Chal-
          lenge of Depression

When a business recession leads to deterioration in the ﬁnancial condition of ﬁrms, employers
have a stronger incentive to repudiate their implicit promises. A trade-oﬀ lies between the long-
run beneﬁt from maintaining a good reputation and the short-run cost of keeping the promises
in the midst of ﬁnancial distress. It is more likely that management will repudiate an implicit
contract if a recession is expected to be deeper and longer. In particular, when a recession
increases the likelihood of bankruptcy of the ﬁrm, the long-run return from maintaining its
reputation is accordingly discounted. In contrast, if a recession is expected to be temporary,
it may be rational for employers to honor their promises and “go out of their way” to help
their employees despite the adverse ﬁnancial circumstances. The following section examines
the impact of exogenous changes in macroeconomic conditions on employer paternalism in the
respective countries.

4.1      The Penetration of Employer Paternalism in Japan

The Japanese economy was troubled by successive negative economic shocks during the 1920s.
To enumerate, there were the post-WWI recession of 1920, the Washington Disarmament Treaty
in 1922 with its serious eﬀect on heavy industry, the Kantō Great Earthquake in 1923, the
Financial Crisis of 1927, and the Great Depression of 1929–32. The impact of each economic
shock, however, was relatively moderate and of short duration. In particular, as Table 5 shows,
Japan’s experience of the Great Depression was by far the mildest among industrialized countries.
Industrial production fell from the peak to the trough by 8 percent, but recovered within three
years. Consequently, for the proponents of employer paternalism, the twenties could be seen
as a period of learning the payoﬀs of oﬀ-the-equilibrium paths. While going through frequent
but short economic downturns, employers in large manufacturing companies learned the cost
of repudiating promises and the value of reputation, and they gradually developed a consensus
with workers on the standards and rules governing corporate paternalism.
      In the early 1920s, most employers were willing to ﬁre workers whenever business declined,
just as most workers were willing to quit whenever business prospered. Many employers reduced
or eliminated bonuses and suspended periodic pay raises in a recession. After the Disarmament
Treaty in 1922, major companies in heavy industry, including the proponents of welfare pa-
ternalism, went through a drastic rationalization of labor management, which involved wage
reductions and mass dismissals.69 It is important to note that workers protested against such
management behavior by organizing public demonstrations and strikes. Independent unions in
large companies fought ﬁercely against wage cuts and layoﬀs. When business deteriorated, the
major demands of labor disputes centered on the establishment of a formal retirement allowance
plan, an increased amount of severance pay, opposition to wage reductions and dismissals, and
reinstatement of the dismissed workers.70 The government also informally and repeatedly urged
employers not to dismiss a large number of workers at once, for fear of the social disorder that
might result from mass unemployment. Toward the late 1920s, local police frequently intervened
to prevent labor disputes. More often than not, local police mediated in an anti-dismissal labor
dispute in favor of workers, settling for higher dismissal compensations. Kyōchōkai also played
an active role in mediating major labor disputes, in which labor’s demands were incorporated to
a considerable extent. Gradually, workers’ protests and informal government pressure against

dismissal made major employers circumvent layoﬀs by other means, such as reduction of work-
ing hours, relocation of workers, and creation of relief work within a company.71 In addition,
management of large companies developed institutional innovations during the 1920s in an eﬀort
to maintain their reputations for paternalism, while surviving the economic downturns. Among
them were a voluntary retirement system and a temporary-worker system, both of which came
to be known as part of the so-called “Japanese employment practices” in the postwar period.
       When a recession forced employers to reduce their workforce, they carefully designed a pro-
cedure for dismissal. Large factories proposed augmented dismissal compensation and asked for
workers who would voluntarily retire (kibō taishoku) until the number of necessary dismissals
was reached. The word “voluntary” meant that workers were consulted in advance and that
dismissals were the result of consent rather than unilateral imposition. In addition, the sum of
dismissal compensation was nontrivial. In the early 1920s, many large ﬁrms expanded and for-
malized the existing retirement allowance plans (taishoku teate seido). For example, Mitsubishi
Shipyards introduced a new plan fully funded by the employer in 1920. The amount of the
beneﬁt increased with length of service in the case of mandatory retirement at age ﬁfty or earlier
retirement caused by sickness or injury. If retirement was initiated by the worker for private
reasons, then the worker received only 20 to 50 percent of the full beneﬁt, depending on the
years of service. If retirement was initiated by the employer for business reasons (i.e., voluntary
retirement), a special increase was added to the full beneﬁt. Table 6 shows the average retire-
ment allowance plans for machinery and metal workers in ﬁrms with more than 200 employees
in 1932. Such retirement allowance plans prevailed in large establishments and then gradu-
ally spread among medium-sized ﬁrms toward the mid-1930s. The voluntary retirement system
and retirement allowance plans were eﬀective in moderating labor disputes associated with dis-
missals. During the anti-dismissal strikes, management often successfully persuaded workers to
accept a retirement oﬀer with a generous sum of money, and workers often appreciated such
arrangements. In some companies, factory committees served to communicate managerial de-
cisions, discuss retirement allowances, and cooperate in soliciting voluntary retirement.72 A
worker at the Mitsubishi Nagasaki Shipyard, who was dismissed after eighteen years of service,
said: “I am grateful for the company for it had treated me well in many aspects. . . It is too bad
that I was ﬁred this time given that I have a big family and a little saving, but fortunately I

received an excessive amount of retirement allowance. . . .”73 As Table 7 shows, a majority of
the employers who instituted a retirement allowance plan conformed to it during the depression
despite the fact that it was an extra ﬁnancial burden. For example, in 1931, the trough of the
Great Depression, 35,000 workers, or 60 percent of those who were dismissed due to business
reasons received allowances that amounted, on average, to six months’ worth of wages.
       Another innovation of Japanese management was the temporary-worker system (rinji-kō
seido). Starting in the early 1920s, large companies gradually changed the status of temporary
workers. Before the change, a temporary worker would be promoted to a regular worker after a
six-month trial period, provided his performance was satisfactory; after the change, the status
of temporary workers was often ﬁxed indeﬁnitely.74 Most employers provided a signiﬁcantly
lower level of wages and beneﬁts to temporary workers than to regular workers, even though
they performed similar tasks. In addition, temporary workers were denied employment security:
it was an established policy to hire temporary workers ﬁrst when business picked up and to ﬁre
temporary workers ﬁrst when business slowed down. Contemporary government oﬃcials deemed
the temporary-worker system as a necessary device that allowed industrialists to respond quickly
to market conditions, while protecting regular workers from frequent employment adjustments.
As a consequence of the change, the share of temporary workers in the total workforce in large
establishments increased sharply after the Great Depression.75
       By the early 1930s, an increasing number of skilled workers in large establishments began
to rely upon and expect to receive company welfare, which constituted a signiﬁcant portion
of their rewards. A study in 1931 shows that workers received a variety of welfare beneﬁts
that amounted to 10 to 20 percent of their wages (see Table 8). To be sure, the private ﬁrms
that provided welfare programs in the 1930s were still a minority in the economy, limited to
those who were large and prosperous (see Table 9). For business leaders, it increasingly became
their social responsibility, if not a social norm, to provide employment security to their regular
workers. A prominent national employers association, Zensanren, issued a statement in 1934
that characterized labor-management relations in Japan as being based on moral obligations
(giri) and warm human feelings (ninjō), as opposed to those based on legal rights and duties
under western individualism. The statement proudly claimed that “the variety of welfare plans

developed within the ﬁrms in our country is a stark representation of the spirit [of paternalism]
and is provided by the employers even though there is no such law or order.”76


4.2      The Impact of Employer Paternalism in Japan

As employer paternalism began to penetrate large factories, there are some indications that
it might have impacted workers’ behavior. First, towards the late 1920s, the turnover rate of
manufacturing workers exhibited a general tendency to decline (see Figure 5). In particular,
the turnover rate of male manufacturing workers in large establishments declined signiﬁcantly.77
When Japan’s aggressive military expansion after 1931 led the economy to recover from the
Depression, any slack in the workforce was taken up, and heavy industry again faced a labor
shortage in the mid-1930s. In spite of the labor shortage, however, the turnover rate in major
factories remained relatively low, in contrast to the previous time of economic expansion in the
late 1910s.78 There was a small but growing number of stable workers, or “company men,” in
those factories, who had been trained in-house and had worked for a single company.79
       Another indication was that, during the 1920s, the trade union movement gradually subsided
in every large manufacturing establishment. Although the number of unions increased steadily,
and the level of labor disputes remained relatively high throughout the 1920s, the size of unions
and the scale of disputes gradually declined. After 1930, the center of labor movement markedly
shifted to small and medium-sized ﬁrms. Despite the unionization drive of Sōdōmei and Hyōgikai,
a radical union formed under communism’s inﬂuence, neither craft nor industrial unionism
penetrated large establishments.80 In many strikes organized by independent unions in large
establishments during the early-1920s, employers ﬁred the union leaders after the incidents
and converted the unions into moderate and harmonious labor organizations. Ironically, the
dismissals during the recessions often enabled management to keep loyal and company-trained
workers while removing “radical elements” from a company, and thus consolidated harmony
between management and the remaining workers.81 In other words, dismissal constituted a
credible punishment for non-loyal workers during a recession, which increased workers’ incentive

to take a cooperative action. Consequently, in 1933, only 10 percent of the workers in large
factories with more than 500 employees belonged to unions. The total number of workers
covered by factory committees or other associations in 1934 exceeded 640,000, in contrast to the
total union membership of 380,000.82
      In summary, from the early 1920s to the mid-1930s, corporate paternalism came to pre-
vail among major Japanese manufacturing companies. Employers gradually learned a way to
maintain their reputations during moderate economic downturns, and, by the time the Great
Depression hit the economy in 1929, they had developed institutional arrangements that miti-
gated its impact on corporate welfarism. Consequently, major employers tended to honor their
promises during the Depression, realizing that failing to do so would result not only in costly
labor disputes, but also in a loss of reputation with the public and the government that would
invite unwelcome pro-labor legislation. At the same time, workers learned to appreciate employ-
ment security and other company beneﬁts during the recessions. Gradually, a consensus was
formed over deﬁnitions and rules governing implicit contracts. As a result, paternalistic em-
ployers began to enjoy more loyal and reliable workforces and an accumulation of ﬁrm-speciﬁc
human capital, while keeping trade unions away from their workplaces. The primary interest of
workers in large factories began to shift, from establishing solidarity across the working class, to
gaining membership and status in their own companies.83 The Japanese government supported
employer paternalism and harmonious labor-management relations from the viewpoint that they
would achieve industrial peace, social stability, and greater industrial production. Government
pressure against labor disputes and mass dismissals enhanced employers’ incentive not to re-
pudiate their promises. And as long as employer paternalism functioned, the government kept
its stance against trade unions. As a result, the demand for legal recognition of unions did not
materialize in prewar Japan, as we discuss later.


4.3     The Penetration of Employer Paternalism in the U.S.

In stark contrast to Japan, the 1920s in the U.S. were perceived as a “decade of prosperity.”
Business leaders promoted corporate welfarism with optimism, which gradually penetrated the
large ﬁrms toward the end of the 1920s.84 Table 10 shows that, in 1929, a variety of industrial re-
lations programs were seen predominantly in giant establishments with more than 1,000 workers

and, to some extent, in large and medium-sized plants. Even though progressive employers still
constituted a minority in the economy, just as in Japan during the same period, the following
observations suggest that corporate paternalism might have generated some of the impact its
proponents envisioned.
       First, labor productivity in manufacturing grew at an annual rate of 5.6 percent between
1919–29 compared to 1.2 percent during the previous decade. Second, job turnover in manu-
facturing establishments declined signiﬁcantly during the 1920s. As shown in Figure 2, when
business recovered from the post-WWI recession in 1923, the annual turnover rate soared to 90
percent; however, by early 1929, it was less than 40 percent despite the continuing economic
prosperity.85 Third, although at a modest pace, the economic conditions of the working class
improved steadily after the recession of 1921–22, and an increasing number of workers expected
that they soon could share in the economic prosperity based on American corporatism.86 Fourth,
the labor movement subsided despite the period of prosperity. Union density in the manufac-
turing industry declined by 10 percent between 1920 and 1930. Employees of most major ﬁrms
in mass production industries remained unorganized, even though they had been targeted by
organizing campaigns of the AFL.87 In an eﬀort to expand its membership, the AFL itself then
drastically turned to a policy of union-management cooperation, announcing that “more and
more, organized labor is coming to believe that its best interests are promoted through concord
rather than by conﬂict.”88 In other words, given the prevailing societal view that aggressive
trade unionism was harmful to economic prosperity, the AFL itself shifted its strategy from
confrontation to cooperation. The new policy was, however, shortly proven to be fruitless as
employers ﬂatly rejected such cooperation. Lastly, the number of employee representation plans
continued to grow, and in some instances, works councils were introduced at workers’ request.
The number of employees covered by employee representation plans doubled between 1922 and
1928 (see Table 1). By the end of the 1920s, it was estimated that more than 1.2 million workers
had signed yellow-dog contracts.89
       The federal and state governments backed corporate paternalism. The labor movement was

     The growth of per capita real income during the period of 1923–29 was 35% and that of the average manu-
facturing wage was 5% (Holt (1977)).

repressed not only by means of labor injunctions, but also by interventions against strikers by
federal troops, state militia, and local police. The open-shop movement promoted by busi-
ness leaders to free the workplace from union membership requirements had the full support of
the Republican government during the 1920s. In 1928, Republican candidate Herbert Hoover
won the presidency, receiving wide support from both business and labor.90 Hoover adopted a
“voluntarist corporatism” approach, in which he viewed the interests of labor and capital as es-
sentially harmonious, and encouraged employee representation plans for the mass of unorganized
unskilled workers.91
       To summarize, the 1920s was the ﬁrst prolonged period of prosperity in which management
appeared to have won its battle to conﬁne unionism and gain trust from workers, the public,
and the government through promoting corporate paternalism. In April 1929, a contemporary
manager declared that “the end of the strike era is in sight, and the next ﬁve years will see an
unparalleled gain in relationships of mutual understanding and goodwill between employee and
employer.”92


4.4      The Great Depression and Broken Promises in the U.S.

Beginning in October 1929, the Great Depression hit the American economy with unprecedented
depth and duration (see Figure 4). For the ﬁrst few years of the Depression, the proponents of
corporate paternalism made a considerable eﬀort to keep their promises under the expectation
that the Depression would soon end. Before resorting to layoﬀs, many employers cut back salaries
of executives and management, instituted extensive worksharing, and relocated workers.93 Some
companies introduced or augmented dismissal compensation when layoﬀs seemed inevitable.
General Electric announced its celebrated private unemployment insurance plan in 1930. In
early 1931, Eastman Kodak and others established the Rochester unemployment beneﬁts plan.
A main purpose of the plan, according to a Kodak manager, was to encourage greater eﬀort by
individual ﬁrms to “plan better, to spread work, and to adopt other means to prevent layoﬀs.”
       Part of the employers’ eﬀorts originated from their concern that “radical” legislation, such
as state unemployment insurance law, might be enacted unless industry took positive action.

                                                     31
The Hoover administration endorsed these employers’ private eﬀorts. Immediately after the
stock market crash, the President urged major business leaders not to reduce wages. He also
promoted a national “share-the-work” movement and further encouraged employers to provide
private relief in cases of laying oﬀ workers, while refusing to establish any public relief or state
unemployment insurance.94 By the end of 1931, the decline in industrial production reached
almost 40 percent.
       After the fall of 1931, the biggest companies, such as Ford and General Electric, announced
wage reductions, renouncing their public promises. Numerous companies followed suit. As Ta-
ble 11 shows, more than three-fourths of manufacturing ﬁrms surveyed cut hourly wages by
March 1932. These wage cuts, however, were just “the ﬁrst of a string of broken promises.” A
majority of large manufacturing companies reduced, inactivated, and sometimes entirely discon-
tinued their industrial relations programs.95 Table 12 shows the various programs discontinued
by large ﬁrms, although the report does not include any revision or inactivation of the plans.
Private unemployment insurance and pensions were cut back due to their insolvency.96 Em-
ployee stock ownership backﬁred under the stock market crash. More than a hundred works
councils were discontinued by 1932 (see Table 1), and many more became inactive after losing
employers’ ﬁnancial support. In the same year, worksharing reduced working hours so severely
that many workers were getting barely a subsistence level of payment, or what they called “star-
vation wages.” Workers who initially cooperated with ﬁrms to institute worksharing increasingly
found it arbitrarily and unfairly implemented by management.97 Eventually, despite the earlier
commitment to provide employment security in exchange for reduced wages and working hours,
management launched massive layoﬀs.98
       By July 1932, the trough of the Great Depression, the level of industrial production had fallen
by 60 percent from July 1929. During the same period, manufacturing employment dropped 40
percent and the total wage bill decreased by 60 percent.99 One-fourth of the labor force in the
U.S. had become unemployed by 1933, and workers who were laid oﬀ lost their eligibility or claim

     GE’s unemployment insurance fund went bankrupt in October 1931 (Schatz (1983), p.61). By 1933, not only

had left (Jacoby (1997a), p.73).

to various beneﬁts. While dismissals prevailed in the economy, in contrast to the case in Japan,
only a small number of manufacturing companies had institutionalized dismissal compensation
plans. In addition, the amount of severance pay for blue-collar workers was almost trivial, if
there was any.100 Furthermore, layoﬀs were often biased toward blue-collar workers and the
procedure for deciding who would be laid oﬀ appeared to be arbitrary and unjust in the eyes of
workers.101
       As a consequence, workers’ beliefs in their employer’s goodwill were considerably undermined.
Many workers were disillusioned by the loss of their savings and felt especially deceived when
they had been advised or urged by their companies to enter stock ownership plans or pension
arrangements.102 When Ford laid oﬀ a large number of employees in 1933, one worker bitterly
wrote to a union leader that he “had spent a lifetime helping to create a millionaire.”103 In the
same year, a noted industrial relations scholar observed that “this depression had undone ﬁfteen
years or so of good personnel work” and predicted that “labor is going to look to legislation and
not to personnel management for a solution of the unemployment problem.”104 An economist of
the time remarked in the same year: “It is painfully apparent that the program within a given
company can operate only within limits that are set by economic forces.”105
       In summary, reﬂecting the parallel institutional development during the 1920s, the initial
responses of the progressive employers and the governments in the U.S. and Japan to the Great
Depression in the respective countries were, to a remarkable extent, similar. In the U.S., however,
the unprecedented severity of the Great Depression and the comparative lack of institutional
arrangements eventually led the majority of American employers to repudiate their implicit
contracts, willingly or unwillingly. Empirically, it is hard to distinguish the case in which
management behaved opportunistically to take advantage of the situation from the case in
which management was indeed sincere, yet was forced to repudiate under extreme economic
conditions. A recent study by Jacoby (1997a) suggests that one could classify the proponents of
corporate paternalism roughly into three types: 1) those who were fully committed, were but hit

     In the automobile industry, the number of blue-collar workers declined by 50% between 1929–33, while the
equivalent ﬁgure for the white-collar was 25% (Bresnahan & Raﬀ (1991)). In Chicago, 40 % of skilled and 57% of
unskilled workers were unemployed in 1931, while only 7% of managers were unemployed (Cohen (1990), p.241).

so hard by the Depression that they breached the contracts; 2) those who were less committed
and broke their promises during the Depression despite their rhetoric of paternalism; and 3)
those who were fully committed and less aﬀected by the Depression, and were able to keep their
welfare programs relatively intact throughout the Depression.106 And it was the ﬁrst and second
types that constituted a large majority in the U.S., while the third type dominated in Japan.
As a consequence, in the U.S, nominal wage and working hours declined, non-wage beneﬁts were
cut back, and the probability of becoming unemployed rose sharply. The welfare of American
workers, even for those who were still employed, declined signiﬁcantly and a majority of workers
lost their trust in management.107 At this historical junction, however, management might have
rebuilt its reputation, convincing workers and the public that the Great Depression was a truly
exceptional and unanticipated event.


5    The Political Economy of Labor Legislation

This section shows how the change in employers’ action caused by the Great Depression sub-
sequently triggered an endogenous process of labor legislation, in which the U.S. government
shifted its stance from voluntarist corporatism (1929–32) to the largely pro-business policy of
the early New Deal (1933–35), and ﬁnally to a pro-labor policy after 1935. As a result, by the
end of the 1930s, the U.S. witnessed the emergence of a new set of institutions characterized
by a legal framework for collective bargaining, antagonistic union-management relations, and
the provision of state welfare programs. From a comparative point of view, we then explore
the political process of labor legislation in Japan during the same period. In contrast to the
U.S., the Japanese government gradually developed labor policies that were complementary to
employer paternalism.

     Due to a falling price level, the real hourly wage in the manufacturing industry increased by 10% between
1929–32, while the average weekly work hours declined more than 10% (U.S. Department of Commerce (1975)).
Therefore, the income of manufacturing workers who maintained their jobs declined only moderately. However,
even those employed lost various non-wage beneﬁts and faced a high probability of losing their jobs. Those who
became unemployed lost their income and received little unemployment compensation. In total, the expected
utility of the average worker in the manufacturing industry declined considerably during the Depression.

5.1      From Hoover to Roosevelt: Early New Deal Labor Policy in the U.S.

During the early years of the Depression, an increasing number of pro-labor bills were intro-
duced in Congress. President Hoover, however, vetoed a public unemployment agency bill and
denied any need of federal unemployment insurance. In 1932, Hoover belatedly and reluctantly
endorsed the Emergency Relief and Construction Act and the Norris-LaGuardia Act, both ini-
tiated by Congress. The Norris-LaGuardia Act declared full freedom for workers to organize
and drastically limited the use of federal court injunctions against strikes, and prohibited most
yellow-dog contracts. Despite its landmark importance, enactment of the law had little impact
since its eﬀectiveness was left uncertain depending on subsequent court interpretations.108
       In November 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected as the Democratic President, defeating
Hoover by a large margin, and the Democrats won a majority in Congress for the ﬁrst time
since 1918. Roosevelt’s victory was critically dependent on the support he gained from business
leaders.109 Roosevelt’s administration in 1932 was, thus, based primarily on a coalition of
northern business and southern agriculture, which did not include labor.
       In June 1933, the President introduced the most comprehensive plan of economic recovery,
the National Industry Recovery Act. The NIRA was, in eﬀect, pro-business legislation that
authorized business to form cartels, packaged with a public works program and one section of
labor provision that recognized the right of workers to bargain collectively. In the legislative
process, employers had vigorously opposed the inclusion of the labor provision but eventually
compromised, in exchange for obtaining a long-sought exemption from antitrust laws.110 The
labor provision, Section 7(a), recognized the right of employees to organize and bargain collec-
tively through representatives of their own choosing; prohibited employers from interfering with
that right; and outlawed yellow-dog contracts or any employment contract conditional on union
aﬃliation or activities.
       The ambiguous wording of Section 7(a) created various interpretations if not confusion. La-
bor leaders saw the NIRA as a Congressional sanction of organized labor for the ﬁrst time in
U.S. labor history. The labor movement surged immediately after the passage of the Act and
organized workers began massive strikes demanding union recognition.111 Management, on the

other hand, claimed that Section 7(a) approved works councils as legitimate bargaining rep-
resentatives and was unwilling to recognize trade unions. Within six months of the passage
of the NIRA, at least four hundred employee representation plans were created under employ-
ers’ initiative.112 Thus Section 7(a) triggered a ﬁerce rivalry between trade unions and works
councils.
    There were two contesting views of works councils in American society. A study by the
National Industrial Conference Board (NICB) forcefully argued that the works council was an
eﬀective form of collective bargaining in which management dealt directly and exclusively with
representatives of the workforce of each company in recognition that the matters of internal
plant policy should not be the subject of outside interference. On the other hand, a study by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics contended that most works councils were established by management
without giving employees an option between a trade union or a works council and, in contrast to
trade unions, they were entirely reliant upon management for ﬁnances, ineﬀective in handling
grievances, and unable to bring any pressure upon the employer.113 The reality of works councils
was a delicate mix of the two. Newly formed works councils conformed more to the latter view,
while those works councils which were established in the early 1920s and continued to operate
during the Great Depression tended to have support from employees.114 In fact, works councils
received almost thirty percent of the total valid votes cast in representation elections held by
the NLB between 1933 and 1935. The government attitude with respect to Section 7(a) was
also internally divided between pro-business NRA oﬃcials who were in favor of works councils,
and pro-labor NLB staﬀ who supported trade unions.115 Both trade unions and works councils
drastically expanded their respective memberships during the period of the NIRA, as shown in
Table 13. Union membership increased from 3.0 million in 1933 to 3.8 million in 1935, while the
number of employees covered by works councils increased from 1.3 million in 1932 to over 2.5
million in 1935.116
    Roosevelt’s program of economic recovery created more chaos than order. By 1935, it was

from 841 in 1932 to 1,695 in 1933.

      No deﬁnite data is available for the total membership of works councils in 1935. Lyon (1935, p.524) estimated
that it was between 2.5 million and 3 million at the end of 1934, and the research staﬀ of Bernheim & Van Doren
(1935, p.79) estimated that it was 2.5 million in April 1935.

increasingly clear to the eyes of the public that the Act contributed little to economic recovery.117
Consequently, the NIRA produced two rather unintended outcomes: one was the failure to
achieve economic recovery under employers’ initiative and self-regulation, and the other was the
unexpected success of organized labor stimulated by Section 7(a). The former led Roosevelt to
abandon voluntarist corporatism, while the latter enabled him to form a political coalition with
labor. To mark an end to the chaos, in May 1935 the Supreme Court reached its unanimous
decision declaring the NIRA unconstitutional as it granted undue power to the President with
vaguely deﬁned objectives.118


5.2      From Pro-Business to Pro-Union Labor Laws in the U.S.

Continuing economic depression and an increasing political voice of organized labor led to un-
usual gains of the Democrats in Congress in the mid-term election of 1934 after the Democratic
victory in 1932.119 In response, Roosevelt’s political position shifted markedly from an alliance
with industrialists to one with organized labor, forming the so-called “New Deal Democratic
Coalition.” Against this political backdrop, the President launched a series of pro-labor laws in
1935.
       Soon after the Supreme Court ruling against the NIRA, President Roosevelt signed the Na-
tional Labor Relations Act (referred to as the Wagner Act) in July 1935, establishing a new
legal framework for collective bargaining. The Act identiﬁed “the inequality of bargaining power
between employees who do not possess full freedom of association or actual liberty of contract,
and employers who are organized in the corporate or other forms of ownership association” as a
factor that aggravated the Depression. The Wagner Act was not the mere reinstatement of the
employees’ rights recognized in the NIRA. The Act went further to obligate employers to bargain
collectively and prohibit an employer from engaging in unfair labor practices, explicitly outlaw-
ing works councils initiated by management. The Act also created the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) as an independent quasi-judicial board with exclusive legal enforcement power
concerning labor relations. The Wagner Act posed a serious legal threat to employer paternal-
ism. In addition to works councils, the NLRB identiﬁed corporate welfare programs containing
discriminatory clauses against union members, as well as employee clubs and associations cre-

ated by management to foster harmonious relations, as unfair labor practices.120 Moreover, in
the same year, the Roosevelt administration enacted the Social Security Act, which introduced
compulsory state unemployment compensation and federal old-age pensions. The Social Secu-
rity Act was the “radical legislation” business leaders feared. State provision of social security
signiﬁcantly reduced the returns from voluntary corporate welfare beneﬁts oﬀered by progressive
employers.
       Major employers immediately launched a vigorous campaign against the Wagner Act and
Social Security Act, ﬁling numerous legal challenges to their constitutionality. Bethlehem Steel
conducted an extensive campaign to convince their employees and the public that, by eliminating
company unions, the Act would “destroy harmonious relations between workers and manage-
ment.” The NICB published an extensive survey on the industry relations programs practiced
by employers and challenged the necessity of any government intervention in labor-management
relations. The National Association of Manufacturing distributed a bulletin claiming that unfair
labor practices did not apply to most manufacturing industries. Within its ﬁrst year, the NLRB
encountered more than eighty injunctions granted by the courts.121
       Endorsed by Congress, in June 1936, the La Follette Committee began its Congressional
investigations of employers’ infringements of civil liberties.122 The Committee soon revealed
that major business leaders, such as General Motors, had engaged in anti-labor practices (e.g.,
spying, arming, strikebreaking) during the NIRA period. In 1937, the Committee reported
that “industrial espionage was found to be a common, almost universal, practice in American
industry” and that it identiﬁed a strong correlation between the decline of labor unions and the
increase in company expenditures on labor detective agents.123 Further, the Committee found
that employers had spent a huge budget on munitions for labor disputes, such as machine guns,
pistols, and gas bombs to arm their strikebreakers and private police force, while labor had spent
nothing.124 In short, the La Follette Hearings presented concrete evidence of unlawful anti-labor
practices commonly exercised by prominent business leaders. As a result, it served to justify
the Wagner Act’s sweeping prohibition of unfair labor practices. The reputations of progressive

employers, which had been eroding since the early 1930s, collapsed.
       In November 1935, the leader of the United Mine Workers, John Lewis, established the Com-
mittee of Industrial Organization (CIO) to promote industrial unionism among unskilled and
semi-skilled workers in mass-production industries. The CIO unions widely introduced a radical
tactic called a “sit-down strike,” which was eﬀectively an illegal seizure of an employer’s private
property. In 1937, the number of work stoppages more than doubled from the previous year,
including nearly ﬁve hundred sit-down strikes and mobilizing almost two million workers. The
contemporaneous developments in the La Follette Committee investigation, however, consider-
ably moderated the public sentiment against the sit-down strikes.125 The government rarely
intervened in labor disputes against organized labor, despite its obvious militancy.126 The La
Follette Hearings also forced employers to give up the use of anti-union violence, contributing
to favorable strike settlements for labor.127 Despite employers’ strong opposition to industrial
unionism, the CIO unionized major manufacturing industries, such as automobile, rubber, iron,
steel, and electric machinery, after 1937. Union density, deﬁned as the rate of trade union mem-
bership among non-agricultural employees, increased from 14.1 percent in 1936 to 18.7 percent
in the single year of 1937.
       In November 1936, Roosevelt won his second presidential election with overwhelming support
from the working class and organized labor.128 Immediately after his reelection, President
Roosevelt pressured the Supreme Court, which had consistently ruled against the New Deal
legislation, by proposing a reorganization of the Supreme Court. In 1937, the Supreme Court
validated the constitutionality of the Wagner Act and the Social Security Act.129
       The legal obstacles were, thus, ﬁnally cleared and the NLRB started to energetically pursue
its goals. Between 1935 and 1941, the NLRB found some 1,200 cases of company unions in
violation of the Act, ordering their disestablishment. In many cases, employers were compelled
to dissolve company unions, while in a small number of cases, they were reorganized into “in-
dependent local unions,” which were single-employer unaﬃliated unions ﬁnancially independent

     Roosevelt received 61% of the popular vote, gaining new support from northern white industrial workers and

of the employer.130 A majority of company unions became CIO or AFL aﬃliates by the vote
of employees under the unionization drive. Between 1935 and 1941, the AFL gained 2.0 million
members and the CIO gained 2.7 million members. By the early 1940s, it was evident that works
councils had lost the battle against trade unions.131 In summary, the Wagner Act brought an
end to labor-management relations based on employee representation plans in most manufac-
turing establishments. Instead, it laid a legal foundation for new industrial relations based on
collective bargaining through trade unions organized across ﬁrms within industries.


5.3      From Implicit to Explicit Employment Contracts in the U.S.

The NIRA and the Wagner Act created a signiﬁcant impact on employment relations in private
companies. An NICB study reported that the share of large ﬁrms with trade union agreements
increased from 12.6 percent in 1933 to 42.8 percent in 1939 (see Table 14).132 The penetration
of trade unions was driven by two main factors. First, there was the workers’ distrust in their
employers, induced ﬁrst by the repudiation of implicit contracts and then by the result of the
La Follette investigation, which seriously discredited corporate paternalism in the eyes of the
public. Second, the Wagner Act provided legal protection of the workers’ right to organize and
severely restricted employers’ strategies. Yellow-dog contracts and other discriminatory welfare
plans contingent on union membership or activities were outlawed, which deprived employers
of a legal means to keep employees from joining unions. Consequently, for many workers, it
became a dominant strategy to join trade unions.
       Most employers responded aggressively to trade unionism, with a belief that unions would
not only demand higher wages, but also undermine cooperative employer-employee relationships
within a company. The processes of union recognition in the late 1930s were, thus, extremely
confrontational and violent. As a result, antagonistic labor-management relations, based on the
view that the interests of employer and employees were essentially in conﬂict, took root in most
unionized companies. Moreover, this adversarial relationship led to the subsequent development
of an explicit and legalistic collective agreement, as follows.
       A marked change in the employment policy of companies during the 1930s was the shift
from implicit agreements to explicit rules. Toward the late 1930s, many companies started to

make their employment policies and work rules written and public. Previously, an employer
would “ﬂatly refuse to put his labor policies in writing on the grounds that if he did so he and
his executives would be committed to make them eﬀective.”133 In other words, under employer
paternalism, a company tended to keep its employment policy internal, and its details were
governed by informal practices or implicit agreements between an employer and employees to
retain ﬂexibility and discretion. In contrast, under collective bargaining with unions, employers
discovered the merit of explicit and detailed rules and policies in winning disputes with unions
and protecting managerial prerogatives. For example, a number of major employers introduced
job analysis and evaluation in order to rationalize wage rates. Management expected that a
systematized wage structure based on an explicit and objective job analysis would forestall union
complaints and establish a managerial prerogative in wage determination.134 In the meantime,
legal enforceability of collective agreements had been increasingly established by courts. For
the ﬁrst two decades of this century, collective agreements had generally been moral, rather
than contractual, obligations. After the ﬁrst ruling of the court in 1920 that reinstated a union
contract that was violated by employers, however, the courts in various states came to recognize
collective agreements as legally binding contracts.135 Since the late 1920s, court injunctions had
been frequently granted to compel the observance of collective agreements breached by employers
or unions, although it was not until the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947 that legal enforceability of
collective agreements was established by federal law.136
       Union oﬃcials also found it advantageous to conclude an explicit collective agreement based
on legal enforcement that would restrict managerial discretion. Unions helped management in
setting up third-party grievance arbitration as the ﬁnal step of a grievance procedure. Many
unions demanded the establishment of the seniority principle as an objective and impersonal
standard that would reduce foremen’s discretion regarding personnel matters.137 As a result of
collective bargaining, management increasingly accepted the seniority principle in layoﬀs and,
to a lesser degree, in promotions and transfers. Nearly 70 percent of unionized ﬁrms estab-
lished layoﬀ-rehire systems under explicit and elaborately deﬁned seniority rules. By the early
1940s, “industrial jurisprudence” emerged in unionized American ﬁrms, requiring management

     According to the seniority principle, workers were laid oﬀ in an inverse order of seniority and rehired in the
order of the seniority, guaranteeing greater job security to those who held longer tenure.

to conform to the rules established by a collective agreement.138
       Consequently, after the passage of the Wagner Act, employment relations in American man-
ufacturing ﬁrms were increasingly characterized by collective bargaining between employer and
trade unions, an explicit and elaborate employment contract relying on legal enforcement, cen-
tralized and bureaucratized labor management, and adversarial labor-management relations.
Corporate paternalism declined toward the end of the 1930s, due to the prohibition of works
councils and other employer-sponsored organizations, the unions’ opposition to discretionary
non-wage beneﬁts, and the introduction of compulsory state welfare programs. These trends
were further reinforced during the Second World War, leading to the establishment of the Amer-
ican employment system in the postwar era.


5.4       Labor Legislation under Imperial Democracy in Japan

As we documented, government labor legislation in the U.S., triggered by the Great Depression,
eventually led to a drastic transformation of employment relations in private manufacturing
ﬁrms. From a comparative perspective, we explore, ﬁrst, why legal recognition of trade unions
did not take place in pre-war Japan, despite the fact that labor union bills were repeatedly
submitted to the Diet, and, second, how government labor policies developed in a way that was
complementary to corporate paternalism in Japan.
       As the economy grew stronger, one of the primary concerns of the Japanese government was
to gain international recognition among industrialized countries. Because Japan was repeat-
edly accused of “social dumping,” i.e., exporting cheap manufacturing goods at the expense of
workers’ conditions in domestic factories, the improvement of the working conditions became a
government priority in the 1920s. As a result, progressive bureaucrats of the Home Ministry
began to gain a voice within the government. Furthermore, since the early 1900s, the elective
Lower Diet had signiﬁcantly increased its political power vis-à-vis the non-elective, oligarchic
Upper Diet. By the 1920s, two major political parties had emerged in the Lower Diet: the
conservative, rural-based, and pro-business party, Seiyūkai, and the liberal, urban-based, and
relatively pro-labor party, Minseitō. The Japanese government was run under a two-party po-
litical system from 1924 to 1931, during which the democratic movement culminated in Japan,
even though it was under the imperial regime.139

       The ﬁrst labor union bill in Japan was introduced to the Diet in 1921, stimulated, in part, by
the establishment of the International Labor Organization. The bill was aborted due primarily to
a disagreement within the government between the pro-industrialist Agricultural and Commerce
Ministry and the pro-labor Home Ministry. Reﬂecting their respective positions, the former
emphasized a need to regulate and monitor unions, whereas the latter insisted on recognizing
and protecting workers’ right to organize.140
       In 1925, the Diet passed a revised election law, introducing universal male suﬀrage that
quadrupled the number of qualiﬁed voters (see Table 15), and repealed Article 17 of the Peace
Police Law that had been applied against organized labor. In the same year, a liberal labor
union bill was drafted by progressive bureaucrats of the Home Ministry. The bill gained support
from labor leaders and intellectuals, while it invoked vigorous opposition from pro-business min-
istries and employers’ associations. Among other points, employers were especially against the
provisions that prohibited yellow-dog contracts and discriminatory discharges of union members.
The bill was modiﬁed substantially in favor of employers during deliberation, incorporating re-
strictions on workers’ right to strike, and then was submitted to the Diet. The revised bill,
which invited strong opposition from both enraged labor unions and unsatisﬁed employers, was
ﬁnally dropped in 1926.141
       In the ﬁrst election under universal male suﬀrage in 1928, Minseitō made a substantial
gain in the Diet, reﬂecting a growing political voice of the working class. The liberal Minseitō
cabinet formed in 1929 was, therefore, determined to pursue union legislation. The government
commissioned the Social Bureau of the Home Ministry to draft a labor union bill. The so-
called “Social Bureau draft” included provisions that exempted unions from liability for strike
damages and outlawed yellow-dog contracts and other discriminatory treatment against union
members. Yet, at the same time, it authorized local governments to alter union constitutions
and dissolve unions if necessary. Employers’ associations immediately organized a united front
to campaign against the bill. The Japanese Industrial Club published a statement claiming
that its enactment would legitimate and encourage militant unions inﬂuenced by socialism, and
that it would endanger spontaneous labor organizations that had “greatly contributed to the
establishment of mutual trust between labor and capital, the improvements in technology and
eﬃciency, and the enhancement of the happiness and interests of workers.” Home Ministry

oﬃcials, on the other hand, argued that the vaunted employer paternalism in Japan rested
entirely on the “whims of capitalists,” oﬀering no solution to the mounting labor disputes in
the society, and that true labor-capital harmony would result only when both sides were on an
equal footing.142
       The above discussions between Japanese employers and government oﬃcials in 1930 exhibit
a striking similarity to the debate between American management and labor oﬃcials during the
legislative process of the NIRA in 1933. Furthermore, in response to the Great Depression, the
Japanese government introduced the Important Industry Control Ordinance, which implemented
cartelization of business under government supervision in 1931, the same year when the union
bill was submitted to the Diet. In other words, the U.S. and Japan came to similar political
crossroads in the early 1930s, at which the two countries parted ways. In contrast to the
U.S., where the cartel provision failed and the labor provision successfully stimulated organized
labor, in Japan, the cartel legislation was more or less successful and the union legislation was
eventually blocked, as described below.
       As the government prepared to submit the labor union bill to the Diet, the industrialists’
oﬀensive further intensiﬁed, leading to the formation of Zensanren, the Association of National
Industrial Groups, under which all the employers’ associations were united in opposition to
union legislation. Employers argued that, in the midst of the current economic depression, legal
recognition of unions would provoke even more labor disputes and create grave consequences
for industrial development. The government was ﬁnally compelled to amend the Social Bureau
draft, and a revised draft was submitted to the Diet in 1931. The bill was approved by the
Lower Diet, but was shelved by the Upper Diet where industrialists had stronger inﬂuence.143
Any further attempt at union legislation by a ruling party was dropped after the defeat of the
bill in 1931, the year in which the Manchurian Incident broke out and political power eﬀectively
fell into the hands of the military. Subsequently, the union movement rapidly subsided in Japan.
       In summary, management scored a political victory in convincing the public and the govern-
ment that recognition of organized labor would destroy industrial harmony and impede industrial
production. In contrast to the solidarity of industrialists, labor unions were unable to overcome
internal disunity and failed to obtain wide support from the working class in pursuing labor
union legislation. Organized labor in Japan, thus, could not provide reliable political support

for the government as the AFL did in the legislative process during the New Deal period. At
the same time, as a majority of Japanese employers maintained their corporate paternalism in
the midst of the Depression, they had better reputations than American business leaders. As a
result, in Japan, big business gained further political voice, whereas organized labor gradually
lost its political inﬂuence. This led further to the formation of pro-paternalism labor policies in
the mid-1930s.


5.5       The Formation of Pro-Paternalism Policies in Japan

During the period of so-called “imperial democracy” in the 1920s, the Japanese government ini-
tiated a series of pro-labor measures that substantially upgraded the previous legal requirements
of working conditions and non-wage beneﬁts.144 For the proponents of employer paternalism,
this posed a serious threat to the viability of their corporate welfare programs. During the
legislative process, employers’ associations and local chambers of commerce lobbied strongly
against these measures. As a result, most of the legal requirements were set signiﬁcantly lower
than the existing welfare practices in large companies, preserving incentives for major employ-
ers to continue their programs, while stabilizing the workers’ welfare by creating some legal
minimum. Government labor policies also played a role in institutionalizing existing corporate
welfare programs and propagated them to smaller-sized ﬁrms in the economy.
       The above aspect of labor policies can be best seen in the Retirement Allowance Fund Law
enacted in 1936. The law was ﬁrst discussed in 1932, as unemployment became a serious so-
cial concern during the Depression. Zensanren, the largest employers’ association, immediately
opposed the introduction of unemployment insurance and, instead, emphasized the unique ex-
istence of retirement allowance plans developed by Japanese employers to foster “warm and
moral” labor-capital relations. Given this view, as well as the lack of a budget and experience
in implementing national unemployment insurance, the government drafted a law that incorpo-
rated an aspect of unemployment insurance into the existing retirement allowance plans. The
Retirement Allowance Fund Law of 1936 required every ﬁrm with ﬁfty or more employees to set
up funds for a retirement allowance and established a minimum amount of allowance depending
on the length of service and the reason for separation. During the legislative process, a clause
which guaranteed that all workers would receive their full allowance regardless of the reason for
separation was eliminated due to the strong opposition of business leaders. Employers also won a

                                                45
provision allowing companies with existing retirement funds of suﬃcient scope to continue their
previous plans with little modiﬁcation. Nevertheless, the Law extended the existing plans to
cover workers with shorter lengths of service. In particular, since poorly compensated temporary
workers had become a serious social problem in the mid-1930s, the Law required an employer
to pay a retirement allowance for every worker with service longer than six months, regardless
of his employment status.145 In short, the Retirement Allowance Fund Law was “an ingenious
variant of unemployment compensation [...] that did not simply rely on the dubious benevo-
lence of employer, but did explicitly link a worker’s ‘entitlement’ to unemployment beneﬁts to
the quality of his service to a particular employer.”146 Thus, in contrast to the Social Security
Act of 1935 in the U.S., unemployment beneﬁts in Japan developed in a way that reinforced
existing corporate practices. Consequently, government labor policies in the U.S. and Japan
evolved in diﬀerent directions in the 1930s.


6       Government Labor Regulations during W.W.II

The Second World War (1939-45) induced enormous government intervention in both the U.S.
and Japan. The respective governments introduced sweeping labor regulations that were pow-
erfully enforced, not only by legal methods, but also by coercive measures under wartime emer-
gency. Even though the government exercised its supreme power during the war, two main
factors bound government actions. First, in designing regulatory policy, the government was
constrained by the existing institutional capital in the economy (e.g., technology, legal frame-
work, informal practices, reputations) that reﬂected past development. Second, in enforcing any
regulation, the government was subject to the strategic responses of private agents who often
possessed private information and tried to evade laws that were against their interests. Con-
sequently, not only did the government tend to develop labor regulation modeled on prevailing
private employment practices, but regulations that were not compatible with existing practices
also turned out to be less eﬀective. As a result, even though the U.S. and Japanese governments
pursued similar objectives during the war — maximum industrial production and minimum la-
bor disputes — labor regulations in the respective countries diﬀered considerably in important
aspects, reﬂecting their distinctive institutional developments prior to the war.

6.1       Employment Stabilization and Wage Control in the U.S.

The massive government spending on defense production stimulated tremendous economic growth
in the U.S. (see Figure 4). As the booming economy and the military draft gave rise to a serious
labor shortage during 1942–45, the federal government launched a series of far-reaching labor
regulations and established powerful agencies for their planning and implementation.
       Beginning in 1941, the federal government implemented employment stability plans to restrict
labor mobility. The plans promoted intra-industry standardization of employment conditions
and work arrangements to reduce labor poaching and wage inﬂation. Employers in manufac-
turing plants were urged to deﬁne job titles according to standardized classiﬁcations and to use
standardized methods of job analysis and evaluation. For eﬀective and easy job training, the
government promoted job simpliﬁcation and urged employers to create promotion lines, which
enabled employees to acquire necessary skills by progressing up job ladders. In addition, the
government created national training programs, such as the Training Within Industry (TWI)
for foremen, contributing to the diﬀusion of standardized shopﬂoor management across the in-
dustry. Furthermore, government wage control programs compelled employers to systematize
and rationalize their wage determination. Wage negotiations between unions and management
under the regulation led to the establishment of explicit links between wage rates and job titles
among many manufacturing ﬁrms. As the Fair Standards Act of 1942 obligated employers to
record the wages and hours of every employee, management was also urged to create a personnel
department in order to compile job classiﬁcations, turnover records, promotion plans, and wage
rules. Consequently, systematized personnel policies — centralized employment, standardized
job analysis, merit ratings and seniority provisions in promotions and layoﬀs — which had been
increasingly adopted by large ﬁrms since the 1920s, spread dramatically during the war among
medium- and small-sized ﬁrms under government supervision (see Table 16).147
       In addition to the employment stability plans, the federal government launched direct control
of labor mobility. In 1942, workers departing from jobs in high-priority industries were required
to obtain an “certiﬁcate of separation,” while employers in those industries were directed not to
dismiss employees without government approval. Although there was no provision specifying a
legal means of enforcement, the government used various methods to exert pressure on workers
and employers to compel conformity. For example, a worker who failed to obtain a certiﬁcate was

                                                         47
subject to modiﬁcation or cancellation of draft deferment or other employment privileges, while
an employer who disobeyed the instructions lost subsequent government contracts. Mobility
control was soon extended to other manufacturing industries. Although it is hard to measure
the exact eﬀect of government mobility control, the data show that the average annual turnover
rates of manufacturing workers remained extremely high, sometimes exceeding 100 percent,
during 1942–45 (see Figure 2). The high turnover was due, in part, to the mobilization of labor
from low-priority to high-priority industries and, to a lesser extent, the military draft. Much of
the turnover, however, was initiated by workers despite the government regulation.148
       In the meantime, wage regulation triggered a revival of corporate welfare beneﬁts in manufac-
turing companies, since management could adopt relatively generous non-wage beneﬁts without
government approval. During the war, welfare plans — such as group insurance, pensions, proﬁt
sharing, paid vacation, family allowances, and medical services — ﬂourished as employers at-
tempted to reduce turnover and raise labor productivity under the extremely tight labor market
and stringent wage control.149 It is important to note, however, that trade unions soon de-
manded establishment of these beneﬁts as a contractual right and tried to expand the scope of
collective bargaining beyond wages and hours. A legal battle between management and unions
subsequently ensued and was eventually settled in the postwar period, as described later.


6.2       Labor-Management Relations during W.W.II in the U.S.

In regulating labor-management relations during the war, federal government intervention was
motivated by two main concerns: preventing industrial disputes and increasing production ef-
ﬁciency. The War Labor Board and the War Production Board respectively instituted various
measures in achieving these goals.
       As wartime inﬂation and long working hours pressed production workers in the U.S., the
number of labor disputes increased sharply in 1941. To prevent costly production interruptions
due to disputes, President Roosevelt set up the War Labor Board consisting of representatives
from business, labor, and the government. The WLB compelled resistant employers to recognize
trade unions as bargaining representatives, while urging unions to cooperate with employers
in the war eﬀort. The WLB also granted union security provisions (e.g., the maintenance
of membership, union shop, dues check-oﬀ) that stabilized unions’s membership and ﬁnancial

structure. Under government pressure, union membership grew substantially during the war,
and the number of workers covered by collective agreements rose from 30 percent in 1941 to 48
percent in 1945. In exchange, the WLB demanded a “no-strike pledge” and responsible unionism
from union leaders. The board was particularly concerned about an increasing number of strikes
initiated by rank and ﬁle workers without union authorization. Although the WLB had no legal
enforcement power, it cultivated national sentiment against wartime strikes and used cancellation
of contract provisions to punish union noncompliance. Later, the War Labor Disputes Act of
1943 empowered the President to seize private plants of strategic importance and forbade strikes
at government-owned plants. The number of labor disputes declined in 1942, but increased again
toward the end of the war. As Table 17 shows, however, the average duration of work stoppages
remained short throughout the war, indicating some eﬀect of the regulatory measures.150
       For prompt settlement of disagreements over the interpretation of collective agreements, the
WLB encouraged management and labor to establish a formal grievance system with third-party
arbitration. Under the no-strike pledge, unions were obliged to take unsettled grievances ﬁrst to
private arbitration, then to state mediation, and eventually to federal ruling. At the same time,
the WLB granted a set of managerial prerogatives, which neither required a union’s prior consent
nor were subject to union grievances. As a result, wartime measures tended to encourage an
explicit, well-speciﬁed, and elaborately-written collective agreement that was enforceable by a
legal third party. Gradually, government oﬃcials, personnel managers, and union representatives
accumulated legal expertise in negotiating contracts and handling disputes during the war,
creating a “common law” of labor-management relations that laid the foundations for American
industrial relations in the postwar period.151
       The federal government also intervened in labor-management relations to enhance plant ef-
ﬁciency. In 1942, confronted with a serious production situation, the War Production Board
advocated the introduction of a joint labor-management production committee at every manu-
facturing plant. The stated objective of the joint production committee was to raise plant pro-
ductivity through labor-management cooperation. In particular, management was encouraged
to involve labor in production planning, share information, and incorporate workers’ sugges-
tions to improve production processes. Initially, both management and unions expressed “fears
and distrust” over the WPB plan. Management was afraid that organized labor would take

over managerial prerogatives through participating in production. Union leaders suspected that
management would turn the joint production committees into “company unions” in unorganized
plants, or would use them to dominate trade unions in organized plants. To gain the consent
of both parties, the WPB had to declare that joint production committees should not inter-
fere with the existing collective bargaining procedures or grievance machinery. After cautious
inquiry, AFL and CIO executives endorsed the plan. Management then followed.152
       The joint production committee quickly spread, at least on the oﬃcial record, under patriotic
enthusiasm. Table 18 shows that, at its peak in 1944, there were 4,835 registered production
committees covering more than seven million workers, or roughly 40 percent of the workforce
in manufacturing and mining. However, closer examination reveals that more than half of the
registered committees were perfunctory, engaging only in war activities such as patriotic rallies
or not functioning at all. Fewer than one ﬁfth of the joint production committees dealt with
production and personnel problems. Successful committees nevertheless reported an increase in
production, reduction of costs, improvement of industrial relations, and better worker morale.153
The establishment of joint production committees left little impact on postwar employment
relations. A majority of employers concluded that engineering and personnel staﬀs were more
reliable than production workers in solving problems. Many unions claimed that, despite their
eﬀorts and concessions during the war, there had been no change in their status as production
partners. Within a few years after the war, 90 percent of the committees were eliminated.154
       In summary, the introduction of establishment-level joint committees by the government
turned out to be largely ineﬀective. Given the existing collective bargaining framework, vested
interests of employers and unions, and persistent mutual distrust between the two, even the
powerful leadership of the wartime government failed to coordinate management and labor and
bring about their cooperation.


6.3      Mobility Control, Training, and Wage Regulations in Japan

In 1937, the Japanese invasion of China led to the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. In June
1938, the National General Mobilization Law provided the military government with the supreme
power to mobilize material resources and manpower under centralized economic planning. The

government regulations extended from mobility and wage controls to labor-management relations
in private ﬁrms.
       The Second World War (1939–45) demanded a dramatic expansion of heavy industry, while
also drafting the most-needed adult male workers into a military force. The labor shortage inten-
siﬁed toward the end of the 1930s, and turnover of workers began to surge.155 Starting in 1939,
the Japanese government launched a series of regulations to restrict labor mobility and to con-
trol labor allocation. The government set up the National Registration System, which required
workers who possessed special skills to be registered with the government. The Employee Hiring
Control Ordinance of 1939 prohibited workers in heavy industry from changing jobs without
the permission of local governments, but had little eﬀect in reducing turnover. The Employee
Turnover Prevention Ordinance of 1940 then prohibited employers from hiring technicians and
production workers in military-related industries. The two ordinances were largely ineﬀective, as
both employers and workers kept engaging in illegal hiring and job switching, ﬁnding loopholes
in the regulations. In 1942, the government replaced them with a stricter measure, the Labor
Adjustment Ordinance, which forbade employment, dismissal, and voluntary separation of work-
ers in important industries without government permission. This Ordinance ﬁnally succeeded
in suppressing job turnover.156 According to government oﬃcials, however, these compulsory
measures often gave rise to discontents, complaints, workplace tensions, lower morale and pro-
ductivity, and organized and unorganized slowdowns in manufacturing establishments.157
       In stark contrast to the U.S., where mass production technology, job simpliﬁcation and
standardization, and utilization of unskilled and semi-skilled workers were vigorously pursued,
manufacturing ﬁrms in wartime Japan kept relying on general-purpose machinery and broadly-
trained, multi-skilled workers. In fact, to increase the supply of skilled workers, the government
encouraged corporate training based on the practices adopted by large establishments since the
late 1910s. The Skilled Employees Training Ordinance of 1939 required employers to provide
three-year training programs within a company to foster “skilled mainstay workers (chūken
jukuren-kō).”158 The eﬀect of compulsory training programs was, at best, mixed. The govern-
ment tried to impose a standard training program combined with moral education and military
drills, which considerably undermined the ﬂexibility and practicality of corporate training. Em-

 155
     The annual turnover rate of factory workers increased from 45.6% in 1937, to 47.4% in 1938, and to 55.2% in
1939 (Ōhara Shakai Mondai Kenkyūsho (1964), p.41).

ployers often secretly simpliﬁed or shortened training in order to allocate more workers to pro-
duction, rather than to training supervision. In some instances, one-third of the workers enrolled
in the programs reportedly quit their ﬁrms before completing the three-year training period. In
1943, recognizing the extraordinary labor shortage, the government drastically shortened the
required training period from three years to one year.159 After 1944, eﬀective training was no
longer feasible, as labor conscription brought a large number of inexperienced workers to the war
factories. In a small number of large ﬁrms, such as the Hitachi Engineering Works and Tōshiba
Electronics, however, corporate training and technical education continued throughout the war,
preserving their highly skilled employees and technicians and contributing to the postwar growth
of the companies.160
       Early in the war, there was little systematic eﬀort to protect skilled workers from the military
draft, due largely to a coordination failure between military and civil oﬃcials. Consequently,
a signiﬁcant portion of skilled male workers were drafted by the early 1940s. The government
belatedly gave deferment or moratorium to the indispensable workers and technicians in high-
priority industries in 1942. Even after 1942, however, many skilled workers were reportedly
drafted.161 Meanwhile, the shortage of skilled workers in conjunction with a shortage of raw
materials greatly hindered Japan’s war production. In 1941, the government introduced the Na-
tional Conscription System, in which male workers in peace-time industries were conscripted and
sent to war factories designated by the government. The government also seized private factories
of strategic importance and “froze” the existing workers to those factories. Workers expressed
their strong antipathy toward labor conscription coerced by the government.162 In addition, the
government subsequently mobilized students, young females, foreign workers, prisoners of war,
and civilian criminals as substitutes for male skilled workers. As a result, the composition of the
workforce changed drastically (see Table 19): at the end of the war, two-thirds of the total labor
force in Japan were either conscripted or mobilized workers, and the percentage of skilled work-
ers to all production workers declined from 34 percent in 1941 to 22 percent in 1945. A manager
at the time remarked that, even though government labor mobilization prevented a decrease
in the total number of workers, the decline in the quality of skill was “more than imaginable.”

them gravely concerned employers.163 In 1943, government oﬃcials reported frequent incidents
of “disguised” disputes, such as negligence at work, escape, absenteeism, illegal job switching,
moonlighting, group violence, destruction of equipment, and producing defective goods. During
the war, labor productivity suﬀered greatly due to extremely high absenteeism, high rates of
defective products, and high accident rates.164
       The Japanese government, like the U.S. government, implemented stringent wage regula-
tions. In 1939, the Wage Control Ordinance put a ceiling on the starting wages of male workers
in strategic sectors in order to prevent labor poaching and wage inﬂation. Since the Ordinance
ﬁxed wages in important industries to levels lower than in other industries, it caused workers
to move from the important industries, contrary to the government’s intention. The Revised
Wage Control Ordinance of 1940 then established maximum, minimum, and average hourly
wages in virtually all industries corresponding to age, sex, occupation and region. Employers
hiring more than ten regular workers were obliged to set wage rules and submit them to the
local employment oﬃces.165 In 1942, the Essential Establishments Labor Control Ordinance
authorized the government to intervene in ﬁrm-level personnel management in important indus-
tries. Government oﬃcials were sent to manufacturing establishments to supervise every aspect
of personnel management, including hiring and ﬁring, working conditions, wages and beneﬁts,
educational and recreational facilities, and job allocation. Employers were required to ﬁle writ-
ten work rules and wage policies with the Welfare Ministry for its approval and to comply with
its orders for any alteration. The Welfare Ministry set “model wage rules” to which companies
were compelled to conform. The rules speciﬁcally stipulated a semiannual wage increase for
every worker with over six months of service and regulated an average rate of increase, as well
as a range of permissible increases. As a consequence, the Ordinance obligated management
to give pay raises to virtually all employees according to their seniority, while allowing limited
consideration of such components as skill and diligence in determining the amount of the raise.
The Ordinance also required ﬁrms to appoint a personnel director and to centralize personnel
management. As the application of the Essential Establishments Ordinance was extended to
the rest of the economy in 1943, seniority-based wages and centralized personnel management
were widely diﬀused among manufacturing ﬁrms.166

       The Japanese government imposed fewer restrictions on fringe beneﬁts, often exempting
them from wage control. To motivate workers and improve their productivity under low wages,
management relied on various allowances and welfare beneﬁts. Consequently, similar to the U.S.
case, corporate welfare programs proliferated under wartime regulation. Attendance bonuses,
overtime pay, retirement allowances, family and other special allowances diﬀused from large to
medium- and small-sized ﬁrms. Companies also provided their employees with beneﬁts in kind,
housing, and facilities for safety, sanitation, medical treatment, day-care, and recreation.167 The
diﬀerence from the U.S. was that, in the absence of trade unions, the welfare programs of the
Japanese ﬁrms continued to be unilateral and discretionary “gifts” from the employer to the
employees under the spirit of paternalism. Non-wage beneﬁts made up a greater part of the
compensations during the war and were received by Japanese workers with appreciation, under
the extreme shortage of goods for basic needs.


6.4      Labor-Management Relations during W.W.II in Japan

As in the U.S., Japan’s wartime government promoted industrial harmony in order to increase
production eﬃciency and eliminate labor disputes. Surprised by a surge of labor disputes in
1937, the government sought to regulate labor-management relations.168 To preempt govern-
ment intervention, Zensanren, the largest employers’ association, initiated a patriotic campaign,
advocating “unity of labor and capital” in pursuing industrial service to the nation. With
the government’s endorsement, this movement led to the creation of the Federation of Indus-
trial Patriotic Society, Sampō. Under state authority, the Sampō organization spread quickly
throughout the country. Within three years, 4.8 million or 70 percent of workers were covered
by Sampō.169 The government urged employers to set up Sampō councils (Sampō kondankai)
and practice joint employer-employee consultation concerning the improvement of productivity
and the welfare of workers. In many cases, employers converted their existing factory commit-
tees into Sampō branches. Despite the government pressure, most employers were reluctant to
encourage employee participation in management; instead, they emphasized patriotic education
and discipline to increase labor productivity.
       In 1939, the Sampō branches were placed under direct control of the Police Bureau of the

 167

     Both the number of workers involved and the man-days lost in disputes doubled in 1937 from the previous
year (NRUS (1959), IV-18).

Home Ministry. At this point, the government shifted its stance from tolerating moderate
unions to the displacement of unions by Sampō, and began to suppress labor disputes with
police intervention.170 The existing unions, including Sōdōmei, were forced to dissolve by 1941.
Consequently, the number of labor disputes declined after 1939, recording the lowest number
in 1941. However, it again rose sharply in 1943 despite the government control (see Figure 3).
Moreover, the suppression of disputes by force led the frustrated workers to engage in various
forms of workplace resistance such as sabotage, slowdown, and absenteeism, as noted above. As
the Paciﬁc War began in 1941, the objective of Sampō was focused on boosting war production.
The Sampō branch was reorganized into the “Production Corps,” or a subdivision of the military
organization. The production workers were organized into small groups called the “ﬁve-member
team,” in which joint responsibility and peer monitoring concerning work eﬀort, absenteeism,
and turnover among the team members were imposed. Toward the end of the war, the welfare
of workers was greatly sacriﬁced for higher production.171
       The Sampō left a complex legacy to postwar labor relations in Japan. Under the ideology
of “enterprise as one family (jigyō ikka),” membership in a Sampō branch encompassed all
the employees within a company, from managers to rank-and-ﬁle, from white-collar to blue-
collar, from regular to temporary, and from male to female workers. The conspicuous status
diﬀerences between the white-collar and blue-collar workers during the prewar period were, in
theory, removed under patriotic egalitarianism.172 The government repeatedly demanded that
employers respect and trust their production workers. In reality, however, the treatment of blue-
collar and white-collar staﬀ often remained fundamentally diﬀerent. Nevertheless, the Sampō
movement during the war raised workers’ expectations for better treatment and improved status,
leading to an outburst of the labor movement in the immediate postwar period in Japan.173
       The implications of Sampō organizations for the formation of enterprise unions in the postwar
period remain to be a contentious issue among historians. In Sampō councils, many employ-
ers and workers experienced joint labor-management consultation for the ﬁrst time. Yet, as
noted above, the activities of councils in practice were limited, by the employers’ resistance
and the later emphasis on production enhancement. The Sampō’s contribution was, thus,
largely conﬁned to the distribution of food and other goods under wartime allocations and

      In contrast, in the factory committees in the prewar period, blue-collar workers were organized separately
from white-collar workers. Sumiya (1966), p.182.

rationing, promotion of corporate welfare programs, and sponsorship of cultural activities and
moral education.174 Sampō nevertheless helped to create solidarity among employees in the same
workshop and to foster their “sense of belonging” to the company, which might have laid an or-
ganizational foundation for postwar enterprise unions. In a few instances, direct continuation —
either in membership or properties — can be traced from a prewar factory committee to a Sampō
branch, and to a postwar enterprise union.175 In some cases, Sampō indirectly contributed to
the postwar formation of enterprise unions through consolidating shopﬂoor organization, fos-
tering workers’ identities as ﬁrm members, and introducing a concept of egalitarianism among
employees.176
       In summary, wartime labor regulation in the U.S. and Japan tended to reinforce the existing
practices in large private ﬁrms in the respective countries and diﬀuse these practices to the rest
of the economy. At the same time, the legal and administrative expertise gained by government
agencies, as well as the organizational skills, knowledge, and experience acquired by employers
and workers during the war, formed an important part of the institutional capital in the two
countries, which was handed down to the postwar period.


7       The Postwar Establishment of Employment Systems

Returning to normalcy after the long period of extreme conditions under the Great Depression
and W.W.II, American business leaders tried to hold back organized labor and to reestablish
managerial prerogatives. Employers’ counteroﬀensive, however, essentially took place within the
framework of collective bargaining developed since the New Deal, institutionalizing adversarial
labor-management relations and legalistic employment contracts that covered extensive subjects
and detailed contingencies. In other words, the postwar establishment of the U.S. employment
system was largely a natural continuation of the prior institutional trajectory.
       By contrast, Japan experienced a major external shock of the century — the postwar depres-
sion and the drastic political and economic reforms brought by the U.S. occupation. However,
the shock, which was comparable to the Great Depression followed by the New Deal reforms
in the U.S., did not deﬂect Japan’s trajectory toward the American path. Building on the in-
stitutional capital accumulated over the past three decades, Japanese labor, management, and

the government essentially re-introduced the employment system based on implicit contracts,
company-wide unions, and cooperative labor-management relations, with some important mod-
iﬁcations.


7.1      The Establishment of Workplace Contractualism in the U.S.

American labor gained substantial power during the Second World War. Trade union mem-
bership increased from 7 million to 13 million, and union membership among non-agricultural
employees increased by 10 percent between 1940–46. Moreover, unions were ﬁrmly entrenched
with contractual rights and guarantees awarded by the WLB.177 Not only employers, but also
Congress, which was led by the Republicans who won a majority in the 1946 election, were de-
termined to discourage organized labor and to protect managerial prerogatives from the unions’
thrust. As a result, the number of labor disputes rose sharply in 1946, involving nearly 5 million
workers (see Table 17). Most employers viewed the trade union as a “group of agitators” antago-
nistic to management, and considered collective bargaining with unions as an unwanted, though
unavoidable, problem. If there was any consensus between business and labor leaders, it was
to draw an explicit legal boundary between managerial prerogatives and the union’s bargaining
rights.178
       In 1947, Congress passed the Labor Management Relations Act (referred to as the Taft-
Hartley Act), which substantially amended the Wagner Act in favor of business, aiming at
rebalancing the bargaining power between capital and labor. The pro-business provisions of the
Taft-Hartley Act included speciﬁcation of unfair labor practices by unions; denial of the right of
supervisory employees to organize and bargain collectively; restrictions on the scope of legitimate
strikes; and prohibition of political contribution by unions. In addition, the Red Purge stormed
through the country in 1949–50 and compelled CIO oﬃcials to expel eleven national unions on
the grounds of communist control. After this political moderation of the CIO, the two major
trade unions, the AFL and the CIO, merged in 1955, ending their twenty years of rivalry.
       As a consequence of collective bargaining, major manufacturing companies and the AFL-CIO
unions developed highly explicit and extremely elaborate collective agreements in the postwar
period. Well-deﬁned job classiﬁcations, wage rates based on standardized job evaluations, se-

 177
     74% of large manufacturing companies had union contracts containing one or more union security provisions
(NICB (1947, p.8)).

                                                     57
niority provisions in layoﬀs and promotions, and a formal grievance procedure, all of which were
widely promoted during the war, became the primary subjects of most union contracts. When
U.S. Steel edited its new job classiﬁcation manual in 1947, the total number of job titles was more
than 20,000, and each of the titles was further divided into 30 wage-rate categories.179 Along
with rigid and well-deﬁned job boundaries, workers developed a concept of job right, which
could not be infringed on by management, supervisors, or fellow workers. Unions vigorously
pursued seniority provisions in layoﬀs, transfers, and promotions as a means of protecting the
job security of loyal union members. Consequently, American manufacturing workers obtained
partial but contractual employment security based on the job right that increased with seniority.
Reﬂecting these changes, the turnover rates of American manufacturing workers were lower and
more stable in the postwar period, compared to the prewar period (see Figure 2).
       In order to contain union intrusion in personnel issues, employers attempted to introduce
merit rating to determine whether employees were suited to the jobs to which they were entitled
by their seniority. Unions often objected to merit rating based on a supervisor’s subjective evalu-
ation, claiming that it would reintroduce discriminatory treatment and undermine the seniority
principle. Under union pressure, foremen and supervisors began to use standardized and objec-
tive methods of merit rating, in which their evaluations were further checked by the grievance
system.180 By contrast, management maintained its prerogatives over business decisions, pro-
duction schedules, and the size and timing of layoﬀs.
       Having received generous non-wage beneﬁts during the war, unions fought to win their
bargaining rights on welfare beneﬁts and expand their contractual rights. Although management
insisted that the size and provision of non-wage beneﬁts were exclusively under managerial
discretion, with the Supreme Court decision of 1949, welfare beneﬁts were also brought within
the scope of collective bargaining. Hence, management lost its unilateral control and discretion
over non-wage beneﬁts.181 Once they were explicitly written into a collective agreement, welfare
beneﬁts became an entitlement attached to a worker’s job title and seniority. Consequently,
the Court decision marked an end to implicit and discretionary welfare programs pertaining to
blue-collar workers in major unionized manufacturing ﬁrms.
       However, there were a very small number of companies, such as Du Pont, Eastman Kodak,
and Proctor & Gamble, that had maintained their corporate welfare programs and relatively co-

operative labor-management relations since the early 1920s to the postwar period. As exceptions
that prove the rule, those were the companies that had suﬀered only mildly from the Depres-
sion and kept their commitment to corporate paternalism during the 1930s, and had remained
non-union throughout the postwar period.182 In most American manufacturing ﬁrms, discre-
tionary corporate welfare plans were for white-collar employees, and bonuses, proﬁt sharing, and
stock ownership plans were limited mostly to executives, middle management, and supervisory
employees, in sharp contrast to the case in Japan.183
       In summary, persistent distrust continued to characterize labor-management relations in U.S.
manufacturing establishments. Under the assumption that the interests of labor and manage-
ment were in conﬂict, it was optimal for employers and unions to advance explicit and detailed
employment contracts contingent on objective and veriﬁable variables. Thus, Workplace con-
tractualism became a unique characteristic of American employment relations in major unionized
manufacturing establishments by the early 1960s.
       The eﬃciency implications of workplace contractualism are complex and should be evaluated
as part of the whole system. In the postwar golden age, American manufacturing companies
did achieve the highest productivity among industrialized countries. Union members enjoyed
persistently higher wages than nonunion workers.184 This success resulted, in part, from the
American employment system, which combined advanced mass production technology, a high
degree of job standardization, explicit and detailed employment contracts, and well-established
collective bargaining methods supported by a sophisticated legal system. It was not until the
1970s that the rigidity of workplace contractualism and the animosity of union-management
relations in American manufacturing ﬁrms became a serious concern, and so-called Japanese
employment relations began to receive attention as a potential alternative to the American
model.


7.2      Postwar Democratization under the U.S. Occupation in Japan

Japan went through the greatest political and economic reorganization since the Meiji Restora-
tion after the Second World War. Immediately after Japan’s surrender in August 1945, the
nation was placed under the indirect governance of the Supreme Commander for the Allied

Powers (SCAP), which forcefully implemented demilitarization and democratization of Japan.
In particular, SCAP ordered the dissolution of the powerful family concerns, Zaibatsu, purge
of the high executives of major corporations for their war responsibilities, disbandment of the
Sampō organizations, and encouragement of the unionization of labor. The wartime labor reg-
ulations based on the National General Mobilization Law of 1938 were abolished by the end of
1945.185
       In response to the SCAP order, the Japanese government immediately set up a special
committee for labor union legislation. Thus, unlike the Japanese constitution that was ﬁrst
drafted in English by SCAP staﬀ, the trade union law was drafted by the Japanese committee
members who had intimate knowledge of domestic labor relations and prewar union bills. When
the ﬁnal draft was submitted for approval, SCAP made little modiﬁcation due to its early hands-
oﬀ policy, as well as to the lack of labor law experts on its initial staﬀ.186 The Trade Union
Law of 1945 provided Japanese workers with the right to bargain collectively for the ﬁrst time
in Japanese labor history. In contrast to the Wagner Act of 1935 in the U.S., however, the
Japanese Trade Union Law took a favorable stance toward “harmonious unions” initiated by
employers. In particular, it speciﬁed no unfair labor practices by employers; prohibited only
“major” assistance to a union by an employer; and did not obligate an employer to bargain with
a union.187 In other words, in its spirit, the Law was closer to the NIRA Section 7(a) than to
the Wagner Act.188
       Even before the promulgation of the Trade Union Law, there was an explosion of the labor
movement led by Japanese workers under the slogan of “democratization of management.” As
Figure 6 shows, by the end of 1945, more than 500 unions were formed involving 380,000 employ-
ees. In most cases, workers spontaneously formed what they called “employee unions (jūgyōin
kumiai),” organizing themselves within an establishment or factory, encompassing both white-
collar and blue-collar workers. Factory and establishment-level unions in the same company
subsequently joined to form an “enterprise union (kigyō-betsu kumiai)”.189 By 1948, 6.5 million
workers, or 53 percent of total employees, were organized, and 84 percent of them belonged to

      The Trade Union Law was later revised in 1949. Incorporating aspects of the Wagner and Taft-Hartley Acts,
it deﬁned unfair labor practices by employers; prohibited employers’ ﬁnancial support to unions; and excluded
supervisors from union members. In practice, however, these clauses often remained unobserved in Japanese
companies. See Takemae (1982), pp.289–91.

enterprise unions (see Table 6). The prewar labor leaders immediately initiated the movement
to unite enterprise unions into a national federation. In 1946, Sōdōmei was reestablished after
ﬁve years of discontinuation. In the same year, the communist leaders, who were released by
SCAP after long-term imprisonments, created the Congress of Industrial Unions, Sambetsu, and
vigorously promoted industrial unionism. The number of labor disputes surged, and workers
fought for union recognition, wage increases, a purge of top managers, and labor’s participation
in management. Workers grew aggressive and often resorted to collective violence and menace
against their managers during the disputes. In particular, under the inﬂuence of Sambetsu
leaders, enterprise unions in major companies implemented “production control (seisan kanri),”
a Japanese equivalent of the sit-down strike, in which employees occupied production facilities
and operated them by themselves (see Table 20).190 SCAP and the Japanese government were
alarmed by the unexpected radicalization of labor.
       While management was unable to ﬁght back in the midst of economic disorder and political
turmoil, many unions won extremely favorable collective agreements, achieving the long-sought
abolishment of status discrimination between white-collar and blue-collar workers, direct par-
ticipation in management, generous wage increases, and various corporate welfare beneﬁts. The
collective agreements of the immediate postwar period in Japan diﬀered in several notable ways
from their American counterparts. First, most unions, aﬃliated with national federations or not,
concluded independent collective agreements at the enterprise level. Second, a typical collective
agreement obligated management to consult with and gain consent of the union in virtually
all personnel matters without specifying detailed rules ex ante.191 Moreover, a typical collec-
tive agreement included no elaborate provision concerning wages, bonuses, or beneﬁts.192 In
other words, it was not the primary concern of union members to establish explicit contractual
rights. Third, more than half of the collective agreements included a provision to establish a
powerful “joint council (keiei kyōgikai)” as machinery for realizing the employees’ participation
in management.193 Fourth, many unions won a union shop provision that required every regular
employee of a company to be a union member, and in exchange, management typically included
a clause requiring every union member to be an employee of the company, excluding outside
unionists from interfering with employer-employees relations. Lastly, the collective agreements

often included a provision of automatic and indeﬁnite extension of the agreements.
       To summarize, despite the new labor law that established collective bargaining methods
and legal enforcement mechanisms, Japanese workers spontaneously reintroduced an implicit,
ambiguous contract and a company-wide union. For many employees in large ﬁrms, given ﬁrm-
speciﬁc human capital, organizational knowledge, and employer-employee relations built over
the past three decades, choosing an implicit and discretionary contract might have remained
optimal. It is important to note that, departing from prewar practices, manufacturing workers
forcefully demanded the equal treatment of all employees, participation in management, and
the establishment of a joint consultation system in order to improve their bargaining power,
status, and welfare in their companies. Labor’s initial victory, however, was soon challenged by
management’s counteroﬀensive, as we see below.


7.3       The Establishment of the Postwar Japanese Employment System

In 1947, with the advent of the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, Japan’s eco-
nomic recovery and political stabilization became SCAP’s ﬁrst priority. Labor policy accordingly
shifted from unconditional encouragement of unionization to discouragement of the radical labor
movement. In February 1947, SCAP ordered to call oﬀ the nation-wide general strike. In July,
the Ordinance 201 deprived employees of public enterprises of the right to bargain collectively.
Stimulated by the shift in SCAP policy, management began to organize its counteroﬀensive
against labor. In 1948, the former members of Zensanren formed the Federation of Japanese
Employers Association, Nikkeiren, involving virtually all major employers in the economy.194
Organized labor was thus put into a defensive position after its tremendous gain during the
immediate postwar period.
       Furthermore, in 1949, the SCAP implemented a drastic deﬂationary policy, the Dodge Line,
intending to bring the Japanese economy under a free market mechanism. In the immediate
postwar years, the government had kept tight market control and had heavily subsidized private
manufacturing companies, which enabled large ﬁrms to hoard workers and pay the relatively
high wages their unions demanded. As generous government subsidies were suddenly terminated,
employers were compelled to take up drastic rationalization plans. Like the Great Depression,
the postwar recession posed a serious challenge to Japanese business leaders’ commitment to cor-
porate paternalism. Japanese union leaders also learned the hard lesson that their unrestrained

 194

                                                         62
demand during the recession might hurt the companies themselves.195 It was, in part, the sud-
den economic boom induced by the Korean War (1950–53) that mitigated the potential impact
of the Dodge Line. More importantly, however, the institutional capital and organizational
arrangements developed since the early 1920s helped major employers to maintain their repu-
tations and reestablish cooperative labor-management relations with their unions, as described
below.
       The announcement of the rationalization programs by employers provoked the strong protest
of unions. Thus, the most violent and prolonged labor disputes in Japanese labor history
took place between 1949 and 1954, involving major manufacturing companies, such as Tōshiba,
Hitachi, and Nissan.196 Enterprise unions led by radical leaders went on strike, demanding
complete withdrawal of dismissals. In response, employers instituted a voluntary retirement
system and proposed augmented retirement allowance plans (see Table 22). In almost all the
major strikes during 1949–54, unions eventually lost. In the process of a prolonged strike, radical
leaders gradually lost support from rank-and-ﬁle members, leading to the formation of so-called
“second union (dai-ni kumiai).” Management concluded an agreement with the second union
and solicited voluntary retirement, while dismissing radical union leaders. After the strike,
the second union typically became a new enterprise union of the company. In exchange for
their cooperation with employers in rationalization plans and productivity improvement, those
unions demanded a fair share of the pie and participation in management in the form of joint
consultation.197 Consequently, enterprise unionism, which was characterized by its exclusive
membership of regular employees, joint consultation, and labor-management cooperation, had
prevailed in most large manufacturing companies in Japan by the end of the 1950s. Thus,
the organizational basis and center of the union activities were once more contained within
the boundaries of a company. As we see below, enterprise unionism was further combined
with implicit and ambiguous collective agreements, extensive corporate welfare programs, and
employment security, constituting the “Japanese-style” industrial relations.
       In the 1950s, massive collective learning from the U.S. took place in Japan. Under the
ﬁnancial support of the U.S. government, hundreds of study teams were sent to learn mod-
ern technology and management methods developed by American manufacturing ﬁrms. Mass-
production technology, scientiﬁc management, total quality control, job evaluation methods,

grievance mechanisms, and training for foremen, among other things, were “imported” to ma-
jor Japanese manufacturing ﬁrms with great enthusiasm. Japanese ﬁrms, however, did not
convert their production methods or employment relations to the American model. What hap-
pened instead was selective adoption and substantial modiﬁcation of American technology and
practices.198 It is well known that Japanese ﬁrms developed ﬂexible mass production systems
and quality circles based on American practices. However, other personnel practices, such as job
evaluations and a layoﬀ system, never diﬀused as they were found incompatible with existing
employment practices. The adoption of formal grievance procedures was also encouraged by the
Japanese government, but both management and labor tended to prefer voluntary resolution
through joint consultation without involving a third party. Even if union contracts contained a
grievance arbitration clause, in reality, arbitration was hardly exercised.199
       Furthermore, collective agreements concluded or revised in the 1950s in Japan remained
implicit and ambiguous. The so-called “consultation clause” and “meet-and-confer clause,” in
which seemingly relevant contingencies were left unspeciﬁed, were commonly and frequently
included in union contracts. As a result, the courts often found a collective agreement “too
general and too vague” to be legally enforced. In stark contrast to explicit and substantive
provisions in collective agreements in the U.S., only general and procedural provisions were
stipulated in Japan, retaining considerable ambiguity and ﬂexibility in their interpretations.200
In place of legal enforcement, employers and enterprise unions in large Japanese manufacturing
ﬁrms developed internal enforcement mechanisms based on long-term relations, reputational
concerns, and joint labor-management consultation.
       In the 1950s, corporate welfarism spread widely and became a main characteristic of Japanese-
style management. As Tables 23 and 24 show, biannual bonuses, housing and family allowances,
health insurance and pensions, retirement beneﬁts, and medical, athletic and recreational facil-
ities were widely adopted by manufacturing companies. Personnel policies, such as corporate
training programs and internal promotion based on both seniority and supervisors’ subjective
evaluations, were fully extended to regular blue-collar workers in large manufacturing compa-
nies. After the costly anti-dismissal strikes in the early 1950s, employers once more recognized
the importance of employment security for regular employees. Thus, the practice of long-term
employment, which had been advanced by a small number of ﬁrms since the 1930s, spread among

large and medium-sized ﬁrms in the economy. As a consequence, the turnover rate of manufac-
turing workers in Japan remained one of the lowest among industrialized countries throughout
the postwar period (see Figure 5).
       Contrary to popular belief, there has been no statutory law that legally guaranteed employ-
ment security in Japan. The Japanese Civil Code provided that, under an employment contract
with no ﬁxed term, either party could terminate the contract at any time with a two-week ad-
vance notice.201 The Labor Standard Law of 1947 obligated employers to pay the equivalent of
thirty days’ average wages when dismissing an employee, reﬂecting the acknowledged importance
of employment security in society.202 Besides those restrictions, the laws, in principle, main-
tained the employers’ right to dismiss employees. No explicit guarantee of employment security
was found in any collective agreement either, except for a clause which required employer’s prior
consultation with a union. Thus, contractually, American workers were provided with better
employment security deﬁned by the seniority rule, compared to Japanese workers.
       However, by the early 1960s, it became an established practice for Japanese employers to cir-
cumvent dismissals for business reasons by any means, resorting to reduction in working hours,
intraplant and interplant transfers of regular workers, temporary leaves with pay, separation
of temporary and outside workers, suspension of new recruitment, and voluntary retirement of
regular workers (see Tables 25 and 26).203 In parallel development, the courts gradually accu-
mulated case laws that restricted the right of dismissal by requiring employers to provide “just
cause.” In particular, judicial decisions established standard requirements employers should
satisfy before resorting to dismissals for business reasons.204
       In summary, the contents and interpretations of labor laws developed in a complementary
manner to the prevailing practices and expectations in society. In turn, by providing clarity
and authority, the law legitimized the practices and consolidated the expectations as social
norms. By the early 1960s, a distinct and stable employment system emerged in Japan, in
which employment relations in private ﬁrms were reinforced by legal systems, labor markets,
state welfare policies, education systems, and norms in society.
       To evaluate the welfare implications of the Japanese employment system requires a delicate
analysis. On the one hand, it enabled ﬁrms to foster a highly-committed workforce and produce

high-quality products. The ﬂexibility of union contracts allowed management to introduce new
technologies and design ﬂexible mass production systems. On the other hand, the long-term and
closed relationships between management and enterprise unions were often collusive, subject to
the criticism of “crony capitalism.” While long-term employment practices gave stability and
security to employees in large ﬁrms, their rigidity might be a source of ineﬃciency in a more
vibrant economy. Needless to say, the duality of labor markets — the diﬀerence between regular
and temporary workers in their economic status — has been a recurrent social problem in Japan.
In other words, in comparing the employment systems in the U.S. and Japan as a whole, neither
is superior to the other. It is only in a speciﬁc dimension in a particular environment that
one can draw a meaningful eﬃciency comparison. Each aspect of an employment system is an
integral part of the whole, tightly knitted into other institutions in forming a stable system.
The diﬀerence between the employment systems in the U.S. and Japan, thus, tended to persist,
even in the face of growing international technology transfers and competition.


8    Conclusion

The purpose of this paper was to explore the origins of the distinctive employment systems that
emerged by the early 1960s in the U.S. and Japan, and to develop a theory which provides a
consistent explanation for the institutional developments for both countries since the beginning
of this century. For this purpose, the paper studied the co-evolution of private employment
relations and government labor policies, from the viewpoint that an employment system is
an equilibrium outcome of the strategic interactions among management, labor, and the gov-
ernment. By tracing the institutional trajectories in the two countries, the paper empirically
examined the dynamic process of equilibrium selection. The main ﬁndings and interpretations
provided by our comparative historical analysis can be summarized as follows.
    At the beginning of the twentieth century, in spite of the underlying diﬀerences between the
two countries’ cultural traditions, political regimes, and the stages of industrialization, employ-
ment relations in large American and Japanese manufacturing ﬁrms were similar in the following
aspects. Employment contracts were simple, short-term, and individualized, and “employment-
at-will” was a prevailing principle in both societies. There were highly competitive labor markets
in which wages were determined by general skills and experience. Production workers, skilled
or unskilled, frequently moved among factories seeking higher wages and better working condi-
tions. Employers, in response, invested little in training their employees and resorted to dismissal

                                                66
whenever business conditions deteriorated. Personnel management was delegated to supervisors
on the shopﬂoor, who relied on close monitoring and often coercive methods to induce work
eﬀort. As a result, in both countries, employment relations in manufacturing establishments
were characterized by individualized wage bargaining, high job turnover, low work commitment,
and a low level of mutual trust.
   Starting from these similar conditions at the beginning of the century, the institutional
paths of the two countries evolved in parallel over the subsequent three decades. In particular,
the unanticipated shock of the First World War gave rise to similar economic, political, and
social conditions in the U.S. and Japan. In response to expanding ﬁrm size, surging labor
movements, and increasing demand for social legislation, business leaders in both countries
began to seek higher labor productivity, industrial harmony, and improvement in their workers’
welfare. Major manufacturing companies gradually developed “employer paternalism,” based
on implicit, long-term employment contracts, corporate welfare programs, and company-wide
employee representation.
   During the 1920s, employer paternalism appeared to have penetrated large manufacturing
establishments in the U.S. and Japan. In both countries, progressive employers gradually accu-
mulated experience and gained trust from their employees, the public, and the government. A
diﬀerence existed, however, in the underlying macroeconomic environments in which employer
paternalism functioned. Japanese employers and workers in the manufacturing industry went
through frequent but small economic shocks and developed common understanding and insti-
tutional arrangements that helped mitigate the impact of these shocks on their employment
relations. In contrast, American employers and workers promoted corporate welfarism under
the prosperity and optimism of the twenties without being seriously challenged.
   When the Depression unexpectedly hit the respective economies in 1929, the initial responses
of employers, workers, and the governments in the U.S. and Japan exhibited important similari-
ties, reﬂecting the parallel institutional developments up to this period. As the Great Depression
deepened further, however, a majority of major American employers repudiated their implicit
contracts, which led to a decline in workers’ welfare, dissemination of ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital,
and depreciation of employers’ reputations. In contrast, the shorter duration of the Depression
and the better institutional arrangements developed during the 1920s in Japan prevented em-
ployers from resorting to such major repudiation.
   In the early 1930s, both the U.S. and Japanese governments attempted to introduce carteliza-


                                               67
tion of business and labor union legislation in response to the economic and social conditions
brought about by the Depression. The respective legislative eﬀorts, however, resulted in con-
trasting outcomes. In the U.S., economic recovery through business cartelization failed, while
labor unions gained legal recognition and increased their membership and political voice. In
Japan, union legislation was blocked, while business gained more political voice as the economy
recovered. These outcomes further led to distinct sets of labor laws and social welfare policies
in the two countries in the late 1930s. The Japanese government developed labor policies that
were complementary to corporate paternalism, while the U.S. government introduced a new
legal framework of collective bargaining that seriously undermined the viability of employer pa-
ternalism. Subsequently, American employers and unions developed collective agreements based
on the assumption of adversarial labor-management relations.
   Consequently, in the late 1930s, two distinctive sets of employment relations were taking
shape in major manufacturing ﬁrms in the respective countries. Employment relations in the
U.S. were based on explicit and legally enforceable employment contracts between employers
and trade unions, whereas employment relations in Japan were based on implicit and long-
term employment contracts enforced through reputation mechanisms and establishment-wide
employee representation.
   The grave shock of the Second World War induced the U.S. and Japanese governments to
undertake powerful labor regulations to achieve the greatest wartime production. Both gov-
ernments designed regulations built largely on the prevailing employment practices and legal
frameworks developed prior to the war. In addition, the strategic reactions and selective com-
pliance of private agents made regulations that were compatible with existing employment rela-
tions more eﬀective. Consequently, wartime government regulations contributed greatly to the
consolidation and diﬀusion of existing employment practices in both countries. As a result, the
emerging diﬀerence between the employment systems in the U.S. and Japan in the late 1930s was
reinforced during the Second World War, leading to further divergence of the two institutional
paths.
   While the U.S. continued down the same path into the postwar period, Japan experienced a
major shock — the postwar U.S. occupation — which brought about drastic legal, political, and
economic reforms. Reﬂecting the institutional capital — such as ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital,
mutual trust, and administrative expertise — accumulated throughout the prewar and wartime
periods, however, Japanese workers and employers re-introduced employment relations based on



                                              68
implicit, long-term employment contracts and company-wide unions under a new legal frame-
work, with some important modiﬁcations. In particular, blue-collar workers achieved a higher
economic and social status within ﬁrms during the process of democratization.
   Consequently, by the early 1960s, two distinctive types of employment relations emerged
in large, unionized manufacturing ﬁrms in the two countries. American-style industrial rela-
tions were characterized by workplace contractualism based on explicit and elaborate collective
agreements and adversarial union-management relationships, whereas implicit, ambiguous, and
long-term collective agreements and cooperative and consultative union-management relation-
ships characterized Japanese-style industrial relations. These distinctive types of employment
relations were complemented by labor markets, labor laws, state welfare policies, and social
norms in the two countries that had co-evolved since the late 1930s.
   In contrast to the traditional monocausal explanations, the comparative historical analysis
advanced in this paper has highlighted the dynamics and complexity of historical processes that
eventually led to the distinctive employment systems of the U.S. and Japan. It is true that
signiﬁcant diﬀerences existed between the cultural traditions, political regimes, and timing of
industrialization in the two countries; it is not the intention of the paper to dismiss or disregard
these diﬀerences. However, the analysis reveals that, despite these diﬀerences, institutional
developments in the two countries often exhibited remarkable similarities in important aspects,
pointing to the possibility that a priori these diﬀerences per se might not have dictated the ﬁnal
outcomes. The historical trajectories in both the U.S. and Japan could have taken very diﬀerent
courses, depending delicately on the magnitude, timing, and sequence of unforeseen historical
events.
   The paper’s analysis ended at the 1960s on the premise that these historical processes were
largely complete as of that time. The two employment systems, however, have continued to
evolve, and many recent experiences in the U.S. and Japan indicate that the employment systems
we observed in the 1960s were yet another historical phase that did not persist unchanged.
We believe, however, that the conceptual framework and the comparative historical analysis
advanced in this paper will provide a point of departure from which further study of the evolution
of employment systems in the two countries can follow.

1) Turnover consists of voluntary quits by employees, discharges by employers, and layoffs by employers.
2) The annual turnover rate measures the number of employees separated from a manufacturing establishment in
a given year as a percentage of that establishment’s average number of employees on the payroll in that year.
3) See the notes of Figures 2 and 5 for details.

1) Turnover rate is the sum of voluntary quits, discharges, and layoffs.
2) In (I), a turnover rate per 10,000 labor hours was reported. An annual turnover rate was computed
assuming that one worker worked 30,000 labor hours per year.
3) In (II), the unweighted median of the turnover rates for all firms in the sample was reported. The
sample covered 350 manufacturing establishments employing 700,000 workers in 1929 (the average
number of workers per firm was 200).
4) In (III), the weighted average of the turnover rates for all firms in the sample was reported. The
sample covered 38,000 manufacturing establishments employing 104,000,000 workers in 1970 (the
average number of workers per firm was 274).
4) In (I), in addition to manufacturing, establishments in public utilities, mercantile, and printing and
publishing enterprises are included. All the non-manufacturing establishments had lower turnover rates
than manufacturing establishments.
5) Before 1943, the data covered production workers only; after 1943, the data covered all employees.
6) After 1959, transfers between establishments of the same firm are counted as separation.

1) An annual turnover rate is the average monthly turnover rate multiplied by 12.
2) A monthly turnover rate is the number of separation (the sum of quits, layoffs, and discharges) within
a month divided by the average number of workers during the month.
3) In (I), the sample covered factory employees (kojo rodosha) in the manufacturing establishments with
50 or more regular production workers (joyo shokko).
4) In (II), the sample covered regular employees in the manufacturing establishments with five or more
regular employees. Regular employees are defined as (a) those who are employed indefinitely or for
more than one month by contracts and (b) those who are employed for a period shorter than a month by
contract (i.e., temporary workers) but were employed during past two months for 18 days or more in
each month.
5) No data are available for years before 1923 and between 1941-47.

1) The survey covered reductions that became effective by March 1932.
2) The sample covered 1,503 establishment in manufacturing, 36 establishments in mining, and 24
establishments in public utilities.
3) Decline in employment shows percentage decline of employment between 1929 and 1932.
4) Plants reducing executive salaries (wages) shows percentage of companies who reported reductions in
executive salaries (wages) between 1929 and 1932.
5) Reduction in executive salaries (wages) shows percentage reduction of executive salaries (wages)
between 1929 and 1932 among those companies who exercised reductions. The numbers are the
weighted average computed by using the number of affected employees in each establishment.
6) The reductions in salary and wage rates above do not include the effects of reduced working hours,
elimination of bonuses and benefits, or demotion of employees.

1) The sample in 1933 covered 3,314 manufacturing companies with total 2,585,740 wage-earners
(average 780 workers per company).
2) The sample in 1934 covered 2,975 companies with total 2,636,847 wage-earners (average 886 workers
per company).
3) The sample in 1935 covered 2,075 manufacturing companies with total 2,602,246 wage-earners
(average 1,254 workers per company).
4) The sample in 1939 covered 2,216 manufacturing companies with total 2,845,697 workers (average
1,284 workers per company).
5) The sample in 1946 covered 3,039 manufacturing companies employing approximately 5,500,000
workers (average 1,800 workers per company).
6) "Total" refers to the companies with at least one signed union agreement. Since one company might
deal with more than one union, the sum of percentages of the AFL, the CIO, and independent unions
exceeds the percentage of total.
7) "Independent unions" include (a) standard independent unions representing more than one employer
and (b) local independent unions representing a single employer (some of works councils were
reorganized into local independent unions after Wagner Act of 1935).

1) “Compensations in cash” includes wages, overtime pays, and biannual bonuses which are specified in
a collective agreement.
2) “Legally required welfare benefits (hotei hukuri-hi)” include health insurance, pensions, and other
benefits required by law.
3) “Voluntary welfare benefits (hotei-gai hukuri-hi)” include private insurance, family and commuting
allowances, company savings, stock ownership, housing facilities, dining facilities, health and medical
facilities, and educational, recreational and athletic facilities which are not required by law.
4) The above data for "voluntary welfare benefits”, however, do not include retirement allowances and
training cost. Therefore, the total amount of voluntary corporate welfare benefits would be significantly
higher than the figure shown above.
