This paper provides a survey of business cycle facts, updated to take account of recent data. Emphasis
is given to the Great Recession which was unlike most other post-war recessions in the US in being
driven by deleveraging and financial market factors. We document how recessions with ˝financial
market origins are different from those driven by supply or monetary policy shocks. This helps explain
why economic models and predictors that work well at some times do poorly at other times. We discuss
challenges for forecasters and empirical researchers in light of the updated business cycle facts.

1       Introduction
In 1985, Victor Zarnowitz wrote a paper in the Journal of Economic Literature that provides
historical background on business cycles and outlines the evolution of thought leading to
developments in theory and related empirical evidence (Zarnowitz, 1985). Prior to that
writing, the dominant view had been that the business cycle reflected stationary deviations
around a deterministic trend attributed to exogenous growth, and that business cycles were
all alike in the sense of having many common features. When Zarnowitz wrote his paper,
the economy had just emerged from the longest post second world war contraction, preceded
by a string of supply shocks with severe inflationary consequences that made economists
and econometricians reconsider the adequacy of their assumptions and tools used to analyze
business cycles.
    Over twenty-five years have passed since the paper was published and there have been de-
velopments in several dimensions. Supply shocks of the 1970s contributed to level and trend
shifts of many economic variables, making economists rethink whether the trend stationary
paradigm is the appropriate characterization of economic data. At the econometric level, it
is now more or less accepted that many economic time series are difference stationary, and
occasional mean shifts, parameter instability, stochastic volatility, and common trends are
features that need to be considered. Statistical tools are now able to take advantage of the
increasingly data-rich environment so that analysis of economic fluctuations and growth can
exploit information from a broad spectrum of the economy. Data from different sources and
frequencies can be analyzed within the same framework. Our understanding of data revi-
sions has expanded, permitting a better understanding of decision-making in real time. We
can also nowcast, a methodology for “predicting” the current state of the economy, taking
into account incoming news announcements as well as special factors such as strikes and
hurricanes.1
    There have also been important advances in macroeconomic analysis. Models with tight
microfoundations are now the standard starting point of understanding business cycle dy-
namics, replacing large scale models that are not fully internally consistent. In these dy-
namic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, fiscal, monetary, preference and supply
shocks are propagated and amplified by intertemporal decisions of households and firms made
under misperceptions, incomplete information, real and nominal rigidities. Statistical and

the Greenbook and other judgmental forecasts for economic activity seems to come from their nowcasting
ability.

computational advances now make it possible to take moderate size models to the data so
that formal model validation is possible.2
    While advances in econometric and macroeconomic theory have helped us better under-
stand events that were important in 1985, the facts have changed since. There has been a
secular increase in the share of services in consumption from an average of 50% before 1983
to 65% after 2007, at the expense of non-durables (from 35% to 22%). Labor share in the
non-farm sector has fallen, as has the share of manufacturing employment. The civilian labor
force participation rate stands at 63.5% in 2013, much below the peak of 67.2% in 1999. This
is in spite of female participation rate rising from under 35% in 1945 to over 60% in 2001, as
the male participation rate has been falling since 1945. The US economy also experienced
increased openness; international trade and financial linkages with the rest of the world have
strengthened, with the volume of imports plus exports rising from 12% of GDP before 1983
to 27% post 2007. Meanwhile, not only have households’ and firms’ indebtedness increased,
so has foreign indebtedness. For example, the household debt-to-asset ratio rose from under
0.75 in the 1950s to over 1.5 in 2000 and has increased further since. Net external assets
relative to GDP have also risen from 0.82 in the 1970s to 2.4 when the sample is extended
to 2007.3 One of the most important changes was the sharp reduction in volatility of con-
sumption, investment and output growth between the mid 1980s and 2006, a phenomenon
referred to as the Great Moderation. This was first documented by Kim and Nelson (1999)
and McConnell and Perez-Quiros (2000), and subsequently confirmed by others.
    The aforementioned changes in the data since 1985 are overshadowed by the sharp decline
in economic activity that began in 2007, followed by a recovery that is in many ways still
incomplete, as real GDP per capita in 2012 remained lower than its level in 20074 . This Great
Recession is important not only because of its impact on the economic well-being of con-
sumers and firms, but also because it once again led econometricians and macroeconomists to
question the adequacy of their analysis. In conventional business cycle analysis, emphasis is
placed on the fluctuations of macroeconomic variables alone. Asset prices, financial variables
and the financial system are a side-show. Yet, as noted by Minsky (1986) and Sinai (1992),
financial market factors can be the primary causes of downturns. And indeed, one only needs
to look at the Great Depression for evidence; it began with the stock market crash in 1929,
and led to debt deflation and bank runs in the years that followed. Nonetheless, there was
a broad lack of interest in business cycles of financial origins, the most likely reason being
that US recessions in the 1970s and 80s can be traced to supply and demand shocks of the

monetary/fiscal policy type, with financial factors merely amplifying the shocks. But the
role of financial markets in recent business cycles can no longer be seen as passive. Though
the recessions of 1990-1991 and 2001 were mild and brief, they had financial origins, with
roots in the savings-and-loan crisis and the internet bubble, respectively. These two reces-
sions did not lead to serious problems of financial market functioning. It was however the
breadth and depth of the Great Recession, which involved a full-blown financial crisis, that
brought the role of financial markets back to center-stage of business cycle analysis.
    This paper takes an overview of the facts and explanations of recent recessions from the
perspective of macroeconometricians and is very much in the spirit of Zarnowitz (1985). We
review the business cycle literature, update the stylized facts and summarize the economic
theories that purport to explain those facts, but with emphasis on the post 1985 sample
and on features of recessions with financial market origins. The discussion is organized to
achieve three objectives with the linkages between finance and the real side of the economy
as the focal point. The first is to document the changing time series properties of the data
using factor analysis to give new perspectives on the nature of these changes, and giving
attention to volatility dynamics that was absent in Zarnowitz (1985). The second objective
is to examine the particular role that financial frictions, leverage and uncertainty played
in recent economic fluctuations, and especially the Great Recession. We study evidence on
economic downturns that are rooted in asset and financial markets, highlighting features
that are different from recessions that are due to adverse supply or demand shocks. Our
third objective is to take an overview of the effectiveness of our econometric methodology in
light of the experience of the recent recessions.
    An overview of the updated business cycle facts is that while there are broad similarities,
recessions that originate with financial market dislocations are distinctively different from
those in which financial markets play a passive role. Recoveries are slow when the reces-
sions have financial origins, especially in resuming the flow of private credit and moving the
unemployed back to work. That financial and non-financial business cycles have different
theoretical implications is not surprising, but that these differences are empirically relevant
confront policy makers, macroeconomists, and econometricians with new challenges. Our
discussion centers on the econometric issues relating to macroeconomic forecasting, estima-
tion of turning points, and identification analysis.
    Numerous surveys of business cycle theory and facts are available since Zarnowitz (1985)
using data updated to around 2000. Diebold and Rudebusch (1996) relate the factor structure
in the data and the property of regime switching to macroeconomic models with spillovers
and strategic complementarities. King and Watson (1996) study the relation between money,
prices and interest rates over business cycles and assess the adequacy of sticky price and


                                              3
liquidity effect in explaining the facts. Diebold and Rudebusch (1999) discuss issues relating
to the measurement, modeling, and forecasting of business cycles. Stock and Watson (1999)
document the time series properties of the data at business cycle frequencies while Stock and
Watson (2002b) consider the causes of the Great Moderation. Christiano and Fitzgerald
(1998) suggest a new business cycle filter and document sectoral comovements of hours
worked at the business cycle frequencies, arguing that shifts in expectations triggered by
strategic complementarities, information externalities, and efficiency wage theory can explain
the facts. However, these papers all preceded the Great Recession. We start where others
left off.
    The plan for the remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses business cycle
facts. Section 3 uses tools of factor analysis to understand comovement and volatility of
a wide range of macro time series. Section 4 discusses the Great Recession specifically.
Sections 5 and 6 examine challenges for forecasting and structural identification analysis,
respectively. Section 7 concludes.


2    Business Cycle Facts
We are interested in business cycle fluctuations as opposed to movements in secular trends. A
business cycle is generally understood to consist of fluctuations in economic activity charac-
terized by at least two distinct states—expansionary and contractionary. Formal quantitative
analysis of business cycles began with the seminal work of Burns and Mitchell (1946) who
developed rules to determine the phase and amplitude of cycles upon studying data on em-
ployment, production, prices and other macroeconomic aggregates. These procedures still
guide the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) Business Cycle Dating Commit-
tee, the authority in dating US recessions. The committee defines a recession as a period of
falling economic activity normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial
production, and wholesale-retail sales spread across the country. Note that no reference is
made to money and credit markets, and only domestic economic conditions are considered.
In empirical work, a recession has also been defined as two consecutive quarters of decline in
real GDP growth, or a 1.5% rise in unemployment within twelve months, but these definitions
apply exclusively to non-financial, country-specific variables.
    The NBER’s definition of a U.S. recession is quite flexible and relies on the judgment
of the committee members. They measure the duration of a recession by the time elapsed
between a peak and a trough, while an expansion is the period from a trough to a peak. A
full business cycle is defined from one trough to the next. While the NBER business cycle
dates are widely accepted as the benchmark, the committee tends to announce the beginning

                                              4
and end of recessions well after the fact. This motivates the development of procedures to
identify business cycles and their turning points in a more mechanical and timely manner
(Chauvet and Hamilton, 2006; Stock and Watson, 2010). More on this in subsection 5.2
below.
    Zarnowitz (1985) analyzed the characteristics of business cycles from 1854 to 1982 using
the NBER dates and showed that there is significant variation in duration and phase. In
the period from 1960-1983 that Zarnowitz analyzed, consumption, investment and output
expanded rapidly but were quite volatile. Real wage growth was positive. Inflation was
elevated (especially in the 1970s and early 1980s), but also variable and persistent. The
updated NBER business cycle dates are given in Table 1.

    Table 1 shows that from the early 1980s until 2007, economic growth in the US was more
stable than at any point in prior history, with only two mild and short recessions. Overall,
the post second world war (WW-II) recessions lasted for a bit less than one year on average
while the post WW-II expansions averaged just short of five years. The average duration of
the 11 business cycles since WW-II has increased as a consequence of longer expansions.
    Even in early work by Burns and Mitchell (1946), it was observed that there is a ten-
dency for the data to behave differently during downturns and upturns. The feature can
arise in economic models because of asymmetric temporary shocks as in the plucking model
of Friedman (1969, 1993), or through the asymmetric price adjustment mechanism as in
Tobin (1972). It is now generally accepted that non-convexities of some sort will generate
asymmetric model dynamics. Neftci (1984) developed a test of whether contractions are
indeed steeper than expansions and found evidence in support of asymmetry.


                                             5
    Observing that the data are not well characterized by linear models if business cycles
are asymmetric, Hamilton (1989) proposed using Markov switching models in which the
parameter values alternate between two different states. Strong evidence for the existence
of these distinct states is provided in Hamilton (1989, 1995). Hamilton’s two-state Markov
switching model has been generalized to allow transition probabilities to be endogenous
and to allow for more states. Sichel (1994) argued for three-state business cycle models
(recessions, high-growth recoveries and mature expansions). Sichel (1994) documented the
high-growth recovery phase and attributed rapid recoveries from recessions to firms building
up inventories in anticipation of stronger final demand. Table 2 reports the average growth
rates of GDP in the quarters before business cycle peaks (top panel) and in the quarters
after business cycle troughs (bottom panel). Indeed, up until the mid 1980s, the quarters
after business cycle troughs tended to be characterized by unusually fast growth. Also, while
it’s not as strong an empirical regularity, the last few quarters before business cycle peaks
appear to be characterized by slightly slower growth. Nalewaik (2011) referred to this as a
stall speed phenomenon.

2.1    Five Differences in the Three Recessions After 1985
Business cycles of the 1970s and early 80s are widely believed to be due to supply shocks
and/or monetary policy. In this section, we highlight five differences in the last three reces-
sions.


                                              6
  (i) Long but weak expansions:
       The 1983-2012 expansions were unusually long, lasting an average of 95 months com-
       pared to 46 months in the 1949-1982 sample. However, the growth rates are low relative
       to the pre-1982 expansions, as GDP grew an average of 5.4% and 2.7% per annum in
       the 1949-1982 and 1983-2012 subsamples, respectively. As noted above, a rapid recov-
       ery phase had previously been a business cycle stylized fact. But, as can be seen in
       Table 2, rapid recoveries have been distinctively absent following the three recessions
       since 1984Q1.

 (ii) Weakened procyclicality of labor productivity:
       The cyclicality of productivity is important to our understanding of the impulses and
       propagation mechanisms of business cycles. Countercyclical productivity suggests that
       labor market variations are due to shifts in labor supply, while procyclical productivity
       is consistent with shifts in the production function as the driver of economic fluctua-
       tions. Procylical productivity is a key driver of the real business cycle literature, (Basu
       and Fernald, 2001). But during the last two recessions (as dated by the NBER), labor
       productivity actually rose. Table 3 documents correlations between the log first dif-
       ferences of output, hours and labor productivity as measured by output her hour over
       different sample periods. On net, over the 1984-2012 period labor productivity growth
       was less procyclical than it had been in previous business cycles. The difference be-
       tween the productivity-output correlation in the 1960-1983 and 1984-2012 subsamples
       is statistically significant at the 10 percent level. The extent to which productivity has
       become less procyclical is however sensitive to which productivity measure is used, and
       also to which detrending method is employed.5

 (iii) Jobless recovery:
       The recoveries from the last three recessions have all been marked by slowly improving
       labor markets, and are often referred to as jobless recoveries. Table 4 reports the
       characteristics of GDP growth, employment growth and unemployment during the
       first eight quarters of expansions.

   5
    Canova (1998) found that within a wide range of business cycle frequencies, the real wage was highly
correlated with GDP over the 1955-1986 sample period, but that the correlation was lower for other measures
of productivity. We have used first differencing for detrending—using some other detrending methods, the
correlation of detrended productivity and output declines more sharply in the post-1984 sample (Gali and
Gambetti, 2009; Gali and van Rens, 2010). At the same time, using the utilization-adjusted productivity
measure of Basu, Fernald, and Kimball (2006) shows less evidence of a decline in the output-productivity
correlation.

 Notes: This Table shows the properties of the first eight quarters of postwar expansions as dated
by the NBER. All entries are in percentage points.



      An increase in GDP growth of one percentage point is associated with a 3.5/6.0=
      0.58 percentage point increase in employment during the early stages of 1949-1982
      expansions, but this ratio decreased to 0.2/2.9=0.07 when computed over the expan-
      sions between 1983 and 2012. Combined with Table 3, it appears that the recoveries
      from these last three recessions were characterized by productivity growth more than
      increases in employment or hours worked.

 (iv) Pronounced leverage cycle:
      Leverage increased before both the 2001 recession and especially before the Great
      Recession. Table 5 tabulates the HP-trend and cycle ratio of assets to liabilities of

                                                   8
      households and firms. There is an apparent downward trend in both ratios. In each
      of the last two recessions, the cyclical component of household leverage swung from
      being positive before the peak to being negative during and after the recession. In the
      Great Recession, the leverage cycle is more pronounced for households than for firms.

 Notes: This table shows the household and firm ratios of assets to liabilities from the Federal
Reserve flow of funds accounts. For each of the last 6 recessions, the table shows the average of the
HP filter trend during the recession, and the average of the HP filter cycle during the recession,
over the 4 quarters before the peak, and over the 8 quarters after the trough. The HP filter uses
the default smoothing parameter of 1600. Averages for all recessions before 1990 and after 1990
are also shown.



 (v) Tight availability of credit giving headwinds to the recovery:
      Table 6 reports the average of the net percentage of domestic respondents reporting
      increased willingness to make consumer installment loans from the Federal Reserve’s
      Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey in the quarters following business cycle troughs,
      both for recessions from 1966 to 1985 and for the subsequent three recessions. In the
      earlier recessions, credit conditions were dramatically eased at the start of the recovery.
      But, on average over the last three recessions, there was no material easing of consumer
      credit conditions until one year into the recovery, and even then it was very modest.
    The five facts listed above concern features of the three recent economic downtowns.
What distinguishes these three recessions is that they were not due to supply and demand
shocks of the textbook type. The recession of 1990-1991 was caused by the savings-and-loan
crisis. Both the 2001 recession and the Great Recession were preceded by asset price bubbles,

though the national housing bubble that preceded the Great Recession was far more potent
than the internet bubble in the late 1990s, as housing represents a larger fraction of house-
hold wealth than stocks. Moreover, the house price collapse affected not only homeowners
who faced wealth losses, but also the considerable number whose employment is directly or
indirectly related to the construction sector.


3     Comovements and Common Factors
Economic analysis of business cycles is often guided by the impulse-propagation framework
introduced by Frisch (1933) and Slutsky (1937) under which fluctuations arise as small white
noise shocks (impulses) that propagate through the economic system over time. The coher-
ence and phase characteristics of many economic time series appeared to be similar across
countries. Lucas (1977) concluded that business cycles are all alike. Not only are bivariate
correlations between industrialized countries strong as shown in Table 7, but business cy-
cles of developing economies also have characteristics similar to those of developed countries.
Kose, Otrok, and Whiteman (2003) allow regional and country-specific cycles to coexist with
the world business cycle and find that the world factor accounts for a significant fraction of
output growth fluctuations in many countries.

   An alternative to the small-shocks view is that business cycles are dominated by infre-
quent large events, such as the Great Depression of the 1930s or the oil price shocks of the

1970s. Blanchard and Watson (1986) find evidence for both large and small shocks and sug-
gest that business cycle fluctuations are not all alike. New theories of economic fluctuations
have also emerged. Barro (2006) and Gourio (2012) suggest that the anticipation of the
possibility of rare large economic shocks can generate declines in real activity, while Bansal
and Yaron (2004); Bansal, Kiku, and Yaron (2010) argue for the importance of long run
risks. Blanchard (1997) and Comin and Gertler (2006) stressed the importance of medium
run fluctuations as the economy goes from the business cycle stage to growth. It is fair to
say that economists have not settled on a satisfactory explanation for why fluctuations arise.
Perhaps they never will, if different causes of economic fluctuations have many observation-
ally equivalent characteristics.
    Comovements in a wide range of series play a fundamental role in business cycle analy-
ses in the tradition of Burns and Mitchell (1946) (see for example Diebold and Rudebusch
(1996)). A methodological development since the work of Zarnowitz (1985) is that econo-
metricians have settled on the idea of representing these comovements using factor analysis.
The factor representation of a series xit , given by

                                         xit = λ0i Ft + eit                                     (1)

where Ft = (F1t , . . . Frt )0 is a vector of r common factors, λi is the vector of factor loadings,
and eit is the idiosyncratic error. Factor analysis decomposes the variations into those that
are pervasive and those that are idiosyncratic. Shocks with pervasive effects are the source

    To present a factor view of business cycles, we estimate the factors from a monthly panel
of 132 series7 . The factors are estimated by the method of static principal components
(PCA) over the full sample 1960-2011.8 The IC2 criterion Bai and Ng (2002) finds seven
factors accounting for almost 42% of the variation in the data. Table 8 reports the standard
deviation of the factor estimates.

    To facilitate interpretation of the estimated factors, we identify the series that load most
heavily on each of the factors. These are industrial production of manufacturing goods, the
risky spread between Baa bonds and the Fed funds rate, the commodity component of the
CPI, one year bond rate, the 6 month-Fed Funds spread, industrial production of consumer
goods, and the SP500 index, respectively. Observe that five of the seven factors are related
to financial markets. The factors are noticeably more variable during recession years than
the non-recession years. Factor 1 (relating to real activity) has a standard deviation of 0.48
during recession years but only 0.28 during non-recession years. The last factor is highly
correlated with stock returns. Higher volatility in returns during recessions appears to be
a business cycle regularity, (Andersen, Bollerslev, Christoffersen, and Diebold, 2012). The
last column of Table 8 measures the importance of the factors jointly (i.e. the common
component of the data). It is cross-section average of the standard deviation of the common
component Ĉit = λ̂0i F̂t over different subsamples. Since the factors are computed using
   6
     Equation (1) is a static factor model in which the dynamics of the factors are not explicitly modeled.
See Stock and Watson (2002a) Bai and Ng (2008) for a review of the literature. Dynamic factor models are
also widely used in macroeconomic analysis, see Forni, Hallin, Lippi, and Reichlin (2000).
   7
     Stock and Watson (2005), Ludvigson and Ng (2009) used the same 132 series but over a shorter sample.
   8
     The normalization Λ0 Λ/N = Ir is imposed. As a robustness check, the factors are also estimated using
two other ways. Method (ii) assumes that αi (L)yit = λ0i Ft + eit . Using α̂i (L) from preliminary estimation
of an AR(4) model, Ft is estimated by PCA. Method (iii) iteratively estimates Ft depends on αi (L), as in
Stock and Watson (2005).

standardized data, this gives an idea of the relative importance of the common variations.
The average variation of the common component is counter-cyclical, as it is much higher
during recessions.9

    A notable feature in Table 8 is the reduction in volatility of the seven factor estimates and
of the relative importance of the common component in the 1984Q1 to 2006Q4 subsample.
This bears out the Great Moderation phenomenon from the perspective of common factors
rather than the selected series. In addition to unconditional volatility, it is also useful to
                                                                        F

standard deviation of factor j. Properties of the monte-carlo markov chain estimates σ̂t,j
(multiplied by ten) are reported in Table 9. With the exception of factor 3 which loads
heavily on commodity prices, the conditional volatilities of the factors are also significantly
lower during the Great Moderation. The shocks to F̂3 were historically quite volatile both
before 1983 and even during the Great Moderation, which can perhaps be attributed to the
oil and commodity price shocks.
    Explanations for why volatility declined around 1984 include improved inventory control
and supply chain management, better fiscal and monetary policy, and simply good luck from
being hit by smaller productivity and commodity price shocks. Another explanation is that
the manufacturing sector, which has relatively volatile total factor productivity growth—

has declined in importance since the late 1970s. With other more stable sectors rising in
relative importance, the volatility of macroeconomic aggregates naturally declined.
    The Great Moderation was disrupted around 2007. As seen from Table 8, the volatility of
all 7 factors rose going from the Great Moderation to the Great Recession. The volatilities
of F̂3 and F̂7 , which load heavily on commodity prices and stock prices, respectively climbed
above their pre-Great Moderation levels. Table 9 shows that the conditional volatility of the
factor estimates are also higher after 2007. This disruption leads one to reconsider whether
the assumption that the Great Moderation would last forever is overly optimistic. And
indeed, with the benefit of hindsight, it seems noteworthy that even during the 1984-2006
period, the decline in volatility was mostly at high frequencies. As Davis and Kahn (2008)
pointed out, the variance of four-quarter changes in aggregates declined, but less markedly.
Also, while the Great Moderation was observed in most countries, the timing and magnitude
of the decline in volatility differed substantially across countries (Stock and Watson, 2003a).
    The jury is still out on whether the Great Moderation has truly ended, or whether
volatility will return to the low level observed before 2007. There are signs that it might,
as GDP growth has been stable (though sluggish) since early 2009. But aggregate volatility
is a weighted average of sectoral volatility, with weights reflecting the relative importance
of the sectors. These weights are quite different in the digital age than fifty or even twenty
years ago. Time varying volatility is to be expected in a changing economy.


4      The Great Recession
The Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 was not officially announced by the NBER business
cycle dating committee until December 2008. It lasted 18 months and was long by post
WW-II standards, even though it was still shorter than the contractions before WW-I, which
averaged 22 months.11 The Great Recession was characterized by a lower mean growth rate,
stagnant real wages, and by higher volatility in consumption, investment, output, as well
as inflation. This can be seen from the standard deviations of factors F̂1 to F̂7 reported in
Table 8.
    There are also indications of a shift in the relation between vacancies (job openings) and
unemployment in the aftermath of the Great Recession. Traditionally, recessions are periods
of high unemployment with low job openings, yielding a negative relationship between the
vacancy rate and the unemployment rate, known as the Beveridge curve (Beveridge, 1944).
  11
    Aruoba and Diebold (2010) use a dynamic factor model to extract indices of real activity and inflation.
Their index of real activity fell to a very low (but not record low level) during the Great Recession, and was
low for a very long period.


                                                     14
Movements along a convex Beveridge curve are taken to be cyclical shocks while shifts are
typically viewed as structural changes relating to the job matching process. Daly, Hobijn,
Sahin, and Valletta (2012) discuss the Beveridge curve at length, finding that the Great
Recession shifted it to the right by over 2 percentage points, although they argue that
much of this may be the slow adjustment of the unemployment-vacancy relationship in the
aftermath of a severe recession rather than a permanent shift in the Beveridge curve.
    The Great Recession also involved a sharp drop in labor force participation rates, meaning
that the unemployment rate has moved further back towards its pre-crisis level than has the
employment-population ratio. Explanations of non-financial origins have been put forward
for the slow and jobless recovery from the Great Recession. Some, such as Stock and Watson
(2012), argue that this could be due to structural demographic factors, including the leveling
out of female labor force participation and the aging of the population. However, Erceg and
Levin (2013) provide evidence that cyclical factors account for most of the recent decline in
the labor force participation rate. Others argued that the slow recovery owes to increased
skills mismatch, though there is little evidence that wages of the workers whose skills were
in special demand have been rising. Also, the dispersion across industries in employment
growth spiked during the Great Recession, but then fell back quickly (Daly, Hobijn, Sahin,
and Valletta, 2012), which does not seem to fit the mismatch story. Estevão and Tsounta
(2011) estimate that skills mismatch accounts for about half a percentage point of the increase
in unemployment since the onset of the Great Recession. They also find that geographical
mismatch between where jobs and job seekers are available accounts for another small part
of the rise in unemployment.
    Uncertainty has been suggested as a contributing factor to the severity of the Great
Recession. Bloom (2009) and Bloom, Floetotto, Jaimovich, Saporta, and Terry (2012) sug-
gest that firms facing adjustment costs in capital and labor are more cautious in making
hiring and investment decisions when macroeconomic uncertainty is high. In these models,
uncertainty affects business conditions at the aggregate, firm, and unit levels. Fernández-
Villaverde, Guerrón-Quintana, Kuester, and Rubio-Ramı́rez (2012) and Basu and Bundick
(2012) suggest that increased uncertainty about fiscal policy and demand, respectively, can
also cause an economic slowdown. The Great Recession was indeed marked by a high level
of uncertainty. Jurado, Ludvigson, and Ng (2013) define uncertainty in a series as the time
varying volatility of the unforecastable component of the series, while macro or aggregate
uncertainty is a weighted average of the uncertainty measures across series. They find that
uncertainty was higher in the 2007-2009 recession than at any time since 1960 and that
uncertainty shocks have significant and persistent effects on real activity.12 An increase in
 12
      Other commonly-used proxies for uncertainty, such as stock market volatility and cross-sectional variation


                                                       15
uncertainty could of course be more the consequence of a downturn than the cause. Naka-
mura, Sergeyev, and Steinsson (2012) document a strong negative correlation between first
moment shocks and uncertainty shocks. As shown in Bachmann and Moscarini (2011), a
negative shock to the first moment of economic activity causes volatility to increase. The
increase in uncertainty in the Great Recession could have contributed to the depth of the
downturn.
    The Great Recession was also exceptionally global in nature. As seen in Table 7, the
contemporaneous correlation of GDP growth in the US and most other OECD economies is
nearly 1 in the 2007-2012 subsample. Although not reported, correlations have also climbed
for emerging market economies, though less dramatically. In contrast, there was little ev-
idence of increased correlations in GDP growth between countries during the Great Mod-
eration13 , despite the deepening financial linkages (also reported in Table 7) and deepening
trade linkages. The increased correlation during the Great Recession could owe in part to
standard trade linkages, but contagion from the financial crisis originating in the US hous-
ing and mortgage markets is also an essential (and probably much larger) part of the story
(Krugman, 2008; Devereux and Yetman, 2010). The global nature of the Great Recession is
important because it means that there is no external sector that represents a natural source
of demand.


4.1     The Balance Sheet Effect
While all of the recessions since 1985 have had financial origins, the Great Recession was
by far the biggest of these and the timing of events make the link of the Great Recession
to financial markets particularly transparent. Although there had been severe strains in
financial markets since August 2007, the collapse of Lehman in September 2008 and the
subsequent run on money-market mutual funds led to a panic in financial markets. Many
firms experienced a sudden and sharp drop in access to credit, including commercial paper.
Within a matter of weeks, this led to sharp declines in economic activity. These events
have been discussed extensively elsewhere (e.g. Gorton and Metrick (2012)). Figure 1 shows
industrial production and the ISM index, two prominent economic indicators which plunged
in the fall of 2008.
    The developments in financial markets during the Great Recession are consistent with
in firms’ profits, productivity, stock returns (all considered by Bloom (2009)) were also very elevated during
the Great Recession, but Jurado, Ludvigson, and Ng (2013) find that these other proxies are generally only
weakly correlated with aggregate economic uncertainty.
  13
     Imbs (2010) documented the remarkable increase in synchronization of cross-country business cycles
around the time of the Great Recession. The result was also found by Doyle and Faust (2005).

the analysis of Fisher (1933) and Minsky (1986) who argued for the role of credit, leverage
and/or asset price bubbles in understanding at least some business cycles fluctuations. The
leverage view was neglected in the years leading up to the crisis, but has received a great
deal of attention of late14 . Indeed, according to this view, the Great Recession could even
be seen in part as a direct consequence of the Great Moderation, as economic stability
leads to overconfidence which in turn sparks a destabilizing rise in leverage (Keen, 1995;
Brunnermeier and Sannikov, 2013).
    In the Minsky-Fisher view, a sharp increase in leverage leaves the economy vulnerable to
small shocks because once asset prices begin to fall, financial institutions, firms and house-
holds all attempt to deleverage. But with all agents trying to increase savings simultaneously,
the economy loses demand, further lowering asset prices and frustrating the attempt to re-

    See, for example, Adrian and Shin (2012), Guerrieri and Lorenzoni (2011), Hall (2011), Eggertson and
Woodford (2003), and Kroszner, Laeven, and Klingebiel (2007).


                                                                17
pair balance sheets. Financial institutions seek to deleverage, lowering the supply of credit.
Households and firms seek to deleverage, lowering the demand for credit. The ensuing down-
turn is often referred to as a balance sheet recession. Bernanke and Gertler (1989), Bernanke,
Gertler, and Gilchrist (1996), Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1999), Kiyotaki and Moore
(1997), and Brunnermeier, Eisenbach, and Sannikov (2012) consider models with a financial
accelerator mechanism, in which financial frictions can give rise to non-linear amplification
effects. The recessions can be deep and the recoveries slow. Chodorow-Reich (2013) studies
the relationship between the employment level of firms and the health of the banks that
these firms have relationships with, and provides evidence that credit market disruptions
account for about one third to one half of the decline in employment at small and medium
sized firms in the year after the Lehman bankruptcy. Mian, Rao, and Sufi (2011) and Mian
and Sufi (2012) attribute the Great Recession to shocks to household balance sheets weak-
ening aggregated demand. Mian and Sufi (2012) show that counties in the US which were
most leveraged had the sharpest drop in employment in the non-tradeable sector, whereas
job losses in the tradeable sector were much more evenly distributed. This pattern is consis-
tent with the deleveraging and aggregate demand channel being important to explain recent
unemployment.
    Focusing only on postwar aggregate US time series data necessarily gives a small sample
size to evaluate the importance of balance sheet effects in recent downturns. Consequently, it
is important to find ways to increase the effective sample size. Many authors have looked at
longer time series and also at cross-sectional evidence on the empirical relationship between
leverage and the business cycle. This work includes Schularick and Taylor (2012), Reinhart
and Rogoff (2009a,b, 2011) and Jorda, Schularick, and Taylor (2011), who have found that
credit booms and increases in leverage tend to be followed by economic downturns that are
severe and long-lasting, and that the sharper is the pre-crisis increase in leverage, the worse
the subsequent recession.15 On the other hand, while Bordo and Haubrich (2010) also find
that recessions associated with financial crises are exceptionally severe, Bordo and Haubrich
(2012) argue that recoveries from such recessions have been rapid in the U.S. The conclusions
from such exercises are of course sensitive to the classification of which recessions are caused
by financial crises and researchers can reasonably disagree about whether financial factors
were causes or symptoms of specific slowdowns. Reinhart and Rogoff (2012) disagree with
the classification employed by Bordo and Haubrich (2012), which rather unusually treats the
1981 recession as caused by a financial crisis rather than monetary policy.
  15
    For example, Mian and Sufi (2010) documented that ZIP codes in the US which had particularly large
increases in leverage in the mid 2000s subsequently had the worst downturns. Mian, Rao, and Sufi (2011)
and Mian and Sufi (2012) extend these results.



                                                  18
4.2     Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy
Financial institutions played a direct role in the deleveraging aspect of the Great Recession,
but they also played a less transparent role. Financial intermediation has changed radically
over the past three decades, and these changes might have sown the seeds of the financial
crisis. In the traditional banking system, money consists of currency issued by the central
bank plus liabilities of private banks in the form of demand deposits. Savers supply deposits
and banks lend the deposits to borrowers. Banks intermediate by screening and monitoring
borrowers while structuring loans with the desired duration and liquidity. As banks rely on
short-term liabilities to fund longer-term loans, they are required to hold a fraction of deposits
as reserves, which together with deposit insurance guard against bank runs. The Federal
Reserve only controls the monetary base (currency plus reserves) through the overnight rate
at which banks borrow. For a given amount of deposits, an increase in reserves causes
money/credit to shrink. In this traditional framework, the short rate matters for monetary
policy to the extent that it affects the yield curve.
    But since the 1980s, credit has increasingly been generated outside of the traditional
banking system. Whereas in the past banks made loans that they intended to hold on their
balance sheet (originate-to-hold), banks instead began to pool the loans into asset-backed
securities and then sold them (originate-to-distribute). These asset-backed securities were
in turn rehypothecated (i.e. used as collateral for short-term borrowing). Long-term illiquid
assets were effectively converted into instruments perceived to have money-like properties,
as discussed by Pozsar, Adrian, Ashcraft, and Boesky (2010). But the non-bank institutions
holding these instruments were more highly leveraged than traditional banks. They were
lightly regulated, not required to hold reserves, and not covered by deposit insurance. For
some time, unawareness of the riskiness of the collateral, the counterparty risk, the fragility of
these institutions, and of the principal-agent problems inherent in the originate-to-distribute
model led to an oversupply of credit (or credit boom). The prolonged leverage cycle docu-
mented earlier was fueled by low interest rates and the growth of the shadow banking system.
But the high leverage of the shadow banking system left it highly vulnerable to runs, and
such a run began in 2007. The Fed had to use liquidity facilities to adjust the quantity
rather than the cost of credit in order to counteract the effects of shrinking balance sheets
of financial institutions, as discussed by Adrian and Shin (2009).
    During the crisis, central banks around the world responded by cutting nominal short-
term interest rates. At the time of writing in mid 2013, these rates in many countries remain
at levels very close to zero.16 In spite of interest rates near the zero lower bound (ZLB), the
  16
    As agents always have the option of holding cash, the rates cannot be reduced below zero. There have
been some cases of rates falling very slightly below zero, but still for all practical purposes, zero is the lower


                                                       19
output gap remains large and persistent. The US faced extended ZLB periods both in the
Great Depression and the Great Recession, and has had other near brushes with it, such as
in 2003.
    The ZLB impedes the ability of monetary policy to stabilize the economy, and even
presents the potential for the economy to enter into a deflationary spiral.17 To date, the
Great Recession has not been associated with deflation in any country outside Japan. Un-
dershooting their inflation targets is a real concern for central banks as inflationary pressures
are nowhere to be found, quite unlike the situation after the recessions of the 1970s and 1980s.
In a weak economy, with nominal rates stuck at zero, lower inflation drives real rates up, fur-
ther weakening demand, and lowering inflation even more. With their respective economies
stuck at the ZLB, several central banks including the Fed have launched asset purchase pro-
grams, often referred to as quantitative easing, to try to speed up their recoveries. The idea
is that by purchasing assets, the central bank will signal its commitment to keeping rates
low (Eggertson and Woodford, 2003) and/or lower term/risk premia.


5     Implications for Forecasting
The financial crisis and the Great Recession call for the need to better monitor credit,
asset prices, and more generally to capture the possibly non-linear link between real and
financial variables that seem to be different from recessions of the 1970s and 1980s. When
recessions are of different origins, three questions become central for economic forecasting and
monitoring:- is the predictive power of the key variables stable, are conventional models and
methodologies providing timely signals of recessions, and are the necessary data available?


5.1     The Predictive Power of Interest Rate Spreads
Asset prices are forward-looking variables that are available at high frequency, and that ought
to contain information about investors’ beliefs concerning the near-term path of the economy.
One might therefore hope that asset prices would be useful for predicting economic activity,
and this question has indeed generated a vast literature (see Stock and Watson (2003b) and
the references therein). Alas, the track record of forecasting models using asset prices is not
good, or at least not consistent. As observed by Hamilton (2011), there are many cases of
forecasting methods working well in-sample, or even in pseudo-out-of-sample experiments,
but then subsequently giving poor forecasts.
bound on nominal interest rates.
  17
     See, for example, Adrian and Shin (2012), Guerrieri and Lorenzoni (2011), Hall (2011), Eggertson and
Woodford (2003) and Reifschneider and Williams (2000).

                                                   20
    Many papers attempt to use the term structure of nominal interest rates to forecast
growth. If changes in the stance of monetary policy were important drivers of business cycle
fluctuations, then we would expect the slope of the yield curve to have predictive power for
future growth. For example, if the Fed were to tighten monetary policy, then this would
cause short term interest rates to go up, long-term interest rates to go down (lower expected
inflation) and so cause the yield curve to flatten or even invert. And it would cause a
slowdown in economic activity.
    In addition to term spreads, various researchers have considered using spreads on private-
sector securities over comparable maturity Treasuries to forecast economic activity. The
idea is that widening spreads ought to indicate expectations of default or disruptions to
the supply of credit. However, the results are sensitive to the choice of credit spread and
sample period. Part of the problem is that conventional indices of credit spreads are all
for a particular credit rating, and the meanings of these ratings vary over time. Recently,
some papers find that credit spreads formed from comparing individual corporate bonds
with comparable maturity Treasuries, and then sorting these into portfolios by maturity
and distance-to-default contain substantially more out-of-sample predictive power for future
economic activity than conventional corporate bond spreads, (see Gilchrist, Yankov, and
Zakrajsek (2008), Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2012) and Faust, Gilchrist, Wright, and Zakrajsek
(2013)).
    While there are reasons to believe that term and credit spreads should have some pre-
dictive power for economic activity, the question is whether the predictive power is robust.
To address this question, we consider a predictive model of the form

                              h
                             yt+h = β0 + Σpj=1 βj yt−j + γzt + εt                         (2)

where yt denotes growth in real GDP or some other aggregate in quarter t (defined as
                             h                                                         h
100 log(GDPt /GDPt−1 )), yt+h    denotes h + 1−period growth ending in quarter t + h (yt+h ≡
  h
Σj=0 yt+j ), and zt is some spread. The equation is estimated in rolling 40-quarter windows,
and then used for pseudo out-of-sample forecasting. The forecasts are then compared to
those from an autoregressive benchmark that omits the spread variable:

                                h
                               yt+h = β0 + Σpj=1 βj yt+1−j + εt                           (3)

    Figure 2 shows the rolling 40-quarter moving average of root mean square prediction
errors (RMSPEs) from estimating (2) relative to those from estimating equation (3), where
the predictor zt is either the ten-year over three-month Treasury spread (top panels) or the
excess corporate bond spread of Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2012) (bottom panels). Results

are shown for horizons of h = 0 quarters (nowcasting) h = 1 quarter and h = 4 quarters.18
The rolling relative RMSPEs are plotted against the middle quarter of the 40-quarter period.
For windows centered in the early 1980s, the relative RMSPE at the four-quarter-horizon
for the term spread is well below 1, indicating that the term spread is indeed adding incre-
mental predictive information. However, later in the sample, inclusion of the term spread
substantially weakens forecast accuracy.19 The results are quite different for the corporate

     The Treasury term spread data are from 1960Q1 to 2012Q1. The corporate spread data are from 1973Q1
to 2010Q3, from Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2012).
  19
     The yield curve was inverted in 2006 and early 2007, but the yield curve had steepened once again well
before the Great Recession reached its acute phase, and in recent years, the yield curve has been steep, even
though growth has been weak.

spreads. For windows centered around 1990, inclusion of corporate spreads gives less accu-
rate forecasts than the autoregressive benchmark. But, later in the sample, inclusion of
the credit spread helps a good deal, especially at short horizons. This is consistent with the
availability of credit being important factors in explaining recent business cycle fluctuations.
The credit spreads considered here widened substantially in late 2007 and the first half of
2008. At the same time, the out-of-sample estimation of (2) using the credit spreads of
Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2012) failed to predict the magnitude of the downturn in the fall of
2008. The results suggest that the performance of the term and credit spreads as predictors
of economic activity is somewhat episodic.20

    One can ask if the difference between the squared forecast error using equation (3) and
equation (2) is related to other variables in the information set at the time the forecast is
made denoted wt , as suggested by Giacomini and White (2006).21 We let wt be the GDP
share of the financial sector and/or household or firm asset-liabilities ratios. The results are
shown in Table 10 for different horizons and variables in wt . The larger is the size of the
financial sector, or the more leveraged are households and firms, the more the inclusion of
credit spreads helps with forecasting performance. The relationship is statistically significant
in nearly every case.
    There are a number of different stories to explain this relationship. One is that credit
spreads are more useful predictors of economic activity in a more highly leveraged economy.
Another possibility is that leverage has trended up, and at the same time, developments
in financial markets mean that credit spreads provide more information than they had pre-
viously. But our results are consistent with the idea that business cycle fluctuations have
different origins. The recessions of the early 1980s were caused by the Fed tightening mone-
tary policy so as to lower inflation, with the effect of generating both an inverted yield curve
and two recessions. The origins of the Great Recession were instead in excess leverage and
a housing/credit bubble.
    This is not a happy state of affairs from a standard forecasting perspective. If the relevant
predictors are constantly changing over time, then there is little hope for anticipating business
cycle fluctuations ahead of time using simple models with few predictors as in (3). Recent
work that exploits the data rich environment to form either averages of many predictors or
averages of many models holds some promise in providing better forecasts, but even these
  20
     A similar finding was reported in (Giacomini and Rossi, 2010; Rossi and Sekhposyan, 2010). Ng (2013)
also finds that term and credit spreads have independent explanatory power in predicting recessions, but
their relative importance varies over time and no single spread performs systematically well.
  21
     If one forecast is better than another only conditional on some other observed variable, then both
forecasting models must be in some way misspecified. But writing out the correctly specified or encompassing
model is not a trivial exercise.

5.2     Calling Turning Points in Real Time
Related to the idea of forecasting business cycles is the idea of identifying business cycle
turning points as accurately and quickly as possible. Harding and Pagan (2006), Chau-


                                                  24
vet and Hamilton (2006) and Chauvet and Piger (2008) propose automatic methods for
identifying business cycle peaks and troughs in real time, which is related to the idea of now-
casting. It is an important endeavor because the NBER announcements involve an element
of subjective judgment which econometricians might prefer to avoid, and because the NBER
announcements come out with a considerable lag. The turning point dates proposed by
these methods are generally quite close to NBER dates. The algorithms call the peaks and
troughs at roughly the same time as the NBER announcements (Hamilton, 2011). Hamilton
(2011) discusses reasons why it is hard to reduce the lag time. One reason is that real-time
data are subject to large revisions. Another is that business cycle features tend to change
over time.
    To investigate how these methodologies fare in real time, we estimate a probit model
for the NBER business cycle dummy for each quarter t starting in 1980Q1 using real time
predictors taken from the dataset of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia or from the
Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF). For the business cycle dummy, peaks and troughs
were recorded only after they had been announced. The models that we considered used the
following predictors:

  (i) The real-time growth rates of industrial production and employment over the previous
      quarter, as observed in the middle of quarter t.

 (ii) The probability that real GDP growth is negative in the current quarter, as reported
      in the SPF survey.

(iii) The real-time growth rate of industrial production in the current quarter, obtained
      from the SPF. Note that the survey forecast for industrial production growth in the
      current quarter is not the same as the survey probability in (ii).

(iv) The ten-year over three-month Treasury spread.

 (v) The excess corporate bond spread of Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2012).

 Notes: This table shows the dates that recessions began and ended as determined by the NBER
and the five automatic methods that we consider. These methods are based on real-time probit
regressions of NBER recession dummies onto variables as follows: industrial production and em-
ployment growth in the previous quarter (quarter t − 1); SPF probability of negative growth in
the current quarter; the SPF forecast of industrial production growth in the current quarter; term
spreads in the current quarter; credit spreads in the current quarter. The regression is run using
data available at the time of the release of each round of the SPF. A peak is called whenever there
are two consecutive quarters where the fitted probability exceeds 65 percent, and the date of the
peak is the first quarter that the probability rose above 50 percent. A trough is called similarly.
NC means that the method in question did not call a peak or trough corresponding to this NBER
recession. For each method, the row labeled “date call made” indicates the date that the turning
point was called.




                                                26
    Each of these methods gives us the fitted probability of a recession in quarter t. Following
Hamilton (2011), a peak occurs if the fitted probability exceeds 65 percent, and we date the
peak as being the first quarter that this fitted probability exceeds 50 percent. Likewise a
trough is called if the fitted probability falls below 35 percent, and we date the trough as
being the last quarter that the fitted probability exceeds 50 percent.
    Table 11 reports the peak and trough dates called by this algorithm, along with the
dates in which the algorithm called the turning points. The NBER turning points and
announcement dates are also shown for reference. Method (i) generally agrees with the
NBER dates and calls turning points at around the same time. Methods (ii) and (iii) however
call the turning points a bit faster. In fact, method (ii) calls every turning point before the
NBER announcement with the sole exception of the 2007Q4 trough. However, this algorithm
completely missed the 2001 recession, as no trough was ever called. Method (iii) calls all
but two turning points no later than the NBER announcement, and does not miss the 2001
recession. Among the financial variables, the term spread called both recessions associated
with the Volcker disinflation very quickly, but entirely missed all subsequent recessions—the
yield curve inverted around subsequent recessions, but only marginally. In contrast, the
credit spread did a reasonably good job of calling the last two recessions, but missed the
second Volcker recession and the 1990-1991 recession. All this is consistent with the idea
that term and credit spreads are useful, but somewhat episodic, indicators.
    It is interesting that the probit model using the SPF probabilities of negative growth in
the current quarter or the current-quarter industrial production growth forecast (models (ii)
and (iii)) seems to do the best job of calling turning points in real time. It is consistent with
the evidence that subjective survey forecasts are very good for measuring the current state
of the economy (Faust and Wright, 2009). At the same time, it is important to underscore
that these survey probabilities are purely judgmental. We have no model for how they are
formed. It would be appealing to have a mechanical way of calling turning points in real-
time using only data produced by statistical agencies, or using only financial variables. Like
Hamilton (2011), we find that it is very hard to do this within a parametric framework much
faster than the NBER business cycle dating committee.


5.3    The Challenges Ahead
The previous two subsections suggest that the changing origins of the business cycle helps
explain the episodic performance of conditionally homoskedastic forecasting models with
time invariant parameters. The shortcomings also provide guides as to how forecasts and
monitoring be improved.


                                               27
    In terms of methodology, the financial crisis highlights the need to model parameter
instability. There is some evidence that the performance of combination forecasts may be
more stable than that of individual forecasts (Stock and Watson, 2003b). Also, volatility
clustering is no longer a feature that macroeconomists can ignore. But efficient estimation
of volatility model typically requires a larger number of observations than are available for
macroeconomic analysis.
    More generally, variation in financial time series occurs at frequencies much higher than
those at which real activity variables are measured. Important contributions have been made
to the task of analyzing data at different frequencies by Andreou, Ghysels, and Kourtellos
(2013) and Auroba, Diebold, and Scotti (2009) and this is an active area of research.
    The choice of variables used for forecasting is closely related to parameter instability. As a
result of the gradual shift from traditional to shadow banking and for other reasons, conven-
tional measures of the money supply no longer bear a simple relation with economic activity.
New measures of money have been proposed, such as MZM—money-at-zero-maturity—to
measure the supply of financial assets that are redeemable at par and on demand, includ-
ing items such as money-market mutual funds. There is some evidence that MZM bears a
more stable relationship with economic activity and interest rates (Teles and Zhou, 2005).
Nonetheless, while MZM data are available since 1959, they are rarely used in academic
research. MZM does not include repurchase agreements—and there is currently no official
measure of the US money supply that does so.
    While it is now clear that financial instability can have serious real consequences, we do
not yet have a robust measure of financial stability, which impedes our ability to monitor it.
Financial stability depends among other things, on asset and liability positions, measures of
credit, leverage at both the household and firm level, and in a shadow banking environment,
the length of rehypothetication chain. As pointed out in Adrian and Shin (2010), financial
intermediaries balance sheet quantities reflect capital market conditions and thus the state
of the economy. Yet data on the shadow banking system have been hard for researchers or
even regulators to obtain. At a practical level, measuring the flow of credit during the most
intense part of the crisis is tricky. For example, firms drew down their contractual lines of
credit, in precautionary demand for liquidity, and banks had difficulty securitizing loans,
and had to keep them on their balance sheets. For a while, such effects made aggregate
lending appear to be increasing despite the evident panic in financial markets. Cohen-Cole,
Duygan-Bump, Fillat, and Montoriol-Garriga (2008) give a very comprehensive discussion
of the issues, as seen in the fall of 2008.
    A different data challenge, emphasized by Gorton (2012), is that obtaining a reasonable
sample size means using data going a long way back. The Great Depression is the closest


                                               28
precedent for the Great Recession (especially given the global nature of both of these events),
but the structure of the economy has of course changed massively since the 1930s. Data from
a long time ago may not be a good guide to what we should expect going forward. Also,
government responses to crises make disentangling causality difficult.


6    Implications for Identification Analysis
The exercise of disentangling the sources of business cycles would be challenging even if
recessions all had the same origins because the impulse and propagating mechanism of shocks
cannot be separately identified from the data without additional assumptions, and validation
of the assumptions is difficult when the true propagating mechanisms are never observed.
The episodic nature of recessions makes such an exercise even more difficult.
     A broad approach to understanding business cycle dynamics is to write down a (partial
or general) equilibrium model that specifies the complete environment in which decisions of
households and firms are made. Because models with too many features are computationally
demanding, researchers tend to focus on features directly related to the problem of interest
while leaving many aspects of the economy unspecified. The cost of starting from micro-
foundations is that equilibrium models do not encompass the details found in models of the
Cowles foundation type. As is true of all identification analysis, the dynamic responses of
structural models necessarily reflect the assumptions imposed. Often, the fit and forecasting
properties of these models are not well understood. The ability of equilibrium models to re-
cover the true propagating mechanisms rests on correct specification of the economic model
and probably has less to do with econometric methods per se.
     An alternative is a limited information approach that identifies the responses of interest
from a reduced form model such as a vector-autoregression (VAR) that fits the data well. A
VAR for N covariance stationary series collected into a N ×1 vector Xt is defined by a system
of linear equations A(L)Xt = ut where in the most basic form, ut ∼ (0, Ω) is a N ×1 vector of
homoskedastic white noise errors and the parameters in A(L) are time invariant. Invertibility
is imposed to yield the Wold moving-average representation Xt = ψ(L)ut , where ψ(L) is a
one-sided polynomial in positive powers of the lag operator L. As we can premultiply ut and
post-multiply ψ(L) by any N × N non-invertible matrix H, the impulse and the propagating
mechanism are not separately identifiable. Assumptions are needed to pin down a specific
H so that t = Hut can be given the desired structural interpretation.
     VARs are widely used, because under covariance stationarity and invertibility, the Wold
representation provides the best linear approximation to the data. The identified impulse
responses often ‘make sense’ without fully specifying an economic model. Much work has

                                              29
been done in recent years to try to extend the VAR framework in important new directions:

  (i) Time varying parameters (VAR-TVP) and stochastic volatility (VAR-SV) incorporated
      into VARs in part to address the debate as to whether the Great Moderation was a
      consequence of a reduction in the volatility of shocks versus a change in the propagation
      mechanism (Sims and Zha, 2006; Cogley and Sargent, 2005; Primiceri, 2005; Giannone,
      Lenza, and Reichlin, 2008; Gali and Gambetti, 2009). These extensions allow the H
      matrix to be time varying.

 (ii) There is a concern that the invertibility assumption restricts identification to primitive
      shocks that can be mapped to the innovations of the VAR. This precludes models with
      more complex information structures that frustrate the mapping from the structural
      shocks to ut , and hence is not suited for analyzing shocks that are known by agents
      ahead of time (Leeper, Walker, and Yang, 2013). A related issue is that variables
      excluded from the system are assumed to be weakly exogenous for the parameters of
      interest. Because VARs are exactly identified, the exogeneity assumption is difficult to
      validate beyond adding or dropping a variable to check for robustness. Both problems
      can be alleviated, at least in theory, by letting N be large. This reduces the possibility
      of omitted variables, and also make it less likely for the problem of non-fundamentalness
      to arise, Forni, Giannone, Lippi, and Reichlin (2009). However, large VARs are not
      feasible to estimate given a finite number of time series observations. The dimension of
      the problem can be reduced if Xt has a factor structure, as considered in (1). Assuming
      that the r common factors have dynamics characterized by Φ(L)Ft = ηt , it is easy to
      see that the augmented system consisting of Xt and Ft is still a VAR. The factor
      augmented VAR (FAVAR) implies a moving average representation:

                                     Xt = ψ1 (L)ηt + ψ2 (L)et .

     Identification now requires specification of a N × r matrix to rotate ηt to the structural
     common shocks t The ut in a VAR in Xt is a linear combination of the innovations in
     a FAVAR. The appeal of the FAVAR is that it allows the effects of common shocks to
     be analyzed while keeping the dimension of the system small. FAVARs have been used
     to understand the transmission mechanism of monetary policy (Bernanke and Boivin,
     2003).

The VAR-TVP, VAR-SV and FAVAR models all admit linear state space representations,
just like the basic VAR. Identification analysis still boils down to imposing assumptions on
H. A natural question to ask is whether a VAR or its extended variants are appropriate

                                              30
for business cycle analysis when recessions are episodic. The magnitude and breadth of the
Great Recession gives us some reasons to suspect that it cannot readily be accommodated
within a linear state space framework:

  (i) It is questionable whether the same variables can be used to analyze non-financial
      and financial recessions alike. The balance sheet effect which was crucial in explaining
      the Great Recession may not be well identified because there is only one such large
      episode in the post-war sample. Furthermore, data on credit-worthiness of firms and
      households are not available for a very long time span.

 (ii) With unprecedented events like the Lehman collapse, and the growing importance of
      shadow banking, the possibility of new common shocks is real. Increased global linkages
      may also require consideration of new shocks. Some evidence indicates that r is not
      constant over time. According to the IC2 criterion, there are seven factors in the full
      sample spanning 1960 to 2011, but there are 5, 8 and 3 in the 1960-1983, 1984-2006
      and 2007-2011 subsamples, respectively. Bai and Ng (2007) report further evidence on
      the sensitivity of the number of factors to the sample period, using dynamic factors.
      However, FAVAR analysis does not yet allow the number of common shocks r to be
      time-varying: there is no room for shocks to ‘pop’ in and out of the VAR.

(iii) The data used in VARs are often detrended in a way that prohibits low frequency
      variations from interacting with the ones at business cycle frequencies. For example,
      HP filtered data Xt are obtained by applying a two-sided filter B(L) with constant
      parameters to observed data, say, Yt . If the secular trends are responsible for the Great
      Moderation and the slow recovery from the Great Recession as has been suggested, we
      may need the coefficients in B(L) to vary in a way that reflect the secular changes. Re-
      straining the coefficients to be constant would inadvertently constrain the propagating
      mechanisms we uncover.

    In a sense, the issues relate to the fact that while the Wold representation seems appro-
priate for analyzing small shocks in a stationary environment, it is no longer optimal in any
particular sense when the data are not covariance stationary. Furthermore, a linear charac-
terization may be inadequate when the data exhibit features like the Great Recession. For
example, fiscal multipliers may be greater at the zero lower bound than in normal times.22
The ZLB is itself a form of non-linearity. But the length of time that the US economy has
been stuck in this liquidity trap is happily still too short for conventional macroeconomic
 22
   See for example Eggertson and Woodford (2003), Woodford (2011) and Christiano, Eichenbaum, and
Rebelo (2011).

                                               31
time series analysis. Most existing macroeconomic, finance, and term structure models sim-
ply ignore the non-linearity induced by ZLB.


6.1    Non-linearities and Identification
Numerous models suggest the possibility of non-linear dynamics in business cycles. Indeed,
the fact that the univariate properties of output growth are well characterized by a two-state
Markov switching model (Hamilton, 1989), as discussed above, is evidence for some reduced
form nonlinearity. Still, beyond this, there is little empirical evidence for non-linearity in
aggregate data. The idea that small shocks can sometimes have outsized effects, which is
central to the financial accelerator mechanism, does not show up clearly in aggregate time
series data. The difficulty from an identification standpoint is that non-linearities at the firm
and household level may not survive aggregation. To illustrate this point, we simulate data
from four models each with two factors as follows:

                    Model 1 Xit = λi1 F1t + λi2 F2t + eit
                    Model 2 Xit = λi1 F1t + λi2 F2t + γi 1F1t−1 <=−.2 + eit
                    Model 3 Xit = (λi1 + γit )F1t + λi2 F2t + eit
                    Model 4 Xit = λi1 F1t + λi2 F2t + γi Ft−1 Ft−2 + eit

where in each case, Fjt = ρFj Fjt−1 + ηjt with ρF1 = .8 and ρF2 = .5 . For each i = 1, . . . N ,
uit = ρi uit−1 + wit with ρi ∼ [0, .8], λi ∼ N (0, 1), γi ∼ U [0, 1] and γit ∼ U [0, 1]. The shocks
eit and ηjt are iid N(0,1) and mutually uncorrelated.
    The benchmark is Model 1, which is linear in the factors. In Model 2, the effect of a
shock to the first common factor depends on F1t−1 . Model 3 introduces time variation in the
loadings on the first factor. Model 4 allows for a multiplicative interaction between the two
factors. The IC2 criterion of Bai and Ng (2002) correctly indicates two factors in models
1 and 3, but three factors in models 2 and 4. Omitted non-linearity can lead to spurious
additional factors.
    The effect of a shock to F1 is obtained by computing the generalized impulse response
averaged over 100 different starting values. These responses, shown as the solid blue line
in Figure 3, are computed using the true parameters and factors, and no estimation is
involved. To see how well a linear model approximates the true dynamic responses, two sets
of responses are computed. The first estimates a linear VAR in Xit , F1t , F2t for each i and
then average the responses over i. This is shown as the dotted red line. The second method
aggregates Xit into X̄t and impulse responses are obtained from a VAR in (X̄t , F1t , F2t ). This


                                                32
is shown as the black line.
    For each of the four non-linear models considered, it is easy to find cases where the linear
response for some i is very far from the series specific non-linear response. But what about
the aggregate response? The top left panel for model 1 shows that the linear VAR closely
approximates the true responses when the true model has no non-linear dynamics. For model
2, the top right panel shows that the linear model gives a smoother response but estimates
the shape of the response function quite well. The bottom left panel shows that in spite of
omitted time variation in the loadings in model 3, the actual response is well approximated
by the linear model. For model 4, the linear VAR underestimates the true response at impact
significantly but the adjustment path is close to the true after four periods.

     impulse responses (red dots) and the aggregated linear impulse responses (black dashed line).



    Overall, the linear VAR is not doing a bad job approximating the true responses in spite
of omitted non-linearity. It does not matter whether we aggregate the individual response

                                                           33
or aggregate the data. Of course, the results are specific to the parameterizations chosen.
The point is that even if non-linear dynamics are at work, a linear VAR may approximate
the propagating mechanism reasonably well, though the correct non-linear model will do
better. Consequently it is very hard to identify the non-linearity from aggregate data alone.
This goes back to our earlier remark that if certain variables are omitted and/or the number
of factors is incorrectly specified, the identification ability of linear models can be severely
compromised. Finding the right variables for analysis is at least as important as finding the
correct functional form.
    Non-linearity is an important part of the theories that attempt to explain the Great
Recession with a financial accelerator mechanism along the lines of Bernanke, Gertler, and
Gilchrist (1996). Given the size of the subprime mortgage market relative to the global
economic system, the Great Recession seems a classic case of a modest initial impulse having
an outsized effect. It would be reassuring if the data provided evidence for non-linearity in
support of the theories. Stock and Watson (2012) fit a dynamic model with six common
factors to 198 quarterly time series in US postwar data to disentangle the channels of the
Great Recession. They find no non-linearity or structural break in the parameters of this
dynamic factor model. They conclude that the Great Recession owes mainly to particularly
large shocks to the financial and uncertainty factors, but the dynamic effect of those shocks
on the economy was largely the same as in earlier business cycles. This suggests that the
Great Recession is similar to other recessions, just bigger, at least from the perspective
of a dynamic factor model fitted to quarterly aggregate data. This finding may well be
a consequence of our limited ability to identify non-linear effects in aggregate data with
the econometric tools at hand, as our simulation exercise illustrates. In this regard, it is
notable that Sims (2012) considered a 6-variable VAR in monthly data and found that in
the last 3 months of 2008 and the first half of 2009, the residuals were large in magnitude
and oscillating in sign 23 . Thus large shocks were not simply feeding through the unchanged
propagation mechanism. The quarterly data of Stock and Watson (2012) may be too low a
frequency to see this. Higher frequency data, more disaggregated data, or new econometric
tools may help uncover clearer evidence of non-linearity.


7      Conclusions
In this paper, we have updated some of the business cycle facts characterized by Zarnowitz
(1985). There have been important developments in the economy since then. One is the
  23
    The VAR was estimated on data through September 2007 and then out-of-sample residuals were com-
puted.


                                                34
reduction in volatility known as the Great Moderation. That decline in volatility was ended—
or at least interrupted—by the Great Recession. All the recessions since the mid 1980s have
had financial origins, although the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions were mild and brief. The
last three recessions have been characterized by slow and jobless recoveries, unlike the rapid
bouncebacks from earlier downturns. Productivity appears to have become somewhat less
procyclical. Examining business cycles over many countries and over a long time period,
most researchers find that recoveries from recessions with financial-market origins are sys-
tematically different, and slower. There have also been important econometric developments
since Zarnowitz wrote, including models with time-varying parameters, regime switching
models and the use of factor analysis to incorporate the information from a large panel of
data. We have used these new tools.
    There is an apparent lack of encompassing—forecasting and economic models that can
explain the facts uniformly well across business cycles. This is perhaps an inevitable outcome
given the changing nature of business cycles. The fact that business cycles are not all alike
naturally means that variables that predict activity have a performance that is episodic.
Notably, we find that term spreads were good predictors of economic activity in the 1970s
and 1980s, but that credit spreads have fared better more recently. This is of course a
challenge for forecasters, as we do not know the origins of future business cycle fluctuations.
Much needs to be learned to determine which and how financial variables are to be monitored
in real time especially in an evolving economy when historical data do not provide adequate
guidance.
    Explanations for the Great Recessions usually involve some form of non-linearity. The
sudden nature of the downturn following the collapse of Lehman is consistent with non-
linearity being part of the transmission mechanism. At the same time, we lack robust
evidence of non-linearity from aggregate low-frequency macroeconomic data. Essentially,
there is an identification issue as different structural models can fit aggregate macroeconomic
data about equally well. Breaking this observational equivalence, by looking at higher-
frequency or more disaggregated data, is the cutting edge of business cycle research.
