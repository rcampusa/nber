The Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) program is a major research
training program administered by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with funds appropriated
each year by Congress. This study examines the impact of NRSA postdoctoral fellowships on
subsequent research-related career outcomes using NIH administrative records on applicants who
applied for a fellowship between 1996 and 2008. We find that postdoctoral fellowships increased
the probability of receiving subsequent NIH research awards from 6.3 to 8.2 percentage points
and of achieving an NIH-funded R01 award, an indication of an independent research career,
from 4.6 to 6.1 percentage points. Our findings demonstrate that the NRSA postdoctoral
fellowship awards have the potential to promote retention of scientists in NIH-funded research
and in the biomedical workforce pipeline.

INTRODUCTION

          The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has advanced the frontier of biomedical research

and innovation since its inception in the 1930s. The NIH mission includes funding and training

the next generation of scientists. Since 1974, the NIH has formally committed to training high-

potential, early-career scientists to carry out the nation’s biomedical research agenda through

the congressionally mandated Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service (NRSA) Award.

While the NRSA programs are subject to periodic review (National Research Council 2011),

few researchers have specifically examined the impact of NIH’s investment in the NRSA F32

postdoctoral program on subsequent receipt of NIH funding for research. Using NIH

administrative records on applicants and awardees of NRSA F32 fellowships between 1996

and 2008, this study provides evidence that an F32 fellowship substantially increases the

likelihood of obtaining subsequent NIH research funding, including the probability of an NIH

R01 grant, which is a major indicator of transition to an independent biomedical research

career.

          We examine two questions: (1) Does the NRSA F32 fellowship affect the likelihood of

future NIH funding? These outcomes are measured by whether a fellowship applicant or

awardee applies for or receives a Research Project Grant (RPG) award, 5 the number of RPG

awards, and whether they appear as an NIH RPG applicant four years or more from the time

they applied for the NRSA F32 award; (2) Does the NRSA F32 award contribute to an NIH-

funded independent research career? This outcome is measured by the probability of

receiving an NIH R01 award, considered a milestone that establishes an independent research
5
 In recent years, Research Project Grant awards include the following grant mechanisms: R00, R01, R03, R15, R21,
R33, R34, R35, R36, R37, R50, R56, R61, RC1, RC2, RC3, RC4, RF1, RL1, RL2, RL9, P01, P42, PM1, PN1,
RM1, UA5, UC1, UC2, UC3, UC4, UC7, UF1, UG3, UH2, UH3, UH5, UM1, UM2, U01, U19, U34, DP1, DP2,
DP3, DP4, DP5. For more information, see: https://grants.nih.gov/grants/glossary.htm#ResearchGrants. While the
definition of RPGs changes slightly from year to year, these mechanisms give a general overview of the mechanisms
generally included in research project grant awards.

career, four years or more after applying to the NRSA F32 award (Science Careers Editors

2007, Rockey 2014). We use the scoring of fellowship applications and matching techniques

that allow us to analyze the outcomes of individuals who received the fellowship award from

those whose application scores and observable characteristics are similar, but who did not

receive an award.

       We find that the average treatment effect of an NRSA F32 postdoctoral award (for all

applicants) increases the future probability of receiving NIH research funding by anywhere from

6.3 to 8.2 percentage points and the probability of receiving NIH R01 funding by anywhere from

4.6 to 6.1 percentage points on average. We find that the benefits are slightly larger for the

average treatment effect on the treated (for those who received the award), increasing the

probability of receiving NIH funding by 7.0 to 8.8 percentage points and the probability of

receiving an NIH R01 award by 4.9 to 6.5 percentage points. Overall, this study provides

evidence demonstrating the positive impact of the F32 program and informs policymakers

regarding the value of future investments in the program.

       The paper proceeds as follows. First, we review the literature on the effect of particular

postdoctoral and graduate appointment types on career outcomes. Second, we introduce the

NRSA F32 fellowship award and scoring process. Third, we discuss the data. Fourth, we

examine the fellowship award process and our matching identification strategy. Fifth, we

evaluate the results and robustness checks. Finally, we conclude with our discussion of the

impact of the NRSA F32 award on career outcomes.

BACKGROUND

           The NRSA program has multiple award mechanisms that fund research training in

biomedical science (NIH 2001; NIH 2002; NIH 2003). These include institutional training

programs for undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs and individual fellowships for

graduate students pursuing PhD students or postdoctorates. Historically, NRSA fellowships

have been highly competitive. In 2008, the NIH allocated around $751.2 million in funding to

NRSA programs to support research training for 16,370 undergraduate students, graduate

students and postdoctoral researchers (https://report.nih.gov/nihdatabook/NIH Office of

Budget, 2017). 6 Of these NRSA awardees or appointees 1,487 (around 9.1% percent) received

the NRSA F32 postdoctoral fellowship award. Between 1998 7 and 2008, the number of F-series

fellowship awards funded by the NIH increased by 15.2 percent, as shown in panel A of Figure

1. While NIH increased the total number of F-series awards, it also diversified the F-mechanism

by funding more positions in other F-series awards, causing the total number of NRSA F32

postdoctoral fellowship awards funded in any given year to decrease over the period by 21.9

percent (see Figure 1, panel A).

           Our analysis focuses only on the NRSA F32 postdoctoral award, which is an award

applied for or received prior to or during a transition toward research independence. Also

important to note is that even though overall the F-series fellowship awards have experienced

growth over the period of our study, they grew much more slowly than the number of PhDs

conferred in biological sciences during that time. According to the National Science Foundation,

the number of new PhDs in biomedical sciences grew annually from 5,838 in 2000 to 7,797 in

2008, an increase of 33.6 percent between 2000 and 2008 (Fiegener, 2011).

The Effect of Postdoctoral Study on Career Outcomes

       There are a limited number of studies that have examined the impact of a postdoctoral

appointment (postdoc) on later career outcomes. Those that do have combined many academic

fields making it difficult to generalize the results to fields like biomedical science (Su 2013,

Levitt 2010, National Science Board 2014, Nerad & Cerny 1999). Several studies investigated

the impact of a postdoc on subsequent placement in academic careers. Su (2013) found that

longer duration postdocs are not associated with improved academic placements. Levitt (2010)

examined the association between the 1992-94 cohorts of NRSA F32 postdocs and their

subsequent biomedical careers. He found significant gender differences in outcomes; women

were more likely to leave scientific research careers than men. Career trajectories of women

appeared to be affected by measures related to their mentor’s quality. For female postdocs, the

higher the mentor’s h-index, the more likely the postdoc was to receive an NIH grant. Levitt

concludes his study by raising the possibility that his results may not be extrapolated to more

recent NRSA cohorts.

       Some studies indicate a negative impact of postdoctoral and graduate appointments.

Kahn and Ginther (2017) found that individuals who took a postdoc in biomedical fields were

paid substantially less in future employment than those who skipped the postdoc. Although

the postdoc was useful for obtaining an academic tenure-track research position, Kahn and

Ginther found that the likelihood of achieving this goal dropped considerably over time.

Blume-Kohout (2016) used the Survey of Earned Doctorates to examine whether graduate

research assistantships or grants were more effective at launching research careers than

graduate student support by NIH training grants or fellowships. Surprisingly, she found that

graduate students with research assistantships had more successful research outcomes in terms



                                                  7
of research-focused jobs (Blume-Kohout 2016) although this study did not address postdocs

funded by different mechanisms. The evidence on the impact of postdoctoral and graduate

training on later career outcomes in general is mixed, and the evidence on the impact of

NRSA postdoctoral fellowships using an adequate methodology in particular is limited,

prompting this study. That said, studies assessing the impact of federal investments in training

the biomedical research workforce, including evaluation studies commissioned by the federal

government, show that individuals participating in NIH training programs experience higher

rates of remaining in scientific research in comparison to their counterparts who did not receive

formal NIH training (Pion 2001; Mantovani et al 2006).

         Our work is most closely related to studies by Jacob and Lefgren (2011a, 2011b). Using a

regression discontinuity design (RDD), these authors found that receiving an NIH postdoctoral

fellowship increased publications by 20 percent in the next five years relative to non-awardees

(Jacob and Lefgren 2011a). In addition, their study found that NIH postdoctoral fellows received

higher dollar amounts in subsequent NIH funding compared to non-awardees. Our analysis

below indicates that RDD has limitations for estimating the impact of the NRSA F32 award

because not all NIH institutes and centers fund NRSA F32 proposals in the order of the score

received. A detailed discussion of the F32 application, review and award process is discussed

below.



The NRSA F32 Postdoctoral Proposal Process

         A thorough understanding of the NRSA application and award process is necessary for

the development of our empirical approach. The goal of the NRSA F32 award is “to enhance

the research training of promising postdoctoral applicants who have the potential to become



                                                8
productive, independent investigators in scientific health-related fields relevant to the

missions of the participating NIH Institutes and Centers (IC).” In defining a postdoctoral

position for the purposes of this paper, we follow the guidance of the National Institutes of

Health and the National Science Foundation who in 2007 defined a postdoc as “…an individual

who has received a doctoral degree (or equivalent) and is engaged in a temporary and defined

period of mentored, advanced training to enhance the professional skills and research

independence needed to pursue his or her chosen career path” (NSF, 2007). One mechanism by

which NIH accomplishes this goal is through funding a postdoctoral fellowship position in a

mentor’s scientific laboratory. The NRSA F32 fellowships are allocated based in part on a

score assigned during peer review which considers the merit of an applicant’s research

proposal and the quality of proposed training and career development support available

through the institution and mentors. 8 In addition, before offering an F32 award program staff

of the NIH institute or center (IC) perform a thorough review to ensure the validity of

research idea, quality of the training environment and whether the research proposed matches

well with the institute or center’s needs and priorities.

        Figure 2 shows the number of NRSA F32 applications by year. The number of new

applications ranged from around 1,500 to 2,500 per year in the mid-2000s. During the NIH

Doubling (1998-2003), the number of new applications decreased from around 2,100 in 1998 to

a low of approximately 1,500 in 2002. This may reflect the increase in the NIH budget during the

doubling that likely increased postdoctoral slots on NIH-funded research grants. After the NIH




8
 During our study timeframe, the NIH assigned priority scores that ranged from 100 to 500. Starting in 2009, the
NIH assigned impact scores that ranged from 10 to 90. Throughout we refer to the scores assigned to proposals
during peer review as the review score.

doubling, the number of new applicants once again began to rise and peaked in 2006. In 2008,

one F32 award cost the NIH, on average, around $48,998. 9

         We posit that applicants who meet the basic requirements for the NRSA F32 award are

willing to apply if the benefit of winning is higher than the cost of applying. Applicants are

required to have a research doctorate or professional degree by the time of the award, be a citizen

or a permanent resident of the United States, and have a sponsor (who functions as a mentor),

and a sponsoring institution. All of these requirements limit the size of applicant group and make

it more homogeneous, limiting the impact of unobserved characteristics on the probability of

receiving an award.

         Selection to receive an NRSA F32 fellowship award depends on multiple measures: First,

each new application is evaluated for scientific merit by an NIH Scientific Review Group

(SRG), which, for the most part, is developed and run by the NIH Center for Scientific

Review (CSR). 10 CSR is an independent body that provides institutes services related to peer

review, as well as documenting the evaluation and scoring of applicants. NIH SRGs for

NRSA F32 fellowships, like SRGs for other funding mechanisms, include accomplished

scientists and experts as external reviewers. The SRG evaluation considers observable

characteristics of the applicants, 𝐴𝐴 (the applicant’s past academic and research records,

publications); observable characteristics of the sponsor 𝑆𝑆 (the sponsor’s general

qualifications); research potential, 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃, (references, the applicant’s research goals); research

environment 𝐸𝐸 (training environment); the research proposal, 𝑃𝑃, plus the perception of the

reviewer in that period 𝜀𝜀𝑞𝑞𝑞𝑞 . Each reviewer, r, assigned to an application, i, for institute or center,

10
   In a handful of instances, some NIH institutes and centers will conduct their own internal review on topic specific
areas of research. The decision to conduct reviews in house or through CSR is a function of resources, time, and
feasibility.

j, in a particular year, t, and council round, q, gives a preliminary reviewer overall review

score, 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , for each application defined as:

        𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑓𝑓�𝐴𝐴, 𝑆𝑆, 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃, 𝐸𝐸, 𝑃𝑃, 𝜀𝜀𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 �                    (1)

                         ∑𝑟𝑟𝑛𝑛=1 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
        𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 =       𝑟𝑟                                                   (2)
                         �          𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
                             𝑛𝑛=1


        Equation 2 gives a final overall review score, 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , for each discussed application, i,

who applied to an institute or center, j, in year, t, in council round, q, and is simply determined

by the mean score of all SRG members' preliminary scores. NIH review panels score proposals

from best to worst, where the lowest scores are considered the best. Until 2009, proposal review

scores ranged from 100 (high impact) and 500 (low impact). Starting in 2009, the process called

Enhancing Peer Review changed the scale of evaluation to 10-90 where the final overall impact

scores now range from 10 (high impact) through 90 (low impact) (NIH, 2011a).

        Prospective awardees are evaluated in council round, 𝑞𝑞, in a calendar year, 𝑡𝑡. At the end

of the scoring process, the SRG reports the review scores to the institute or center’s selection

process. At the end of the first selection, those applications with the lowest scores receive a

secondary level of review by NIH institute and center staff. This step is a key determinant of

the funding decision. NIH program staff examines the applications’ summary statements and

review scores, and weighs these factors against the needs and priorities of the institute or

center. The institute or center director or their delegate makes the final decision as to whether

to offer an award.

        Applicants who do not receive an award typically explore multiple options, which

include appointment to a position as postdoctoral researcher on a mentor’s research grant,

appointment to a T32 training grant if a slot is available, application to other funding sources



                                                                 11
such as foundation grants, or, if feasible, resubmission of their application. Other scenarios are to

leave academic research and explore other career paths. The true value of the NRSA F32 award

is its power of developing and conducting a research project and the freedom it gives the postdoc

to explore that line of research under the supervision of their mentor. Therefore, we do not argue

that one does not receive additional training if one does not receive the NRSA F32 award. We

are testing whether funding to develop and pursue a research project early in one’s career has an

effect on the probability of receiving future in NIH research funding.

        A sharp regression discontinuity design is appropriate if, NIH institutes and centers fund

the majority of proposals in the order of the score. Aberrations in funding of proposals with

review scores near the cutoff would constitute a fuzzy regression discontinuity design. However,

if institutes skip several (competitive) low-scoring proposals and reach for higher scoring

proposals that are more consistent with institute priorities or because of other administrative

hurdles on low-scoring applications, then an RDD has limitations. We turn now to the data

before evaluating the appropriate methods for determining the impact of the F32 award on

subsequent career outcomes.



DATA AND METHODS

           We use administrative records from the NIH’s Information for Management, Planning,

Analysis, and Coordination (IMPACII) system from 1996 to 2008. NIH matches IMPACII

records to data from the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Survey of Earned Doctorates

(SED), an annual census of doctoral recipients from U.S. institutions.11 The NSF SED contains

information on individual demographics, characteristics of graduate study, and future career

11
   Under existing Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) and interagency agreements, we use an ID variable that
tracks respondents over time to link individual-level NIH (IMPACII) administrative records with individual-level
data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) (NSF 2013).

                                                       12
plans. By linking these datasets, we are able to obtain missing data and add additional individual-

level covariates on our sample. We used demographic variables before or at the point of PhD

completion extracted from the SED including age at PhD completion, gender, race/ethnicity,

marital status at PhD completion, PhD field of study, and type of doctorate education funding.

We used the two data sources to construct one large panel dataset for analysis, limiting our

sample to those who applied for NRSA F32 funding between 1996 and 2008, and then observing

these individuals’ NIH application and funding patterns through 2015.

       We use detailed fellowship and subsequent NIH grant application and funding

information, including application review score, funded or non-funded status, timeframe and

institute/center (IC) receiving applications or funding the award, as well as previous grant

funding or training affiliations. This information comes from IMPACII for NRSA F32

postdoctoral fellowship applicants from 1996 to 2008. We further queried IMPACII for

subsequent applications for NIH funding and awards for these individuals. Similar to Jacob and

Lefgren (2011a), we define our outcome variables to identify research award application or

receipt four or more years out from the individual’s NRSA F32 application year.

       Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for all fellowship applications from 1996 to 2008 by

award status. Awardees and non-awardees differ across a number of observable characteristics.

Awardees are younger, more likely to be married and white. Awardees are significantly less

likely to be black or Hispanic. Individuals with MD degrees are less likely to receive fellowship

awards whereas PhDs are more likely. Individuals with biomedical or social science degrees are

more likely to receive fellowship awards compared with those whose PhD field is not reported.

Individuals who have had T32 predoctoral traineeships are more likely to receive awards. NRSA

F32 awardees are significantly more likely aspire to and to receive subsequent NIH funding as



                                                13
measured by the number of RPG applications and awards, the probability of an RPG award, and

the probability of an R01 award. As expected, awardees have significantly lower (better) scores

on their last observed F32 application. In the next section, we examine whether NIH institutes

and centers fund proposals in the order of the score, and whether a regression discontinuity

design (RDD) is warranted.

       Our analysis sample is a subset of the full sample. We drop all applications that are

higher than the 60th percentile in each council round because scores for these applications are not

consistently saved in the reporting database and practically none of them get funding. Some

institutes and centers have too few applicants for our preferred analysis method, so we drop

applicants from seven institutes and centers for this reason. Finally, the dataset we use is

incomplete for some council rounds prior to fiscal year 1996 and are dropped. Our final analysis

sample contains 14,276 individuals, and descriptive statistics are reported in Table 2. In our

analysis sample, awardees and non-awardees no longer differ in terms of age at application,

marital status, or likelihood of having a prior T32 traineeship.



An Analysis of NIH Institute and Center Award Behavior

       Each institute and center has discretion in deciding who is offered a fellowship based

on the current research priorities of the institute. Institutes and centers vary in their process

for awarding a fellowship. For this study, we interviewed staff at various institutes and centers

who provided a representative view of the variation in procedures across NIH. Through our

interviews, we learned that the process for awarding fellowships is complex.

       The review and scoring of fellowship proposals and NIH institute and center budgets

create scoring thresholds that theoretically would support the use of a regression discontinuity



                                                 14
design (RDD) like the one used in Jacobs and Lefgren (2011a). Decisions of who to fund are

made at the year, institute, 12 and council round. Jacobs and Lefgren only use year and institute

to estimate an RDD model, which we demonstrate below is not an optimal method for

evaluating training fellowships given the fellowship selection process at NIH.

            If awards are based solely on the review score allocated from best (lowest) score to

worst (highest) score until the institute budget allocations for the fellowship are exhausted, the

percent of applicants selected out of order would be zero or close to zero. If this were the

case, a sharp RDD would be valid because, in this scenario, the institute follows the guidance

of the review score for the best (lowest) scores. If, however, an institute has funded a majority

of applicants with meritorious scores and some discretion is used regarding awards to

applications with scores near the pay line, we would observe minimal disorder in funding. In

this example, the institute uses discretion to potentially skip some applicants close to the pay

line in order to fund applications with slightly worse scores but that best fit within their

scientific priorities and where the institute staff believes the applicant has the best-case

scenario for future success. If this were the case, a fuzzy RDD would be appropriate.

Additionally, institutes could just chose to use a significant amount of discretion when

selecting proposals for funding in order to meet institution goals related to scientific priorities

or, perhaps, diversity of the workforce. For institutes who engage in this behavior, no real

cutoff exists and an RDD is not appropriate.

            Our interviews with NIH staff indicated that the funding process is multifaceted. The

institute receives an application’s review score, which, in most cases, is defined by the study

section through the NIH’s Center for Scientific Review (CSR). Once the institute receives the

scores, the staff assesses the full application, including the summary statement from peer

12
     For the rest of this paper, “institute” will be used to refer to NIH Institutes and Centers.

                                                              15
review, the quality of the training institution, and the alignment of the research proposal with

the institute’s research priorities. Institute staff, specifically program officers at each institute

then generally participate in a team meeting in which they defend the proposals that best

match their defined priorities. Together, the program officers, the training director and other

institute staff make a joint decision for recommendations to the institute director. Either the

institute director or his/her delegate makes the final decision and signs off on which proposals

to fund. Institute directors vary in terms of direct involvement in the consideration and final

approval of proposals. Before a final decision is made and the candidates are informed, the

budget office reviews and signs off on the final list of candidates, primarily making sure

sufficient funds are available for the recommended awards.

       Decisions related to fellowship funding at NIH use discretion. Figure 3 illustrates why

RDD is not the appropriate design for evaluating fellowship awards. It demonstrates the range

of discretion used in fellowship decision making for the full sample over the period of our

study. In a given council round, anywhere from around 6.9 percent to 20.9 percent of

applicants received a decision that was not based on their ranked score. Either the institute’s

funded the applicant even though other applicants had better scores or the institute’s final

decision was not to fund the applicant even though they had better scores than others that

received funding.

       What does this mean for our study? Figure 3 illustrates the level of non-compliance for

an RDD method and the strong tendency for discretion in decision making within each

council round. While the level of discretion has decreased in recent years, over the entire

sample, around 12.3 percent (1 in 8) of all applications within a given council round received

a decision that was not in line with the peer review score. Given the large proportion of



                                                 16
discretion used within council rounds, we argue that RDD is an invalid method for evaluating

the true impact of early career training on later career outcomes as it relates to the NRSA F32

award.



Using Matching to Identify the Causal Effect of the NRSA F32 Award

         As described above, the NIH’s multi-step selection process for NRSA fellowships and

research grants generates a review score via a systematic peer review process. Given this, and

the fact that the groups of individuals applying to the awards are relatively homogenous given

the total population, we use matching techniques, specifically Propensity Score Match (PSM)

and Nearest Neighbor Match (NNM). While we understand that any unobserved

characteristics that are different between funded and unfunded confound our results, we argue

that matching is a feasible approach for the following reasons. First, we can control for

unobserved differences by institute and council round by controlling for these factors.

Additionally, selection is made at the institute level, and any unobserved differences among

applicants are also unobserved by the institute and, therefore, not a driving component of the

selection process. In short, there is no self-selection of fellowship award offerings. Finally,

the groups of individuals who apply for funding are relatively homogeneous within the

institute. They all clearly excel in academics, have been encouraged to apply by their mentors

(which means their mentors believe they have a chance of getting the award), and are

typically intensely interested in biomedical research. Given the unobservable variation that

could exist, we argue that within this select group of applicants, it is minimal.

         We use the potential outcomes framework employed in econometric analysis to estimate

the causal effect of fellowship awards on subsequent NIH funding outcomes (Rubin 2004). To



                                                17
fix ideas, let         be the treatment when an individual’s fellowship application is funded, and

let        if the application is not funded. In the potential outcomes framework each individual

has two potential outcomes of subsequent NIH funding:              if the individual receives the

award treatment and           if the individual is not treated. For each individual, the causal effect

of the award on subsequent NIH funding is defined as the difference in potential outcomes

                 . However, each individual is only observed when they receive the award or they do

not, and we must estimate the counterfactual outcome, in this case, using matching methods.


        In order to implement matching methods, we assume that treatment is independent of the

outcome conditional on covariates,                           . This is the unconfoundedness

assumption, which means that the treatment is conditionally independent of the outcome after

conditioning on observable characteristics. Given unconfoundedness, we can define the average

treatment effect in terms of potential outcomes as the expected value of potential outcomes:




We can define the average treatment effect on the subsample of the treated as:




        We use two matching methods to identify the ATE and ATT. First we employ propensity

score matching, defining the propensity score as the probability of receiving treatment

conditional on observed characteristics                              . In order to implement

propensity score methods, the propensity scores for the treated and untreated in our sample must

overlap such that                . Although the unconfoundedness assumption cannot be tested

directly, we can examine whether the propensity score has a causal effect on a pseudo outcome

                                                    18
that was determined prior to the treatment. If the estimated effect of the treatment on the pseudo

outcome is significant, then unconfoundedness has likely been violated (Imbens 2015). We can

evaluate the overlap assumption directly by assessing the balance of the covariates in the treated

and untreated groups as well as visually inspecting the overlap in the propensity scores.


       Propensity score matching has been widely used in economics and other social sciences

(Imbens 2015). However, King and Nielson (2016) and Imbens (2015) note that propensity

score estimates break down if the propensity score model fits to the data too well. As a result,

we cannot use the review score to estimate the propensity score related to fellowship funding.

Thus, we use the coarsened exact matching (CEM) algorithm (Blackwell et al 2009) to improve

the balance of the data, and nearest-neighbor methods to facilitate matching on the review score.

We use both propensity score matching and nearest neighbor matching after reducing the data

using the CEM algorithm.




RESULTS

       We begin the analysis by estimating the probability of receiving an NRSA F32 award in

the full and analysis samples using probit models; Table 3 reports marginal effects. In addition

to covariates listed in the table, all models include controls for institute and council round. In the

first column, using the full sample, several covariates predict the likelihood of receiving an

NRSA F32 award. Several age dummy variables are statistically significant as well as an

indicator for sex being missing in the data. Blacks and Asians are significantly less likely to

receive an award, but those indicating Other race are significantly more likely to receive the

award. Having an MD, PhD, or MD/PhD degree increases the probability of the award as does

having a field in biomedicine or social science. Those applicants who have been predoctoral

                                                 19
trainees are significantly more likely to receive an award, but those who have been postdoctoral

trainees are not. We include the score in the second column, and many observable

characteristics lose statistical significance. Proposals with lower review scores are significantly

more likely to receive funding. Older applicants (age greater than 37) are less likely to be

funded, as are applicants with sex missing, those who are black, and NRSA T32 postdoc

trainees. PhD and MD/PhD applicants are about 9 percentage points (ppt) more likely to receive

fellowship awards than individuals who hold other medical professional degrees such as DVMs

or DDSs.

       The analysis sample deletes observations that have review scores above the 60th

percentile or those that have applied to smaller institutes. As Table 2 indicated, the treatment

and control groups in the analysis sample are more closely related than in the full sample. After

controlling for review score, institute, and council round, only the sex missing variable has a

significant negative impact on the likelihood of receiving a fellowship award. We tested the

joint hypothesis that the institute and council round fixed effects were significantly different

from zero, and rejected that hypothesis (p<.000) in both cases. Thus, our argument that NRSA

F32 applicants are relatively homogeneous is supported by the analysis, conditional on the

review score, council round, and institute. The probit models in Table 3 are the basis of the

propensity score estimates used in our matching models below.



Propensity Score Matching

       Table 4 presents the propensity score matching (PSM) estimates of the ATE and ATT for

the analysis sample. As mentioned previously, if we include the review score in the propensity

score estimates, the propensity score becomes too precise, and the matching algorithm breaks



                                                 20
down (King and Nielson 2016, Imbens 2015). Thus, our propensity score estimates include

institute and council round fixed effects and the covariates listed in column 3 of Table 3. The

first row of Table 4 shows the ATE of the NRSA F32 award on the number of RPG awards,

number of RPG applications, the probability of an RPG, the probability of an R01 and the

probability of never applying for additional funding. The ATE estimates indicate that the

fellowship award increases the number of RPG awards by 0.15; increases the number of RPG

applications by 0.73; increases the probability of an RPG award by 8.2 ppt; increases the

probability of an R01 award by 6.0 ppt; and decreases the likelihood of never applying for

subsequent NIH funding by 11.2 ppt. The ATT estimates are remarkably similar in size and

magnitude.

       In order for the estimates to be considered valid, there should be considerable overlap in

the propensity score estimates of the awardees and non-awardees. Figure 4 Panel A shows this

PS overlap for the analysis sample. The mass of the kernel density estimate of the propensity

score for receiving an award lies to the left of that for not receiving an award. In order to

improve the overlap, Imbens (2015) recommends trimming the tails of the propensity score

distribution below .1 and above .9. The second row of Table 4 presents the ATE estimates after

this trimming. The estimated effects of the fellowship award on the ATE and ATT fall

somewhat after trimming but remain statistically significant. Figure 4 Panel B indicates that the

overlap in propensity scores appears quite similar. Finally, Smith and Todd (2005) recommend

trimming the propensity score in order to optimize the common support. We trimmed the

propensity scores below .33 and above .67. Figure 4 Panel C indicates that the overlap has

improved considerably after this trimming. Our estimated effect of the ATE and ATT remain

significant but are smaller. The ATE estimates after the .33 and .67 trimming indicate that the



                                                 21
fellowship award increases the number of RPG awards by .11, increases the number of RPG

applications by .67, increases the probability of an RPG award by 6.7 ppt, increases the

probability of an R01 award by 4.8 ppt, and decreases the likelihood of never applying for

subsequent NIH funding by 10.2 ppt. As before, the ATT estimates are remarkably similar in

size and magnitude.

       Although we cannot test the unconfoundedness assumption directly, Imbens (2015)

recommends using PSM on pseudo outcomes that occur prior to the award treatment. Given the

SED data, we evaluate whether the fellowship award predicts the probability that an applicant

has a PhD degree, the applicant’s field of highest degree is in biomedicine, and the applicant’s

doctoral funding was from a fellowship or scholarship. Table 5 presents these results and finds

no significant impact of the fellowship award on these pseudo outcomes.



Nearest-Neighbor Matching

       Given the sensitivity of the PSM to the propensity score specification and

recommendations to use alternative methods by King and Nielson (2016), we used nearest-

neighbor matching for the analysis sample. Throughout we use the Mahalanobis distance for

nearest-neighbor matching. Let      be the set of control variables for those receiving the

fellowship award and      be the set of control variable for non-awardees. The Mahalanobis

distance is given by:



and V is the covariance matrix of X. Mahalanobis distance will reduce differences between the

treated and control groups by an equal percentage for each covariate in the matrix X.




                                                22
        We experiment with a variety of specifications of the covariate list and matching

approach for the nearest neighbor matching. First we match on the review score only since it is a

significant determinant of fellowship funding and we could not include it in the PSM approach.

Second, we match on the review score, institute and council round. Third, we match on review

score and council round, and impose exact matching on institute. Fourth, we match on all of the

variables in the fourth column of Table 3 and impose exact matching on the institute. We drop

about 1,000 observations that do not have an exact match leaving us with 13,653 in the analysis

sample. We concentrate on the estimates of the ATE in the last column of Table 6 where the

number of covariates is the largest. The nearest neighbor matches increase the number of RPG

awards by .10, the number of RPG applications by .73, the probability of an RPG award by 6.3

ppt, the probability of an R01 award by 4.6 ppt, and reduces the probability of never applying for

subsequent NIH funding by 9.8 ppt. These estimates are somewhat smaller than the PSM

estimates but still statistically significant.

        Blackwell et al (2009) recommend coarsened exact matching (CEM) for sample selection

as a way to improve the balance of the matching estimator by exactly matching on categorical

values of the data. They show that the coarsened data have significantly improved balance and

balances nonlinearities and interactions in the sample. We begin by using the CEM algorithm to

perform exact matches by institute and fiscal year of funding. Next we use the nearest neighbor

matching and same covariates to estimate the ATE, and these estimates inherit the balance

properties from the CEM procedure. These estimates appear in the bottom of Table 6. Despite

the sample size reduction from 13,653 to 8,630, the nearest-neighbor matches after the CEM

algorithm are remarkably similar to the full analysis sample.




                                                 23
       We also use the CEM sample to estimate propensity score matches in Table 7. The first

row of Table 7 repeats the ATE estimates of the effect of fellowship awards on our outcomes.

The second row reports the ATE after employing the CEM algorithm to improve the balance.

The estimated effects of NRSA F32 awards are virtually identical despite the significant sample

size reduction. Figure 4 Panel D indicates significant improvements in the overlap of the

propensity score estimates.



DISCUSSION

       Overall, our findings provide evidence that both the NRSA F32 award and the process

used to make funding decisions matter for future engagement with NIH as an independent

researcher. The NRSA fellowships for postdoctoral scientists increase the probability that

awardees will receive NIH research funding later in their career. These results provide strong

evidence to the science policy community and leaders that using mechanisms like the NRSA F32

fellowship to prepare and sustain a biomedical research workforce does achieve the goal of

keeping scientists in NIH-funded research careers. These results are also consistent with the

recommendations of NIH’s Biomedical Workforce Working Group, which suggested that the

number of postdoctoral students receiving fellowships should increase (NIH 2012).

       A limitation of our study is that it does not allow us to examine the extent to which

funding from other agencies or research organizations affects those that do and do not receive

NRSA F32 funding. However, if individuals were able to receive support from other sources in

early career and then develop their NIH-funded research, we would expect this to bias our

estimates downwards. Thus, our results may be considered a lower-bound on the impact of

fellowships on subsequent NIH funding and an independent research career.



                                                24
        In Fiscal Year 2016, one NRSA F32 award cost the federal government, on average,

around $60,000 per individual. If a fellowship usually lasts, on average, two years, then the total

cost to NIH of funding training via the NRSA F32 mechanism is around $120,000 per individual.

Our study shows that making that kind of investment today in young scientists increases the

chance that they remain in a scientific research career.

        Congress used to require the National Research Council to conduct a periodic review of

the impact of the NRSA training program (National Academies 2011). Furthermore, several

researchers and policymakers have noted an increasing length of time spent in training as

graduate students or postdocs (Alberts et. al. 2015, Tilghman & Rockey 2012). These reports

have called for policies designed to promote researcher independence. One viable option would

be to expand the number of NRSA F32 fellowship awards available.



CONCLUSION

        During the time of our study, the total number of NRSA F32 awards granted decreased;

however, their impact as an early career training mechanism to keep individuals in NIH-funded,

future, independent science careers was robust. Of interest to note, the number of NRSA F32

applications during the NIH doubling years decreased. The decrease in applicants occurred when

funding for postdoctoral researchers on R01 and RPG research grants became more available.

Postdoctoral appointments on RPG and R01 grants do not require postdocs to develop a research

proposal distinct from their mentors’ research in order to be appointed, and this may influence

the direction of their careers.

        Our study is related to work where the NRSA F32 award was modeled as a regression

discontinuity and the peer review scoring mechanism was used as a cut off to determine the



                                                 25
causal effect of NIH funding at the margin (Jacob and Lefgren 2011a). We found that these

methods have significant limitations. NIH institutes and centers take their job seriously with staff

devoting time, energy, and effort to selecting candidates who have the right mix of institutional

support, innovative ideas, and alignment with institute scientific priorities. Candidates are not

solely selected based on the review score. Proposals with competitive scores are skipped over for

administrative reasons as well, either the package is not complete or additional review is required

because of human subjects research requirements or other complexities that may delay the

application. This means, however, that at least for the NRSA F32 fellowships, regression

discontinuity is not an optimal method for this analysis.

       Using matching methods, we find robust results that overall the NRSA F32 keeps

postdoctoral researchers in NIH-funded science at higher rates than they would otherwise

experience. Along the margin of being funded or not, the NRSA postdoctoral fellowship award

mechanism significantly improves the probability of receiving subsequent NIH funding and

launching an independent research career.

       Our findings provide that targeted and focused NIH training programs associated with

independent research ideas can have a significant impact on keeping individuals in academic

science and engaged in NIH-funded research. The F32 programs can be seen as a viable

mechanism for this purpose. Future research should address the issues of cost-benefit and

whether the amount of investment in these trainings programs matches the return.
