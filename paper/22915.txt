Evidence on the Relationship between Recruiting and Starting Wage

JEL No. D21,J30,J60

                                          ABSTRACT

Using data from the Employment Opportunity Pilot Project, we examine the relationship between
the starting wage paid to the worker filling a vacancy, the number of applications attracted by the
vacancy, the number of candidates interviewed for the vacancy, and the duration of the vacancy.
We find that the wage is positively related to the duration of a vacancy and negatively related to
the number of applications and interviews per week. We show that these surprising findings are
consistent with a view of the labor market in which firms post wages and workers direct their
search based on these wages if workers and jobs are heterogeneous and the interaction between
worker’s type and job’s type in production satisfies some rather natural assumptions.

1. Introduction

    Models of directed search have become a very popular tool to study labor markets. The central

assumption of directed search models is that firms post wages (or, more generally, employment contracts)

and workers direct their search to different firms based on these wages. This assumption implies that

firms face a trade-off between paying a lower wage and filling their vacancies faster. If a firm chooses to

post a lower wage for its vacancies, it will receive fewer applications and take longer to fill these vacancies.

If a firm chooses to post a higher wage, it will receive more applications and take less time to fill its

vacancies. Similarly, workers face a trade-off between the wage and the probability of being hired. If a

worker chooses to seek jobs with higher wages, he will be competing with more applicants and have a

lower probability of being hired. If a worker chooses to seek jobs with lower wages, he will have a higher

chance of being hired. Directed search models are appealing because they translate the basic insights of

Walrasian equilibrium in environments with search frictions. Directed search models are also appealing

because, unlike random search models, they remain very tractable even in the dynamic versions with

heterogeneous agents. For these reasons, the labor economics literature that makes use of directed

search models has exploded.1

    Despite the popularity of directed search models, there is hardly any evidence corroborating its basic

implication that firms that choose to post higher wages will attract more applicants and will fill their

vacancies faster. Part of the problem is a lack of data that contain information on the number of

applications received by different vacancies, the duration of different vacancies, and the wage paid by

different vacancies. One exception is the Employment Opportunity Pilot Project (EOPP), a survey

conducted in 1980 and 1982 that contains detailed information on the recruiting process for a broad,

representative set of vacancies. We use this dataset to estimate the relationship between the starting

wage paid to the worker filling a vacancy, the number of applications attracted by the vacancy, the

number of candidates interviewed for the vacancy and the duration of the vacancy.

    We find that 20 percent of the hires in our data occur without any recruiting. Among the hires for

which recruiting took place, we find that the starting wage paid to the worker filling the vacancy is

positively related to the duration of the vacancy, negatively related to the number of applicants to the

vacancy and negatively related to the number of candidates interviewed for the vacancy. These findings

are very robust. One can see them directly in the raw data. These findings emerge when we control for

the labor market, as defined by time, location, occupation, and industry. They emerge when we

additionally control for observable characteristics of the firm and of the job that might affect the non-

wage value of the job to the worker. They also emerge when we control for observable characteristics of

the hire that might be related with the requirements of the job.

    We find a great deal of duration dependence in recruitment outcomes. Indeed, we see that vacancies

that are filled within 1 week receive a higher number of applications per week than vacancies that are

filled in 2 weeks, which, in turn, receive a higher number of applications per week than vacancies that are

filled after a month. In light of this observation, we re-estimate the relationship between wages and

applications per week under the assumption of true duration dependence (i.e., the assumption that

applications per week depend directly on the duration of the vacancy). Under this assumption, we find

that the relationship between wages and number of applications per week is weakened, but still negative.

    These empirical findings are puzzling from the perspective of a directed search view of the labor

market. Why would firms post higher wages if that means attracting fewer applicants and having a lower

probability of filling its vacancies? And why would more workers apply to jobs that pay lower wages? We

show that, while these empirical findings cannot be rationalized in a simple model of directed search with

homogeneous workers, they are perfectly consistent with a model of directed search if workers and jobs


                                                    2
are heterogeneous (beyond those basic observable characteristics for which we control in our regressions)

and if the interaction between the worker’s type and the job’s type in the production process satisfies

some rather natural conditions.

    We use the general model of directed search with two-sided heterogeneity of Shimer (2005). We

show that if the productivity of some jobs (which we call “sensitive”) is more responsive to the quality of

the worker manning them than the productivity of some other jobs (which we call “regular”), and the

productivity of sensitive jobs when manned by low-quality workers is lower than the productivity of

regular jobs, then the equilibrium is such that firms with sensitive jobs pay higher wages, attract fewer

applicants and take longer to fill their vacancies. Firms with sensitive jobs pay higher wages not to attract

more applicants but to attract a better pool of applicants. In particular, firms with sensitive jobs post

higher wages for both high-quality and low-quality workers. In response to this higher wage, high-quality

workers apply more frequently to sensitive jobs than to regular jobs. However, low-quality workers do

not apply more frequently to sensitive jobs because, even though they would be paid a higher wage, they

are very unlikely to be hired as they have to compete with a larger number of more attractive applicants.

When low-quality workers are less productive in sensitive jobs than in regular jobs, the total number of

applicants attracted by high-wage firms is lower.

    The paper’s main contribution is to use the EOPP to document the relationship between wages and

recruitment outcomes and to make sense of this relationship in the context of the directed search view

of the labor market. Our paper complements very nicely recent work by Marinescu and Wolthoff (2015).

Marinescu and Wolthoff (2015) use data from CareerBuilder.com for three large metropolitan areas of

the U.S. that contains information on the job title, wage and applications for each vacancy. They find that,

controlling for occupation but not for job titles, there is a negative relationship between wages and

number of applications. This finding is consistent with ours, even though our data comes from the early

1980s. Our results corroborate their finding by showing that there is also a negative relationship between


                                                     3
wages and interviews and a positive relationship between wages and duration of a vacancy. After also

controlling for job titles, however, Marinescu and Wolthoff (2015) find that a higher wage attracts more

applications. This finding is perfectly in line with our model. In fact, if in our model, one could control for

different types of jobs by looking at the associated title (i.e., sensitive or regular), one would recover the

standard directed-search relationship between wages and number of applicants. Moreover, our model

provides an explanation for why, when one cannot control for the job title, the relationship between wage

and applications is negative: it is because high-wage jobs are sensitive jobs where high-quality applicants

are especially productive relative to low-quality applicants, and where low-quality applicants have an

especially low productivity.

    Ketterman, Mueller, and Zweimueller (2016) use matched employer-employee data from Austria,

which include information on vacancies. They find that, in the raw data, there is a positive relationship

between the wage paid to the worker filling the vacancy and the duration of the vacancy. However, they

show that there is a negative relationship between the average wage paid by a firm and its average

vacancy duration. These findings are also consistent with our model. Indeed, if we were to add a firm-

specific component of productivity to our model, we would find that more productive firms post higher

wages for both sensitive and regular jobs and, on average, attract more applicants and fill their vacancies

faster. Banfi and Villena-Roldán (2015) use data from the online job search website Trabajando.com to

study the relationship between wages and applications in Chile. They find a negative relationship between

the average wage of the firm and the average number of applications per month. Again, this finding is

consistent with a version of our model where firms differ with respect to their productivity in both

sensitive and regular jobs.

    Several recent studies are focused, broadly speaking, on the determinants of the job search process.

Hall and Kruger (2012) use a survey of workers to see whether they bargained over the wage or faced a

take-it-or-leave-it offer. Brenčič (2012) studies the firm’s decision of whether to advertise a wage, a wage


                                                      4
range or to not advertise a wage at all in its vacancies using data from Monster.com in the US, from local

career centers in the U.K., and from a public employment agency in Slovenia. Belot, Kircher, and Muller

(2015) run an experiment with job seekers in the U.K. to understand the effect of nudging them to search

a broader spectrum of jobs.



2. Data

        We use both waves of the Earnings and Opportunities Pilot Project (EOPP) survey, which were

conducted in 1980 and 1982. The survey includes a relatively small sample of firms, and is over three

decades old, but still provides one of the best sources of detailed information on hiring outcomes at the

firm level. It includes information on the initial wage paid and a wide range of information on the hire and

related recruiting activity. It has been used numerous times before to examine firm recruiting and hiring

behavior.2 The survey was designed to evaluate several policies targeted towards hiring and training in

the early 1980s. As such, it asks employers to report detailed information on their most recent hire. In

addition to the wage paid, employers report detailed demographic information, information on the firm’s

recruiting efforts that led to the hire, the training given after the hire started, and information on the

recruiting process (i.e., the duration of the search, the number of applicants, and the number of job

interviews).


        The survey initially interviewed 5,918 firms in 1980, 3,419 of which responded to the 1982 follow-

up survey. We focus on firms that report having a hire during the survey’s reference period (generally

several months prior to the interview). We focus our analysis on the 1982 survey because it has

information on the number of applicants to a job opening, which is not present in the 1980 data, and a

more relevant definition of the starting wage, but we also appeal to the 1980 data to use the panel

Barron, Berger, and Black (1997), Burdett and Cunningham (1998), and Wolthoff (2014).

dimension of the EOPP for those firms that appear in both surveys.3 The 1980 survey also asks about the

most recent hire separately by whether or not the hire occurred through a federal hiring subsidy program,

so firms may have up to three hires reported across the two surveys.


        Our main variables of interest are the starting wage paid to the hire, the length of time it took to

fill the vacancy (i.e., the vacancy duration), the number of applicants to the vacancy, and the number of

interviewed applicants (used as a proxy for applications when comparing across the two surveys). The

data also include information on the job (e.g., the occupation, whether the job is a subsidized hire,

whether it is a temporary or seasonal job, and the usual hours worked), information on the firm (e.g.,

location, industry, total employment, employment growth, the percent unionized, and various measures

of worker turnover) and basic characteristics of the hire (e.g., age, gender, race, education, veteran status,

the amount of experience relevant to the position, and whether the hire had any prior vocational training).

The data also include additional information on the hire, the most notable of which are the amount of

time employers spent recruiting, the amount of time employers spent training the new hire, whether or

not the hire was a referral, and whether the hire is still with the firm. Furthermore, when reporting a

vacancy’s duration, the surveys in both years allow respondents to explicitly report whether there was

“no recruiting” done, implying that the vacancy was filled immediately, or whether they are “always

recruiting,” allowing us to identify and directly quantify the amount of hiring done without any formal

recruiting. In our analysis, we use the real starting wage, deflated by the Consumer Price Index at the time

of the reported start date of each hire.4 We measure the number of applicants, number of job interviews,

and the hours employees spent on recruiting on a per-vacancy basis.



3
  Specifically, the 1982 survey asks employers the starting wage of the most recent hire, while the 1980 survey
instead asks what the current starting wage would be for someone in the same position as the most recent hire. We
simply note this difference as an important caveat when interpreting our pooled results.
4
  For the 1980 data, which uses the current starting wage for the position of the most recent hire, we use the date
of the survey interview. The timing of the CPI value used is important, given the high rates of inflation during the
survey period.

                                                         6
         Not all firms surveyed had a hire during the survey’s reference period, reducing our 1982 sample

by 35 percent. Furthermore, a sizable fraction of firms has missing data for one or more key variables in

our analysis, reducing the sample by another 37 percent. The remaining 1982 sample contains data on

1,512 hires, 1,238 of which had a positive, finite vacancy duration (i.e., did not report “no recruiting” or

“always recruiting”). Applying similar criteria to our matched 1980-82 panel, we obtain an unbalanced

panel of 1,922 pooled hires (with a positive, finite vacancy duration) across 1,087 firms. In our analysis,

our main results come from the samples restricted to a hires with a positive, finite vacancy duration, but

we also examine the wage and recruiting behavior for the broader sample of hires in the next section. The

1982 sample suffers from attrition, but does not contain updated weights to deal with it. We deal with

this by generating non-response adjustment factors based on the survey’s sample stratification (the EOPP

is stratified by survey wave and metropolitan area) and adjusting the 1980 sample weights accordingly.5



3. Summary Evidence on Starting Wages, Duration, and Recruiting

         We begin with basic evidence on the starting wage, vacancy duration, and recruiting behavior by

characteristics of the hire and the job. We report sample means for these measures in Table 1. The top

row lists the summary statistics for the full sample of 1982 observations. The real starting wage averaged

$4.53, and it took about 16 days to fill a vacancy (20 days when excluding vacancies where there was no

recruiting done). The average vacancy received 10.4 applications, had 6.2 job interviews conducted for it,

and had 8.2 person-hours of recruiting effort exerted for it each week it was open.


         The next several rows of Table 1 report these estimates broken out by various demographic

characteristics of the hire, restricting the 1982 sample to vacancies with a positive vacancy duration. Jobs

 We also experimented with a variety of weighting alternatives, including weighting by total reported hires and total
reported vacancies, and examined unweighted results as well. We determined, however, that weighting each
vacancy using the sample weights (adjusted for nonresponse) provided the most representative sample when
compared to published aggregate statistics by broad industry.

that were filled by women tended to pay less, took less time to fill, and had fewer applicants. Starting

wages and vacancy durations generally rose with the age of the hire, but there were few differences in

other recruiting outcomes by age group. More-educated hires tended to have higher starting wages and

positions that took longer to fill, received fewer applications, had fewer interviews, and had less recruiting

effort devoted to them per week of the job opening. Hires with more relevant experience exhibited similar

patterns, though recruiting effort showed no systematic variation by experience group.


        The last rows of Table 1 report these estimates broken out by the characteristics of the firm and

job, again restricting the 1982 sample to vacancies with a positive vacancy duration. Larger firms tended

to have higher starting wages and had more effort exerted on recruiting, but otherwise recruiting

outcomes were similar across firm size categories. There was substantial variation in recruiting outcomes

by both industry and occupation, but no clear pattern emerges when one compares them by their average

starting wage. Notably, management positions offer the highest wages and have relatively long vacancy

durations and few applications or interviews. Part-time and temporary jobs have relatively lower starting

wages, but also more applications and shorter vacancy durations.


        Figure 1 shows the distribution of jobs by their vacancy duration. Surprisingly, employers report

that 19.4 percent of all vacancies involved no recruiting at all. That is, they report the vacancy was

essentially filled immediately or perhaps had no vacancy associated with it (e.g., an opportunistic hire).

This finding is consistent with Davis, Faberman, and Haltiwanger (2013), who find that 42 percent of hires

occur at establishments that start a month without a vacancy, of which all but 14 percent can be

accounted for by time aggregation and observed heterogeneity. Only 0.4 percent of vacancies were for

positions where employers reported that they were always recruiting. About three-quarters of vacancies

were filled within their first two weeks, though a nontrivial amount (9.2 percent) took over a month to

fill.

Figure 1. Cross-Sectional Distribution of Vacancy Durations




Note: Figure reports the sample-weighted distribution of vacancy durations across all hires in the 1982 wave of the
EOPP survey. “None” refers to hires were the firm reported “no recruiting” as their vacancy duration (i.e., a zero-
duration vacancy). “Always” refers to hires where the firm reported that they are “always recruiting” for the
reported position.




    Table 2 reports starting wages and recruiting outcomes by vacancy duration. The top panel presents

our most basic evidence on the relationship between the starting wage, recruiting outcomes, and vacancy

duration. It shows that the starting wage tends to rise with duration, while applications, interviews, and

recruiting effort per week all fall with duration—i.e., there is considerable duration dependence in the

data. The bottom panel of Table 2 reports the mean estimates of the starting wage and recruiting

outcomes after conditioning out observable firm and job characteristics from each measure.6 Controlling

for these characteristics has a notable effect on the amount of wage variation as a function of duration,




6
 Specifically, we regress each variable in each column of Table 2 on a set of dummies for the starting month of the
hire, 2-digit industry, 2-digit occupation, metropolitan area, (log) firm size, the firm’s previous 6-month growth rate,
the firm’s worker turnover rate, the firm’s percentage unionized, the job’s reported 5-scale index of associated
machine costs (a proxy for productivity), and indicators for whether the job was part-time, temporary or seasonal,
subsidized, or paid the minimum wage.

but does not reduce the degree of duration dependence in the measures of weekly recruiting activity

(applications, job interviews, and recruiting).7 Table 2 also shows that vacancies that were reported as

having no recruiting tended to have above-average wages and, as would be expected, minimal

applications, interviews, or recruiting effort.

      Table 3 explores in detail the relationship between the duration of the vacancy and characteristics of

the hiring process (i.e., referral, walk in, etc.), characteristics of the firm and job (i.e., firm size, unionization

rate, etc.), and characteristics of the person hired (i.e., gender, age, education, etc.) From this table, the

most interesting take-away is the difference between vacancies filled without recruiting activity and other

vacancies. Vacancies that had no recruiting were more likely to come from a referral or a “walk-in” (i.e.,




7
  We also replicated the exercise adding in controls for the characteristics of the hire (e.g., demographics and
relevant experience) and of the match (e.g., job tenure, training), and the results are essentially unchanged from
those in the bottom panel of Table 2.

                                                         11
unsolicited) job applicant.8 These jobs tended to involve more training, but they also were more likely to

have their hire separate by the time of the survey interview. Hires with no recruiting were significantly

more likely to occur at smaller firms, but other firm characteristics are generally unrelated to the incidence

of no recruiting. Vacancies with no recruiting are more prevalent in retail, in part-time jobs, in temporary

or seasonal jobs, and in goods-producing or maintenance jobs. Those hired without any recruiting tended

to be older and more educated than most hires, with those with the longest vacancy durations being the

exception. The results paint a dichotomous picture of the types of jobs that occur with no recruiting. Many

of these jobs appear to be transitory in nature, suggesting that firms may not want to invest too much

recruiting effort into a match that may not last too long. Other aspects of these jobs, however, suggest a

role for informal networking for specialized or skill-intensive positions, which are traditionally hard-to-fill.



4. Starting Wages and Recruiting Outcomes

         We now turn to our main analysis. First, we examine how the starting wage paid to those hired is

related to the duration of the vacancy, the number of applications attracted by the vacancy each week,

and the number of candidates interviewed each week. We report our findings controlling for the labor

market, as defined by time, location, occupation, and industry. We also report our findings for when we

introduce additional controls for observable characteristics of the job, the firm and the hire. Second, using

the panel structure of the dataset, we control for the unobserved, fixed characteristics of the firm that

might affect the non-pecuniary value of the job to a worker. Finally, we re-estimate the relationship

between wages and recruitment outcomes under the assumption that applications and interviews per

week depend directly on the duration of the vacancy. Our main finding is very robust: vacancies that pay

 The importance of hiring through referrals has been documented by Ioannides and Loury (2004) and Topa (2011)
and, more recently, by Burks et al. (2015), Pallais and Sands (2016). Galenianos (2014) develops an interesting model
of hiring through referrals, in which jobs may be filled without a formal vacancy.

                                                         12
higher wages tend to attract fewer applicants per week, fewer interviewees per week and take more time

to fill.

4.A. Vacancy Duration, Applications, Interviews, and the Starting Wage

        We begin by estimating the relationship between the starting wage and recruiting outcomes

conditional on our definition of a labor market and on firm, job, worker, and recruitment characteristics.

Our baseline specification is


 (1a)                              ln 𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑘 = 𝛼𝑚 + 𝛽 ln 𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑘 + 𝐽𝑗 𝛾 + 𝑍𝑘 𝛿 + 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑘 ,

where 𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑘 represents one of our three recruiting outcome variables (vacancy duration, applications

received per week of vacancy duration, or job interviews given per week of vacancy duration) for hire 𝑖 to

job 𝑗 at firm 𝑘. The starting month and year of the hire are controlled for with a vector of dummy variables,

𝛼𝑚 . Our main variable of interest is the (log) real starting wage, ln 𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑘 . The vector of observed job

characteristics, 𝐽𝑗 , includes a set of dummy variables for two-digit occupation code, and separate

indicators for whether the job was temporary or seasonal, involved a subsidized hire, was a minimum-

wage job, or was a part-time position. The vector of firm characteristics, 𝑍𝑘 , includes a set of dummy

variables for metropolitan area and a set of dummy variables for two-digit industry code. We consider this

specification as our “baseline” since it includes the controls that seem most likely to define a particular

labor market (e.g., a full-time accountant within the finance industry in New York).


        Our extended specification is


 (1b)                     ln 𝑌𝑖𝑗𝑘 = 𝛼𝑚 + 𝛽 ln 𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑘 + 𝜂 ln 𝑒𝑖𝑗𝑘 + 𝐽̃𝑗 𝛾 + 𝑍̃𝑘 𝛿 + 𝑋𝑖 𝜃 + 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑘 ,

where ln 𝑒𝑖𝑗𝑘 . is recruiting effort measured as the (log) number of employee hours per week dedicated to

recruiting, 𝐽̃𝑗 includes additional characteristics of the job, 𝑍̃𝑘 includes additional characteristics of the

firm, and 𝑋𝑖 is a set of characteristics of the worker hired. In this specification, the additional job and firm

controls include firm size (the log of employment), the percent of the workforce unionized, the firm’s

employment growth rate over the previous six months, and a measure of worker turnover (total quits and

fires in the preceding quarter, as a percent of employment). The worker controls, included in the vector

                                                       14
𝑋𝑖 , include sex, age, age squared, education categories, (log) relevant work experience , veteran status,

and an indicator for any vocational training. We include recruitment effort because we are curious about

the relationship between effort and recruitment outcomes (although we understand that we need to be

cautious in interpreting the coefficient 𝜂 because of potential endogeneity). We include additional job

and firm characteristics to try and capture aspects of the value of the job to a worker that are not captured

by the wage (e.g., expected duration of the job, union protection, etc.) or aspects of the firm that affect

its prominence in the market and hence its ability to attract applicants (e.g., firm size, firm growth). We

include controls for worker’s characteristics as an attempt to capture additional requirements of the job

that might affect the size of the pool of applicants that are qualified for the job (e.g., experience,

education, etc.), or that might be reflected into the wage after the applicant has been selected (e.g., age,

gender, etc.)


        The main coefficient of interest is 𝛽, which is the “elasticity” of the recruiting outcome with

respect to the starting wage.9 The regressions are run on the sample of 1982 observations with a positive,

finite vacancy duration and regression estimates are sample-weighted. Table 4 presents the regression

results for the regressions of the (log) vacancy duration, (log) applications per week, and (log) interviews

per week in three panels, respectively. We first show results for specifications that only control for the

month of the hire (column 1). We then show results for the “baseline” regression model (column 2), for

the regression model with additional controls for job and firm characteristics (column 3), for worker

characteristics (column 4), and for recruitment effort (column 5). Finally, we show results for the full

regression model (column 6).




9
 Even though we are going to use the word elasticity, we do not mean to imply any direct causal relationship
between the wage and recruitment outcomes. We simply use the word elasticity to refer to the empirical
relationship between the log of the wage and the log of one of our recruitment outcomes.

                                                                               16
         In the regression model with only time controls, the estimated elasticity with respect to the wage

of vacancy duration is large and positive, while the elasticity with respect to the wage of applications and

interviews per week is large and negative. In the baseline regression model, which controls for the labor

market characteristics (time, location, industry and occupation), the estimated elasticities of recruitment

outcomes with respect to the wage are smaller in magnitude but maintain the same sign. In particular,

the elasticity of vacancy duration with respect to the wage is 0.39, the elasticity of the number of

applications per week with respect to the wage is -0.40, and the elasticity of the number of interviews per

week with respect to the wage is -0.39. All of these elasticities are statistically significant. We do not

interpret these findings in a casual sense—i.e., if a firm were to increase its wage, it would attract fewer

applicants. Rather, we interpret them as simply saying that the firms in our dataset that do pay higher

wages attract fewer applicants per week, interview fewer candidates per week, and take longer to fill their

vacancies.


         In the regression models with additional controls, the elasticities of recruitment outcomes with

respect to the wage have different point estimates. However, in all specifications, the elasticities maintain

the same sign, are similar in magnitude, and maintain statistical significance.10


         We also find that the amount of recruiting effort per week is also strongly and significantly related

to the three recruiting outcomes. It is strongly negatively related to vacancy duration and strongly

positively related to applications and interviews per week.11 In other words, higher recruiting effort is



10
   We also estimated specifications that regress log applications and log interviews on the right-hand side of (1a) and
(1b), including log vacancy duration on the right-hand side. To deal with potential division bias, we also included
(log) recruiting effort, in levels, in the specifications that include effort. All specifications produce estimates that are
somewhat smaller in magnitude but otherwise qualitatively similar to those in Table 4.
11
   One may worry that division bias at least partly drives our results for effort, since it is effort divided by vacancy
duration (in weeks), which is the dependent variable in the first regression and which also appears in the
denominator of the dependent variables of the other two regressions. To test for this, we re-ran our regressions
instead using total applications, total interviews and total effort, adding in (log) vacancy duration as an additional
control when applications or interviews were the dependent variable. The magnitudes of the coefficients on effort
all decline, but remain strongly statistically significant throughout, and their signs remain the same.

                                                            17
correlated with more applicants and interviews and leads to shorter vacancy durations (i.e., higher job-

filling rates). The fact that recruiting effort would significantly affect recruiting outcomes is not surprising.

Most, however, would expect recruiting effort to have the largest impact on the screening and selection

process (see, e.g., Wolthoff 2014). In contrast, we find that higher recruiting effort is related to a vacancy

having more applicants, which in turn is related to a higher job-filling rate. One interpretation of these

findings is that recruiting effort may not only aid in improving match quality but may also improve the

probability of a hire as well. Another interpretation is that recruiting effort increases mechanically with

applications because, for every application received, some effort has to be devoted to vet it.


4.B. Panel Data Estimates, Accounting for Firm Heterogeneity

         Next, we attempt to control for the role of fixed, unobserved firm heterogeneity using an

unbalanced panel of firms from the 1980 and 1982 surveys. This is an important robustness check as one

might worry that the relationship between wages and recruiting outcomes is spuriously driven by

heterogeneity in unobserved features of the firm that affect the worker’s valuation of the job or by

heterogeneity in unobserved features of the firm that affect its visibility in the labor market. For example,

one might worry about the possibility that firms with a pleasant work environment can attract more

applicants even though they offer lower wages. Similarly, one might worry about the possibility that some

firms are better known than others and, hence, can attract more applicants even though they offer lower

wages.


         As we noted in Section 2, firms originally surveyed in 1980 are re-interviewed in 1982. The 1980

survey also asked firms about their most recent subsidized and non-subsidized hire, implying that a firm

can have up to three hires reported in the pooled sample. Note that while the panel data approach allows

us to control for any fixed unobservable characteristics of the firm, it does not allow us to control for any

fixed unobservable characteristics of the job or the hire. It also has the additional drawback that we are


                                                       18
limited to the variables that are available in the 1980 survey. Therefore, we only report results using (log)

vacancy duration and (log) job interviews per week as dependent variables. We focus on firms that report

a hire in both 1980 and 1982. The panel remains unbalanced because, in addition to the potential for two

hiring observations in 1980, some of these hires were done without recruiting, and are therefore excluded

from the sample.


        Our approach re-estimates (1a) and (1b) using the firm panel. We include only variables available

in both surveys. Additionally, when we include firm fixed effects, we must also drop the variables that are

firm-invariant.12 Table 5 shows that including firm fixed effects actually increases the magnitude of the

elasticities with respect to wages. The estimate of the elasticity of vacancy duration rises from 0.48 to

0.88, while the elasticity of interviews per week increases in magnitude from -0.35 to -0.65. Further, notice

that the elasticity estimates in the specifications that exclude firm fixed effects are very similar to the

analogous estimates in Table 4 (0.48 vs. 0.39, and -0.35 vs. -0.39, for vacancy duration and interviews,

respectively). When we add both firm fixed effects and additional controls for firm, job, and worker

characteristics, the estimated elasticities become smaller in absolute value. These estimates are also

comparable to their counterparts in Table 4.


4.C. True Duration Dependence

        Table 2 shows that vacancies that are filled in a week or less receive more applicants per week

than vacancies that are filled after 2 weeks, which in turn receive more applicants per week than vacancies

that are filled after a month. One interpretation of the observed duration dependence is that it is

“spurious”—that is, duration dependence is due to the fact that the wage is negatively related to



12
  Variables that are unavailable in the 1980 data are: (log) applications per week, the part-time and temporary or
seasonal status of the job, the union share of the firm’s employees, and the veteran status and vocational training
of the hire. Two-digit industry and metro area controls are excluded when firm fixed effects are included. Finally,
when observable firm controls are included, we interact the turnover rate and the productivity category variables
with survey year because the two are measured differently across the surveys.

                                                        19
applications per week and positively related to the duration of the vacancy. This is the interpretation that

lies behind the regression model (1a) and (1b). Another interpretation of duration dependence is that it

is “true”—that is, all else equal, firms receive fewer vacancies the longer a vacancy stays open.13 Under

this view, our estimated elasticity of the number of applications per week with respect to the wage

conflates two channels. The first channel is the direct relationship between the wage and the number of

applications received by a vacancy each week. The second channel is the indirect relationship between

the wage and the number of applications that operates through the relationship between the wage and

the duration of the vacancy. Here we attempt to isolate the direct channel.


         We account for true duration dependence by imputing first-week values for applications,

interviews, and recruiting effort under the assumption that these measures decline exponentially over

the duration of the vacancy. We then use the imputed first-week values rather than the average-per-week

values when re-estimating our model in (1a) and (1b) for applications and job interviews. Specifically, we

assume that applications, job interviews and recruiting effort follow the following process:


                                                𝑥𝑗 (𝑡) = 𝜇𝛼𝑑(𝑡)𝛼+1 𝑒 𝜀𝑗(𝑡) ,

where 𝑥𝑗 (𝑡) represents the amount of applications, job interviews, or recruiting effort measured 𝑡 days

after vacancy 𝑗 was posted, 𝛼 is the parameter that determines the steepness of the exponential decline,

𝜇 is a scaling parameter, and 𝜀𝑗 (𝑡) is an error term.14 The process can be estimated in log form using OLS

on the following equation:


 (2)                                       ln 𝑥𝑗 (𝑡) = 𝑏0 + 𝑏1 ln 𝑑(𝑡) + 𝜀𝑗 (𝑡).




13
  This is the view taken by, for example, van Ours and Ridder (1992) and Andrews et al. (2008).
14
  The specification is equivalent to the probability density function of a Pareto distribution with lower support equal
to one, shape parameter 𝛼, and a scaling parameter 𝜇.

Using this equation, we can account for duration dependence in the data by conditioning out 𝑏̂1 ln 𝑑(𝑡),

making our imputed first-week value of ln 𝑥𝑗 (𝑡) equal to 𝑏̂0 + 𝜀̂𝑗 (𝑡). We generate these estimates for the

1982 sample and re-estimate (1a) and (1b). Our results are in Table 6.


         As expected, we find that—under the assumption of true duration dependence—the elasticities

of the number of applications and the number of interviews per week with respect to the wage fall in

magnitude. Indeed, in the most basic specification of the regression model, the elasticities of applications

and interviews with respect to the wage fall to zero. In richer specifications of the regression model which

include additional controls on firm, job, and worker characteristics, however, the elasticities fall in

magnitude but remain negative and statistically significant.



5. Theory

    The key empirical fact from the previous section is that jobs paying higher wages tend to receive fewer

applications and tend to be filled more slowly than jobs paying lower wages. At first blush, this fact seems

hard to reconcile with the popular view of a labor market in which firms post wages and workers direct

their search based on that information. Indeed, why would a firm offer a higher wage if that means waiting

longer to fill its vacancy? Similarly, why would a worker apply to a low-wage firm if that means competing

with more applicants and, if hired, being paid a lower wage? In this section, we show that—if workers and

jobs are heterogeneous (to a greater extent than what we can control for in the data) and the interaction

of the worker’s type and the job’s type in production satisfies some reasonable assumptions—the

equilibrium of a labor market in which firms post wages and workers direct their search is such that the

wage paid by jobs is negatively correlated with the number of applications it attracts and the velocity at

which it is filled.




                                                    22
5.A Model

     We use the model of Shimer (2005), which is a general model of directed search with two-sided

heterogeneity. The labor market is populated by heterogeneous workers and heterogeneous firms.15 In

particular, there is a measure 𝜇𝑗 of workers of type 𝑗 = {𝑙, ℎ}. Each one of these workers is unemployed

and applies to only one job. A worker’s payoff is equal to his labor income. There is also a measure 𝜈𝑖 of

firms of type 𝑖 = {𝑙, ℎ}. Each one of these firms has one job. A firm’s payoff is equal to its output net of

the labor income it pays to its worker. To simplify the algebra, we assume that the measure of firms of

type 𝑖 is equal to 1, i.e., 𝜈𝑙 = 𝜈ℎ = 1.

     A firm of type 𝑖 and a worker of type 𝑗 produce 𝑦𝑖𝑗 > 0 units of output. A worker without a job

produces zero units of output. Similarly, a firm without a worker produces zero units of output. We

assume that 𝑦𝑖ℎ > 𝑦𝑖𝑙 for 𝑖 = {𝑙, ℎ}. That is, we assume that workers of type ℎ are more productive than

workers of type 𝑙 when matched with either type of firm. Without loss of generality, we also assume that

𝑦ℎℎ − 𝑦ℎ𝑙 ≥ 𝑦𝑙ℎ − 𝑦𝑙𝑙 . That is, we assume that the additional output produced by workers of type ℎ

relative to workers of type 𝑙 is at least as large at firms of type ℎ as it is at firms of type 𝑙.

     Firms and workers come together according to a process of directed search. First, firms post wages.

In particular, a firm posts wages (𝑤𝑙 , 𝑤ℎ ), where 𝑤𝑙 is the wage the firm pays if it hires a worker of type 𝑙

and 𝑤ℎ is the wage the firm pays if it hires a worker of type ℎ. Second, workers observe the wages offered

by different firms and choose where to apply. As is standard in directed search, we require that workers

follow symmetric strategies, in the sense that all workers of type 𝑗 apply to various jobs with the same

probability. Third, firms observe the number and type of applicants. Given our assumptions on 𝑦𝑖𝑗 , all

firms prefer workers of type ℎ. If a firm receives some applications from workers of type ℎ, it chooses one

of these workers at random and hires him. If a firm receives no applications from workers of type ℎ and



15
  In the model, we refer to firms and jobs interchangeably, as every firm has only one job. However, the model is
really about jobs and not firms.

                                                        23
some from workers of type 𝑙, it randomly chooses one of the type-𝑙 applicants and hires him. If a firm

does receive any applications, it remains idle.


5.B Social Planner’s Problem

       Proposition 2 in Shimer (2005) states that the equilibrium allocation of applications to firms in this

setting is the same as the solution to the following social planner’s problem. The objective of the social

planner is to maximize aggregate output. The choice of the social planner is the probability 𝑝𝑖𝑗 with which

a worker of type 𝑗 applies to one of the jobs of type 𝑖. In the spirit of symmetric strategies, a worker of

type 𝑗 is equally likely to apply to any one of the jobs of type 𝑖. Therefore, given probabilities 𝑝𝑖𝑗 , the

number of applications from workers of type 𝑗 to a firm of type 𝑖 is a Poisson random variable with

average 𝑞𝑖𝑗 = 𝑝𝑖𝑗 𝜇𝑗 /𝜈𝑖 .

       Formally, the social planner’s problem is

 (3)                             max ∑ [(1 − 𝑒 −𝑞𝑖ℎ )𝑦𝑖ℎ + 𝑒 −𝑞𝑖ℎ (1 − 𝑒 −𝑞𝑖𝑙 )𝑦𝑖𝑙 ],
                                  𝑞𝑖𝑗
                                        𝑖={𝑙,ℎ}


subject to

 (4)                                              𝑞𝑙𝑗 + 𝑞ℎ𝑗 = 𝜇𝑗 , for 𝑗 = {𝑙, ℎ}

Let us briefly explain the objective function in (3). There is a measure 1 of firms of type 𝑖. A firm of type 𝑖

receives at least one application from a worker of type ℎ with probability 1 − 𝑒 −𝑞𝑖ℎ . In this case, the firm

hires the worker of type ℎ and produces 𝑦𝑖ℎ units of output. A firm of type 𝑖 does not receive any

application from a worker of type ℎ, but at least one application from a worker of type 𝑙 with probability

𝑒 −𝑞𝑖ℎ (1 − 𝑒 −𝑞𝑖𝑙 ). In this case, the firm hires a worker of type 𝑙 and produces 𝑦𝑖𝑙 units of output. In any

other case, the firm does not have any applicants and its output is 0. The constraint (4) is an aggregate

feasibility constraint for each worker type 𝑗. There is a measure 1 of firms of type 𝑖 and each of them

receives 𝑞𝑖𝑙 applicants of type 𝑙 and 𝑞𝑖ℎ applicants of type ℎ. The constraint (4) states that the measure of

applicants of type 𝑗 received by all firms is equal to the measure 𝜇𝑗 of workers of type 𝑗.

                                                             24
           Shimer (2005) proves that the first order conditions of the planner’s problem are both necessary

and sufficient for optimality. The first order conditions are given by

 (5)                               𝑒 −𝑞𝑖ℎ 𝑒 −𝑞𝑖𝑙 𝑦𝑖𝑙 ≤ 𝜙𝑙 and 𝑞𝑖𝑙 ≥ 0, for 𝑖 = {𝑙, ℎ}

 (6)                               𝑒 −𝑞𝑖ℎ [𝑦𝑖ℎ − (1 − 𝑒 −𝑞𝑖𝑙 )𝑦𝑖𝑙 ] ≤ 𝜙ℎ and 𝑞𝑖ℎ ≥ 0, for 𝑖 = {𝑙, ℎ}

where 𝜙𝑗 is the Lagrange multiplier on (4) and the two pairs of inequalities in (5) and (6) hold with

complementary slackness.

       The optimality condition (5) is easy to understand. The left-hand side is the marginal benefit of

increasing 𝑞𝑖𝑙 . An increase in 𝑞𝑖𝑙 raises the probability that a firm of type 𝑖 receives at least one application

from a worker of type 𝑙 by 𝑒 −𝑞𝑖𝑙 . The value of receiving at least one application from a worker of type 𝑙 is

given by 𝑒 −𝑞𝑙ℎ 𝑦𝑙𝑙 , which is the probability that the firm does not receive any application from a worker of

type ℎ times the output produced by a worker of type 𝑙. The right-hand side is the marginal cost of

increasing 𝑞𝑖𝑙 , which is the Lagrange multiplier on the aggregate resource constraint for workers of type

𝑙. The optimality condition (5) then states that the marginal benefit of increasing 𝑞𝑖𝑙 must be at most equal

to the marginal cost, and must equal the marginal cost if 𝑞𝑖𝑙 is strictly positive.

       The optimality condition (6) is also easy to understand. The left-hand side is the marginal benefit of

increasing 𝑞𝑖ℎ . An increase in 𝑞𝑖ℎ raises the probability that a firm of type 𝑖 receives at least one

application from a worker of type ℎ by 𝑒 −𝑞𝑖ℎ . The value of receiving at least one application from a worker

of type ℎ is given by 𝑦𝑖ℎ − (1 − 𝑒 −𝑞𝑖𝑙 )𝑦𝑖𝑙 , which is the difference between the output 𝑦𝑖ℎ produced by

the firm with an ℎ-worker minus the output (1 − 𝑒 −𝑞𝑖𝑙 )𝑦𝑖𝑙 that the firm could have produced if it had

received no applications from ℎ-workers. The right-hand side is the marginal cost of increasing 𝑞𝑖ℎ , which

is the Lagrange multiplier on the resource constraint for workers of type ℎ. The optimality condition (6)

then states that the marginal benefit of increasing 𝑞𝑖ℎ must be at most equal to the marginal cost, and

must equal the marginal cost if 𝑞𝑖ℎ is strictly positive.




                                                        25
       Now, let us conjecture that the solution to the social planner problem is interior. Later we will find

parametric conditions under which this conjecture is correct. At an interior solution, the ratio between

the left-hand side of (6) and the left-hand side of (5) for 𝑖 = 𝑙 equals the ratio between the left-hand side

of (6) and the left-hand side of (5) for 𝑖 = ℎ. This equality can be written as

 (7)                                              𝑦𝑙ℎ − 𝑦𝑙𝑙 𝑦ℎℎ − 𝑦ℎ𝑙
                                                             =            .
                                                  𝑦𝑙𝑙 𝑒 −𝑞𝑙𝑙   𝑦ℎ𝑙 𝑒 −𝑞ℎ𝑙

Using the resource constraint (4), we can solve (7) with respect to 𝑞𝑙𝑙 and 𝑞ℎ𝑙 and obtain

 (8)                                          𝜇𝑙 1       𝑦ℎℎ − 𝑦ℎ𝑙          𝑦ℎ𝑙
                                      𝑞𝑙𝑙 =     + [log (           ) − log ( )],
                                              2 2        𝑦𝑙ℎ − 𝑦𝑙𝑙          𝑦𝑙𝑙

 (9)                                          𝜇𝑙 1       𝑦ℎℎ − 𝑦ℎ𝑙          𝑦ℎ𝑙
                                     𝑞ℎ𝑙 =      − [log (           ) − log ( )].
                                              2 2        𝑦𝑙ℎ − 𝑦𝑙𝑙          𝑦𝑙𝑙

The above expressions imply that a firm of type 𝑙 receives more applicants of type 𝑙 than a firm of type ℎ

if and only if(𝑦ℎℎ − 𝑦ℎ𝑙 )/(𝑦𝑙ℎ − 𝑦𝑙𝑙 ) is greater than 𝑦ℎ𝑙 ⁄𝑦𝑙𝑙 .

           At an interior solution, the left-hand side of (5) for 𝑖 = 𝑙 equals the left-hand side of (5) for 𝑖 = ℎ.

This equality can be written as

 (10)                                         𝑒 −(𝑞𝑙𝑙 +𝑞𝑙ℎ ) 𝑦𝑙𝑙 = 𝑒 −(𝑞ℎ𝑙+𝑞ℎℎ ) 𝑦ℎ𝑙 .

Using (8), (9) and the resource constraint (4), we can solve (10) with respect to 𝑞𝑙ℎ and 𝑞ℎℎ and obtain

 (11)                                                  𝜇ℎ 1     𝑦ℎℎ − 𝑦ℎ𝑙
                                               𝑞𝑙ℎ =     − log (           ),
                                                       2 2       𝑦𝑙ℎ − 𝑦𝑙𝑙

 (12)                                                  𝜇ℎ 1     𝑦ℎℎ − 𝑦ℎ𝑙
                                              𝑞ℎℎ =      + log (           ).
                                                       2 2       𝑦𝑙ℎ − 𝑦𝑙𝑙

The above expressions imply that a firm of type ℎ receives more applicants of type ℎ than a firm of type

𝑙, since—by definition—a firm of type ℎ has more to gain from producing with a type-ℎ worker rather

than with a type-𝑙 worker than a firm of type 𝑙 does, i.e., 𝑦ℎℎ − 𝑦ℎ𝑙 > 𝑦𝑙ℎ − 𝑦𝑙𝑙 .

           Finally, we can use (8)-(9) and (11)-(12) to find conditions under which the solution to the social

planner’s problem is interior. In particular, the necessary and sufficient conditions for 𝑞𝑖𝑗 > 0 for 𝑖 =

{𝑙, ℎ} and 𝑗 = {𝑙, ℎ} are given by

                                                            26
 (13)                                          𝑦ℎℎ − 𝑦ℎ𝑙
                                                         ∈ (𝑒 −𝜇ℎ , 𝑒 𝜇ℎ ),
                                               𝑦𝑙ℎ − 𝑦𝑙𝑙

 (14)                                         𝑦ℎℎ − 𝑦ℎ𝑙 𝑦ℎ𝑙 −𝜇 𝜇
                                                        ∈     (𝑒 𝑙 , 𝑒 𝑙 ).
                                              𝑦𝑙ℎ − 𝑦𝑙𝑙   𝑦𝑙𝑙


5.C Market Decentralization

        In equilibrium, firms of type 𝑖 offer wages (𝑤𝑖𝑙 , 𝑤𝑖ℎ ) that attract an average of 𝑞𝑖𝑙 applications

from workers of type 𝑙 and an average of 𝑞𝑖ℎ applications from workers of type ℎ, where 𝑞𝑖𝑙 and 𝑞𝑖ℎ are

the same queue lengths as in the solution to the planner’s problem. Shimer (2005) shows that the wages

(𝑤𝑖𝑙 , 𝑤𝑖ℎ ) offered by firms of type 𝑖 are

 (15)                                                      𝑒 −𝑞𝑖𝑙 𝑞𝑖𝑙
                                                  𝑤𝑖𝑙 =               𝑦 ,
                                                          1 − 𝑒 −𝑞𝑖𝑙 𝑖𝑙

 (16)                                          𝑒 −𝑞𝑖ℎ 𝑞𝑖ℎ
                                       𝑤𝑖ℎ =              [𝑦 − (1 − 𝑒 −𝑞𝑖𝑙 )𝑦𝑖𝑙 ].
                                               1 − 𝑒 −𝑞𝑖ℎ 𝑖ℎ

    Let us explain the above expressions for the equilibrium wages. Start with (15). If a worker of type 𝑙

applies to a firm of type 𝑖, he is hired with probability 𝑒 −𝑞𝑖ℎ (1 − 𝑒 −𝑞𝑖𝑙 )/𝑞𝑖𝑙 and, conditional on being

hired, he earns the wage 𝑤𝑖𝑙 . The worker’s expected payoff from applying to a firm of type 𝑖 must be equal

to the worker’s maximized payoff from applying anywhere else. In a directed search model, this is equal

to 𝜙𝑙 , the value of the worker to the social planner, because firms compete for workers . Equation (6) tells

us that 𝜙𝑙 is equal to the marginal social value of increasing 𝑞𝑖𝑙 , i.e. 𝑒 −𝑞𝑖ℎ 𝑒 −𝑞𝑖𝑙 𝑦𝑖𝑙 . From these

observations, it follows that the equilibrium wage 𝑤𝑖𝑙 is given by (15).

    Next, consider (16). If a worker of type ℎ applies to a firm of type 𝑖, he is hired with probability

(1 − 𝑒 −𝑞𝑖ℎ )⁄𝑞𝑖ℎ and, conditional on being hired, he earns the wage 𝑤𝑖ℎ . The worker’s expected payoff

from applying to a firm of type 𝑖 must be equal to the worker’s maximized payoff from applying anywhere

else, 𝜙ℎ . Equation (6) tells us that 𝜙ℎ is equal to the marginal social value of increasing 𝑞𝑖ℎ , i.e.,

𝑒 −𝑞𝑖ℎ [𝑦𝑖ℎ − (1 − 𝑒 −𝑞𝑖𝑙 )𝑦𝑖𝑙 ]. From these observations, it follows that the equilibrium wage 𝑤𝑖ℎ is given by

(16).


                                                        27
5.D Wages, Applications, and Job-Filling Rates

    We now want to find a set of conditions for the parameters that describe the production process

under which a firm of type ℎ receives fewer applications, has a lower job-filling probability, and pays

higher wages than a firm of type 𝑙. To carry out this task, it is useful to represent the production process

with the tuple (𝑦𝑙𝑙 , 𝛿𝑙 , 𝜌𝑦 , 𝜌𝛿 ), where 𝛿𝑙 denotes 𝑦𝑙ℎ − 𝑦𝑙𝑙 , 𝜌𝑦 denotes the ratio 𝑦ℎ𝑙 ⁄𝑦𝑙𝑙 and 𝜌𝛿 denotes

the ratio (𝑦ℎℎ − 𝑦ℎ𝑙 )/(𝑦𝑙ℎ − 𝑦𝑙𝑙 ). Given (𝑦𝑙𝑙 , 𝛿𝑙 , 𝜌𝑦 , 𝜌𝛿 ), one can recover the tuple (𝑦𝑙𝑙 , 𝑦𝑙ℎ , 𝑦ℎ𝑙 , 𝑦ℎℎ ) as

𝑦𝑙ℎ = 𝑦𝑙𝑙 + 𝛿𝑙 , 𝑦ℎ𝑙 = 𝑦𝑙𝑙 𝜌𝑦 , and 𝑦ℎℎ = 𝑦𝑙𝑙 + 𝛿𝑙 𝜌𝛿 .

    A firm of type ℎ receives, on average, 𝑞ℎ𝑙 + 𝑞ℎℎ applications. A firm of type 𝑙 receives, on average,

𝑞𝑙𝑙 + 𝑞𝑙ℎ applications. Using (8)-(9) and (11)-(12), we can express the ratio between 𝑞ℎ𝑙 + 𝑞ℎℎ and 𝑞𝑙𝑙 +

𝑞𝑙ℎ as

 (17)                                        𝑞ℎ𝑙 + 𝑞ℎℎ 𝜇𝑙 + 𝜇ℎ + log 𝜌𝑦
                                                       =                  .
                                             𝑞𝑙𝑙 + 𝑞𝑙ℎ   𝜇𝑙 + 𝜇ℎ − log 𝜌𝑦

The above expression implies that 𝑞ℎ𝑙 + 𝑞ℎℎ < 𝑞𝑙𝑙 + 𝑞𝑙ℎ if and only if 𝜌𝑦 < 1. That is, a firm of type ℎ

receives fewer applications than a firm of type 𝑙 if and only if a firm of type ℎ produces less output with

an 𝑙-worker than a firm of type 𝑙 does.

         A firm of type ℎ fills its vacant job with an ℎ-worker with probability (1 − 𝑒 −𝑞ℎℎ ) and with an 𝑙-

worker with probability 𝑒 −𝑞ℎℎ (1 − 𝑒 −𝑞ℎ𝑙 ). Overall, a firm of type ℎ fills its vacant job with probability

(1 − 𝑒 −(𝑞ℎ𝑙+𝑞ℎℎ ) ). Similarly, a firm of type 𝑙 fills its vacant job with probability (1 − 𝑒 −(𝑞𝑙𝑙+𝑞𝑙ℎ ) ). Using

(8)-(9) and (11)-(12), we can express the ratio between the job-filling probability for a firm of type ℎ and

the job-filling probability for a firm of type 𝑙 as

                                      1 − 𝑒 −(𝑞ℎ𝑙+𝑞ℎℎ ) 1 − 𝑒 −(𝜇𝑙+𝜇ℎ +log 𝜌𝑦 )⁄2
                                                        =                           .
                                      1 − 𝑒 −(𝑞𝑙𝑙+𝑞𝑙ℎ )   1 − 𝑒 −(𝜇𝑙+𝜇ℎ −log 𝜌𝑦 )⁄2

The above expression implies that 1 − 𝑒 −(𝑞ℎ𝑙+𝑞ℎℎ ) < 1 − 𝑒 −(𝑞𝑙𝑙+𝑞𝑙ℎ ) if and only if 𝜌𝑦 < 1. That is, a firm

of type ℎ has a lower job-filling probability than a firm of type 𝑙, and hence a longer vacancy duration, if

and only if a firm of type ℎ produces less output with an 𝑙-worker than a firm of type 𝑙.

                                                          28
        The average wage paid by a firm of type 𝑖 is

                                            𝑤𝑖 = 𝛼𝑖 𝑤𝑖ℎ + (1 − 𝛼𝑖 )𝑤𝑖𝑙 ,

where 𝛼𝑖 is the probability that the worker hired by the firm is of type ℎ and 1 − 𝛼𝑖 is the probability that

the worker hired by the firm is of type 𝑙. That is, 𝛼𝑖 is

                                                         1 − 𝑒 −𝑞𝑖ℎ
                                                𝛼𝑖 =                      .
                                                       1 − 𝑒 −(𝑞𝑖𝑙 +𝑞𝑖ℎ )

We can express the difference between the average wage paid by a firm of type ℎ and the average wage

paid by a firm of type 𝑙 as

                  𝑤ℎ − 𝑤𝑙 = 𝛼𝑙 (𝑤ℎℎ − 𝑤𝑙ℎ ) + (1 − 𝛼𝑙 )(𝑤ℎ𝑙 − 𝑤𝑙𝑙 ) + (𝛼ℎ − 𝛼𝑙 )(𝑤ℎℎ − 𝑤ℎ𝑙 ).

The above decomposition implies that 𝑤ℎ > 𝑤𝑙 if: the probability that the worker hired by an ℎ-firm is of

type ℎ is higher than the probability that the worker hired by an 𝑙-firm is of type ℎ, i.e. 𝛼ℎ > 𝛼𝑙 ; an ℎ-firm

offers higher wages than an 𝑙-firm, i.e. 𝑤ℎℎ ≥ 𝑤𝑙ℎ and 𝑤ℎ𝑙 ≥ 𝑤𝑙𝑙 ; and an ℎ-firm offers a higher wage to a

worker of type ℎ than to a worker of type 𝑙, i.e. 𝑤ℎℎ > 𝑤ℎ𝑙 .

        The ratio between the probability that the worker hired by an ℎ-firm is of type ℎ, 𝛼ℎ , and the

probability that the worker hired by an 𝑙-firm is of type ℎ, 𝛼𝑙 , is given by

 (18)                                  𝛼ℎ   1 − 𝑒 −𝑞ℎℎ         1 − 𝑒 −(𝑞𝑙𝑙 +𝑞𝑙ℎ )
                                          =                  ∙                    .
                                       𝛼𝑙 1 − 𝑒 −(𝑞ℎ𝑙 +𝑞ℎℎ )     1 − 𝑒 −𝑞𝑙ℎ

The right-hand side of (18) is certainly greater than 1 if 𝑞ℎℎ ≥ 𝑞𝑙ℎ and 𝑞ℎ𝑙 + 𝑞ℎℎ ≤ 𝑞𝑙𝑙 + 𝑞𝑙ℎ . From (11)

and (12), it follows that 𝑞ℎℎ ≥ 𝑞𝑙ℎ because (𝑦ℎℎ − 𝑦ℎ𝑙 )/(𝑦𝑙ℎ − 𝑦𝑙𝑙 ) = 𝜌𝛿 ≥ 1. From (17), it follows that

𝑞ℎ𝑙 + 𝑞ℎℎ ≤ 𝑞𝑙𝑙 + 𝑞𝑙ℎ if and only if 𝜌𝑦 ≤ 1. Therefore, a sufficient condition for 𝛼ℎ > 𝛼𝑙 is 𝜌𝑦 < 1. That

is, if an ℎ-firm produces less output with a worker of type 𝑙 than an 𝑙-firm, the probability that the worker

hired by an ℎ-firm is of type h is higher than the probability that the worker hired by an 𝑙-firm is of type

ℎ.

        From (15), the ratio between the wage offered by an h-firm to a worker of type ℎ, 𝑤ℎℎ , and the

wage offered by an 𝑙-firm to a worker of type 𝑙, 𝑤𝑙ℎ , is given by


                                                        29
 (19)                                     𝑤ℎℎ    1 − 𝑒 −𝑞𝑙ℎ       𝑞ℎℎ
                                              =(            )∙            .
                                          𝑤𝑙ℎ       𝑞𝑙ℎ        1 − 𝑒 −𝑞ℎℎ

The first term on the right-hand side of (19) is (1 − 𝑒 −𝑞𝑙ℎ )/𝑞𝑙ℎ , which is the probability that a worker of

type ℎ applying to an 𝑙-firm gets hired. The second term on the right-hand side of (19) is 𝑞ℎℎ /(1 − 𝑒 −𝑞ℎℎ ),

which is the inverse of the probability that a worker of type ℎ applying to an ℎ-firm gets hired. Since 𝑞ℎℎ ≥

𝑞𝑙ℎ , an ℎ-firm receives more applications from workers of type h than an 𝑙-firm and, consequently, a

worker of type-ℎ is more likely to be hired if he applies to a firm of type 𝑙 than to a firm of type ℎ.

Therefore, 𝑤ℎℎ ≥ 𝑤𝑙ℎ .

        From (15) and (16), the ratio between the wage offered by an ℎ-firm to a worker of type ℎ, 𝑤ℎℎ ,

and the wage offered by an ℎ-firm to a worker of type 𝑙, 𝑤ℎ𝑙 , is given by

 (20)                          𝑤ℎℎ 𝜖(𝑞ℎℎ )[𝑦ℎℎ − 𝑦ℎ𝑙 + 𝑒 −𝑞ℎ𝑙 𝑦ℎ𝑙 ] 𝜖(𝑞ℎℎ )𝜌𝛿 𝛿𝑙
                                   =                               ≥               .
                               𝑤ℎ𝑙           𝜖(𝑞ℎ𝑙 )𝑦ℎ𝑙              𝜖(𝑞ℎ𝑙 )𝜌𝑦 𝑦𝑙𝑙

where 𝜖(𝑞) = 𝑒 −𝑞 𝑞⁄(1 − 𝑒 −𝑞 ) is the elasticity of the job-filling probability 1 − 𝑒 −𝑞 with respect to 𝑞,

and the inequality follows from the fact that 𝑒 −𝑞ℎ𝑙 𝑦ℎ𝑙 ≥ 0. After substituting 𝑞ℎ𝑙 and 𝑞ℎℎ with (9) and

(11), we find that the right-hand side of (20) is greater than 1 if and only if

 (21)                                       𝜖[(𝜇𝑙 − log 𝜌𝛿 + log 𝜌𝑦 )⁄2] 𝜌𝑦 𝑦𝑙𝑙
                                     𝛿𝑙 >                               ∙       .
                                                𝜖[(𝜇ℎ + log 𝜌𝛿 )⁄2]       𝜌𝛿

Therefore, 𝑤ℎℎ ≥ 𝑤ℎ𝑙 if 𝛿𝑙 is greater than the right-hand side in (21). That is, an ℎ-firm offers a higher

wage to a worker of type ℎ than to a worker of type 𝑙 if—for given ratios 𝜌𝑦 and 𝜌𝛿 —the difference

between the output produced by an 𝑙-firm with a worker of type ℎ and with a worker of type 𝑙 is high

enough.

        Finally, the ratio between the wage offered by an ℎ-firm to a worker of type 𝑙, 𝑤ℎ𝑙 , and the wage

offered by an 𝑙-firm to a worker of type 𝑙, 𝑤𝑙𝑙 , is given by

 (22)                                             𝑤ℎ𝑙 𝜖(𝑞ℎ𝑙 )𝑦ℎ𝑙
                                                      =            .
                                                  𝑤𝑙𝑙   𝜖(𝑞𝑙𝑙 )𝑦𝑙𝑙




                                                       30
After substituting 𝑞𝑙𝑙 and 𝑞ℎ𝑙 with (8) and (10), we find that the right-hand side of (22) is greater than 1 if

and only if

 (23)                                      𝜖[(𝜇𝑙 + log 𝜌𝛿 − log 𝜌𝑦 )⁄2]
                                                                           ≤ 𝜌𝑦 .
                                          𝜖[(𝜇ℎ − log 𝜌𝛿 + log 𝜌𝑦 )⁄2]

Let 𝑓(𝜌𝑦 ) denote the value of 𝜌𝛿 for which the left-hand side of (23) equals 𝜌𝑦 . Then, for all 𝜌𝛿 ≥ 𝑓(𝜌𝑦 ),

condition (28) is satisfied and 𝑤ℎ𝑙 ≥ 𝑤𝑙𝑙 . That is, a worker of type 𝑙 is offered a higher wage by an ℎ-firm

than by an 𝑙-firm if the ratio between the extra output produced by a worker of type ℎ at an ℎ-firm and

at an 𝑙-firm is greater than 𝑓(𝜌𝑦 ). Notice that, 𝑓(1) = 1 and that 𝑓(𝜌𝑦 ) is strictly decreasing with respect

to 𝜌𝑦 .

    We can now summarize our findings by stating the following theorem.

Theorem: Let the production process be described by the tuple (𝑦𝑙𝑙 , 𝛿𝑙 , 𝜌𝑦 , 𝜌𝛿 ) with 𝑦𝑙𝑙 > 0, 𝛿𝑙 > 0, 𝜌𝑦 >

0 and 𝜌𝛿 ≥ 1: (i) In equilibrium, the queue lengths (𝑞𝑙𝑙 , 𝑞𝑙ℎ , 𝑞ℎ𝑙 , 𝑞ℎℎ ) are strictly positive if and only if 𝜌𝛿 ∈

(𝑒 −𝜇ℎ , 𝑒 𝜇ℎ ) and 𝜌𝛿 ∈ 𝜌𝑦 (𝑒 −𝜇𝑙 , 𝑒 𝜇𝑙 ); (ii) In equilibrium, firms of type ℎ pay strictly higher wages, attract

strictly fewer applicants and have a strictly lower job-filling probability than firms of type 𝑙 if 𝜌𝑦 < 1, 𝜌𝛿 ≥

𝑓(𝜌𝑦 ) and 𝛿𝑙 is high enough.

    The theorem above is illustrated in Figure 2. The necessary and sufficient conditions for an interior

equilibrium are 𝜌𝛿 ∈ (𝑒 −𝜇ℎ , 𝑒 𝜇ℎ ) and 𝜌𝛿 ∈ 𝜌𝑦 (𝑒 −𝜇𝑙 , 𝑒 𝜇𝑙 ). The lightly shaded area denotes the region of

parameters (𝜌𝑦 , 𝜌𝛿 ) where the conditions for an interior equilibrium are satisfied. The necessary and

sufficient condition for firms of type ℎ to receive fewer applications and have a lower job-filling probability

than firms of type 𝑙 is 𝜌𝑦 < 1. The sufficient conditions for firms of type ℎ to pay higher wages than firms

of type 𝑙 are 𝜌𝑦 < 1, 𝜌𝛿 ≥ 𝑓(𝜌𝑦 ) and 𝛿𝑙 large enough. The heavily shaded area denotes the region of

parameters (𝜌𝑦 , 𝜌𝛿 ) where the equilibrium is interior, firms of type-ℎ attract fewer applicants and have

lower job-filling probability and pay higher wages (for some 𝛿𝑙 high enough).

     The theorem shows that the empirical observation that firms paying higher wages receive fewer

applications and take longer to fill their vacancies is not at all inconsistent with a view of the labor market

in which firms post wages and workers direct their search based on these wages. The first key assumption

is that workers are heterogeneous.16 First, consider the side of the firm. If workers were all identical, a

firm would only offer higher wages if that meant attracting more applicants and filling its vacancies faster.

If workers are heterogeneous, however, a firm could offer higher wages not because they attract more

applicants but because they attract a better pool of applicants. Now, consider the side of the workers. If

workers were identical, they would prefer to apply more frequently to high-wage jobs than to low-wage

jobs. However, if workers are heterogeneous, this need not be true. High-quality workers still prefer to

apply more frequently to high-wage jobs than to low-wage jobs, as their chances of being hired only

depend on the number of applications from other high-quality jobs. In contrast, low-quality workers may


16
  More precisely, the assumption is that workers are heterogeneous in some dimension that is not observable to us
from the EOPP data (i.e., some dimension not captured by education, experience, or age).

                                                       32
apply less frequently to high-wage jobs than to low-wage jobs because, at high-wage jobs, there are so

many more high-quality applicants that their chances of being hired are much lower. If this second effect

is strong enough, the overall number of workers applying to high-wage jobs may be lower than at low-

wage jobs.

     The second key assumption is that jobs are heterogeneous and the interaction between their type

and the worker’s type satisfies some particular conditions. 17 These conditions are spelled out in the

theorem and they all have a simple intuition. The condition 𝜌𝛿 ≥ 1 means that jobs of type ℎ have more

to gain than jobs of type 𝑙 by employing high-quality workers than low-quality workers. In turn, this

implies that jobs of type ℎ will offer higher wages than jobs of type 𝑙 to high-quality workers and they will

attract more of them. The condition 𝜌𝑦 < 1 means that jobs of type ℎ produce less output than jobs of

type 𝑙 when employing low-quality workers. In turn, this implies that jobs of type ℎ will attract fewer

applicants of type 𝑙 and fewer applicants overall. The condition 𝜌𝛿 ≥ 𝑓(𝜌𝑦 ) guarantees that jobs of type

ℎ will have to pay low-quality workers more than jobs of type 𝑙. Finally, the condition that 𝛿𝑙 is high

enough guarantees that high-quality workers are paid more than low-quality workers, even though low-

quality workers are hired with lower probability.

     The assumptions of the model are quite natural. The assumption that the workers and the jobs

participating in any particular labor market are heterogeneous beyond what is observable in the EOPP

seems hard to dispute. The assumptions about the interaction between jobs’ and workers’ types in

production are also quite natural. They basically say that there are some “sensitive” jobs and some

“regular” jobs. The productivity of sensitive jobs is more responsive to the quality of the workers manning

them than the productivity of regular jobs and the productivity of sensitive jobs manned by low-quality

workers is lower than the productivity of regular jobs. Our explanation for the fact that jobs paying higher



17
  More precisely, the assumption is that firms and jobs are heterogeneous in some dimension that is not captured
by the characteristics available in the EOPP survey.

                                                      33
wages attract fewer applicants and take longer to be filled is based on the existence of jobs’ and workers’

heterogeneity that is not observable in the EOPP. However, if one had data that contained information

about the job type, one would recover the standard positive relationship between wages, applicants, and

job-filling rates. For instance, using data that identifies jobs as sensitive or not, one would find that—

controlling for the type of job—firms that pay higher wages do attract more applicants and fill their

vacancies more quickly. Indeed, this is exactly what Marinescu and Wolthoff (2015) find when they control

for the exact job title, a much more nuanced variable than an occupational code. Similarly, if one could

average out the heterogeneity between different types of jobs, one would recover the standard positive

relationship between wages, applicants and job-filling rates. For instance, averaging out the firm’s wage

across sensitive and regular jobs, one would find that firms with a high average wage attract more

applicants and fill vacancies faster. Indeed, this is what Banfi and Villena-Roldán (2015) and Ketterman,

Mueller, and Zweimueller (2016) find.



6. Conclusions

    In this paper we used the EOPP survey to study the relationship between the wage paid to the worker

filling a vacancy, the duration of the vacancy, the number of applications attracted by the vacancy each

week, and the number of candidates interviewed for the vacancy each week. We found that, within a

particular labor market, the wage is positively related with the duration of the vacancy and negatively

related with both the number of applications and the number of interviews per week. We found these

relationships to be robust to the addition of all controls for observed characteristics of the job, firm, and

worker. We then argued that these findings do not contradict the common theory of the labor market

according to which firms post wages and workers direct their search based on these wages. We made this

point using the general directed search framework of Shimer (2005). We showed that jobs that are

“sensitive”—in the sense that they are especially responsive to the worker’s quality and are especially


                                                     34
unproductive when manned by low-quality workers—pay higher wages, attract fewer applicants, and take

longer to fill. The seeming paradoxical finding is easily explained by the fact that, while these jobs attract

fewer applicants overall, they attract a pool of applicants of higher quality.
