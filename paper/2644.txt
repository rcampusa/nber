                     THE DEVELOPING COUNTRY DEBT CRISIS


                                  ABSTRACT


    This paper raises several cautionary notes regarding high-condition-

ality lending by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in the

context of international debt crisis. It is argued that the role for high-

conditionality lending is more restricted than generally believed, because

enforcement of conditionality is rather weak. Moreover, the incentives for

a country to abide by conditionality terms are also likely to be reduced by

a large overhang of external indebtedness.

     Given the limited ability to enforce conditionality agreements, nodesty

and realism should be a cornerstone of each program. The experience with

conditionality suggests two major lessons for the design of high-condition-

ality lending. First, debt forgiveness rather than mere debt rescheduling

may increase a debtor country's compliance with conditionality, and thereby

increase the actual stream of repayments by the indebted countries. Second,

given the complexity of the needed adjustments, and the difficulty of

enforcing conditionality agreements, programs are most likely to be suc-

cessful when macroeconomic stabilization is given priority over large-scale

liberalization.

I. Introduction

    This paper examines the role of high-conditionality lending by the

International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as a part of the overall

managenent of the debt crisis. High-conditionality lending refers to     the

process in which the international institutions make loans based on   the

promise of the borrowing countries to pursue a specified set of policies.

High-conditionality lending by both institutions has played a key role in

the management of the crisis since 1982, though the results of such lending

have rarely lived up to the advertised hopes. One major theme of this

paper is that the role for high-conditionality lending is more   restricted

than generally believed, since the efficacy of conditionality is inherently

limited.

     A related theme is that many programs involving high-conditionality

lending could be made more effective by including commercial bank debt

relief as a component of such programs. I shall argue that such debt

relief can be to the benefit of the creditor banks as well as the debtors,

by enhancing the likelihood that the debtor governments will adhere to the

conditionality terms of the IMF and World Bank loans, and thereby raise

their long-term capacity to service their debts.

     Almost by definition, countries in debt crisis that appeal to the Fund

or the Bank for new loans have already been judged to be uncreditworthy on

normal market criteria. In such treacheroua circumstances, it is

appropriate to ask why the IMF or the World Bank should be extending new

loans. As an alternative, for example, the international institutions

could allow the creditors and debtors to renegotiate new terms on the old

loans without any official involvement. Such two-party negotiations
                                       2

 between creditors and debtors characterized earlier debt crises, before the

 IMF and World Bank existed (see Lindert and Morton, in this volume, for a

 discussion of the earlier history).

      In principle, continued lending by the international institutions

could be justified by several non-market criteria: as a form of aid, as an

 investment by the creditor governments that finance the IMF and World Bank

in political and economic stability of the debtor country (see Von

Furstenberg 1985, 1986, for such a view), as an extension of the foreign

policy interests of the major creditor governments, as a defense of the

international financial system, etc. Loans are not usually defended on

these grounds, though in fact such considerations are frequently important.

Of course, these criteria are valid to an extent, but also extremely

difficult to specify with precision as a basis for IMF-World Bank lending.

     Another defense of lending, also with considerable merit in some

circumstances, is that the IMF (and World Bank to a far lesser extent>, can

act as a "lender of last resort," in analogue to a central bank in a

domestic economy. The theory of the "lender of last resort" is not fully

developed, though the practical importance of having a domestic lender of

last resort is not much in dispute. The conceptual argument goes something

as follows.

     Commercial banks are at a risk of self-confirming "speculative panics"

by their depositors because the banks engage in maturity transformation of

their liabilities, i.e., they borrow short term and lend long term (see

Dybvig and Diamond, 1983, for a formal model of banking panics). If the

depositors suddenly get the idea that all other depositors are going to

withdraw their funds, it is rational for each depositor to withdraw his own
                                      3

funds from the bank, even if the bank would be fundamentally sound in the

sbsence of a sudden rush of withdrswals. The depositors' collective

behavior creates a liouidity crisis for the bank, in that a fundamentally

sound intermediary cannot satisfy the sudden desire of its depositors to

convert their deposits to cash. A lender of last resort, ususlly the

central bank, can eliminate the liquidity crisis by lending freely to the

bank in the short term. The banking panic is a form of market failure,

that can be overcome by a lender of last resort.

     The analogous argument for the IMF would hold that the private

commercial bank lenders to a country might similarly panic, and all decide

to withdraw their funds from the country even though the country is a

fundamentally sound credit risk in the longer term (see Sachs, 1984, for

such a model). In this case, lending by the IMF can eliminate the

liquidity squeeze on the country, and thereby help both the creditors and

the debtors. As in the domestic economy, the IMF helps to overcome a well-

defined market failure.

     This argument was part of the basis of the original IMF intervention

into the debt crisis in the early 1980s. The argument following the

Mexican crisis in mid-1982 was that countries were suffering from a

liquidity crisis, made acute by the simultaneous rise in world interest

rates and the sudden cessation of commercial bank lending. It seemed at

the time that the crisis could be quickly resolved (as argued, for example,

by dine, 1984), since it represented merely a liquidity squeeze.

     The liquidity arguments are no doubt true in some cases, but most

observers now doubt that the developing country debt crisis represents

merely a problem of liquidity. Six years after the onset of the crisis,
                                       4

almost no countries have returned to normal borrowing from the

international capital markets, and the secondary-market value of bank loans

to the debtor countries reflect very deep discounts in valuation. For many

countries at least, the crisis represents more fundamental problems of

solvency and longer-term willingness to pay on the part of the debtor

nations.

     In these circumstances, other justifications (that can be in addition

to the liquidity argument) have been advanced for the large role of the IMF

and World Bank lending. By far the most important argument is that strict

conditionality attached to IMF-World Bank loans can make such loans

aenaible on normal market terms. The asaumption is that the international

institutions are better than the banks at enforcing good behavior of the

debtor country governments, and therefore have more scope for lending.

     The importance of conditionality in justifying IMF-World Bank lending

is certainly well placed. Countries in crisis are often in poor economic

shape in large part because of bad policy choices in the past. IMF and

World Bank policies are appropriately focuaaed on key policy weaknesaea

(excessive budget deficits in the case of the IMF, and excessive inward

orientation in the case of the World Bank). Moreover, the IMF and World

Bank have the expertise and institutional clout to design high-

conditionality programs, while the commercial banks do not.

     Nonetheless, the role for high-conditionality lending is overstated,

especially in the case of countries in a deep debt crisis. In practice the

compliance of debtor countries with conditionality is rather weak, and this

compliance problem has gotten worse in recent yeara, since a large atock of

debt can itself be an important disincentive to "good behavior." In other
                                          5

words, the debt overhang itself makes it less likely that conditionality

will prove successful.

     The reason is straightforward. Why should a country adjust if that

adjustment produces income for foreign banks rather than for its own

citizenry?   Since deeply indebted countries recognize that much of each

extra dollar of export earnings gets gobbled up in debt servicing, a very

large stock of debt acts like a high marginal tax on successful adjustment.

Therefore, two counterintuitive propositions could be true when a country

is deeply indebted: "good behavior" (such as a higher investment rate) can

actually reduce national welfare, by increasing the transfer of income from

the debtor country to creditors; and explicit debt relief by the creditors

can increase the amounts   of   actual debt repayment, by improving the

incentive of the debtor country to take the necessary adjustments.

     Before turning to these arguments at greater length, we should

consider one additional argument sometimes made for official lending. The

argument is occasionally made that since countries are more averse to

defaulting on official loans than they are on private loans, it is safe

for official creditors to lend even when private creditors will not. This

argument can sometimes be correct, but it is often mistaken. If official

loans just raise the country's debt burden without raising its debt-

servicing capacity, then repayments to the official creditors might simply

crowd Out repayments to its private creditors, and thereby undermine the

smooth functioning of the international capital markets.

     The issues of conditionality and debt relief are now taken up in the

five following sections. Section II outlines the theory of conditionality,

and Section III focuses on the empirical record of high-conditionality
                                      6

lending. Section IV shows the linkages between the overhang of debt and

the effectiveness of conditionality, and demonstrates the potential role

for debt relief in high-conditionality lending. Section V then discusses

the specific problems raised by the macroeconomic situation of the heavily

indebted countries: high inflation, excessive inward orientation, large

budget deficits, and a prolonged economic downturn, all exacerbated by the

problem of high foreign indebtedness. The recent history of stabilization

has shown that few countries have been able to solve even one or two of

these problems at a time, much less all of them simultaneously, and the

record suggests that adjustment programs have the highest probability of

success when macroeconomic stabilization precedes large-scale trade

liberalization and a shift to outward orientation.



II. High-Conditionality Lendina by the IMF and World Bank

     The argument for high-conditionality lending is that the IMF and the

World Bank can compel countries to undertake stabilizing actions in return

for loans, thereby making the loans prudent even when the private capital

markets have declared the country to be not creditworthy. A full theory of

conditionality would have to explain three things. First, if the actions

being recommended to the country are really "desirable" for the country,

why is it that the country must be compelled to undertake the polfdy?

Second, if the country must indeed be compelled to undertake the actions,

what types of force or sanctions can be used to guarantee compliance? And

third, why is it that international institutions are better able to impose

conditionality than are the private capital markets?
                                      7

     One solution to the conundrum of why countries must be compelled to

accept conditionality is the problem of "time consistency": a debtor

government accepts cx ante the need for a POi1C    adjustment   as the

iro quo for a loan, but the government has a strong incentive to avoid the

policy change once the loan is arranged. In this case, the role of

conditionality is to bind the country to a course of future actions,

actions which make sense today but which will look unattractive in the

future. In other words, the goal of conditionality is to make the ex ante

and cx cost incentives for adjustment the same (where cx ante and ex qost

are with respect to the receipt of the loan).

     In earlier papers (Sachs, 1984; Cooper and Sachs, 1985), I have given

a simple illustration of a case in which conditionality is appropriate.

will discuss that case here, relegating the formal model to Appendix A.

Suppose that a government faces the problem of allocating resources between

consumption and investment. The government has a very high time discount

rate (0.30 for purposes of illustration), so that •current consumption is

much preferred to future consumption. The investment opportunities have a

return (0.20) in excess of the world interest rate (0.10), but less than

the time discount rate.

     The problem is the following. Once the foreign loans are obtained,

and the government has to decide how to allocate over time the total pool

of resources (equal to domestic resources plus foreign borrowing), the

government will choose to consume rather than invest. That is because its

time discount rate exceeds the rate of return on investment, so that it

doesn't pay to sacrifice consumption expenditures in order to raise

investment. For concreteness, we suppose that a particular export-oriented
                                      8

investment project costs $100 million, and therefore yields $120 million in

the future.

     We assume that without investment, the country won't have the

resources to pay off a loan in the following period. The government is

then assumed to pay off as much as it can, and to default on the rest.

Under these conditions, private foreign lenders will not lend much to this

country since they correctly foresee that the government will not invest

the money. The situation can be depicted simply as a two-stage game

between the creditors and the borrower. The creditor must first decide

whether to lend; the borrower then decides whether to invest. As

illustrated in Diagram 1(a), once the money is received, the government's

"utility" is higher by consuming today rather than investing (utility is

assumed to be equal to consumption, with future consumption discounted by

the rate of time preference). In particular, the country gets 100 in

utility by using the loan for current consumption, but only 8 if the loan

is used for investment. Because the country's "impatience" (high time

discount) is recognized by potential private creditors, the country is a

bad credit risk. Since the loan will not in fact be made, the country's

utility from the loan is of course 0.0.

     On the other hand, if the country could commit itself to increase

investment by the amount of the foreign loans, as shown in Figure 1(b), it

would result in a better outcome for the country (specifically, a utility

of 8 rather than 0.0). Since the investment opportunities have a return

that is higher than the world cost of borrowing, the returns to the

investment will be more than enough to pay off the loans. Moreover, since

the investment is foreign financed, undertaking it does not have to reduce

current consumption. Thus, if the country can commit itself to use foreign

loans for investment purposes, the country will: (1) maintain current

consumption levels; and (2) generate out of the investment project more

than enough future income necessary to repay the debt. In sum, it ia

advantageous for the government to try to "tie its hands," and commit

itself to use new foreign money for investment rather than consumption

purposes.

     The role for conditionality is introduced by assuming that countries

cannot make credible, enforceable commitments with private lenders to use

loans for one purpose or another, but that via conditionality agreements

with the IMF or World Bank, the country can commit itself to a particular

investment program. In such a case, it would be safe for the IMF or World

Bank to make high conditionality loans to the country (since the loans will

be used for investment purposes), while it would be imprudent for the

private sector to make the same loans (since without conditionality, the

government will consume the proceeds of the loan rather than invest).

     The remaining problem with conditionality comes from the fact that

once the IMF or World Bank lending is received, the country has the

incentive to renege on its investment commitment. Given the preferences of

the government, it is always better to consume than to invest once a level

of foreign loans has been established. Thus, there must be some way for

the country or the IMF and World Bank to guarantee that the commitment to

invest is actually honored.

     In practice bargaining over conditionality almost always involves more

than the debtor goverrment binding itself to a specific path of policies.

Bargaining between a debtor country and the IMF and World Bank may also
                                      10

involve an implicit dispute about which objective function to use in

evaluating a set of outcomes. If a program will lead to a recession next

year, but a recovery over the following several years. is it desirable?

The answer may well be "yes" to the Fund or the Bank (or their creditor

governments, which recognize that adjustment may involve short-run pain in

return for long-run benefits), but the same answer might be "no" to a

precarious regime that might lose power during a period of austerity.

Openness about this difference of opinion would block the signing of many

agreements. In practice, neither the Fund or Bank on the one hand nor the

creditor government on the other fully admit their disagreements, so that

many conditionality packages are signed that have little chance of

fulfillment, a point I return to below.



Official Versus Private Lending in IMF-World Bank Packases

     In the framework just described, the major role for the IMF and the

World Bank is to guarantee through conditionality that the country will use

a new loan for investment rather than consumption. We have discussed the

issue as if the loan itself will come from the monitoring institutions, but

in fact, there is no reason why there could not instead be a division of

labor: the international institutions impose the conditionality; the

private capital markets provide the financing. This is a well recognized

idea, that the international institutions should act mainly to provide "a

seal of good housekeeping," and thereby to catalyze private lending.

     Since the outbreak of the debt crisis, the IMF and World Bank have

often emphasized such a catalytic role. One of the major innovations early

in the crisis was the IMF's insistence to the commercial banks that any new
                                      11

IMF program for Mexico would require that the commercial banks commit $5

billion of additional lending to Mexico as well. Thus began the pattern of

"involuntaryt' or "nonspontaneous" bank lending, in which the banks agreed

to commit new lending to a debtor country in proportion to their existing

exposures to the country, as part of an IMF stabilization package. More

recently, private cofinsncing with the World Bank has also been added as a

condition of some package agreements (e.g., the Argentine agreement in

1986).

     The details of such loan packages are beyond the scope of this paper,

and have been discussed at some length in Sschs and Huizinga, 1987. Here

it suffices to point out the extremely limited nature of such financing,

and to point out that the "catalytic" role of the IMF and World Bank have

been vastly overstated (this may be a result of the lack of credibility of

the conditionality, for reasons suggested below). Three points can be made

here. First, overall net bank lending to the problem debtor countries was

negative during 1982-86, not positive. That is, loan amortizations

exceeded new lending, even after taking into account all of the well-

publicized "concerted lending" arrangement. The concerted lending has been

sporadic, and small in absolute magnitude, compared with the levels of debt

amortizations in recent years. Thus, the levels of commercial bank

exposure in the debtor countries actually fell after the onset of the

crisis.

     Second, the new lending by the commercial banks, where it has

occurred, has almost always fallen far short of the debt servicing payments

made by the debtor countries to the creditor banks. In this sense, the net

resource transfers from the banks to the major debtor countries has been
                                       12

highly negative in recent years, despite the occasional application of

concerted lending.

     Third, and perhaps most disturbing, the IMF has not devoted much

energy to getting concerted lending programs for the smaller debtor

countries, but only for the larger countries (e.g., Argentina, Brazil, and

Mexico). Almost no debtor country with an outstanding debt below $5

billion has been able to get any concerted lending from its commercial bank

creditors, as shown in Table 6 in Sachs and Huizinga (1987). The smaller

and politically weaker debtor countries have apparently had to make much

larger net resource transfers than have their larger fellow debtor

countries.



Enforcement of Conditionality Agreements: The Theory

     The question of enforcement of conditionality agreements is in many

ways tougher than the question of why conditionality is needed. The

justification for IMF-World Bank lending rests on two propositions

regarding enforcement:   (1) that the enforcement of IMF-World Bank

conditionality is sufficiently powerful to result in an "acceptable" rate

of compliance with IMF-World Bank programs; and (2) that the official

institutions have an advantage over the commercial banks in enforcing

conditionality. In this section and the next, we examine the validity of

these views.                                                     -




The Strenath of Conditionality

     For both the international institutions and the commercial banks, the

legal bases of conditionality are weak. In the domestic capital markets,
                                      13

bond covenants are legally binding restrictions on the behavior of debtors,

which can generally be enforced with only modest transactions costs. In

the international arena, particularly for loana to sovereign governments,

the transactions coats for enforcing loan agreements are extremely high.

As moat writers have recognized recently, the main method of enforcement

for lenders (whether official or private) involve the threat of cutoffs of

    loans to misbehaving borrowers. Such a cutoff in lending can of course

be extremely disruptive and costly to a borrower. Bank creditors can cut

back on short-term trade credits to a country, and thereby disrupt the flow

of international trade in the short term. The IMF similarly can cut back

on balance of payments support, and by doing so, also trigger the cutoff of

lending from other official sources (e.g., the World Bank, the bilateral

official creditors, the multilateral development banks).

     Theoretical work and the empirical evidence both establish that the

threat of a lending cutoff is a credible, but inherently limited sanction.

Thus, conditionality, whether by the IMF and World Bank, or by the

commercial banks themselves, should not on an a priori basis be expected to

have the same force as a binding bond covenant in a domestic loan. From

the beginning, we should appreciate the inherent limitations of the

enforcement mechanisms in conditionality on international lending.



A Special Problem of Nesotiatine with a Sovereign Borrower

     Conditionality is limited in effectiveness not only because of

enforcement difficulties, but also because of the complexity of negotiating

with a sovereign borrower. In the case of a bond covenant, there is a

clear legal responsibility on the borrower to carry out the conditions of
                                      14

the covenant. When a government is the debtor, however, there is likely to

be a considerable diffusion of power within the government, to the extent

that the individual parts of the government negotiating the conditionality

agreement may well lack the authority to implement the agreement.

     This problem is common with IMF agreements, though it is rarely

discussed or carefully analyzed. The IMF invariably negotiates with the

executive branch, and mainly with a small part of the executive branch, the

finance ministry. A small group of technocrats at the ministry of finance

and at the central bank will typically negotiate the IMF agreement in

private, and in splendid isolation from the rest of the government.

However, when the minister of finance signs the agreement with the Fund,

very often there can be little assurance that the minister has the

authority or political standing within the government to carry out the

agreement. This is especially the case when the minister agrees

to spending and tax changes that recuire oarliamentarv aooroval, or that

require the approval of other parts of the government (independent state

enterprises, regional corporations, state and municipal governments, other

ministries, etc.). Often, it is the president himself that undercuts his

finance minister in the execution of an adjustment program.

     In this sense, most IMF and World Bank agreements start with a formal

myth, that there is one unified actor in the government that can be bound

by the terms of a conditionality agreement. This may be a necessary myth,

and even sometimes a useful one, but uncovering the myth helps us in a

simple way to account for the fact that most IMF agreements fail, a point

we shall see below.

The Debt Overhang and the Weakness of Conditionality

     What must also be appreciated is the fact that the current overhang of

external debt to private creditors can greatly hinder the effectiveness of

IMF conditionality, at least under the prevailing design of IMF programs.

Virtually all IMF programs to date have been designed under the assumption

that the debtor country can and will service its external debts in the long

run on a normal market basis. The programs are constructed under the

maintained assumption of such normal debt servicing. (For exsmple, in the

technical calculations in Fund progrsms, interest rates on the existing

debt are assumed to be at market rates; the country is assumed to clear all

arrears on a reasonable timetable, etc.)

     Contrary to this assumption, however, it might easily be the case that

a country is better off defaulting on a portion of its debts than it would

be with timely debt servicing (a dozen or more countries have indeed taken

such umilateral action by 1987). There may simply exist no IMF high-

conditionality program based on full debt servicing, that if followed,

actually makes the country better off than it would be without the program

but with a partial suspension of debt payments. In other words, the IMF

program might simply be too tight relative to the available options of the

debtor government.

     In such circumstances, four things could happen. One outcome would be

for the IHF to design a program that is actually based on partial and

explicit debt relief. So far, the IMF has avoided this rather obvious

approach, partly because it has underestimated the possible efficiency

gains for all parties (creditors, debtors, and the Fund) that might result.

The second possibility is that the IMF and the debtor government would fail
                                         16

to sign a program, and the country would simply suspend payments on part of

its private sector debts. This has been the case with Peru during 1985-87,

and Brazil in 1987. The third possibility, and indeed the typical case in

recent years, is that the Fund and the country would sign a program based

on full debt servicing, even though both parties fully exDect that the

agreement will breakdown in due course. Either the conditionality would be

allowed to fall by the wayside and the country would continue to borrow

from the Fund but without living up to earlier commitments, or the IMF

program would eventually be suspended.

     Argentina during 1987-88 provides an ideal illustration of the case in

which the IMF and a debtor country signed a series of agreements in which

almost no observers had any confidence, and in which the IMF simply relaxed

the conditionality terms (with formal waivers) throughout the course of the

agreement. Mr. David Finch, the former director of the IMP Department of

Exchange and Trade Relations, writes of Argentina as a case of "renewed

pressures to involve the IMF in an agreement where political solutions [in

Argentina] won't allow a solution to the balance-of-payments problem .

the IMF has been forced to continue lending [to Argentinal to maintain the

facade of the debt strategy." (Finch, 1988, p. 127) In less diplomatic

language, the U.S. government was fearful that Argentina would default to

the commercial banks in the absence of new IMF money. The U.S. therefore
                                                                             -



pressured the Fund to maintain a program with Argentina despite the failure
of the Argentine government to live up to earlier agreements.

     A fourth possibility would be for the IMF and World Bank to approve

programs with debtor countries that allow for a build-up of arrears (i.e.,

nonpayments) to the commercial bank creditors, in well-defined
                                      17

circumstances. These circumstances would include:   (I) a large overhang of

debt that is deemed to be highly inimical to the stabilization efforts of

the country; and (2) the unwillingness of the commercial creditors either

to grant relief or significant new financing. By allowing for the buildup

of arrears to private creditors, the IMF could design more realistic

programs without the need to press the private creditors for specific

amounts of debt relief. The debt relief would instead emerge in the

bilateral bargaining of the debtor and the creditora.

     In a later section, we will explore in much greater detail the case

for combining conditionality with debt relief.



The Streneth of Official versus Private Conditionality

     It remains to ask whether the Fund and the Bank have more power than

the private banks in imposing conditionality on sovereign borrowers. Here,

experience will have to provide the most conclusive answers, and we discuss

the historical experience in the next section. Some theoretical arguments,

though, go as follows. First, the Fund and the Bank are ongoing

institutions, while bank syndicates are ad hoc. Defaulting to the Fund or

the Bank will presumably put the country at risk of rupturing the relations

with these institutions, while defaulting to some private creditors in a

particular syndicate might not forestall further borrowing from new lenders

elsewhere.

     Second, enforcement of loans raises several problems of collective

action. With hundreds or even more than a thousand private creditors for a

major debtor country, there is a problem in allocating the monitoring and

enforcement costs of a conditionality agreement that might be reached
                                              18

between the country and the creditors. With the Fund or the Bank, a single

 actor bears the enforcement Costs and reaps the rewards of enforcement.

Third, it is sometimes suggested that the Fund or the Bank          can   dictate

 terms to a country while    the    private sector cannot because it is easier for

 the country   to   be respondin&   to   an independent political institution than

 it is for the country to be responding to "private capital."

     Fourth, and perhaps most important, the creditor governments have made

IMF conditionality the practical linchpin of all a debtor country's

financial relations with the creditor governments. With few exceptions, a

debtor country in crisis must have an ongoing relationship with the IMF in

order to qualify for: (I) a rescheduling of official bilateral (i.e.,

government-to-government) loans in the Paris Club; (2) new credits from

official export credit agencies to the debtor government; (3) new lending

from the World Bank and the multilateral development banks (even if there

is no formal cross-conditionality clause between IMF and World Bank

lending, there is often implicit cross-conditionality); and (4) debtor

countries are often instructed by the U.S. to maintain good relations with

the IMF in order to maintain good bilateral relations with the United

States. Thus, a country's concern about foreign policy relations with the

United States often strengthens the hand of the IMF.

     On the other side of the ledger, the public institutions also have

several disadvantages in enforcement power relative to the private sector.

With respect to the first point, banks are also ongoing institutions well

aware of their reputations. They have so far been extremely reluctant to

ease the repayment terms for any country (for example to reschedule at

below market interest rates), even for countries in dire straits, because
                                        19

of the demonstration effect on the dozens of other countries with which

these banks are bargaining.

     Second, with respect to the free-rider problems of enforcement, the

banks have worked out ways to get around many of the collective action

problems involved in monitoring and rescheduling. For example, small

steering committees of banks are appointed to manage the negotiations with

the debtor countries. A small number of banks is entrusted with most of

the actual mechanics of oversight and negotiation. Syndicated loan

agreements now often contain provisions for certain binding actions by the

entire syndicate upon a favorable vote of some fraction of the syndicate

members. This kind of procedure can help to eliminate the problem of

individual banks attempting to free ride on the actions of others.

        Moreover, in some cases, the presence of hundreds of small banks can

actually strengthen the bargaining position of a bank syndicate. The

steering committee is able to point out in some circumstances that even the

small banks might ruin an agreement, so that the country must accede to

better terms for these weak links in the chain. When the country is

negotiating with a single creditor such as the IMF, this appeal of the

creditor to the "weak" fringe members of the bargaining tesm cannot be

made.

        As to the third point, that it is easier for a government to take

marching order from the international public institutions rather than from

private banks, the evidence is at best mixed. The epithet that a program

 is "fondo monetarista" is about as damning as possible in much of the Latin

American political lexicon. Indeed, there are now several cases in recent
                                      20

years in which countries have explicitly attempted private workouts with

the banks, in order to avoid the opprobrium of agreeing to a Fund program.

     Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the World Bank and the IMF are

in a weak bargaining position for several institutional reasons. First,

they are clients of the very governments to whom they are lending the

money. It may be hard indeed for the IMF or World Bank to tell a member

government to go away. To the credit of the Fund and the Bank, these

organizations have developed several institutional levels of technical

staff that intervene between the country and a final decision with respect

to lending.

     Because of the formal position of the multilateral agencies as clients

of the member governments, there is a need for a formal equality of

treatment of all member governments with regard to negotiations. It is

very difficult for the Fund or the Bank to make invidious comparisons among

countries concerning the likelihood that they will actually live up to

commitments. If a program looks good on paper, there are great pressures

for the program to be approved, even if there is widespread skepticism that

the program will actually be carried out. The Fund of course keeps track

of the compliance record of member governments, but it appears to be

difficult to make that record a formal basis for approving or disapproving

a program, assuming that the country is current in its repayments to the

Fund and assuming that on paper a proposed program hangs together.

     Another problem is that the Fund and the Bank have many goals other

than profits, which can make them a soft touch with respect to

conditionality. For the private capital markets, there is basically one

bottom line: will the loan make money? The Bank and the Fund must also
                                      21

worry about the political stability of the recipient country, the political

interests of the creditor governments, the standard of living of

individuals in the debtor countries, etc. These are admirable concerns,

indeed crucial concerns. They are the raison d'etre of international

institutions. But these concerns do not always allow for the hard-boiled

judgement about the potential success or failure of a conditionality

package.

     These limitations of the IMF are pointed out by Finch [1988], who

cites the case of IMF relations with Egypt as an important example (we have

already noted Finch's observations with regard to Argentina).

          For political reasons, Egypt had been receiving sizable support
     from the Western allies, much of it in the form of repayable export
     credits. With very limited cash aid available, servicing this credit
     became virtually impossible. Yet, debt relief was blocked by Paris
     Club rules that required that Egypt have an agreement with the IMF
     before the creditor countries would reschedule their losns. To
     maintain even a semblance of its traditional concern for timely
     repayment, the IMF had to insist on major changes in Egypt's economic
     policies.
          But the Egyptian government, fearing a domestic political
     backlash, refused to take the required action. Instead, it sought
     protection from other governments. The Fund was told to reach
     "agreement" with Egypt without insisting on the necessary policy
     changes. In recompense, undoubtedly, the IMF was given assured
     priority over other creditors. (p. 127)


     In sum, the power of conditionality is certainly present in the case

of IMF and World Bank lending, though conditionality

will face inherent limitations, given the limited enforcement powers at

hand. The alleged superiority of the international institutions in

imposing conditionality is probably correct in general but much oversold

quantitatively. The private sector can indeed impose conditionality, and

has done so in the past. At the same time, the conditionality emanating

from the international institutions is hobbled by the nature of the
                                        22

relationship of those institutions to the member governments. In the last

analysis, the success or failure of conditionality is an empirical matter,

and it is to the historical record that we turn shortly.



Enhancing the Strenzth of Conditionality

     Even before proceeding to the empirical record, we can already make

several points regarding ways to enhance the effectiveness of

conditionality agreements. First, given the weakness of conditionality,

the IMF and the World Bank probably undermine their effectivenes by signing

too many (unrealistic) programs. In cases which appear particularly

unrealistic, the IMF and World Bank can protect the conditionality process

by requiring more         actions on the part of the borrowing government, so

that the government proves its resolve to carry through on the negotiated

program (and is forced to build the domestic political base for the policy

changes).

     Second, if one source of unrealism is the heavy burden represented by

a large overhang of debt, the IMP and World Bank would increase the

likelihood of success by endorsing some programs that allow for arrears to

private sector creditors, if those creditors are unprepared to allow for a

realistic extent of debt relief. Furthermore, as we shall see, this point

applies more generally to encouraging formal debt relief as part of overall

IMFWorld Bank programs.

III. The Recent Experience with Conditionality

     The recent experience of the World Bank with high conditionality

lending in aupport of macroeconomic adjustment is rather limited, so that

most of the discussion will focus on the outcomes of IMF programs.

Moreover, measuring the success of Fund programs is a daunting task,

because the inevitable refrain is "compared to what?" (See Williamson

(1983, Chapter 7) for an interesting discussion of possible bases for

evaluation). One useful standard, which I apply here, is to judge the

programs in terms of the compliance of the debtor government with the terms

of the IMF agreement. Even this limited type of assessment is difficult,

both because compliance is multi-dimensional, and because-many of the

details of the programs (particularly the contents of the letters of

intent) are typically beyond the public view. Because of this latter

feature, we must rely almost wholly on studies of compliance undertaken by

the Fund itself, or on case studies of individual countries by outside

authors.

     Of course the design of IMF conditionality loans, and to a lesser

extent, World BankStructural Adjustment Loans (SALs), have been subject to

intense criticism and debate among policy makers and academic economists.

These debates often make it appear that the fundamental diagnoses

underlying such loans, and the conditions attached to them remain in

serious dispute. However, the problem of diagnosis is almost surely not

the main source of the problem with compliance. At a recent conference

reviewing IMF conditionality (see Williamson (1983)), Richard Cooper

conjectured (pp.571-573) that despite their differing theoretical views,

the conference participants would find themselves in broad agreement in
                                      24

designing a stabilization program for any specific country other than their

own. He went on to say that the chosen stabilization program would

probably look quite like a "standard" IMF package. Notably, there were few

demurrals, despite the wide range of theoretical positions represented at

the conference.

     In that conference (and in the country studies in the NBER Project on

Developing Country Debt) there was much evidence for the prevailing IMF and

World Bank views that: (1) balance of payments problems typically reflect,

inter alia, excessive money creation in support of fiscal deficits; (2)

multiple exchange rate systems lead to serious resource misallocations, and

are often a burden on public sector budgets; (3) overvalued exchange rates,

coupled with exchange controls, capital flight, and smuggling, represent a

tax on exports that is detrimental to long-term development; and (4)

allowing key prices (including real wages, public sector prices, and

interest rates) to respond to market conditions as part of an overall

adjustment effort will improve efficiency and growth.

     Ironically, though, there was one more point of agreement running

through most of the analyses at the Williamson conference (and the NEER

studies): IMF programs are very frequently, if not typically, unsuccessful

in restoring stability and growth in countries beset with balance of

payments and inflation problems. Aside from the cases of the developed

country borrowers (Italy, U.K. and Portugal) discussed at the conference,

several of the remaining programs that were described (Argentina, Brazil,

Jamaica, Tanzania) were unsuccessful in meeting stated objectives. These

findings of limited success are in accord with a growing number of other

case studies and cross-sectional analyses of IMF stabilization programs,
                                      25

which in sunt point to a mixed record, at the very best, in the compliance

of countries with Fund programs. (Notably, however, in the cases where

Fund programs were substantially implemented the macroeconomic results seem

to justify the conditions attached to the loans.)

     Internal IMF reviews of compliance are similarly mixed. In a review

of Fund programs supported by stand-by arrangements in upper-credit

tranches during 1969-78, Beveridge and Kelley (1980) found that fiscal

targets were achieved in about half the cases, but, "[b]y 1977 and 1978,

expenditures were contained as planned in less than 20 percent of the

programs, compared with over 50 percent in 1969 and 1970" (p. 213). Also,

Beveridge and Kelley found that governments were not generally successful

in meeting targets with respect to the composition of expenditure between

current and capital outlays. In over 70 percent of the programs specifying

a desire to expand capital outlays while constraining current outlays

(exactly the form of conditionality considered in the theoretical model),

"current expenditure in nominal terms exceeded the target or projection.

In about half of the these programs, capital outlays in nominal terms were

lower than projected" (p. 214). With respect to the target on overall

budget balance, as opposed to expenditures alone, budget targets were met

in about 50 percent of the programs overall, but in less than 20 percent of

the programs in 1978. Once again, a sharp downturn in compliance was

noted. Doe's study (1983) has updated the Beveridge and Kelley results for

Fund programs in 1980. Of the 18 programs surveyed that planned a

reduction in the fiscal deficit, half of the programs did result in a

reduced deficit, but in only 4 (22 percent) of the cases did the country

actually meet the agreed upon targets.
                                      26

     Stephan Haggard's (1985) recent review of IMF programs under the

Extended Fund Facility (EFF) is no more heartening. The EFF was created in

1974 in the wake of the first oil shock as a way to enlarge the access of

IMF member countries to Fund credits. The goals were similar to those

enunciated for the Baker Plan. In Haggard's words, the EFFs "are

representative of a growing emphasis among development economists on the

importance of microeconomic instruments and on the role of resource

utilization and production as a basis for longer-term structural

adjustment. EFFs often call for fundamental shifts in policy, such as

liberalization of trade, decontrol of prices, and restructuring of

public-sector corporations" (p. 508). The results of the EFFs were poor.

According to Haggard, in his count, "of the thirty adjustment programs

launched under the auspices of the Extended Fund Facility, twenty-four were

renegotiated, or had payments interrupted, or were quietly allowed to

lapse. Of these twenty-four, sixteen were formally cancelled by the IMF,

virtually all for noncompliance" (pp. 505-506).

     Haggard's bleak conclusions are echoed in a recent study by Remmer

(1986), of IMF programs during 1954-1984. It is worth quoting Renimer at

length on the question of IMF conditionality:

          Unsuccessful implementation of IMF recipes has been the norm in
     Latin America, not the exception. A high proportion of standby
     programs have failed to push key indicators of government finance and
     domestic credit even in the right direction. Moreover, examining IMF
     standby programs on a before and after basis shows that changes in key
     indicators are more readily attributable to chance than to the
     operation of IMF stabilization programs. The obvious conclusion is
     that the economic, social, and political impact of IMF programs has
     been overstated. To describe the IMF as a 'poverty broker,' as does
     the title of a recent book, or to charge the Fund with undermining
     democracy is to engage in hyperbole. The power of the IMF remains a
     useful myth for governments seeking a scapegoat to explain difficult
     economic conditions associated with severe balance of payments
                                      27

     disequilibria, but the ability of the IMF to impose programs from the
     outside is distinctly limited. (p. 21)


     Given all of these unsatisfactory results, it is not surprising that

the Fund has been unable to wean many countries away from IMF support, in

spite of "temporarily available." The accompanying Table 1, taken from

Goode (1985), shows the list of 24 countries that have used Fund resources

consecutively for a period of at least 10 years. Note that of these 24

cases, fully 19 are still using IMF resources as of 1984. In other words,

the lengthy reliance on Fund loans is a contemporary feature of the system.

This table, by definition, does not include even more problematic cases, in

which the country's performance under Fund programs was so unsatisfactory

that its access to further Fund credits was suspended.

     The experience with the World Bank Structural Adjustment Loans is too

brief to allow any such comparable review. By design these programs are

intended to yield results only in the intermediate term (say 5-15 years),

so that no comprehensive judgements can yet be made. However, there are

already some very worrisome signs that the compliance with Bank

conditionality is no better than with the Fund's. In a review of recent

SAL experience, Berg and Batchelder (1985) note that three (Senegal,

Guyana, Bolivia) of sixteen SAL countries have already experienced a clear

breakdown of a program in process, or in the denial of a follow-up of SAL

because of inadequate performance. These authors are also skeptical of the

strength of Bank conditionality, pointing to the case of Senegal (whose

SAL was cancelled in mid-1983) as an example of the non-enforceability of

conditionality:

          As noted earlier the Bank must shrink from the ultimate sanction,
     cancellation. Cessation of disbursements is too strong a response by
     the Bank to banal acts of non-performance. In the one case where this
     was done (Senegal) the SAL was replaced by new credits.
          Non-compliance, at least in the short-run, was virtually costless
     to Senegal, whose share of Bank-IDA disbursements has been 50% higher,
     during July-February of fiscal 1984, than it was during fiscal 1981
     and 1982... [H]owever, new Bank-IDA commitments to Senegal have dropped
     off, and it is not clear when that decline will be reversed [p. 44].


     The record of failed SAL programs (3 in 16 countries) may well

understate the failure rate in the longer term, particularly if the SALs

become important for the Latin American countries. Many of the existing

SALs cover the successful middle-income developing countries and the NICs,

such as Thailand and Korea, rather than the problem cases of Peru, Chile,

Argentina, Brazil, or Mexico.



IV. External Debt and Conditionality

     The theme of this section is that high external indebtedness can

reduce the incentives for a country to undertake necessary macroeconomic

adjustments, and thus further reduce the chance that the terms of a

conditionality agreement will be fulfilled. Indeed, for very high levels

of indebtedness, it may be useful for creditors to forgive some of the debt

as an incentive for better performance, recognizing that such an incentive

could actually raise the repayments to creditors in the long run. Before

proceeding with this argument, a terminological point must be made.

Creditors frequently "write dowi" the value of bad loans in their own

books, without relieving the debtor of the legal obligation to make full

repayments. The thrust of this section is not about writedowns (which may

be wise from an accounting or regulatory point of view), but about explicit
                                      29

relief or forgiveness, in which the creditors reduce the legal obligations

of repayment below the levels originally contracted.



The Basic Efficiency Case for Debt Relief

     Let us see how debt forgiveness can work (once again the technical

material is presented at the end of the paper, in Appendix B). Suppose

that a country has a large stock of debt due in the future. We will

assume, for purposes of illustration, that the stock of debt is so large

that the country lacks creditworthiness for any additional borrowing on

international private markets. Moreover, to avoid complications, we will

for the moment ignore conditionality lending. Finally, by assuming that

the debt is due in the future rather than the present, we ignore issues

relating to rescheduling.

     The existing creditors have a choice this period: They can sit down

with the country and negotiate some debt relief, or they can "hang tough"

today, and hope to get fully repaid in the future. It might seem, and it

is often argued as if, the creditors should simply hold Out for the maximum

repayment, and take whatever they can get in the future. After all, why

give up on full repayment today, before the debt is due? This is certainly

the attitude of many banks, who recognize that they are unlikely to be

repaid fully but have decided to sit tight until further developments

occur. Unfortunately, this strategy may well ultimately leave the banks

with smaller repayments than they would receive by negotiating forgiveness

in some circumstances.

     When the debt overhang is large enough, it can act as a major

incentive against the very adjustments in the debtor country that would
                                        30

contribute to future debt servicing, as can be shown by a simple numerical

example. Suppose that the country owes $150 million, but has a future

capacity for debt servicing of only $100 million. Suppose also that in the

future the country will repay (in present value terms) as much of the $150

million as possible, and will then default on the balance. Note that

improvements in the country's future debt servicing capacity (up to $150

million) would go simply to the creditors' benefit, and not the country's,

since the overhang of debt is so large.

     Suppose, for instance, that a wonderful investment opportunity is

available for enhancing exports. If the debtor government sacrifices $10

million of current consumption and raises investments in the export sector,

it will raise its future debt servicing capacity from $100 million to $120

million. From the creditors' point of view this would be quite beneficial.

Rut from the country's point of view, it would be highly irrational. The

country would lose $10 million in consumption today, and would gain nothing

in consumption in the future, since all of the added export earnings would

go to the creditors, and the export earnings still not be enough to repay

the debt! The benefits of higher future production would fall entirely to

the creditors.

     Since the government will not undertake the investments in such

circumstances it is most likely that the debt servicing capacity of the

country will not be enhanced. The debtor will not adjust (i.e., the

export-promoting investments will not be made). The future debt servicing

capacity will remain at $100 million, which is the amount that the

creditors will receive in the future.
                                     31

    Now suppose instead that the creditors offer some debt relief. The

creditors might agree to forgive $45 million, and to continue to demand

$105 million of repayments (i.e., the creditors settle for 70 cents on the

dollar). This could be done, for example, by a swap of the outstanding

$150 million of debt for exit bonds with face value of $105 million.

if the country invests, it loses $10 million in consumption today, gains

$20 million in additional export earnings in the future (total export

earnings now equal $120 million), and repays $105 million in debt (i.e.,

the exit bonds would be fully serviced). Future consumption therefore

rises by $15 million (— $120 million - $105 million). Assuming that the

government's rate of time discount is not too high, the opportunity to pay

$10 million in current consumption in order to raise future consumption by

$15 million will seem attractive, and the investment will be made.

     In sum, by aareeing to debt relief, the creditors raise the ultimate

reoayment from $100 million to $105 million. The debtor is better off as

well, since it accepts a short-run cut in consumption in return for a much

larger future increase in consumption. The whole game is diagrammed in

Diagram 2. With now debt relief, the equilibrium involves no investment,

and $100 million in debt repayment. with debt relief, the equilibrium

involves investment with repayments of $105 million.

     This argument for debt relief would be misplaced if the debtor

countries are actually in the range of indebtedness in which they will

eventually service all of their debts at market terms. However, most of

the direct and indirect evidence that we have on the market value of claims

on the major debtor countries shows that the investors indeed believe that

there is a significant chance that much of the debt will not be fully

Explanation: Without debt relief, the creditor is repaid $100 million, and the
debtor consumes. Debtor utility in this case is set at 0.0, and utility in the
other caaea ia measured as a deviation from this baseline, according to the for-
mula u —
            -i   + max £100 + 2I — D, 0] 1(1.3), where D is the amount of debt
that is due. D = 150       in the case of no relief, and D =             105   in the case of
relief.          is 0.0, or $10 million. Lender utility is measured by the amount of
repayment in the second period, and is equal to mm [ioo + 2 I, DJ , which
equals $100 million if I • 0; $120 million if I = $10 million and no relief is
granted; and $105 million if I a $10 million and D is reduced from $150 million
to $105 million.

serviced in the long run. (See Sachs and Huizinga, 1987, for further

details on the market valuation of the outstanding debt).

     If this analysis is correct, there nay be significant welfare gains

from forgiving some of the existing stock of debt, rather than piling up

more debt in the form of new loans and reschedulings. The question of how

actually to engineer debt relief is a very difficult one. Equity and

efficiency considerations will dictate that the existing creditors from all

classes must coordinate any forgiveness. This will pose serious

administrative and regulatory problems, since creditors in different

countries and in different sectors would face very different costs and

benefits. Commercial banks might even face shareholder lawsuits if they

were to forgive some debt without adequate administrative support from the

batik regulators and perhaps from the legislatures of the various creditor

countries. Moreover, the debt relief must be in a way to limit the moral

hazard problem of countries intentionally mismanaging their international

economic policies for the sake of achieving debt relief.

     Of course debt relief could come in all shapes and sizes, varying from

an Alan Garcia-style cap on debt repayments relative to exports, to a

conversion of existing debt into new securities with a lower contractual

present value, to a rescheduling at below market interest rates, to a

scheme in which each dollar of amortization reduces the debt outstanding by

some multiple of a dollar (by agreement with the creditors), or finally to

an explicit elimination of claims by the creditors without a auid pro auo

(as in the cancellation of inter-allied war debts in the early l930s). The

relative advantages and disadvantages of these various methods are beyond

the scope of this paper.
                                      33



The Interaction of Debt Relief and Conditionality

     There are really two linkages between a debt overhang and the

effectiveness of conditionality, one obvious and the other a bit more

subtle. The obvious linkage has already been made: in the absence of debt

relief, a country may have no incentive to honor a conditionality

agreement, and to carry through on an economic reform program. The foreign

debt acts like a tax on adjustment. The debt relief removes the tax, and

encourages the country to undertake efficient reforms.

     The second linkage occurs when debt relief is a necessary but not

sufficient condition for inducing the country to undertake needed reforms.

In the previous numerical example, the country chooses to undertake reforms

once debt relief is granted, even in the absence of conditionality. As

soon as the debt is reduced from $150 million to $105 million, the country

voluntarily reduces current consumption by $10 million in order to raise

future consumption by $15 million. It might easily have been the case,

however, that even with debt relief, the needed reforms would still look

unattractive. This would happen, for example, if the government's rate of

time discount is so high that an increase in future consumption of $15

million would not justify a cut in current consumption of $10 million.

     In such a case, relief would not result in any improvement in the

debtor country's economy, and so would be unattractive from the creditors'

point of view. It might still be the case, however, that the combination

of debt relief and conditionality would raise the welfare of both the

creditors and the debtor, even though relief by itself and conditionality

by itself, could not do so.
                                      34

     To see how this would work, suppose that the following high-

conditionality loan package is put together:
-  debt relief, which reduces the overhang of debt from $150 million to
$105 million;

-  II4F lending of $5 million to the country, and with repayment to the IMF
of $5.5 million in the future;

-  the country commits to undertake the export-enhancing reform, at the
cost of $10 million today.


Assuming that the conditionality is enforced, the country increases its

future productive capacity from $100 million to $120 million. Current

consumption falls by $5 million (since half of the cost of the investment

is financed by the IMF loan). Future consumption goes up by $9.5 million

($120 million in exports minus $5.5 million in debt repayment to the IMF

minus $105 million in debt repayment to the original creditors).

     Now, instead of giving up $10 million today to get $15 million in the

future, the government gives up only $5 million today to get $9.5 million

in the future. As long as the rate of time discount is neither too low nor

too high (specifically, as long as the discount rate is between 0.5 and

0.9), the country will reject the investment in the absence of the IMF-

World Bank loan, but will accept the investment cum conditionality with the

official loan. In that case, the original creditors are better off, since

their repayments rise by $5 million relative to the case of no reform. The

debtor is better off by $9.5 million in the future. The IMF breaks even

since its loan gets repaid.

     And yet none of this would happen in the absence of debt relief (in

which case the country reaps no benefit from reform),      in   the absence of

conditionality and new IMF lending (since the country would not undertake
                                     35

the investment without new lending, and would not get the new lending

without a credible commit to undertake the investment).

     The key to this example is that the investment requires kQ new

external financing and debt relief, and the external financing requires

conditionality, since the country would prefer to borrow abroad and then

not undertake the reform, as in the first example in Diagram 1. Again we

can resort to a formal game analysis, as in Diagram 3. In Diagram 3(a) we

have the case without debt relief. The country will not undertake the

investment, and will not consent to a conditionality package. In Diagram

3(b) we have the case with relief, but without conditionality. Again, the

country will not undertake the investment out of its own resources, but

also will not get any new loans. In Diagram 3(c), we have the combination

of debt relief and new external financing cum conditionality.

     This example belies two common views: that debt relief must hurt the

creditors; or that if debt relief helps the creditors, it will be achieved

without official intervention. The example makes clear that both relief

and official intervention via conditionality are necessary for a successful

adjustment program to the mutual benefit of the debtor and its creditors.



V. Some Imulications for the Pace and Phasing of Adiustment Programs

     The postwar history of stabilization, liberalization, and

conditionality can make a pessimist of the most tenacious optimist. Few

stabilization and liberalization plans meet their initial objectives, and

many fail miserably. We have seen that conditionality is inherently

limited in its capacity to effect adjustment in the debtor countries, and

that the limitations are even more severe in the presence of a debt

Explanation: Without debt relief, the debtor's second period consumption       is always

0.0. Thus, if it accepts the $5 million IMP   loan,   the utility effect is simply

the change in C1,. which equals —$10 million (   I)   +    $5 million (— IMP loan), or
—$5 million. With debt relief, but no new lending, the benefit of investment is

—$10 + ($120 — $105)I1.6, which is approximately —1. With debt relief and con-
ditionality, the benefit of the IMP package is
               —$5 + ($120 — $5(I.1) — $105)/1.6
which is approximately 1. Note that $5(1.1) represents the repayment of the $5
million IMP loan at 10 percent interest.

overhang. In many cases, deht relief might have to be combined with

conditionality to improve the likelihood of success of IMF and World Bank

programs.

     Given these limitations, it is important to make the objectives of

conditionality consistent with the limited efficacy of conditionality.

Programs of the IMF and World Bank should be tailored according to a

realistic assessment of the possible accomplishments. One of the most

important issues in this regard is the balancing of the demands of

stabilization with those of longer-term structural reform. Since the major

debtor countries suffer from acute macroeconomic disequilibria (with

inflation rates in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico well exceeding 100 percent

per year in 1987), a crucial issue is the balancing of macroeconomic

stabilization with other types of structural reform.

     The main theme of this section is that structural reform (especially a

shift towards greater outward orientation and trade liberalization) is a

very difficult process that takes many years to bring to fruition. The

process is so difficult economically and politically that it is likely to

fail under the best of macroeconomic circumstances, and is in general

greatly jeopardized by a concurrent macroeconomic stabilization crisis.

The historical record suggests that adjustment programs rarely succeed

unless stabilization is their first step, with structural reforms

proceeding gradually and mostly after macroeconomic balance has been

restored.

     The historical record points to a high failure rate in general

regarding attempts at trade liberalization and a shift towards outward

orientation. One thoroughly documented record of liberalization
                                      37

experiences can be found in the multi-country study on "Foreign Trade

Regimes and Economic Development" directed by Jagdish Bhagwati and Anne

Krueger at the National Bureau of Economic Research, and summarized in

Krueger (1978). Krueger (pp. 219-220) identified 22 attempts to liberalize

from a situation of heavy reliance on quantitative restrictions and

exchange controls. By her own count, 13 of these episodes were

unsuccessful and nine were successful. Even this count is too optimistic,

however, since only 4 of the 9 "success" cases (measured as j years of

successful liberalization) proved to be enduring until the time of

Krueger's study (these cases are Brazil, 1964; South Korea, 1964; Israel,

1962; and Colombia, 1967). Perhaps most discouraging from the current

policy vantage point is the fact that the Latin American countries show the

most repeated failures in attempts at liberalization. And the legacy of

past failures can have an important bearing on the success of any future

plan, as I argue below.

     Tab1egives the breakdown of success and failure, with the dates of

the program, and the inflation rate of the preceding year. Two points

stand out clearly. In almost all cases, the internal imbalances in the

economy at the time of the liberalization attempts, as measured by the

inflation rate, are far smaller than the crisis conditions now confronting

the Latin American debtors. Second, a high inflation rate seems to be a

serious hindrance in successful stabilization, since in four of the five

cases in which liberalization was attempted with an inflation rate above 30

percent, the experiment failed. Of those five, only Brazil, in 1964,

demonstrates a successful liberalization cum stabilization. That episode

might be the only modern case of the type of adjustment now demanded of the

Note: Note that the definition of success used here is rather modest: a      Phase


        III liberalization S converted to a Phase IV liberalization for at least

        four years. Several of the success cases ultimately became failures, as

        qualitative restrictions (QR5) were reapplied. The precise definitionS

        of Phases III and IV can be found in Krueger (1978. pp. 25-27). Phase

        III signifies a trade regime in which the exchange rate has been devalued

        "to reflect the de facto price of foreign exchange." QRs may be reduced

        in scope but will generally remain. Phase iv   "features   greater emphasis

                                                                             the

 Latin American countries. It had its own special conditions that allowed a

 successful program, not the least of which was a strong military

 dictatorship that could sharply squeeze real wages in the period of

 disinflation, 1964-67.

      The appropriate link between stabilization and liberalization may be

 the most important policy issue facing the World Bank in choosing a

 strategy for high-conditionality lending. The suggestion in Table 4 that

 an initially high inflation rate can do in a liberalization effort finds

 independent support in several quarters. First, Krueger herself notes that

 liberalization attempts are most successful in countries that are not at

 the same time pursuing anti-inflationary policies or policies   to restrict

 the level of foreign borrowing. One clear reason is that the fear of

 inflation induced governments to undertake inadequate devaluations     at the

start of a liberalization exercise, and then failed to keep the exchange

rate adjusting downward in correction for a domestic inflation rate in

excess of the world rate.

     Unfortunately, this lesson was not learned in time for the recent

Southern Cone stabilization exercises, which foundered exactly on this

conflict of goals. In their excellent survey of these episodes in

Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, Corbo and de Nelo conclude that
                                                                 "policy
inconsistencies were the main reason for the eventual failure of the

reforms" (1985, p.864), with the inconsistencies revolving first around the

use of the exchange rate to both promote trade and restrict
                                                              inflation, and
second around the inconsistent application of tariff and
                                                           regulatory
policies. Even the tariff inconsistencies can often be traced to the

anti-inflation program, since unexpected and unplanned tariff changes were

often made (especially in Argentina) in an attempt

inflation.

     The Southern Cone countries were attempting to pursue two targets, low

inflation and liberalized trade, and had the freedom to relax a third

constraint: external borrowing. In the late 1980s, the Latin American

countries are being called upon to pursue three objectives simultaneously:

lower inflation, liberalization, and reduced dependence on foreign

 to success. Brazil and Korea started out their programs with sharp real

 data for Indonesia are not available). Also, all proceeded gradually with

  1044 percent in 1965.)

       Other research, by Killick et al. (1984) and Ching-yuan Lin (1985),

  agree with the proposition that the simultaneous application of
                                       40

 stabilization and widespread liberalization is unlikely to be sustainable

 and successful. Killick notes that a degree of liberalization was sought

 alongside stabilization in at least 8 of 23 standby arrangements in

 1978-79, with meager results. He concludes "It does not seem that the

means available to, or employed by, the Fund are strong enough to achieve

 its liberalization objective in more than rare cases" (p. 238). Lin has

made a persuasive case, this time based on a comparative economic
                                                                      history
of East Asia and Latin America, that a reduction in inflation should take

precedence over all other targets, including liberalization, when inflation

rates are high and prone to rise. In a detailed comparison of the

stabilization experiences of Latin American and East Asian countries, Lin

argues that the success of the Asian cases was built on a reduction of

inflation that preceded the liberalization attempts by 5 years or more:

          In both Chile and Argentina, the control of hyperinflation and
     the liberalization of the economy occurred at the same time [in the
     mid-1970's]. This greatly compounded the difficulties of the domestic
     industries by forcing them to cope with both the depressive effects of
     the stabilization policies and the increased competition of foreign
     producers at the same time. This contrasts sharply with the situation
     4n Taiwan and South Korea, where the control of hyperinflation
     preceded intensive trade policy reforms by several years.


     Lin also points out at some length that inflation control was

supported by a worsening rather than an improvement of the trade balance,

since foreign funds were used to support the governments of Taiwan and

Korea after the resort to money creation was brought under control:

          In all of the cases mentioned, the eventual contraction of the
     inflationary process required the restoration of political stability
     and productive capacity, with the injection of massive foreign aid and
     the restriction of deficit financing by the central bank playing
     important roles. (Chapter 4, p.8)
                                        41

     Lin is persuasive in arguing that improvements in the real economy

have been unlikely to be long-lasting when attempted in a setting of rapid

inflation and large budget deficits. The analytical arguments in favor of

giving anti-inflationary policies a strong priority include the following:

(a) the damage to financial intermediation that occurs in a climate        of high

inflation, including bank failures, widespread disintermediation,      the

absence of financial instruments of long-term maturities, capital flight;

(b) the likelihood of major relative price distortions in an inflationary

environment; (c) the damage to tax    collection   and the public sector

finances; (d) the damage to real investment and financial      institutions as

governments implement increasingly onerous methods of collecting the

inflation tax (e.g., rising reserve requirements on banks); (e) the

likelihood of policy conflict and policy inconsistency in management of the

exchange rate to meet both trade and inflation targets; (f)      the high

transactions costs that are incurred as individuals and firms economize on

monetary transactions; and (g) the ever-present fear of the public that

major new tax increases or capital levies will be used in order to close

 large public sector deficits. Such fears will constrain the private sector

 from making the real investment expenditures necessary for a successful

 liberalization in the longer term.



 VI. Conclusions: Towards an ImDroved Use of Conditionality

      We have noted that the efficacy of conditionality is inherently

 limited, and that the current overhang of debt greatly complicates the

 situation. In cases of extreme indebtedness, the debt itself might set up

 incentives that are adverse to significant adjustment or liberalization.
                                           42

 In such a case, partial debt forgiveness can actually raise the expected

 repayments to the creditors, while at the same time giving greater

 incentive to the country for favorable adjustment. To be most successful,

 combining debt relief with IMF-World Bank conditionality would enhance the

 likelihood that the debt relief actually turns into economic reform.

         The historical experience with liberalization alone, and with

 stabilization alone, are not very encouraging. The difficulties of

 combining the two policy initiatives are formidable. The historical record

 suggests that it is virtually impossible to bring inflation under control,

 while simultaneously trying to liberalize the economy. One is hard pressed

 to find an example of an economy which stabilized, liberalized, and

 improved the external position all at the same time. Only Korea,
                                                                         Brazil,
 and Indonesia seem to provide examples of implementing the first     two

 measures, and in those cases the programs were supported by a
                                                                   strong
military government that substantially reduced real wages (at least in

Brazil and South Korea) at the outset of the programs, and favorable world

conditions, including growing world trade, and after a few years, access to

foreign borrowing in significant amounts.

     These findings suggest that the 11fF and World Bank should
                                                                   recognize
the limited efficacy of conditionality. The following list of guidelines

for the use of conditionality in future lending by the 11fF and the World

Bank would increase the chances of success for LDC adjustment programs and

improve the effectiveness of conditionality:

     -
          approve fewer programs;
     -
          require   more prior actions in cases where the efficacy of the

conditionality is doubtful;
                                      43

     -
         encourage governments to enlist the necessary range of political
                                                            before the
support behind the terms of a high-conditionality program

program is finalized;

     -
         approve programs which allow a buildup of arrears to private
creditors in cases where the private creditors:   (a) fail to grant debt

relief; and (b) fail to provide sufficient amounts of new financing;

     -
         encourage the use of debt relief schemes as a way to enhance the
likely adherence to conditionality terms;

     -   narrow the goals of conditionality: put macroeconomic
stabilization as the first step, with structural reform to be implemented

only as macroeconomic stability is restored.

                                     Appendix A

                        A Formal Analysis of Conditionality


       The model in this appendix provides a
                                                  very simple illustration of the
 function of conditionality in international lending.         Suppose that there
 are two periods (t —   1,2),   and that a government of a small economy faces

 an allocation problem of consunption and investment. In the first period,

 the government can consume (C1) or invest
                                               1 resources, subject to the
 budget constraint that total spending,
                                           C1 + Il must equal domestic output
 (Q1) plus borrowing from abroad (D1). The foreign loans carry an interest

 rate r, so that repayments due in the second period
                                                          are (l+r)D1. Output in
 the second period is a function of investment in the first. As a simple

 illustration, I assume a linear technology, with         —     +   (l+g)11, and
 also assume that investment opportunities
                                               are bounded by I s I. The
 utility function is U —
                           C1 + C2/(l+d), where d is the rate of pure time

 preference. For purposes of illustration, I assume that we have the

 following relative parameter values: d > g > r. With this
                                                                    ordering,
 investments are profitable when evaluated at world
                                                        interest rates, but not
worthwhile when evaluated according to the subjective rate of time

discount d.

       I assume that the country repays all of its
                                                       foreign borrowing,
subject to the constraint that C2      0. If the debt is      so large that full
repayment would require C2 C 0, then the country pays as much as possible,

suspends further repayments, and consumes 0 in the second period. Under

conditions of certainty, the lenders will ration credit such that

D1   Q2/(1+r). Of course C2 — 0 should be taken figuratively. The model

is virtually unchanged if the
                                 consumption constraint is C2       M where M is
                                         45

some minimum   level   of consumption, based on political or economic

constraints. Also, C2 implicitly refers only to tradeable goods (since

only those goods can be used to finance debt servicing).       With C2 = 0 or

     M, there could still be positive levels of nontradeables consumption.
C2
However, to introduce nontradeable goods at this point would unnecessarily

complicate the model.

      Now, to see the role of conditionality, suppose that private lenders

must make loans before the country chooses the level of investment in the

first period, while the IMF or the World Bank, to the contrary, can

condition a loan on a particular level of investment.        The private-sector

creditor must determine how much investment the country will make once a
                                                               Q2/(l+r) ties the
loan is received, since the safe lending constraint D1

sustainable debt        to the level of Q2.
                                                                            will
      It is easy to verify that for any level of debt D1, the country

always prefer a zero level of investment, as long as we have the inequality

                                                               of investment
that d > g. The reason is straightforward: an increment

reduces welfare by 1 in the first period and raises it in the second period

by (l+g)/(l+d) in terms of first period goods.      Therefore, the welfare

return from an increment of investment is negative.         Since the country will

                                                              for the commercial
 choose I 0, Q2 will equal Q1, and the lending limit

banks is given by Q1/(l+r).
       It may be possible for the Fund or the Bank     to   lend more than this

 safely, if the new loans can be conditioned on investment expenditure.

 Suppose that the World Bank or the IMF can obtain a credible commitment of

 the country to invest 0 < II      I in return for a stabilization or

 adjustment loan. In such a case, the country will be able to support total
                                        46

foreign borrowing in the amount [Q1 +
                                        (l+g)11]/(l+r),   which is

(l+g)11/(l+r) greater than in the absence of the program. Will the country

agree to such a program? The answer is clearly yes, since first-period

consumption rises by (l+g)11/(l+r) -
                                       Il    and second-period consumption is

unchanged (since the rise in income (l+g)11, equals the increase in debt

servicing).

      It is not necessary, in this scenario, for the World Bank or the 11fF

to actually make the conditionality loan in the amount
                                                           (l+g)11/(l+r). In
principle, any smaller loan should attract additional private resources to

make up the difference. The Fund or the Bank is important only in the

"seal of good housekeeping" role rather than as a supplier of funds.

                                     Appendix B

                            A Model of Debt Forgiveness


     To see how a given stock of debt can interfere with conditionality,

let us return to the simple two-period model presented in Appendix A. We

now amend the model in two important ways. First, the utility function is

written in general form as as U — U(C1,C2), with the standard concavity

conditions. Second, we assume that as of the first period, there is an

existing stock of debt, inherited from the past and due in the second

period. Let D be the legal amount due in the second period (interest plus

principal), and let S denote the actual debt servicing in that period (S

may be a stochastic variable as of the first period).       The creditors might,

we shall see, be willing to forgive some of the debt as of the first

period, in which case we denote the post-forgiveness amount due as N..

Thus, with D >   N.,
                       there is some formal forgiveness of the debt as of the

first period, and with N. >     5,   there is a partial default in the second

period (since as of the second period, N. is due and only S is actually

repaid). The production technology is as before: Q2 — Q1 +        (l+g)1t,
11   I.
     Suppose that the country is cut off from the world capital markets by

virtue of the preexisting stock of debt D, or by virtue of its general lack

of creditworthiness, and ignore conditionality lending for the moment.          All

investment therefore comes from internal savings. We assume as before that

as of the second period the country repays as much of the foreign debt as

 it can. If savings and consumption allocations are made by a central
                                                 48

 planner, then the planner's problem is:

      max U(C1,C2) such that              C1 —        -
       Ii                                 C2 — Q2(11)     -    S

                                           S —   min(R, Q2)

      The creditors have a corresponding problem. Should
                                                                             they demand full

 repayment of the debt D, or should they agree as of the first period to

 forgive part of the debt, and to demand a smaller repayment R < D ?

 Assuming that the creditor "moves first" by announcing the debt
                                                                                    decision,
 and that the debtor country thereafter solves the optimal allocation

 problem, the creditor must solve the following:


      max S such that R S          D and that S is the solution to the
      R                              debtor problem given above


 In words, the debtor chooses the repayment level R that maximizes actual

 debt servicing, 5, subject to the constraint that R be less than or equal

 to the original debt, D.

      As noted in the text, it might seem, and it is often argued as if,

the creditor should simply hold out for the maximum repayment D, and take

whatever he can get in the second period. Such
                                                               a strategy, however, can be
improved upon.

      Consider the debtor's problem, taking R as a parameter. For low

values of R, the debtor will repay everything, since
                                                                        it will turn out that
R < Q2UP. Thus, the allocation problem becomes one of maximimizing

U(C1,C2) such that C1 =        -         and C2 —              -   R.

then sets (l+g)        (l+d)U'(Q1-11)/U'[Q2(11) -   R].    It is then easy to verify

that II is an increasing function of R in this rsnge.           In a sense, high

                                                                         knows that
debt repayments are a spur to adjustment. The social planner

there is a big reduction to real cash flow next period, because of the debt

repayment, and therefore he smooths consumption across periods by saving

today and investing more in order to raise second-period output.

       For large values of R, however, it will be the case that R > Q2(11)
                                                                                        -

 level of utility U*. The country's utility can never

 C2
        —   01 — Q1.
        The key point from the creditor's point of view is that actual

 repayments S will fall when R increases above R*,          since investment Il falls
                                             50

  to zero. The resource base from which the country makes debt repayments

  shrinks, so that actual repayments decline. Thus, for R                 R*,   we have
  S — R; for R >   R*, we have S < R* < R.
       Now let us return to the creditor's problem. For
                                                                    levels of debt D
 less than the threshhold R*, it is clear that the creditors should hold out

 for full repayment. Indeed, the higher the level of the debt, the greater

 will be the "adjustment" in the debtor
                                             country, with adjustment measured by
 the amount of first period investment.
                                              However, for D > R*. it is a
 mistake to hold out for full repayment. The
                                                      creditors will get more
 repayment by agreeing in the first period to lower the required debt

 repayments in second! Forgiving debt can be to the advantage of the

 creditors, by spurring investment in the debtor country, and thereby

 spurring the means of the debtor to service the debt.

        The two-period model just explored lends itself to a standard

 diagramnatic analysis, as in Figure 1. As usual, the X-axis measures

production and consumption in the first period, and the Y-axis measures

production and consumption in the second period.           Note that since

 forgiveness could leave gft         the    country and the creditors better off than

 at point E.

        It might be objected that the foregoing model is artificial, in that

 it establishes a zone in which a high external debt level makes

 second-period investment completely worthless from the country's point of

view. To see a more nuanced view, we could use the model of default and

 debt renegotation in Sachs and Cohen (1985). Suppose that if the country

 defaults, the retaliation penalty from the creditors is a fraction h of

national GDP. Thus, if the country repays the debt due, second period

consumption is        -
                           R.   If instead it defaults, it saves repayments R, but

suffers a loss of CDP equal to hQ2, so that second period consumption would

be C2    (l-h)Q2. Clearly, the country would find default attractive
whenever R >              Finally, suppose that in lieu of default cum
               hQ2.
retaliation, we can assume that in the second period if R >                        the
                                                                            hQ2,
creditors and debtor reach a cooperative outcome such that the debtors pay

a fraction of the repayment due, in the amount hQ2, and the creditors                    agree
to forego any further retaliation.

     In this case, the debtor's problem can be restated as follows:

     max U(C1,C2)          such that C1 —            -


                                            —               -S
                                       C2
                                        S —     mm
                                                         [R, (l-h)Q2(11)]

In this case, the marginal return to investment in the zone in which debt

is fully repaid is simply (l+g). On the other hand, in the region in which

debt is not fully repaid, the marginal return to investment is (l-h)(l+g).

The overhang of debt now imposes a marginal tax of h percent on the social
                                      53

return to investment. Once again, it is easy to show that explicit debt

relief can in fact raise the creditors' eventual repayments,   and can spur

"adjustment" (i.e. investment) in the debtor country, by eliminating the

implicit "marginal tax" on the returns to investment.

                      The Interaction of Debt Relief and Conditionalit1


       In this appendix, we combine the models of Appendix A and Appendix B,

 to illustrate the case in which the combination of
                                                             conditionality and debt
 relief is both necessary and sufficient for raising the welfare of both

 creditors and debtors.

      For convenience, we work with the case of linear utility and linear

 technology. The government objective function is given as:

      u —         +
             C1       C2/(l-i-d)

 Production in period 2 is given as:



     Q2—Q1+(l+gn1                  IlI.
There is an initial overhang of debt in the second period D2, with

D2 > Q1     +     (l+g)   I.

     In the absence of debt relief, the
                                               government will undertake zero
investment spending in the first period.
                                                   Moreover, the country would not
agree to any binding package of new official lending c
                                                                 conditionality if
the official lenders were financing
                                           anything less than 100 percent of the
investment. Suppose that a share s of the investment could be financed

with an IMF-World Bank loan. Then initial
                                                   consumption would fall by
(l-s) *
          Ii,,    i.e. by'the amount not financed externally. Future consumption

would not rise at all, however, since after repayment to the IMF -
                                                                           World
Bank, and partial repayment to the original
                                                    creditors, nothing would be
left over for the country.
                                           55

     Next, suppose that there is debt relief alone, without the involvement

of the official institutions. Suppose, for example, that the debt is

reduced to the level Q1. Then, the country will surely repay the remaining

debt in the second period. However, it will still choose to do no

investment spending, as long as the rate of time discount, d, is greater

than the return to investment, g. Moreover, in the absence of

conditionality, it would not be safe to make new loans to the country even

after the debt is written down to Q1, since the country will use the loans

for consumption, and not for investment.

     Now, suppose that the debt relief is combined with a high-

conditionality loan, in the following manner. The country undertakes to

make investment ll with the share s to be financed by the IMF-World Bank.

The initial debt is reduced to           + e, where e is a small amount. First

period consumption falls by (l-s) Il and second period output rises by

(l-i-g)11. Second-period consumption now rises        in the amount (l+g)l1 - s

(l+r) I - e, which will surely be positive as long as e is sufficiently
small. (Note that the rise in consumption equals the rise in output, minus

the repayment to the IMF, minus the increment e in repayment to the

original creditors above the level Q1). Now, as long as the rate of time

discount d is sufficiently small or the share of IMF-World Bank financing

 is sufficiently large, then the overall effect on the government's

 objective function is positive. Specifically, the condition for an

 improvement in the government's objective function is:


                               -   s Il (l+r) -   e]/(l+d) >   0
      -(1-s) Il +   [(l+g)11
                                         56

Since g >   r,   and e is close to 0.0, the condition in (C.3) is surely

satisfied for s very close to 1.0, or d very close to 0.0, and may well be

satisfied for intermediate values of s and d.
