                                              ABSTRACT

We investigate the relationship between economic growth and lagged international capital flows, disaggregated
into FDI, portfolio investment, equity investment, and short-term debt. We follow about 100 countries
during 1990-2010 when emerging markets became more integrated into the international financial
system. We look at the relationship both before and after the global crisis. Our study reveals a complex
and mixed picture. The relationship between growth and lagged capital flows depends on the type
of flows, economic structure, and global growth patterns. We find a large and robust relationship between
FDI – both inflows and outflows – and growth. The relationship between growth and equity flows
is smaller and less stable. Finally, the relationship between growth and short-term debt is nil before
the crisis, and negative during the crisis.

1 Introduction

 The global financial and economic crisis of 2008-2009 marks an opportune time to re-

visit the issue of international financial integration. The crisis raised the possibility that

integration among advanced economies went too far, reinvigorating the debate about the

desirability of a laissez-faire approach towards financial integration. The heavy exposure

of European financial institutions to assets associated with sub-prime US mortgages

largely explains Europe’s financial havoc and subsequent recession. Going forward, the

specter of large and volatile capital flows is raising concerns in emerging markets about

their adverse and destabilizing impact on financial stability and economic growth.

Emerging markets’ more robust recovery from the crisis and their stronger long-term

growth prospects are the fundamental drivers of such capital flows. Episodes of financial

and economic distress related to capital flows – e.g. Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 –

and relative under-development of their financial systems further heighten such concerns.

 At a broader level, the relationship between financial openness and economic growth is

the subject of heated controversy. In contrast to the largely positive perception of trade

integration, economists differ sharply about the effect of financial integration on growth.

In principle, access to foreign savings can promote investment and growth in recipient

countries, and access to a wider range of investment opportunities can contribute to more

efficient investments and thus growth in the source countries. In practice, however, the

international historical experience fails to yield convincing evidence of a positive

relationship between financial integration and growth. To the contrary, countries such as

China have grown rapidly despite limited degree of financial integration. In addition,

even on purely theoretical grounds, financial integration may entail negative growth and




                                              1
welfare effects. Financial integration in the presence of distortions and externalities can

lead to sizable welfare costs in the worst case scenarios.1

    Integration of emerging markets into global financial markets is a relatively recent

phenomenon. Financial integration among advanced countries took off and progressed

rapidly since the end of the Bretton Woods system. Some emerging markets which were

financially more open suffered financial instability. For example, Latin America suffered

a severe foreign debt crisis which had a protracted impact on growth. However, by and

large emerging markets maintained varying degrees of restrictions on their capital

accounts until the early 1990s. In a remarkable turnaround since that time, emerging

markets joined the global trend towards financial integration, although at a more

controlled pace than the headlong rush of advanced economies. Figures 1a and 1b show

the evolution of de jure and de facto financial integration. The embrace of financial

integration by emerging markets followed the Washington Consensus of the early 1990s,

which called for opening up to international trade and capital flows.

                                               [Figure 1a]

                                               [Figure 1b]

    In recent decades, faster growth in emerging markets has been associated with

improvements in the current account balance. Japan, China, Korea and other countries

experienced sizable increases in their saving rates shortly after their successful take-offs,

and the increases were large enough to induce sizable current account surpluses. This

financial integration in the presence of distortions, McKinnon and Pill (1996) for the role of expectations,

Gourinchas and Jeanne (2006) report that measured welfare gains from switching from financial autarky to
perfect capital mobility are negligible relative to the potential welfare gain of a takeoff in domestic
productivity of the magnitude observed in some of the emerging markets.

anomaly casts doubt on the view that scarcity of savings to finance investment is the

main obstacle to growth. Indeed investment and growth in emerging markets seems to be,

on average, more or less self-financed.2 These stylized facts imply that even if there were

sizable gains from financial integration, they are not primarily due to access to the pool of

global saving. Yet self-financed growth does not rule out gains from risk diversification,

though these gains may be limited by the home bias observed in portfolio choices.

Furthermore, there is the possibility that selective types of capital flows may be

associated with large welfare gains.

    In fact, in light of the heterogeneous nature of capital flows, it may not be sensible to

lump them together in investigating the impact of capital flows on economic growth. FDI

and portfolio equity investment are fundamentally different from each other since the

former is associated with ownership and control while the latter is not. Both are different

from foreign debt that creates liabilities which must be repaid. Therefore, there is no a

priori reason why different types of capital flows have the same effect on growth.

Furthermore, FDI has traditionally been viewed as more beneficial for growth than other

types of capital flows. In principle, by bringing in capital, technology and knowhow,

managerial skills, international marketing networks, and other assets, FDI can create jobs

and stimulate growth. At the other end, many economists blame foreign debt for causing

and exacerbating financial crises in emerging markets.3




2  Prasad, Rajan, and Subramanian (2007) found that non-industrial countries that have relied more on
foreign finance have not grown faster in the long run. Thus, additional financing in excess of domestic
savings is the channel through via financial integration may have limited benefits. Looking at the
contribution of the current account towards financing growth, Aizenman, Pinto and Radziwill (2007)
conclude that most of the economic growth of developing and emerging markets was self-financed.
3
  According to Bordo, Meissner and Stuckler (2010), foreign debts are widely believed to have contributed
substantially to the Mexican tequilia crisis, Russian rouble crisis and Asian financial crisis.




                                                   3
    The global crisis of 2008-2009 has rekindled the debate about the desirability of

financial integration in both advanced economies and emerging markets. The crisis thus

provides strong fresh impetus for empirically revisiting the relationship between

international capital flows and economic growth. To do so, we look at macro data for

1990-2010, a period which encompasses growing financial integration of emerging

markets, low volatility associated with the Great Moderation in advanced economies, and

the global financial crisis. More specifically, we investigate the relationship between

economic growth and lagged international capital flows, disaggregated into FDI, portfolio

investment, equity investment, and short-term debt, in about 100 countries. Our central

objective is to look for systematic patterns in the relationship between capital flows and

growth during a period of financial integration. In addition, we compare the pre-crisis

period, 2000-2005, with the immediate pre-crisis and the crisis period, 2006-2010.4

    The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the empirical

literature on the relationship between international capital flows and economic growth.

Section 3 describes the data used for our own empirical analysis of the relationship

between capital flows and growth. Section 4 reports and discusses the key findings of our

empirical analysis. Section 5 brings the paper to a close with concluding observations.

2 Literature Review of the Relationship Between Capital Flows and Growth

    While the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 marks an opportune time to re-examine

the impact of international capital flows on economic growth, a large number of

empirical studies have already explored the issue. Overall, the empirical literature yields

a complex and mixed picture about the relationship between capital flows and growth.

4
  By doing so, we try to identify possible structural changes in the relationship between capital flows and
growth due to the global crisis, even though it is premature to draw inferences about the long run impact of
the crisis on financial integration.




                                                     4
The balance of evidence does not conclusively support either a positive or negative

impact of capital flows – both collectively and its different components such as FDI – on

growth. In this section, we provide a brief review of the empirical literature.

 In a comprehensive study, Reinhart and Reinhart (2008) analyze capital inflow

bonanzas in 181 countries during 1960-2007. They find that for emerging markets, such

bonanzas are associated with higher likelihood of financial and economic crisis. Bussiere

and Fratzscher (2008) notes that no empirical evidence has yet emerged for the existence

of robust positive relationship between financial openness and growth. Using a dataset of

45 advanced economies and emerging markets for 1980-2002, they find that financial

openness may promote growth in the short run, but not in the medium to long run. Klein

and Olivei (2008) find significant and positive effect of open capital accounts on

financial depth and economic growth in a cross-section of countries over the periods

1986-1995 and 1976-1995. Countries with open capital accounts experienced greater

financial deepening and more rapid growth. Using a dataset of 57 non-OECD countries

during 1975-1995, Chanda (2005) finds a negative effect of capital controls on growth.

  Choong et al (2010) empirically investigate the effect of three different types of private

capital flows on economic growth in 51 recipient developed and developing countries

during 1988-2002. They find that FDI has a positive impact on growth, while both

foreign debt and portfolio investment have a negative impact on growth. Kose, Prasad

and Terrones (2009) assess the impact of financial openness on a key component of

economic growth – productivity growth. They find strong evidence that FDI and portfolio

equity inflows boost TFP growth while foreign debt is negatively correlated with TFP

growth. Durham (2004) examines the effect of lagged FDI and lagged equity foreign




                                              5
portfolio investment (EFPI) on economic growth using data on 80 countries from 1979

through 1998. Their results do not support a positive effect of either FDI or EFPI on

growth. At the same time, they find evidence that the effect of both FDI and EFPI on host

countries depend on their financial and institutional development.

 Using data from 50 countries during 1988-2001, Ferreira and Laux (2009) find a

positive relationship between portfolio capital flows in both advanced economies and

emerging markets. Outflows into US securities markets, and both inflows into and

outflows from local equity markets, enhance economic growth. Durham (2003)

investigates the impact of foreign portfolio investment (FPI) and other foreign investment

(OFI) on economic growth using data from 88 countries during 1977-2000. Their results

indicate that FPI has no effect on growth and OFI, which consists largely of foreign bank

lending, has a negative effect. Blair (2003) evaluates 18 episodes of stock market

liberalization in emerging markets, and finds that opening up stock markets to foreign

participants lowers the costs of capital, and raises the growth rate of the capital stock and

the growth rate of output per workers. In a similar vein, using data for 94 countries for

1950-2004, Quinn and Toyoda (2008) find that equity market liberalization has a positive

effect on growth.

 According to Bordo, Meissner and Stuckler (2010), foreign currency debt is widely

believed to increase risks of financial crisis, especially after being blamed as a cause of

the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998. They study the effects of foreign currency debt

on currency and debt crises and its indirect effects on short-term growth and long-run

output effects in both 1880–1913 and 1973–2003 for 45 countries. They find that greater

ratios of foreign currency debt to total debt are associated with heightened risks of




                                             6
currency and debt crises, which lead to significant permanent output losses. Reinhart and

Reinhart (2008) find that expansion of foreign debt during capital inflow bonanzas raises

the probability of financial and economic crisis. Lin and Sosin (2001) examine the

relationship between government foreign debt and growth rate of per capita GDP based

on a total sample of 77 countries for 1970-1992. They find that foreign debt has a

negative effect for the whole sample but is not always significant.

    Contessi and Weinberger (2009) review the empirical literature that studies the

relationship between FDI, productivity and growth using aggregate data. They conclude

that the plethora of studies fails to yield a consensus on whether FDI is beneficial or

harmful for economic growth. Despite widespread claims in the policy literature about

positive spillovers from FDI to the economy, the empirical evidence is mixed. Using data

on FDI inflows from advanced economies to 69 emerging markets during 1970-1989,

Borensztein, De Gregorio and Lee (1998) finds that FDI increases economic growth

when the level of education of the host country is high. This suggests that absorptive

capacity influences the effectiveness of FDI.5 Their findings were challenged by

Carkovic and Levine (2002), who conclude that FDI inflows do not exert an independent

influence on growth. In a similar vein, attempts to identify positive spillovers associated

with FDI yield conflicting evidence [Lipsey and Sjöholm (2004)].

3 Data

    In this section, we describe the data set we use for our empirical analysis. Our panel

data covers over one hundred countries observed over the years 1990-2010. The sample

has some missing data for some time periods and countries, and is therefore unbalanced.


5
  Alguacil, Cuadros and Ortis (2011) also find that the macroeconomic and institutional environment
influences the effect of inward FDI.




                                                7
Since our objective lies in studying the impact of different types of capital flows on

output growth, our panel data set contains variables related to the growth rates of GDP

per capita and capital flows. Our main variables include real GDP per capita, initial GNI

per capita, private credit-GDP ratio, education, measures of exchange stability and

monetary independence, and the amounts of different types of capital flows. Besides

GDP, we also consider consumption, investment, government spending, exports, and

imports as an alternative set of growth measures. The five types of capital flows we study

are FDI inflow, FDI outflow, portfolio investment, equity investment, and short-term

debt. The data series are described in more detail in the Data Appendix.

    To give an overview of the capital flow patterns over the decade, Figures 2a-2d provide

a bar chart of the sample, calculated as an average over the 5-year periods – i.e. 1991-95,

1996-2000, 2001-06, and 2006-10 – of the net capital flows, as % of GDP, across

different regions.6 One noticeable pattern is an increase in net FDI in all regions. Among

the three types of capital flows, the increase in net FDI flows is the largest and the most

persistent trend during the last two decades, inclusive of the crisis period. As % GDP, the

growth of FDI inflows has been largest in the Middle East & North Africa, followed by

Europe and Central Asia, South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia and the Pacific, and

Latin America and the Caribbean. On the other hand, the growth of portfolio inflows and

equity investment are much smaller as % GDP than the FDI flows. The large and

persistent increase in net FDI relative to other types of flows, and the earlier literature

attributing sizable growth effects to lagged FDI inflows induces us to separately examine


6
  The construction of each bars is as follows. First, we keep only countries with the non-missing data for
FDI, portfolio and equity investment over the periods considered; this amounts to 105 countries. Second,
the capital flow measures and GDP are separately averaged over the 5-year periods. Finally, the averaged
capital flow is divided by the averaged GDP for the corresponding period.




                                                    8
FDI inflows and FDI outflows.7 Figure 2e plots the patterns of inflows during four sub-

periods. The figure vividly shows the rapid expansion of FDI inflows to developing

countries, and a less dramatic increase in FDI inflows to high income countries. It also

shows the growth of FDI outflows from emerging markets.

                                             [Figure 2a]

                                             [Figure 2b]

                                             [Figure 2c]

                                             [Figure 2d]

                                             [Figure 2e]

    For the 2001-05 and 2006-10 periods, Figure 3 shows a scatter plot of the data on the

growth rates of GDP per capita and the growth rates of capital flows. In the top half, a

point in this scatter plot represents the growth rate of GDP per capita from 2001-2005 to

2006-2010 and the growth rate of FDI inflow for a given region. The correlation between

these two variables is 0.36. We re-do the scatter plot for the growth rate of equity

investment in the bottom half of Figure 3. Similar to the scatter plot for FDI inflow, the

correlation between the growth rate of GDP per capita and the growth rate of equity

investment is 0.36. Taken literally, higher growth of capital flows is associated with

higher GDP per capita growth over this 10-year period.

                                              [Figure 3]

    However, we cannot conclude that an increase in the FDI inflow and/or an increase in

the equity investment leads to more growth because these associations could have

significant omitted variable bias. Table 1 reports summary statistics of many factors that


7
  Our data sources report the inflows and outflows of FDI, but only the net flows of equity and portfolio
flows.




                                                   9
can affect the growth rate of GDP per capita. Note that the choice of time periods: 1990-

96, 1997-2003, 2004-10, is chosen in order to average out the cross-country business

cycles as well as to have a time-balanced sample. As this can be considered arbitrary, our

regression analysis also divide the 2001-2010 period into two 5-year periods – 2001-05

and 2006-10 periods. The former represents the years prior the global financial crisis, and

the latter the crisis period. Still, there might be other time-invariant factors that may be

correlated with the growth of capital flows, leading to omitted variable bias. This leads us

to perform additional analysis using panel data analysis of the annual observations. We

use both cross-sectional regressions and the fixed-effects estimation to analyze the

growth-capital flows relationship.

                                         [Table 1]

4 Empirical Results

 In this section, we report and discuss the main results which emerge from our empirical

analysis. The first sub-section reports the results of the baseline estimation, and the

second sub-section reports the results of estimations which compare the pre-global crisis

period – 2001-2005 – and the global crisis period – 2006-2010.

4.1 Baseline Estimation

 The baseline results are presented in the cross-country estimation of Table 2. We keep

the analysis informative and simple, using the estimating equation given by: ΔYi = β0 +

β1ΔYi(t-1) + ΔX'iβ + Δei; where Y is GDP/capita, X is a vector of controls, β is a vector of

coefficients to be estimated, and e the error terms. Each column reports a different

regression by type of capital flow measures, and each row reports a coefficient estimate

and robust standard error, together with the R2 and the number of countries. Our main




                                            10
interest lies in the effect of capital flows and their interaction with other controls. Column

(1) presents results for the OLS regression of the growth rate of GDP per capita on the

growth rate of FDI inflow, other controls, and interaction terms. The coefficients on the

interaction variables - increase in exchange rate stability x growth of FDI inflow and

increase in monetary independence x growth of FDI inflow - are both positive and

statistically significant. In Column (2), the coefficients on the growth of FDI outflow, the

interaction variables - increase in exchange rate stability x growth of FDI outflow, and

increase in monetary independence x growth of FDI outflow - are all positive and

statistically significant. According to these estimates, FDI flows - both inflow and

outflow – has a positive effect on GDP per capita, and the positive effect becomes larger

with exchange rate stability and monetary independence.

  In contrast, the coefficients on the growth of portfolio investment in Column (3) and the

growth of equity investment in Column (4) are negative and statistically insignificant.

This suggests that non-FDI flows have no discernible effect on the growth of GDP/capita

in a cross section of countries over our sample period. For the analysis of columns (1) –

(4), the estimated R2 suggests that our regressions account for a third of variation in the

data. In addition, the standard macro controls included are statistically significant with

expected signs. The growth rate of GDP per capita is persistent - the lagged dependent is

positive and statistically significant. There is a cross-country convergence - the variable

initial GNI per capita is negative. Financial depth leads to higher growth - the variable

private credit/GDP is positive. Education is good for growth - the variable education is

positive and statistically significant.




                                             11
 We summarize the economic significance of each variable in Figure 4. Based on the

estimates of Columns (1) and (2) in Table 2, we multiply each coefficient with a sample

standard deviation of the corresponding variable. To illustrate, for the growth of private

credit/GDP variable, the average coefficient of columns (1) and (2) is 0.13, multiplying

this by the standard deviation of private credit/GDP growth yields the economic

significance of 0.13 x 26.63 = 3.46. That is, increasing the growth of private credit/GDP

by one standard deviation increases the growth rate of GDP/capita by 3.46 percentage

points. Figure 4 sorts all variables by their economic significance. The growth of FDI

outflows, and the interaction of the growth of FDI flows – inflows and outflows – with

improvement in exchange rate stability and monetary independence have the largest

positive effect on the growth rate of GDP per capita. Initial GNI per capita has a large

negative effect, implying strong convergence between rich and poor countries.

                                        [Figure 4]

                                         [Table 2]

 In Table 3, we report additional results using the same set of sample to regress the

growth rates of consumption, investment, government spending, exports, and imports, all

as % of GDP. Positive effects - individual effect and interaction effect - of FDI flows can

be detected in the regressions of consumption, government spending, exports - FDI

inflow - and imports - FDI outflow. Consistent with our findings on GDP per capita

growth, we do not find a significant effect of portfolio inflow and equity investment on

these additional set of dependent variables.

                                         [Table 3]




                                               12
4.2 Pre-Global Crisis Period Versus Global Crisis Period

 It would be interesting to perform our empirical analysis for the pre-global crisis period

and the global crisis period for a cross section and for a panel of annual observations. In

Table 4, we divide the sample into two 5-year periods: the pre-crisis years of 2001-05 and

the crisis years of 2006-10. The format of the table is the same as that of Table 2. At the

cost of smaller sample of countries, we add a new variable - state fragility - as a measure

of weak institutional environment, and replace contemporaneous capital flows with their

lagged values. For the growth-capital flow association, we find some changes, albeit

small, when we estimate the pre-crisis period, as reported in Column (1) of Table 4. An

exception is that an improvement in the level of education is no longer significant. A

decline in state fragility, and increases in exchange rate stability and monetary

independence are all positively associated with higher growth of GDP/capita. Both

lagged FDI inflow in Column (1) and lagged equity investment in Column (2) have a

positive effect on GDP per capita. The coefficient of the interaction variable state

fragility x FDI inflow suggests that prior to the crisis, FDI had a positive effect on growth

in countries with weaker institutions.

                                          [Table 4]

 When we estimate the cross-country regression for the crisis years of 2006-10 in

Columns (3) and (4), the association between growth and lagged growth, initial

GNI/capita, and private credit/GDP remain significant as in the pre-crisis period.

Individually, the effects of FDI and equity investment on growth disappear in the crisis

period. However, the coefficient of the interaction variable [state fragility x capital inflow

measure] suggests that institutionally weak countries could still benefit from FDI inflows,




                                             13
but not the equity investment, in the crisis period. We note that dividing the sample into

non-crisis and crisis years improves the R2 by 20-40 percent. For the crisis years, our

estimation accounts for 70 percent of variation in the data.

 Finally, we verify our results for a panel of annual observations. The next six

regressions in Table 5 include the time-invariant country effects. The estimating

specification is given by: ΔYit = i + β0 + β1ΔYit-1 + ΔX'itβ + Δeit; where, as before, Y is

GDP per capita, X is a vector of controls, β is a vector of coefficients to be estimated, and

e the error terms. i is a fixed effect. This specification is comparable to a random growth

model of GDP per capita, i.e. a country-specific time effect is included in a panel of Yit

and Xit. Subject to data availability, we now also consider the short-term external debt to

GDP ratio as another measure of hot capital flow. In terms of the growth-capital flow

association, in Table 5, the pre-crisis panel estimation, reported in Columns (1) – (3),

yields a similar pattern to the cross-country estimation. Both lagged FDI inflow and

lagged equity investment have a positive effect on GDP per capita. On the contrary, there

is no growth effect from the short-term debt flow. The coefficient of the interaction

variable [state fragility x FDI inflow] suggests that for the years 2001-05 prior to the

crisis, institutionally weak countries could benefit from the growth acceleration effect of

FDI inflow. The positive effects of FDI inflow and its interaction with good institution

are therefore quite robust in the pre-crisis period.

                                          [Table 5]

 During the crisis period, the coefficient estimates in Columns (4) and (5) suggest that

the associations between the growth of GDP per capita on one hand and FDI and equity

investment on the other hand remain positive and significant. Note, however, that the




                                              14
effect of equity investment was not significant in the cross-sectional estimation. The

coefficient of the interaction variable [state fragility x short-term debt] in Column (6)

indicates that during the crisis period of 2006-10, countries with weaker institutions

suffered more from short-term external debt. The effects of several macro controls have

become unstable in the panel estimation. Nonetheless, our main findings on the positive

growth effect of FDI and its interaction variables from the cross-sectional estimation in

Tables 2-4 are similar to those of the panel regressions in Table 5. A look at economic

significance in Figure 5 confirms that short term debt had a sizable negative impact on

growth in the crisis period but no impact in the non-crisis period.

                                         [Figure 5]

  Comparing the effects of capital flows on growth of GDP per capita in two emerging

markets gives us further insights. Table 6 reports the results of comparing Kazakhstan

and Thailand for the years 2002-09. These two emerging markets had a similar level of

GNI per capita in 2002. The FDI inflow-to-GDP ratio is relatively higher in Kazakhstan

throughout the decade. During the crisis years, short-term debt flow to Thailand rose

slightly whereas the flow to Kazakhstan declined. It is possible that Kazakhstan’s higher

exposure to FDI inflows lessened the impact of the global crisis relative to Thailand.

While Kazakhstan’s real GDP per capita fell by 0.2% in 2009, that of Thailand fell by

2.8%. On the other hand, the quality of institution is slightly higher in Thailand - the state

fragility score is 7 out of 25 scale - than in Kazakhstan - 10 out of 25 scale - yet their

observed growth rates are consistent with the interaction effect of FDI and quality of

institutions.

Concluding Remarks

 The issue of whether cross-border financial integration is beneficial or not has returned

to the forefront of the global economic agenda in the wake of the global crisis of 2008-

2009. A high degree of financial integration among the advanced economies helps to

explain the trans-Atlantic propagation of the US subprime crisis and its transformation

into the global financial and economic crisis. By the same token, the emerging markets’

relative lack of financial integration fortuitously shielded their financial systems from the

full impact of the crisis. Going forward, however, there are growing concerns in

emerging markets that large and volatile capital inflows will harm their financial systems

and real economies. Historical experience of capital inflow bonanzas which created short-

term booms but eventually led to crisis lend further weight to such concerns. It is against

this backdrop of increased wariness that policymakers in emerging markets are re-

considering the pros and cons of capital account liberalization in the post-crisis period.

 Therefore, the era of financial integration - especially among hitherto financially closed

emerging markets - which immediately preceded the global crisis and the global crisis

period is an opportune time to revisit the relationship between capital flows and

economic growth. On the whole, our study reveals a complex and mixed picture, where

the association between growth and lagged capital flows depends on the types of flows,

economic structure, and global patterns of growth. the pre-crisis and the post crisis data,

applying cross country and panel regressions. Overall, lagged FDI flows - inflow and

outflow- are associated with higher growth. This effect is economically large and robust

during the entire sample period, inclusive of the crisis period. The association between




                                             16
growth and lagged equity flows is smaller than, and not as stable as the association of

growth with FDI flows over the two decades. In contrast, the association of growth and

lagged short term debt is nil before the crisis, and negative and large during the crisis.

 Our empirical results thus provide some support for the popular perception that FDI is

more beneficial for growth than other types of inflows. They are also support our earlier

observation that in recent decades some fast-growing emerging markets, especially those

in East Asia, enjoyed current account surpluses. This stylized fact is inconsistent with the

notion that the main economic benefit of capital inflows is that they help to ease shortage

of savings and thus allows for greater investment and faster growth. This suggests that

the primary gain from financial integration is not access to pool of foreign savings but

instead access to other foreign factors of production. Much more than other forms of

capital inflows, FDI is bundled together with other factors which can promote growth

such as advanced foreign technology and knowhow. Another interesting result, especially

in light of the rising importance of emerging markets as sources of FDI, is that FDI

outflows too have a positive effect on growth.

 Our results are also supportive of the generally skeptical popular view about the

benefits of non-FDI capital inflows for economic growth. In contrast to FDI, portfolio

investment, equity investment, and short-term debt do not bring obvious benefits other

than access to foreign savings. Non-FDI capital inflows may bring important benefits to

some individual fast-growing developing countries. For example, Viet Nam runs a

sizable current account deficit – i.e. excess of investment over savings – which it finances

through both FDI and non-FDI capital inflows. Without those inflows, Viet Nam’s

investment rate and growth rate would be lower. However, for our sample of countries as




                                              17
a whole, portfolio and equity investment do not have a significant effect on growth. Our

results lend some support to the notion that short-term foreign debt can adversely affect

growth. Our finding that such adverse effect is likely to be more significant during crisis

and in countries with weaker institutions is intuitively plausible.

 At a broader level, the results of our empirical analysis of the capital flows-growth

nexus during an era of financial integration and crisis confirm the need to differentiate

between different types of capital flows. In line with the results of existing studies, our

evidence indicates that some types of capital flows are more beneficial for growth than

others. Although global financial integration since 1990 has taken the form of both FDI

and non-FDI capital flows, according to our analysis only FDI has a strong and robust

positive effect on growth. Our evidence suggests that the effects of capital flows may

differ between crisis and non-crisis periods. In particular, short term debt has no effect in

non-crisis period but a sizable adverse effect in crisis period.
