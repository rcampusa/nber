Was Jackson Pollock the Greatest Modern American Painter?
A Quantitative Investigation

NBER Working Paper No. 8830
March 2002



                                              ABSTRACT

        A survey of the illustrations in textbooks of modern art demonstrates that scholars do consider
Jackson Pollock the most important modern American painter, but not by a wide margin over Jasper
Johns and Andy Warhol, the leading artists of the following generation. The distribution of the
illustrations furthermore reveals a sharp contrast in the careers of the major artists of these two
generations: the Abstract Expressionists produced their most important contributions late in their careers,
whereas their successors innovated early in theirs. This difference resulted from the differing approaches
of the artists, for the Abstract Expressionists were experimental innovators, who developed new visual
images by a process of trial and error, while the leading artists of the 1960s were conceptual innovators,
whose work embodied new ideas.

       In August of 1949, Life magazine published a feature article titled “Jackson Pollock: Is

He the Greatest Living Painter in the United States?”1 The article was prompted by a growing

recognition that Pollock was the leader of a group of artists centered in New York who were

producing the most important new art of their time. The fame of Pollock, Willem de Kooning,

Mark Rothko, and others in the group continued to grow, so that by 1955, when William Seitz

completed the first major academic study of their art he concluded that it was nearly “impossible

to fully convey the degree to which Abstract Expressionism has become a universal style.”2

       In 1955, few in the art world could have predicted how quickly and how thoroughly

Abstract Expressionism would be eclipsed by new styles devised by younger artists. The new

styles did not belong to any single movement and differed greatly in appearance, but all were

clearly recognized as challenges to Abstract Expressionism. Thus from 1958 through the 1960s,

Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella, Andy Warhol, and a number of other young

artists emerged as the leaders of the new generation.

       Since the ‘60s, the influence of the new styles of that decade has grown. In view of this,

it is now of some interest to ask whether art historians’ assessments of the importance of the

Abstract Expressionists’ achievements have changed. In 1949, there was little doubt among

experts that Jackson Pollock was the greatest living American painter. More than 50 years later,

is he still considered the greatest artist from the extraordinary era when American painters

dominated the world of advanced art, or has his reputation been surpassed by one or more of the

leaders of the next generation?

       To answer this question, this study will survey the opinions of art historians about the

relative importance of the major American painters of this era. The evidence obtained from this
                                                  4

survey will not only allow us to gauge Pollock’s importance, but will also provide new insights

into the contrasts between the art of the Abstract Expressionists and that of their successors.

The Artists and the Evidence

       The goal in choosing the artists to be studied here was to select the most important

painters who lived and worked in the United States during the 1950s and ‘60s. This was done by

using ten textbooks on the history of modern art published since 1993.3 The first step was to list

all artists who had at least one painting reproduced in two or more of these ten books. The 29

artists on this list who were born in the US between 1900 and 1940 were placed in the sample, as

were another six artists on the list who were born elsewhere in the same period but spent most of

their careers in the US. The resulting sample of 35 painters is shown in Table 1.

       Textbooks of art history are also the source of the evidence analyzed in this study. This

evidence was drawn from all available books, published in English since 1980, that provide

illustrated surveys of at least the entire period under consideration here. A total of 56 such books

were found.4 The data set for this study was created by listing every reproduction of every work

of art shown in these books by all of the 35 artists in the sample.5

       Counting the illustrations contained in these 56 surveys of art history effectively allows

us to draw on the judgments of scores of art scholars concerning which painters, and paintings,

are judged most important. This approach is analogous to a citation study, in which the

importance of a book or article is measured by the number of citations it receives in a specified

set of books or journals. Yet using illustrations as the unit of analysis has the advantage that

these are substantially more costly then written references. In addition to the printing costs,

authors or publishers must usually pay for permission to reproduce each painting, and purchase
                                                    5

or rent a suitable photograph. The resulting cost in time and money implies that authors would

be more selective in their use of illustrations, and that illustrations may consequently provide a

better indication than written references of what an author considers genuinely important.6

Rankings: Painters and Paintings

       Table 2 presents the ranking of painters by total illustrations. Jackson Pollock leads the

list with 135 illustrations, an average of more than two per book. He is clearly identified as the

leading artist of his generation, with over 40% more illustrations than de Kooning and Rothko.

Interestingly, however, the three artists immediately following Pollock are all of the following

generation, and Pollock’s total illustrations are less than 10% greater than those of Jasper Johns.

Neither generation dominates the top of the ranking; thus the top ten positions are divided evenly

between the two cohorts.

       Table 3 ranks individual paintings by total illustrations. De Kooning’s Woman I is in first

place, but its success is not overwhelming, as it appears in considerably less than half of the

books, and leads Newman’s Vir Heroicus Sublimis by just one illustration. Table 3 is headed by

the same artists who dominate Table 2: all of the highest-ranked 11 paintings in Table 3, and 17

of the total of 21 works listed, were done by painters who were ranked in the top ten in Table 2.

Table 3 is also relatively evenly divided by generation, with nine paintings by artists born before

1920, and twelve by artists born after that date.

       An interesting contrast appears in Table 4, which gives the ages of the artists when they

executed the paintings listed in Table 3. This shows a striking difference by generation in the

artists’ ages. The median age at which the Abstract Expressionists executed their nine entries in

Table 3 was 40, compared to a median age of just 31 for the twelve entries of the next generation.
                                                  6

None of the nine paintings by the first generation was done by an artist under the age of 38, but

ten of the twelve works by the second generation were done by artists younger than that, and

fully half were made by artists aged 30 or younger.

Experimental and Conceptual Innovators

       Table 4 raises an intriguing question: why did the Abstract Expressionists produce their

most important paintings later in their lives than did the leading artists of the next generation?

The answer to this question follows from the recognition that the careers of the Abstract

Expressionists were systematically different from those of their successors. This difference is a

consequence of the differing ways the two groups of artists arrived at their principal

contributions.

       The Abstract Expressionists were experimental innovators. They worked by a process of

trial and error, motivated by aesthetic goals. They wished to create new visual representations of

emotions and states of mind, but in advance they had no precise conception of either the process

they should follow or what the results should look like. Their styles evolved as they worked, not

only from one painting to the next, but even in the process of making a single painting. Thus

Mark Rothko described his work as “a series of stumblings toward a clearer issue,” and he spent

long periods studying his paintings in progress, deciding how to continue: a biographer observed

that “since the late 1940s Rothko, building up his canvases with thin glazes of quickly applied

paint, had spent more time considering his evolving works than he had in the physical act of

producing them.”7 Like the other Abstract Expressionists, Rothko believed that progress only

came slowly, in small increments. He made his trademark image of stacked rectangles the basis

for hundreds of paintings over the course of two decades, explaining that “If a thing is worth
                                                  7

doing once, it is worth doing over and over again - exploring it, probing it.”8

       The absence of preconceived outcomes became a celebrated feature of Abstract

Expressionism. Jackson Pollock’s signature drip method of applying paint, with the inevitable

spattering and puddling that could not be completely controlled by the artist, became the most

familiar symbol of this lack of preconception, reinforced by Pollock’s often-quoted statement,

“When I am in my painting, I’m not aware of what I’m doing.”9 For the Abstract Expressionists,

creativity lay in the process of making their works, and preparation for individual paintings was

consequently of little importance. Barnett Newman explained that he was a “direct” painter: “I

have never worked from sketches, never planned a painting, never ‘thought out’ a painting

before.”10 In fact, since their goal was to draw on the unconscious to arrive at new images, the

Abstract Expressionists purposely avoided plans that would constrain them. Pollock explained

that “I don’t work from drawings, I don’t make sketches and drawings and color sketches into a

final painting. Painting, I think, today - the more immediate, the more direct - the greater the

possibilities of making a direct - of making a statement.”11 The form of the work would reveal

itself in the process of making it: Pollock declared that “I have no fears about making changes,

destroying the image, etc., because the painting has a life of its own. I try to let it come

through.”12

       Their lack of specific goals for their works meant that the Abstract Expressionists often

found it difficult to decide when a painting was finished. Nor did they necessarily consider this

an important issue. Newman in fact declared that “I think the idea of a ‘finished’ picture is a

fiction.”13 The absence of precise goals equally led the Abstract Expressionists to the recognition

that they would not typically consider their paintings successful. Willem de Kooning told an
                                                 8

interviewer that he considered his series of paintings of Women - which would come to be

generally considered his greatest achievement - a failure, but that that hadn’t fazed him,

explaining:

               I was never interested, you know, how to make a good painting.
               For many years I was not interested in making a good painting, you
               know, like you could say: now this is a really good painting or a
               perfect work. I didn’t want to pin it down at all. I was interested
               in that before, but I found out it was not my nature.14

       Unlike the Abstract Expressionists, the leading painters of the next generation did not

belong to any single group or movement. Yet they did share a common concern with replacing

the complexity of Abstract Expressionist gestures and symbols with simpler images and ideas,

and in pursuing this goal they succeeded in replacing their predecessors’ experimental method

with a conceptual approach.

       The art that came to dominate the 1960s was planned carefully in advance. Frank Stella

explained that “the painting never changes once I’ve started to work on it. I work things out

beforehand in the sketches.”15 In this Roy Lichtenstein found common ground between his

work’s cartoon images and Stella’s geometric patterns: “I think that is what’s interesting people

these days: that before you start painting the painting, you know exactly what it’s going to look

like.”16 The images in the work were intended to be straightforward: Jasper Johns explained to a

critic that he had chosen to paint flags, targets, and numerals because they were “preformed,

conventional, depersonalized, factual, exterior elements.”17

       Because the significance of the work lay in its planning, the production of paintings was

often described as perfunctory. Andy Warhol used mechanical devices, like silk screens, to make

his paintings, because “hand painting would take much too long and anyway that’s not the age
                                                    9

we’re living in. Mechanical means are today.”18 Lichtenstein explained that “I want my painting

to look as if it had been programmed. I want to hide the record of my hand.”19 He stressed the

contrast with his predecessors: “Abstract Expressionism was very human looking. My work is

the opposite. It has a pseudomechanical look - as though it were done by a machine.”20

       The clarity associated with the preconception of their works meant that these younger

artists knew when their paintings were finished. Frank Stella contrasted his cohort with the

preceding one:

                 We believe that we can find the end, and that a painting can be
                 finished. The Abstract Expressionists always felt the painting’s
                 being finished was very problematical. We’d more readily say that
                 our paintings were finished and say, well, it’s either a failure or it’s
                 not, instead of saying, well, maybe it’s not really finished.21

The resolution of their works similarly came about quite differently. For Mark Rothko

completion of a painting occurred “in a flash of recognition,” because the picture had to be “a

revelation, an unexpected and unprecedented resolution of an eternally familiar need;” for Jasper

Johns, completing a painting involved a loss of interest: “I usually get bored before I finish.”22

       The enormous differences in the practices of the artists of these two generations were

directly associated with radically differing conceptions of their artistic goals. To the Abstract

Expressionists art was a spiritual quest, and the artist was a seeker. In a letter published in the

New York Times in 1943, Adolph Gottlieb and Mark Rothko explained their aesthetic beliefs,

declaring that “To us art is an adventure into an unknown world, which can be explored only by

those willing to take the risks.”23 Rejecting the view that subject matter was unimportant to the

quality of art, they asserted that “the subject is crucial and only that subject-matter is valid which

is tragic and timeless.”24 Barnett Newman declared that in their work the Abstract Expressionists
                                                 10

created “a truly abstract world which can be discussed only in metaphysical terms.”25 Asked

about the meaning of his art for society, Newman replied that his work was an assertion of

freedom, and if it were understood “it would mean the end of all state capitalism and

totalitarianism.”26 The leading artists of the next generation made much more limited claims for

their work. To them art consisted of a series of technical problems, to which they believed they

could find solutions. Jasper Johns told an interviewer that “I’m neither a teacher nor an author of

manifestos. I don’t think along the same lines as the Abstract Expressionists who took those

sorts of things all too seriously.”27 In 1965 Frank Stella made a similar comparison of artistic

goals, and explained that he and his contemporaries were interested in more concrete problems:

               [A]s for the transcendental or metaphysical things, I simply don’t
               understand them, and I’m honestly not interested in them. It seems
               to be something that was almost a generation thing. I can’t think of
               any artist in my generation or any artists that I really know that are
               working right now that could be interested in that either or even
               understand it. It seems it’s something that’s sort of gone by or
               passed by on the level of ideas. Maybe it’s not such a good thing,
               but the ideas now are much more simply technical or simply
               pedestrian, simply involved in the making of the actual object.
               That’s about all I can think about.28

       A generation dominated by experimental innovators was thus followed by one dominated

by conceptual innovators. The process began in the late 1950s, when Jasper Johns and Robert

Rauschenberg first attracted attention in New York’s art world, and continued with the

emergence of Pop Art early in the 1960s and of Minimalism later in the decade. The replacement

of a generation of artists whose work was based on seeking by a younger generation whose work

was based on finding did not altogether escape the notice of art world observers. So for example

the critic David Sylvester wrote of this shift in 1969:
                                                 11

               Some artists like to think they are working in the dark, others that
               they are firmly in control. The preference seems almost more a
               matter of generation than of individual temperament. Most of the
               artists whose styles were formed in the 1940s subscribed to the
               idea that making art meant feeling one’s way through unknown
               territory... Art was the lonely journey of existentialist man...and
               this ideal of the journey was shared by a multitude of artists... This
               common ethical ideal led to a generally shared attribute of style:
               the way in which the work was made was more or less visible in
               the end-product.
                       The typical art of the Sixties is as different from this as
               Colonel Borman’s journey to the moon is from Lévi-Strauss’s
               journey into the tropics. It is carefully planned, tightly organized,
               precise in execution. It is technological (as in its use of silk-screen
               and spray-gun or as in sculpture ordered from the factory by
               telephone)... It is sure of itself and has an air of certainty and
               decision. The artist, like a good executive, makes up his mind
               what he will do and does it, or gets it done to his specifications.29

       Yet what was not generally recognized, or understood, is that this generational shift in

approach had profound consequences for the timing of artists’ life cycles. Recent research has

begun to demonstrate that the careers of experimental and conceptual artists differ considerably.

The long periods of trial and error typically required for important experimental innovations

mean that they rarely occur early in an artist’s career. In contrast conceptual innovations, which

can be made much more quickly as new ideas are formulated, can occur at any age. Radical

conceptual innovations are in fact most often made early in artists’ careers, by painters who are

not yet accustomed to existing conventions and methods and are consequently more likely to be

able to perceive and appreciate more extreme deviations from these accepted practices.30

Old Masters and Young Geniuses

       The differences in the life cycles of the Abstract Expressionists and their successors can

be explored using the data set constructed for this study. The data are most abundant for the
                                                 12

leading artists, and this investigation will therefore concentrate on the ten artists who hold the top

places in Table 2; these are the artists who had an average of more than one illustration per book.

As noted above, five of these artists were Abstract Expressionists, and five were from the next

generation.

       Table 5 presents a measure of the timing of the major contribution of each of these artists,

by listing the year from which each had the most illustrations. By this measure the Abstract

Expressionists’ peak years occurred at a median age of 46, whereas the median age for the artists

of the next generation was just 34. Four of the five Abstract Expressionists had their peak years

after the age of 40, while four of the five leaders of the next generation had their peak years

before that age. The Abstract Expressionists thus clearly produced their most important work at

considerably older ages than did their successors.

       Table 5 also shows that the conceptual artists of the second generation not only made

their major contributions at younger ages than did their predecessors, but that they made them

within shorter periods of time. Thus although Pollock ranked first in Table 3 with the greatest

number of total illustrations, he stands only in a tie for third place in Table 5. Both Warhol and

Johns had more important individual years than Pollock, and even Lichtenstein, who had nearly a

third less total illustrations than Pollock, had a single year that matched Pollock’s best.

Conceptual innovations embody new ideas, and are generally arrived at and presented more

quickly than the visual advances of experimental innovators. Johns, Warhol, and Lichtenstein

could therefore make and present their innovations in a much shorter period than Pollock and his

colleagues had.

       Warhol’s position at the top of Table 5 is a consequence of the fact that his early Pop
                                                  13

works constituted one of the most influential contributions in American modern art. Critic John

Coplans explained that these works embodied two important formal innovations: “First, the

actual as against the simulated use of an anonymous and mechanical technique, and second, the

use of serial forms.”31 Warhol introduced both of these innovations in 1962. Early in that year

Warhol began to use stencils, and with them he made the 32 paintings of Campbell’s soup cans

that were exhibited at his first one-person show at Los Angeles’ Ferus Gallery in June.32 In July

Warhol discovered that he could work much more quickly by silkscreening his paintings. His

two paintings listed in Table 3 - the Tate Gallery’s Monroe Diptych and the Whitney Museum’s

Green Coca-Cola Bottles - were made with this technique. All of his work of 1962 made use of

serial forms, usually in the repeated appearance of images in series of separate works, such as the

soup cans and the portraits of Marilyn Monroe, and often also in the repetition of an image

within a given work; so for example the Monroe Diptych presents Monroe’s portrait 50 times,

and Green Coca-Cola Bottles contains more than 100 images of bottles. Both of Warhol’s

innovations were the product of new conceptions, and could be introduced immediately, without

the need for experimentation. Thus for example having just begun to use silk screens in July,

Warhol could use them to produce more than 100 paintings in the next three months, in time to

make his new screened paintings the basis for his first New York one-person show, at the Stable

Gallery, in November.33 The Stable show was a great success, as almost all the works sold,

including a portrait of Monroe that curator William Seitz bought for the Museum of Modern

Art.34 The extreme concentration of Warhol’s major contribution in a short period is emphasized

not only by Table 5, which shows that the single year of 1962 accounts for 45% of his total

illustrations - the highest share for any of the leading artists - but also by the fact that among all
                                                  14

his works only the Monroe Diptych and Green Coca-Cola Bottles appear in as many as five

textbooks.35

       For experimental artists, experience as an artist allows the accumulation of knowledge

that leads to innovations, whereas for conceptual artists a lack of experience in fine art may be

key in allowing the departure into radically new practices. Table 6 gives an indication of the

timing of each artist’s major contribution within the context of his career. For each artist, in

addition to the artist’s age in his peak year, the table shows how old each artist was in the earliest

and latest years from which any of his work appeared in the textbooks.

       Table 6 clearly reveals the slower maturation of the Abstract Expressionists than of their

successors. Among the former, only Newman had an interval of less than 15 years between the

date of his first illustrated work and his best year. In contrast, none of the five painters of the

second generation had a gap of more than 10 years between their first illustrated work and their

peak year. Indeed the most remarkable feature of Table 6 is that for both Johns and Stella their

peak years were the earliest ones from which they had any work illustrated, and for both

Lichtenstein and Warhol the gap from their earliest illustrated work to their best was just two

years. This underscores the fact that for these four conceptual innovators, their major

contributions were their first significant efforts. For Johns and Stella, this was work done in their

early 20s, but for Lichtenstein and Warhol it was done at older ages, for both made their

breakthroughs as artists only after spending extended periods earning a living at jobs that did not

allow them to concentrate primarily on their own painting.36

       Table 7 provides further evidence on the timing of these artists’ careers, by showing the

proportions of each artist’s total illustrations that represent work done before and after the single
                                                  15

year judged most important by the art historians. The Abstract Expressionists all produced

substantial bodies of significant work prior to their peaks: for all five, at least 20% of their total

illustrations show work done before their peak years, and for both Pollock and Rothko this

proportion is fully half. In contrast, of the five younger artists, only for Rauschenberg does work

done before his peak year account for more than 20% of his total illustrations, while for Johns,

Stella, and Warhol these proportions are below 5%. For three of the Abstract Expressionists, the

share of illustrations accounted for by paintings done prior to their peaks is actually greater than

the share of work done after those peaks, whereas this is not true for any of the later artists.

        An example of the gradual process by which the Abstract Expressionists developed their

art is afforded by Pollock’s career. Table 8 presents a full listing of the illustrations of his work

by year of execution. This identifies Pollock’s first important year as 1943, the time of his first

one-person show at Peggy Guggenheim’s gallery, Art of this Century. Pollock had been working

under the influence of Surrealism for several years, but it was in 1943 that he first began to use

this influence in an original way, in paintings like Pasiphae (illustrated in five books) and

Guardians of the Secret (6 illustrations). Late in the year Pollock painted Mural (5 illustrations)

as a commission for Guggenheim. This began to anticipate Pollock’s major work: the painting

was the largest he had made to date, and in it he began to use line for its own sake, rather than for

creating figures or defining planes, as in all earlier painting. The next important years identified

by Table 8 are 1947-48. These began what is considered Pollock’s classic period, as in 1947 he

produced the first paintings in his signature method of applying paint, by dripping it onto

canvases laid flat on the floor. Landmark paintings from these years include Cathedral (5

illustrations) and Number 1, 1948 (7 illustrations). In 1950, Pollock’s peak year in Table 8, he

produced the work, including his two entries in Table 3, Lavender Mist (12 illustrations) and

Autumn Rhythm (13 illustrations), that is considered his finest. Working with large formats, he

used the drip method to create all-over compositions that broke with tradition by having no

specific points of emphasis. Pollock described this innovation by saying “My paintings do not

have a center,” and its influence changed the course of modern painting.37 Thus in 1967 the

Minimalist sculptor Donald Judd would write that “I think it’s clear that Pollock created the large

scale, wholeness, and simplicity that have become common to almost all good work.”38 Table 8

documents the timing of the incremental process by which Pollock developed each of the

elements of his technique into these revolutionary results.

       The evidence of Tables 7 and 8 thus reinforces the recognition that much of the interest in

the Abstract Expressionists’ careers lies in the experimental process by which they arrived at

their greatest work. In contrast, Table 7 shows that for the later artists the discontinuities in their

careers represented by their major contributions mean that their prior work is of little or no

interest, and that for scholars these artists’ careers effectively begin with their early conceptual

breakthroughs. A remarkable consequence of the early achievements of the younger conceptual

artists is shown in Table 9. Both Jasper Johns and Frank Stella had their first New York one-

man gallery shows after they had done the work that would later be judged their most important,

while Andy Warhol had his first show in the same year in which he produced what scholars

would consider his best work. In contrast, all the Abstract Expressionists had their first gallery

shows before - and usually well before - producing their most important work. The conceptual

revolution of the ‘60s thus produced a new phenomenon in the history of modern art, in which

the work that first introduced an artist to the art world would often be that which would remain
                                                 17

his most important.

Careers and Conflicts

       The differences in career patterns documented above help us not only to understand the

differences in the creative processes of these two types of artist, but also to gain perspective on

the violence of the conflict that occurred in the art world when the two generations considered

here clashed in the late 1950s and early ‘60s. A dramatic and celebrated instance was occasioned

by an exhibition in 1962.

       Sidney Janis was a wealthy clothing manufacturer and art collector who opened an art

gallery in New York in 1948. His gallery quickly gained prominence, for he not only exhibited

the work of most of the emerging leaders of Abstract Expressionism, but also that of such

important European artists as Bonnard, Klee, Miró, and Mondrian. As the critic Clement

Greenberg explained in a 1958 tribute to the dealer, Janis’ exhibition practices had helped to

establish the legitimacy of the Americans, for his policy “not only implied, it declared, that

Pollock, de Kooning, Kline, Guston, Rothko, and Motherwell were to be judged by the same

standards as Matisse and Picasso, without condescension, without making allowances.”

Greenberg observed that in the late ‘40s “the real issue was whether ambitious artists could live

in this country by what they did ambitiously. Sidney Janis helped as much as anyone to see that

it was decided affirmatively.”39

       In the fall of 1962, Janis welcomed a new generation of artists in a group show he titled

“The New Realism.” The exhibition included paintings by Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, and

a number of other Pop artists. In the catalogue Janis hailed the arrival of a new movement:

                        Reaction and change in the continuity of art have never
                                                 18

               before undergone the rapid nor unpredictable succession of
               metamorphoses as they have in the twentieth century.
                        Cubism, Surrealism, Dadaism and later Abstract
               Expressionism, to name only a few, were each in turn ardent
               dissents from existing creative art forms and frequently before
               these forms were even accepted. The originality of each
               succeeding movement, challenged or maligned as it was, ultimately
               found its recognition.
                        Today’s Factual artist, and the work of these artists make
               up the present exhibition, belong to a new generation (age average
               about 30) whose reaction to Abstract Expressionism is still another
               manifestation in the evolution of art. As the Abstract Expressionist
               became the world recognized painter of the 50s, the new Factual
               artist (referred to as the Pop Artist in England ... and here as in
               France, as the New Realist) may have already proved to be the
               pacemaker of the 60s.40

       The show had a powerful impact, both on the large crowds of curious spectators it

attracted, and on Janis’ established artists, as Adolph Gottlieb, Philip Guston, Robert

Motherwell, and Mark Rothko resigned from the gallery in protest. Janis claimed to be both

startled and disappointed at the older artists’ action, which he considered hypocritical: “It took

me completely by surprise. Here we had been showing Pollock cheek-by-jowl with Léger, and

de Kooning with Mondrian, and Kline with Klee, but when we took up the next generation our

artists were furious.”41 Yet critic Calvin Tomkins explained that the Abstract Expressionists

could not see the parallel between the two episodes:

               The Abstract Expressionists’ anger was not really so hard to
               understand. They had struggled for many years in total obscurity,
               their achievements recognized only by one another... The
               recognition that they had so recently and so arduously won was
               now being usurped, or so they believed, by a new generation of
               brash youngsters who have become “artists overnight,” who had
               not earned anything the hard way, and whose most apparent
               common bond seemed to be mockery and rejection of all serious
               art, especially Abstract Expressionism. Pollock and de Kooning
               and Rothko and Newman had not repudiated Picasso, Mondrian,
                                                  19

               and Léger. They had worshiped the European masters, while
               striving heroically to go beyond them. Now, suddenly, heroism
               and high art were out of style. 42

As Tomkins recognized, the Abstract Expressionists’ anger at Pop art was not simply a product

of jealousy at the younger artists’ quick commercial success. Its deeper cause lay in the inability

of a generation of experimental artists to appreciate the achievement of a younger generation of

conceptual innovators. For Rothko and his friends, real artistic achievement was only possible

through long and difficult struggles. Consequently, for them the conceptual art of the ‘60s was

not only not good art, but it was not art at all. Thus for example when Motherwell first saw

Frank Stella’s early paintings, he remarked “It’s very interesting, but it’s not painting.”43

Similarly, the critic Harold Rosenberg, a friend and early supporter of the Abstract

Expressionists, described Andy Warhol as “a new kind of artist: ‘Media celebrity and

manufacturer of art substitutes.’”44

       The Janis episode underscores the fact that the differences in the careers of experimental

and conceptual artists that appear in the quantitative measures of this paper were associated with

fundamental differences in the artists’ goals and in their very conception of the purposes of art.

To the Abstract Expressionists, whose careers - and lives - were dedicated to a visual art, the

conceptual art of their successors could never be more than a cynical and opportunistic strategy.

Conclusion

       If the illustrations in textbooks were considered as ballots in a competition like the

movies’ Academy Awards, Table 2 shows that Jackson Pollock would win the award for the

greatest overall achievement by a modern American painter. This would not come as a great

surprise to many leading artists of this era. Thus for example in one recent interview the sculptor
                                                20

Richard Serra observed that “We evaluate artists by how much they are able to rid themselves of

convention, to change history. Well, I don’t know anyone since Pollock who has altered the form

or the language of painting as much as he did,” and in another the painter Cy Twombly remarked

that “To me, Pollock is the height of American painting.”45 Yet Pollock would not sweep these

hypothetical Oscars, for Table 5 shows that Andy Warhol’s seminal Pop paintings from 1962

would win him an award for the greatest achievement in a single year, and Table 3 shows that de

Kooning’s Woman I would have the honor of being considered the greatest American modern

painting. Jasper Johns might receive an award for the most impressive debut, as the paintings of

flags and targets that made 1955 his peak year were not only the earliest of his paintings that

received votes, but were ranked in Table 5 as the second most important contribution made by a

modern American painter in a single year. And de Kooning might also receive a special award

for endurance, in recognition of the evidence of Table 6 that he produced work deemed worthy of

scholarly attention over a period of more than 60 years.

       If a similar process were used to make awards to the great painters who worked in France

and dominated modern art during its first century, virtually all significant honors would be

captured by a single towering figure.46 The absence of such a dominant figure in the present

study, and the even balance of these awards by generation, appear to reflect a broad consensus of

art historians. Thus Jackson Pollock does appear in retrospect as the greatest of modern

American painters, but not by an overwhelming margin. Similarly whereas it is widely agreed

that the leading American artists of the next generation succeeded the Abstract Expressionists as

the major producers of innovations in modern art, there is also a consensus that they did not

overshadow their predecessors.
                                                 21

       The Abstract Expressionists revolutionized modern painting during the late 1940s and

early ‘50s, and their successors again revolutionized it in the late ‘50s and the early ‘60s. Yet

this study has highlighted the dramatic difference in the ways these revolutions were made. The

Abstract Expressionists produced their innovations gradually, through time-consuming and

painstaking experimentation aimed at capturing complex and elusive visual effects. In contrast,

the artists of the next generation produced their innovations abruptly, by making new kinds of art

from more straightforward images that came directly from new ideas. The Abstract

Expressionists’ art of perception gave way to new movements based on conception. And the

creative lives of the artists contrasted just as sharply. The Abstract Expressionists made their

greatest contributions only after decades of searching, whereas their successors produced their

major works by making dramatic discoveries early in their careers.

35.   Interestingly, in spite of the enormous importance of Warhol’s contribution of 1962, no
      individual work of his stands higher than seventh in Table 3. This contrasts sharply with
      the pattern for earlier conceptual innovators, whose greatest contributions were typically
      embodied in a single major breakthrough work; e.g. see Galenson, “Quantifying Artistic
      Success: Ranking French Painters - and Paintings - from Impressionism to Cubism,”
      Historical Methods, forthcoming. The obvious source of the failure of this pattern to
                                              24

      apply to Warhol is the nature of his innovations, for both tended to deemphasize the
      significance of individual paintings in favor of a body of work as a whole. For discussion
      see Galenson, “Masterpieces and Markets: Why the Most Famous Modern Paintings Are
