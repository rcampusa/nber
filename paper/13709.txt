                                           ABSTRACT

We document that simulated corporate marginal tax rates based on financial statement data (Shevlin
1990 and Graham 1996a) are highly correlated with simulated rates based on corporate tax return data.
We provide algorithms that can be used to estimate the book or tax simulated rates when they are not
available. We find that the simulated book marginal tax rate does a better job of explaining financial
statement debt ratios than does the analogous tax return variable and discuss how the book simulated
rate is likely to be an appropriate measure in settings with global, long-term considerations.

1. Introduction

         The marginal tax rate (MTR) is an important input into many corporate decisions.

For example, high marginal tax rate firms are hypothesized to use more debt, restructure

via Chapter 11 when in distress, and participate in tax shelters. Low marginal tax rate

firms are thought to pay employees with deferred and/or stock compensation rather than

salary, operate as corporations rather than partnerships, and lease rather than buy assets.

The corporate MTR also is a key input into the cost of capital and, therefore, affects

many capital budgeting decisions.1 Given the significance of these issues, it is important

to measure corporate marginal income tax rates accurately and choose a rate appropriate

to the research question.

         Ideally, to test for tax effects, researchers would construct the tax variable(s) that

managers use in their actual decision making. In theory, such tax rates should incorporate

the effects of net operating losses (NOLs), projections of future income, and various

features of the tax code (for all jurisdictions), as appropriate. For economic decisions that

are tied to an incremental dollar of income or deduction, like those mentioned above, tax

incentives should be measured by a marginal income tax rate.

         In practice, much prior research has relied on simple static tax variables created

from financial statement data, such as the presence of an NOL carryforward, to measure

tax incentives. The value of a static variable is limited, however, when dynamic

considerations are important, such as when a firm’s tax status is expected to change in the

near future. Shevlin (1990) and Graham (1996a) address this concern by simulating

1
  We measure the MTR as the present value of incremental taxes paid on an additional dollar of current-
period income, consistent with Scholes et al.’s (2005) corporate income marginal tax rate. This measure of
the MTR on the next dollar of income differs from the concept of the marginal effective tax rate on an
investment, which is estimated as the expected pretax return minus the expected after tax return, divided by
the expected pretax return. See Fullerton (1999) for a brief description.
marginal tax rates that capture important dynamic features of the tax code such as the

effects of NOL carrybacks and carryforwards. While a simulated tax variable based on

financial statement information (hereafter, the book simulated rate) is only an

approximation of the theoretical, “true” tax variable that managers use in their actual

decisions, it appears to be a reasonable proxy because it loads as expected in many

economic settings (see Graham (2003) for a summary of findings). In addition, the

simulated book MTR performs well in experiments that compare it to benchmark tax

rates that are believed to capture important elements of the “true” tax variable.

       In one such experiment, Graham (1996b) compares financial statement tax

variables to a benchmark marginal tax rate that models dynamic features of the tax code

and is based on “perfect foresight” future book income. He finds that the simulated book

MTR is most highly correlated with the perfect foresight benchmark. In a second

experiment, Plesko (2003) tests how closely book MTRs approximate a benchmark MTR

that is based on tax return data. Plesko examines a small sample of homogeneous, single-

entity firms, chosen to eliminate firms for which the reporting entity is likely to vary

between financial and tax reporting. He uses 1992 data to form a static tax return tax rate

benchmark against which to compare a collection of financial statement MTRs. Plesko

finds that Graham’s (1996a) simulated book MTRs are the closest approximation to his

benchmark static tax return MTR.

       While the book simulated MTR performs well in these two experiments, there are

still unanswered questions. In particular, how closely does the book simulated rate

approximate a tax return benchmark that incorporates dynamic features of the tax code?

Also, do the results validating the book simulated rate hold for large, complex




                                                                                         2
corporations for which tax and book consolidated entities differ? The answers to these

questions are important because they relate to issues often studied by researchers and to

companies that are responsible for much of the world’s economic activity.

        Our paper fills this void by comparing, for a sample of large, complex firms, a

collection of financial statement tax rates to a dynamic tax return MTR benchmark. In

particular, we use a panel of confidential U.S. tax return data from 1992 to 2000 to

simulate corporate income MTRs for the years 1998 to 2000. We compare these

benchmark tax rates to a collection of financial statement MTRs to determine which is

most highly correlated. As an alternative, we also benchmark against a simple static tax

return MTR that is based on realized future taxable income.

        We find that, among the candidate financial statement tax variables, the book

simulated MTR is most highly correlated with the dynamic tax return benchmark, further

validating the book simulated MTR. The book simulated rate also performs well when

benchmarked against the static tax return variables that are based on realized future

taxable income. We also identify the “second best” book variables, in this case,

categorical variables that combine information about net operating losses and the sign of

pretax income; however, as detailed below, the amount of correlation lost by relying on

second best, and even which variable is second best, varies by setting and benchmark.2

Taking all this evidence together, we conclude that researchers should use the simulated

rate when it is available. For situations where the simulated rate is not available, we

report algorithms that researchers can use to estimate the simulated book MTR. We also

provide an algorithm to estimate the simulated tax return MTR for settings where tax

  For example, the superiority of the simulated rate is greater when comparing MTRs based on pre-interest
income than it is for MTRs based on post-interest income.


                                                                                                        3
returns provide the ideal data to measure corporate tax incentives.

         Even though we use it as a benchmark, one should not assume that a tax return tax

rate is the “true” tax variable that managers use when making all decisions. As we detail

in Section 3, there are advantages and disadvantages to using tax return data in tax rate

calculations. A key advantage of using tax return data is that they allow us to directly

measure taxable income, which is difficult to estimate from financial statement data due

to “book-tax differences.” When these differences are temporary (e.g., accelerated tax

depreciation vs. straight line book depreciation), researchers can estimate taxable income

by adjusting book income for deferred taxes. When the book and tax differences are not

temporary (e.g., fines or some stock option deductions), researchers are less able to adjust

financial statement data for book-tax differences, making tax return data appear superior.

However, tax return based measures are not without weaknesses as proxies for the “true”

marginal tax rate. For one thing, due to differing consolidation rules, financial statement

and U.S. tax return data do not always represent the same entity.3 In some situations,

managers are likely to take actions relative to the firm’s global operations (which are

often best represented by book data), rather than relative to domestic-only operations

(often best reflected by U.S. tax return data).

         To put this point in perspective, and to place our paper within the literature,

consider which tax rate variable might be preferred in different settings (as summarized

in Figure 1).4 The figure categorizes settings that involve worldwide vs. domestic



3
  The U.S. tax return includes only a subset of the enterprise. While financial statements consolidate
worldwide subsidiaries that are 50 percent or more owned, U.S. tax returns only consolidate domestic
subsidiaries that are 80 percent or more owned. In addition, most researchers cannot access tax returns, and
even those that do cannot access a long time series.

  Figure 1 should not be used as a “cook book” to determine the correct tax rate to use in a given setting.
One should always consider the theoretical and nuanced empirical implications that apply to the particular


                                                                                                           4
operations and those that involve long-term vs. short-term considerations. Much of our

analysis focuses on Box 3 because we extensively study the best way to use public data to

measure tax rates in settings where decisions are made in response to dynamic, domestic

tax return driven incentives (e.g., situations like incremental borrowing in the U.S. or

using transfer-pricing to place an additional dollar of income in the U.S.). In such

settings, we conclude that researchers who only have access to public data should use a

“predicted” simulated tax return MTR (based on coefficients that we provide in Section

5)    or     a     book      simulated        MTR       (available       from      Graham’s         website:

http://www.duke.edu/~jgraham).

         When long-term worldwide incentives are important (Box 1), we again

recommend that researchers use the book simulated tax rate when it is available or use a

“predicted” simulated book MTR (based on coefficients that we also provide in Section

5). As a case in point, in Section 7 we investigate tax incentives in corporate capital

structure decisions, a setting where managers likely focus on the global business

enterprise. Consistent with tax theory, we find a positive relation between simulated

MTRs and corporate debt ratios. As expected, financial statement debt ratios are more

highly correlated with simulated book MTRs than with tax return MTRs, most likely

because both the debt ratio and book MTRs are based on the worldwide enterprise, while

the tax return MTR reflects only U.S. taxable income. The capital structure evidence

highlights that book MTRs more appropriately measure tax incentives in some settings

than do tax return MTRs. Other settings that often affect the enterprise as a whole, and

therefore call for the use of book tax rates, include management compensation for


set of circumstances under consideration. The intent of Figure 1 is to categorize certain tax considerations
and briefly summarize research implications to date.


                                                                                                               5
corporate officers and trade-off settings like book-tax conformity or gain and loss

recognition for the company as a whole (see Box 1).

           Figure 1 (Boxes 2 and 4) also categorizes tax implications occurring when short-

term considerations are important. In situations where short-term domestic considerations

are important but tax return data are unavailable, the book simulated MTR from

Graham’s website once again appears to be the best publicly available measure (see

Plesko, 2003). If that variable is missing, researchers can use the coefficients estimated in

Model C of Table 4 to create a “predicted” book simulated rate (see Box 4). Finally, we

are not aware of research that explicitly investigates which tax variable is best when

short-term worldwide considerations are important (see Box 2). In these situations, we

conjecture that a static book MTR should reasonably measure tax incentives.

           To summarize, we find that simulated MTRs based on financial statement data are

highly correlated with simulated MTRs based on tax return data, providing additional

validity for the widespread use of simulated MTRs. We conclude that book simulated

MTRs provide a reasonable measure of tax incentives when a researcher is attempting to

capture long- or short-term domestic tax incentives (Boxes 3 and 4, respectively, in

Figure 1), as well as long-term worldwide tax incentives (Box 1).

2. Simulating dynamic marginal tax rates

           We begin by describing the procedure that we use to estimate dynamic marginal

tax rates.5 We define the corporate marginal income tax rate as the present value of

current and expected future taxes paid on an additional dollar of income earned today. As

a key part of our experiment, we operationalize this definition of the current-period MTR



5
    Static MTRs are defined in Section 4 below (see Plesko (2003) for background and more detail).


                                                                                                     6
by forecasting future taxable income and modeling dynamic features of the tax code.

During our sample period, a firm that experiences a net operating loss (NOL) is allowed

to “carry back” the loss and receive a tax refund for taxes paid in the previous two

years. If current-year losses more than offset taxable income from the preceding two

years, they are “carried forward” and used to offset taxable income up to 20 years in the

future. Additional losses are added to any unused losses from previous years and carried

forward to shield income in future years, with the oldest losses being applied first.

2.1 Financial statement simulated corporate marginal income tax rates

         We follow the approach developed in Shevlin (1987, 1990) and Graham (1996a,

1996b, 1999) to simulate the dynamic features of the tax code. This process forecasts

future taxable income by assuming that taxable income follows a random walk with drift.

We assume that income is taxed at U.S. statutory rates.6

         To measure taxable income, we start with consolidated book net income and add

taxes paid. We add grossed-up minority interest and deferred tax expense from the

statement of cash flows (or the change in deferred tax liabilities if deferred tax expense is

missing). To gross up these amounts, we use an income-appropriate statutory tax rate (not

always the top statutory rate). The deferred tax adjustment alters the book income number

to account for temporary differences relative to tax return taxable income.

         To forecast future taxable income for year t+1 and beyond, we first calculate the

6
  Using an alternative technique, Contos et al. (2006) simulate across a grid of firm characteristics and then
map each firm’s characteristics onto the grid to assign a firm-specific MTR. Their approach may miss
important tax status features for a given firm; however, it is computationally efficient and permits the
number of simulations to be increased greatly. Contos et al. focus on book-tax differences and find
moderate differences in average effective tax rates but minimal differences between book and tax MTRs.
This latter result complements one of our general findings, though we go into greater depth by separately
contrasting pre- and post-financing MTRs, and we identify a possible difference in the book and tax
treatment of interest. Like us, even though they use a different simulation process and use debt from the
tax-return as the dependent variable, Contos et al. find a positive relation between simulated tax return
MTRs and debt usage. See also Matheson (2006).


                                                                                                             7
mean and variance of the change in taxable income for a given firm based on its historic

data through year t. We exclude grossed-up extraordinary items and discontinued

operations from historical income because we assume these items are transitory. For each

firm-year, we forecast income 22 years into the future to account for the 20-year

carryforward period, plus an additional two years in which carrybacks can affect income

in year t + 20. These forecasts are generated with repeated random draws from a normal

distribution, with drift and variance equal to that gathered in the first step.7 We simulate

50 different forecasts of the future for each firm-year. For example, to calculate a tax rate

for the year 2000, we forecast 50 distinct income paths for income in the years 2001 to

2022, to account for possible carryback and carryforward effects on the year 2000 tax

rate.

        The third step calculates the tax liability based on the statutory tax schedule along

each of the 50 income paths generated in the second step. Net operating losses (NOLs)

are carried back or forward to offset income along each path, with additional losses being

added to any existing accumulated NOLs. We compute the present value of the tax

liabilities for each path, discounting with a bond rate (Modigliani and Miller 1963).

Because firm-specific bond yields are not readily available, we use the average Moody’s

corporate bond yield as the economy-wide discount rate.8 The fourth step adds $1 to

current year income and recalculates the present value tax liability along each path. The

incremental tax liability calculated in the fourth step, relative to that calculated in the

  Graham (1996b) studies alternative forecasting approaches to the random walk with drift model. For
example, he examines autoregressive models that account for mean-reversion in earnings. Graham
concludes that the random walk model used herein outperforms these alternatives in the context of
simulating corporate MTRs. In addition, he finds that the random walk forecasting model produces MTRs
that are highly correlated with MTRs based on realized “perfect foresight” estimated taxable income.
8
  Like Shevlin (1990), we use a constant cross-sectional constant discount rate, acknowledging that this
ignores differences in risk premia across firms.


                                                                                                           8
third step, is the present value tax liability from earning an extra dollar today; in other

words, the economic MTR along a given forecast path.

       The fifth step averages across the MTRs from the 50 different paths to determine

the expected marginal tax rate for a single firm-year, which we call BookSimMTR. We

replicate the steps for each firm for each year, to produce a panel of firm-year MTRs. The

marginal tax rates in this panel vary across firms and can also vary through time for a

given firm.

       We separately compute firm-year MTRs on prefinancing income. To do so, we

add back financial statement interest expense (Compustat data item #15), plus the interest

portion of rental payments (approximated as one-third of total rental payments #47; see

Graham et al. (1998)), to the historical estimates of taxable income. Using these

prefinancing data, we repeat the steps described above to simulate prefinancing corporate

marginal income tax rates (PreIntBookSimMTR).

2.2 Adapting the simulation procedure to use tax return data

       We also follow the steps described above to simulate tax return MTRs

(TaxSimMTR) based on tax return data. In this case, of course, we use actual tax return

taxable income (and we do not need to estimate taxable income like we do when we use

financial statement data). We measure taxable income without net operating loss

deductions as equal to Form 1120 line 28 (net income) less line 29a (the dividends

received deduction). In the tax return simulation, we have no specific data about

nonrecurring items, so all of the historic taxable income enters the drift and volatility

computations. As in the book-based simulation, we build up and utilize net operating

losses within the program based on realized losses. We carry losses back two years and




                                                                                         9
forward 20 years to shield actual and/or forecasted future income.

         We also separately compute tax return-based prefinancing simulated marginal tax

rates (PreIntTaxSimMTR). We replicate the simulation after adding back interest

deductions (Form 1120, Line 18) and one-third of rents paid (Form 1120, Line 16) to

taxable income.

         Using the same simulation method on both datasets could induce spurious

correlation between our book and tax simulated MTRs. For example, any systematic error

in our estimation of the discount rate used in both simulations could induce a positive

correlation. In addition, using the same historic period to calibrate the simulation

procedures also has the potential to create a mechanical relation between the book and tax

simulated MTRs. We estimate the mean and variance of income growth using only five

or six years of historical data, which could make this potential problem more acute

relative to a setting based on a longer historical estimation period. To partially address

these concerns, we compare the book simulated rate to a naïve static tax return tax rate

(FutureSimple) that is based on actual future realizations of taxable income, and therefore

can not be mechanically related to the book simulated rate in the manner described

above.

3. Using tax return data: advantages, disadvantages and measurement issues

         The primary advantage of using tax return data is the ability to measure taxable

income accurately, although only for the tax return entities. Financial statement

disclosures do not provide sufficient data to perfectly measure taxable income, even for

the financial reporting entities. The primary disadvantage of using tax return data as a

benchmark is that tax returns do not represent the same entities as do financial




                                                                                        10
statements. Therefore, “the firm” is not the same in the two data sources. The preferred

definition of the firm (book or tax) depends on the research question (see Figure 1).

3.1 Measuring taxable income – permanent differences and stock options

        When taxable income is the variable of interest but tax return data are not

available, researchers must estimate taxable income from financial statement disclosures.

By adding grossed-up deferred tax expense to pretax book income, we adjust book

income for temporary differences like accelerated tax depreciation and delayed tax

recognition of accrued losses and reserves.9 However, deferred tax expense does not

account for permanent differences like municipal bond interest, dividends’ received

deductions, nondeductible penalties and entertainment expenses, and some valuation

differences arising out of mergers and acquisitions. Though these permanent differences

drive a wedge between taxable income from the tax return and estimates of taxable

income from the financial statements, it is an empirical question as to how this wedge

affects the correlation between book and tax measures of marginal tax status.

        One possible wedge is the tax deduction for employees’ exercising nonqualified

stock options, which could reduce taxes paid far below financial statement reported

current tax expense (Hanlon and Shevlin 2002; Graham 2003; Graham et al. 2004).

During our sample period, corporations generally did not record stock option expense in

their financial statements. Therefore, MTRs based on tax return income will likely be

smaller than MTRs based on financial statement estimates of taxable income. In

supplemental tests, we explore the degree to which stock option deductions contribute to

9
  Our simulation program measures book-tax differences as grossed-up deferred tax expense, similar to
Hanlon (2005). Other research (Lev and Nissim 2004, Desai and Dharmapala 2006) estimates taxable
income as grossed-up current tax expense. Although the latter method includes permanent differences, it
introduces additional measurement error to the extent that tax credits and other rate differences do not
represent income differences.


                                                                                                           11
differences between book and tax MTRs.10 These differences should be smaller in the

future because SFAS 123R requires companies to record book expenses for stock options

starting in 2005.

3.2 Entity differences

         The consolidation rules for financial statements differ from those for U.S. tax

returns, so in some cases the enterprises are not directly comparable (Plesko 2003, Mills

and Plesko 2003, Hanlon 2003, Mills et al. 2003). A firm typically includes all controlled

domestic and foreign entities in its financial statements, where control generally means

ownership greater than 50 percent. In contrast, a U.S. parent corporation can elect to file

a consolidated tax return that includes net income or loss from all its domestic

subsidiaries that are owned 80 percent or more (affiliated corporations) plus repatriations

of profits from the foreign subsidiaries. These differences can lead to apples-to-oranges

comparisons between the tax return and financial statement entities, at least in part. We

conduct tests to explore the degree to which consolidation discrepancies explain

differences between the financial statement and tax return simulated MTRs.

         While tax return (financial statement) data can generally be thought of as being

ideal to represent domestic (worldwide) operations, there are exceptions. Consider a

purely domestic company, a firm for which one might initially think that its domestic

focus would make the tax return the ideal data source. Financial statement data include



10
  Currently there are no machine-readable data on stock option deductions. In 2003, the IRS added a
discrete line to Schedule M-1 to capture the book-tax difference associated with stock options. In
supplemental tests, we use the 2003 M-1 amount of stock option difference to proxy for the use of stock
options by a corporation during our sample period. Based on untabulated t-tests, BookSimMTR exceeds
TaxSimMTR by 0.012 for taxpayers that claim a 2003 option deduction, but only 0.006 for taxpayers that
do not claim the deduction. Though not quite significant (t = 1.55, p-value = 0.12), this difference suggests
that stock option deductions reduce MTRs for some firms, consistent with estimates by Graham et al.
(2004).


                                                                                                           12
majority income for subsidiaries (domestic subsidiaries in this example) owned more

than 50 percent but less than 80 percent, while these data are entirely missing from the

tax return data. In the other direction, as might be preferred, financial statements exclude

minority interest, which is included wholly for the 80 percent domestic subsidiaries

consolidated in the tax return. These differences may lead to situations where financial

statement data more closely capture domestic operations than do tax return data.

3.3 Ease of access

       One disadvantage of using tax returns is their confidential nature. A researcher

must work for the Treasury or have a special arrangement to access tax return data. This

limitation highlights the importance of determining how closely book tax variables

approximate tax return variables and also determining the accuracy of algorithms that

approximate tax return MTRs when access to tax return data is limited.

       However, the appropriateness of the book MTR in many settings makes the

limited availability of tax return data less disadvantageous in these settings. MTRs

derived from financial statements are appropriate for many research questions concerning

tax-induced decisions of the global enterprise. For example, as shown in Box 1 of Figure

1, if the research question involves debt-related tax benefits for the enterprise as a whole

(e.g., Graham 1996a), researchers should use a worldwide marginal tax rate (i.e., a book

MTR). In contrast, for narrow jurisdictional questions such as the placement of debt in

the U.S. versus a foreign subsidiary (Newberry and Dhaliwal 2001), researchers would

want to know the marginal tax rate on income in each jurisdiction, one of which would be

the U.S. (Box 3). It is difficult to make sweeping statements about which data source is

better to use when constructing MTRs in any given setting. Researchers must consider




                                                                                         13
the particular circumstances of the experimental setting to make proper MTR and data

choices. Guidance like that provided in Figure 1 should be used as a starting point, not as

a definitive set of recommendations.


4. Sample and univariate analysis

       We use the MatchedFile dataset constructed by the Treasury Department to merge

financial statement data from S&P’s Compustat database with U.S. corporate tax return

data. The Treasury samples large firms every year and only includes a random sampling

of smaller firms. This, combined with the panel data requirements of the simulation

method, implies that the tax return data we use over-represent large, surviving firms.

Because of their importance to the world economy and capital markets, we argue that

these large, complex multinationals are important to include when judging the

reasonableness of book data. Moreover, if we find that book and tax MTRs for these

firms closely approximate each other, even though mismatching issues due to

consolidation and book tax differences (discussed above) are most acute for these large

complex entities, this would suggest that book and tax MTRs are also close substitutes

for smaller firms (where consolidation issues and book tax differences are less acute). As

described below, this is exactly what we find when we examine a subset of (smaller)

firms for which the book and tax entities closely match.

       MatchedFile is formed by merging records from each database by employer

identification number (EIN) after special care is taken to align the time periods. For

example, if a corporation has a November fiscal year-end for tax filing purposes and a

June fiscal year-end for financial reporting purposes, MatchedFile links the November

1998 tax return with the June 1998 financial statement, because such a match creates the



                                                                                        14
most overlapping months of income. MatchedFile also explicitly identifies any duplicate

listings for the same identifier, retaining only the top-level consolidated group. For

example, the file deletes unconsolidated filings such as large manufacturers and their

credit corporations, retaining only the full consolidated financial statement.

       We calculate tax rates starting in 1998 because the simulation procedure uses an

historic panel of at least five prior years of data, and the MatchedFile dataset is not

comprehensive prior to 1992. As described above, we use historic data from 1992

through t-1 to determine the mean and variance of taxable income to enable us to forecast

income in t and beyond. We simulate marginal tax rates only for 1998, 1999 and 2000 for

two reasons. First, these three years had the same net operating loss carryback (two) and

carryforward (twenty) periods. Second, ending in 2000 permits us to calculate future

simple static tax return MTRs from 2001 to 2004 (FutureSimple). We use these simple

static MTRs as a secondary benchmark, as described below. We begin with 1,799 firms

with at least five years of data between 1992 and 1997 to construct our simulations.

       Table 1 summarizes the sample composition by year and industry. Panel A shows

1,315 companies in 1998; 1,271 in 1999; and 1,081 in 2000, for a total of 3,667 firm-year

observations, representing 1,362 firms. All but 19 of these firms have simulated book

MTRs on Graham’s website during our sample period. Most of our sample firms are

manufacturers (SIC2 and SIC3). We perform some tests on a subsample that omits 61

observations from financial service firms (SIC6).

       Table 1, Panel B describes how our sample of 1,315 observations in 1998

compares to Compustat’s active and inactive companies’ 1998 assets (data item #6,

dollars in millions), sales (#12), pretax income (#170), the absolute value of the




                                                                                       15
proportion of foreign (#272) to worldwide pretax income (#170), and the total debt

(#9+#34) to assets (#6) ratio. To make our comparison, we compute quintiles of the

Compustat variables, then determine the percentage of our sample that falls in those

ranges. If our sample were perfectly representative of Compustat, one-fifth of the sample

would appear in each Compustat quintile. As expected, for variables that indicate size

(Assets, Sales) or profitability (Pretax Income), our sample is skewed toward the upper

end of the Compustat population. We only compute Foreign Percent for the 466 firms

that report nonmissing foreign income (otherwise the first four Compustat quintiles have

zero foreign income), and our sample is relatively representative of Compustat’s

multinational firms. More of our sample is in the middle of the Leverage distribution than

at the tails, suggesting that large multinationals do not often operate with very small or

extremely high leverage.

       We split the 3,667 firm-years from 1998-2000 into a test sample of 1,833 firm-

year observations and a holdout sample of 1,834 firm-year observations. We perform our

analysis on the test sample, concluding with a regression to fit public financial statement

data to the simulated tax return MTR. In Section 5.2, we use the estimated regression

coefficients to predict the tax return MTRs for the holdout sample and compare those

MTRs to the benchmark tax return MTRs.

       Table 2 presents summary information. Panel A describes various marginal tax

rate measures. BookSimMTR is the simulated book marginal tax rate described

previously. The mean BookSimMTR is 0.305. The maximum is 0.390, reflecting the

narrow “clawback” bracket where the statutory rate is 39 percent before it falls back to

the top-bracket statutory rate of 35 percent that applies to most large firms.




                                                                                        16
           We also create categorical marginal tax rate variables commonly used in prior

accounting and finance research. Following Plesko (2003), we define NOL as the

beginning net operating loss carryfoward (prior year Compustat data item #52) and pretax

income as data item #170. We use 35 percent as the top statutory rate to reflect current

law.

•      If NOL equals zero, then Binary1 equals 0.35. Otherwise, Binary1 equals 0.

•      If NOL equals zero and pretax income is nonnegative, then Binary2 equals 0.35.
       Otherwise, Binary2 equals 0.

•      If NOL equals zero and pretax income is nonnegative, then Trichotomous equals
       0.35. If NOL is positive and pretax income is negative, then Trichotomous equals
       zero. Otherwise, Trichotomous equals 0.17.

•      If NOL equals zero and pretax income is nonnegative, then PseudoStatutory equals
       0.35.11 If NOL is zero and pretax income is negative, then PseudoStatutory equals
       0.15. If NOL is positive and pretax income is positive, then PseudoStatutory equals
       0.25. Otherwise, PseudoStatutory equals zero.

•      If NOL equals zero and pretax income is nonnegative, then Uniform equals 0.35. If
       NOL is zero and pretax income is negative, then Uniform equals 0.11667. If NOL is
       positive and pretax income is positive, then Uniform equals 0.23333. Otherwise,
       Uniform equals zero.

           As previously described, we construct prefinancing versions of the variables in

which we first add interest expense (Compustat #15) back to pretax income prior to

testing whether income is a profit or a loss. As expected, the prefinancing marginal tax

rate proxies are slightly larger than each of their post-financing equivalents (e.g., mean

Trichotomous is 0.275, but mean Trichotomous (prefinancing) is 0.283). The higher

mean for the prefinancing version reflects the fact that some firms have a profit before

interest expense but a loss after interest expense.

           The tax return simulated marginal tax rate, TaxSimMTR, has a mean of 0.295 and


11
     Plesko (2003) refers to this variable as Statutory but we re-label it PseudoStatutory.


                                                                                              17
a maximum of 0.390. We also use actual tax return data from 1999-2004 to construct a

forward-looking (relative to 1998) categorical variable, FutureSimple, based on realized

future taxable income and defined as follows:

•    If net income (tax return Line 28) minus NOL and special deductions (Lines 29a and
     29b) is less than or equal to zero, then FutureSimple equals zero (but if the firm pays
     Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), FutureSimple equals 0.02). If net income minus
     NOL and special deductions is greater than zero, FutureSimple equals 0.35 (but if the
     firm pays AMT, FutureSimple equals 0.20).

        This definition captures two key features of the tax code: the top statutory rate and

the AMT rate (as well as NOL deduction limits for AMT). If a firm does not have a

taxable profit, we assign a tax rate of zero unless the firm pays AMT, in which case we

assign a tax rate of 2 percent.12 We generally assign the top statutory rate (35 percent) to

profitable firms. However, if a profitable firm pays AMT, we assign the 20 percent AMT

rate to that firm, assuming that the firm is in a range where preferences and deductions

make 20 percent of AMT income greater than 35 percent of regular taxable income.

        We calculate FutureSimple rates for 2000 and 2003, and the average discounted

tax rate (AvgDiscountedFutureSimple1999-2004) based on a 7.5 percent annual discount

rate (the approximate Moody’s corporate bond rate for 1999 to 2004). FutureSimple2000

(0.221), has a higher mean than FutureSimple2003 (0.189), consistent with 2000 being

more economically robust.

        Table 2, Panel B presents additional summary statistics (expressed in millions of

dollars). Our firms are large, with median book assets of $400 million and mean assets




12
  Because we do not have all the detail from the AMT form available to us, we cannot be sure that the
AMT paid by loss firms arises due to the NOL deduction limitation, but we believe this to be a reasonable
assumption.


                                                                                                       18
much larger.13 Median pretax income per books ($27 million) exceeds taxable income

($17 million). Consistent with off-balance-sheet financing or preferences to place

external and/or intercompany debt in the U.S., mean tax deductions for interest ($78

million) are higher than worldwide interest expense on the financial statement ($53

million), although median interest amounts are no different ($9 million each for book and

tax). These interest expense differences likely contribute to book income exceeding

taxable income.

        About one-fifth of our sample has losses, as captured by the following dummy

variables: worldwide pretax loss (BookLossDummy) 18.2 percent, U.S. pretax loss

(USBooklossDummy) 20.1 percent, and taxable loss (Taxloss) 22 percent. Although one-

fourth of the sample discloses a net operating loss carryforward on its financial

statements, only 7.6 percent has both a current year book loss and an NOL carryforward.

A much higher proportion of the tax returns have available NOLs on the tax return (45

percent). Because NOLs acquired from target subsidiaries are difficult to use (due to

Internal Revenue Code section 381 and 382 limitations), NOLs that are immaterial for

financial statement disclosure can persist on the tax return for many years.

        The sample firms have significant multinational activity: 35.3 percent have

foreign pretax book income greater than five percent of worldwide pretax book income in

absolute value, and 38.5 percent claim a foreign tax credit on the U.S. tax return. Sample

firms generally report a current effective tax rate on U.S. income (USETR) below the

statutory rate. Mean USETR is only 22.1 percent, and 22.4 percent of our sample firms

have an USETR below 10 percent.


13
   Book assets from the tax return are larger than consolidated financial statement assets because some
firms do not post elimination entries when preparing the Schedule L balance sheet (Boynton et al. 2004).


                                                                                                           19
4.1 Correlation between financial statement and tax return marginal tax rates

       Table 3 quantifies the relation between financial statement and tax return MTRs.

The first column presents the correlations of TaxSimMTR with BookSimMTR and the

other financial statement tax variables. In Panel A (Panel B), all variables are defined on

a post-financing (prefinancing) basis. The correlation between TaxSimMTR and

BookSimMTR is 67.1 percent in our test sample (Panel A). This correlation is relatively

high considering likely consolidation differences and other issues described in Section 3.

       Figure 2 displays the relation between TaxSimMTR and BookSimMTR. Most

observations cluster near zero percent and the top statutory rates, reflecting the high

correlation between the two tax rates; however, there are only a few clustered

observations along the interior diagonal. The main disconnect between BookSimMTR and

TaxSimMTR occurs along the back row of Figure 2, where book MTRs are high but tax

MTRs vary across the board for these same observations. This reflects that worldwide

imputed taxable income based on financial statement data often exceeds taxable income

from the U.S. tax return (consistent with the means presented in Table 2, Panel B). We

conjecture that another contributing factor is that we exclude discontinued operations and

extraordinary items from income in the book simulations but cannot do the same for the

tax simulations. Including such items increases the volatility of income (Lipe 1986) and

decreases the level of income (Collins et al. 1997), leading to TaxSimMTR having more

variation and lower values relative to BookSimMTR.

       If we limit the sample to the 45 observations for which the financial statement

enterprise likely equals the tax enterprise (per Plesko’s 2003 screens) the correlation




                                                                                        20
between TaxSimMTR and BookSimMTR increases to 97 percent (untabulated).14 This

high correlation arises because Plesko’s screens result in a sample of homogenous firms.

         Other common financial statement proxies are not as highly correlated with

TaxSimMTR. The worst proxy for our sample is one of the most commonly used in

academic research: the net operating loss dummy variable (Binary1, ρ = 0.223).

TaxSimMTR is more highly correlated with the financial proxies that assign a top

marginal tax rate only if a corporation has neither a current year loss nor an NOL. For

example, Binary2 is more highly correlated with TaxSimMTR (ρ = 0.483). However,

Binary2 performs worse than the remaining variables, presumably because Binary2

equals zero whenever a firm has an NOL, a loss, or both. Thus, Binary2 can be zero for

firms that have a profit, just like Binary1. Trichotomous, PseudoStatutory and Uniform

all assign the maximum statutory rate when the corporation has positive income with no

NOL, and assign a zero marginal rate when the corporation has both an NOL and a loss.

Although they differ slightly in the presence of either an NOL or a loss, but not both, the

correlations all improve over Binary1 and Binary2. The correlations of TaxSimMTR with

Trichotomous, PseudoStatutory, and Uniform are 0.556, 0.632 and 0.633, respectively.

         In the second, third and fourth columns of Table 3, Panel A, we compare 1998

values for various tax variables to FutureSimple tax rates that are based on actual future

taxable income in 1999 to 2004. TaxSimMTR is highly correlated with all the

FutureSimple rates (ρ = 0.564, 0.384, and 0.600), which indicates that ignoring AMT in

14
   We replicate the screens imposed by Plesko (2003) in turn. In all cases BookSimMTR is more correlated
with TaxSimMTR than are the other financial statement proxies. First, ρ = 78 percent for the 459
observations that have financial statement assets within 0.5 percent of their book assets reported on the tax
return, Form 1120, Schedule L. Results are unchanged when we drop one observation that is a domestic
subsidiary of another taxpayer and 63 observations for taxpayers that are owned 50 percent or more by
another corporation. After we drop another 138 observations for firms that have controlled foreign
corporations, ρ = 76 percent for the remaining 257 observations.


                                                                                                           21
the simulation is not a major deficiency. BookSimMTR is also highly correlated with

FutureSimple, attenuating concerns that the strong relations between tax return MTRs

and the book simulated MTR might be driven by mechanical artifacts (such as using a

common discount rate or common historical period to simulate both book and tax MTRs).

Of the other variables based on financial statements, Uniform is the most highly

correlated with the FutureSimple measures.

       Table 3, Panel B repeats the exercise for all the correlations based on prefinancing

income. PreIntBookSimMTR is highly correlated (ρ=0.760) with prefinancing

TaxSimMTR, more so than correlations for the other prefinancing MTR proxies.

BookSimMTR and TaxSimMTR are more highly correlated on a prefinancing basis (in

Panel B) than on a post-financing basis (in Panel A), suggesting that book-tax differences

in interest expense make it difficult to estimate U.S. taxable income from financial

statements (as previously documented in Mills and Newberry 2005). Analogous to the

post-financing results, the book net operating loss (Binary1) is the worst proxy for the

prefinancing TaxSimMTR (ρ = 0.177).

       To construct prefinancing FutureSimple, we add interest deductions (Line 15) to

income prior to evaluating loss or profit for the zero and 35 percent rates.

PreIntBookSimMTR is highly correlated with each of the prefinancing versions of

FutureSimple 2000, FutureSimple 2003 and AvgDiscountedFutureSimple1999-2004 (ρ =

0.428, 0.335 and 0.520, respectively). All the prefinancing FutureSimple variables are

more correlated with the PreIntBookSimMTR than with the static prefinancing financial

statement proxies (Binary1, Binary2, Trichotomous, PseudoStatutory and Uniform).

       To sum up, Table 3 provides consistent evidence that the Shevlin/Graham



                                                                                        22
simulated book marginal tax rates are reasonable proxies of a firm’s tax return dynamic

tax status (Box 3 of Figure 1) because BookSimMTR is more highly correlated with the

tax return marginal tax rates than are the other book tax variables.

5. Regressions to explain simulated marginal tax rates

         Because a simulated marginal tax rate for the U.S. portion of the enterprise is

appropriate for some research questions, we develop algorithms that use publicly

available data to “predict” TaxSimMTR. We also develop an algorithm to predict

BookSimMTR for situations when it is not available.15 The algorithms include five

explanatory variables that address consolidation differences:

TaxSimMTRit = α0 + α1BookSimMTRit+ α2 USBookLossDummyit + α3

LowUSETRDummyit + α4 NOLDummyit + α5 BookLossDummyit + α6

ForeignActivityDummyit + εit,

or

BookSimMTRi = α0 + α1 LowUSETRDummyit + α2 NOLDummyit

+ α3 BookLossDummyit + α4 ForeignActivityDummyit + εit,

where

TaxSimMTR and BookSimMTR are the tax and book simulated tax rates.
USBookLossDummy =1 if Compustat #272 (or, #170 if #272 missing) < 0, zero
otherwise.
LowUSETRDummy = 1 if #63/#272 (or, #16/#170 if missing) < 10 percent, zero
otherwise.
NOLDummy =1 if #52 > 0, zero otherwise.
BookLossDummy = 1 if nonmissing #170 < 0, zero otherwise.


15
  In 2005, there are 6,937 firms on Compusat with nonmissing assets and nonmissing firm identifiers.
Graham’s website provides simulated book MTRs for 4,518 of these firms (based on GVKEY matching).
That is, there are 2,523 Compustat firms that do not have a 2005 Graham simulated MTR match. These
observations are missing either because the firm is new to Compustat and therefore has insufficient
historical data to run the simulation (1,408 firms) or otherwise has missing data for one or more of the key
input variables in the simulation procedure.


                                                                                                          23
ForeignActivityDummy = 1 if |#273/#170| > 5 percent, zero otherwise.

       Two of these variables are specifically related to the U.S. entities. We include

U.S. book losses and low U.S. current effective tax rates because our univariate analysis

revealed mismatches with high BookSimMTR but near-zero TaxSimMTR (see Figure 2).

In the TaxSimMTR specification, we include USBookLossDummy, which indicates a U.S.

pretax loss, because the corporation could lose money in its U.S. jurisdiction even if it

had worldwide profits. In all the models, we include LowUSETRDummy, an indicator for

an average U.S. current effective tax rate below 10 percent. With this variable, we

capture the presence of U.S. permanent differences that the simulation ignores and any

U.S. temporary differences that vary substantially from the worldwide temporary

differences that the simulation already incorporates. To the extent that such U.S.-specific

differences decrease U.S. taxable income, TaxSimMTR will be lower than BookSimMTR,

leading to negative coefficients on USLossDummy and LowUSETRDummy.

       We include ForeignActivityDummy to capture the presence of substantial foreign

income, although we make no prediction about its sign. TaxSimMTR could exceed

BookSimMTR if foreign losses or intercompany payments make U.S. taxable income

higher than worldwide financial statement income or if multinational firms have high

TaxSimMTR because of their size. Alternatively, if intercompany payments out of the

U.S. exceed payments into the U.S., TaxSimMTR could be lower.

       Because we also estimate regressions of TaxSimMTR without BookSimMTR as an

explanatory variable, and we estimate BookSimMTR separately, we include NOLDummy

and BookLossDummy. We expect the coefficients on these variables to be negative when

we estimate TaxSimMTR without BookSimMTR, as well as when we model BookSimMTR




                                                                                        24
as a dependent variable. We are unsure whether these variables will improve the fit of

TaxSimMTR in the specification that includes BookSimMTR.

5.1 Regression results

        Table 4 presents regression estimates. Panel A uses post-financing marginal tax

rates, and Panel B uses prefinancing rates. In Model A, we regress TaxSimMTR on

BookSimMTR and additional publicly-available variables. The intercept is 0.21, and the

slope coefficient on BookSimMTR is 0.379. By comparison, untabulated univariate

regressions of TaxSimMTR on BookSimMTR alone generate an intercept of 0.079 and a

slope coefficient of 0.709. The adjusted R2 increases from 45 percent in the untabulated

univariate regression to 58 percent in the multivariate regression shown in Panel A.

        Model A indicates that negative U.S. pretax income (USBookLossDummy) is

significantly associated with a lower TaxSimMTR (coefficient = -0.042, t = -3.63). The

negative relation is consistent with U.S. taxable income being negative if U.S. pretax

income is negative, even in those cases where a multinational is profitable on a

worldwide basis. LowUSETRDummy is strongly negatively associated with TaxSimMTR

(coefficient= -0.053, t-statistic = -10.47). We infer that the average current effective tax

rate helps to incorporate permanent differences that the simulation cannot easily

estimate.16 NOLDummy and BookLossDummy are both negatively related to the

dependent variable even though BookSimMTR is already in the regression. TaxSimMTR

could be lower for firms that have prior or current book losses because our tax return



16
  In untabulated tests, we also include a proxy for corporate tax deductions for exercises of nonqualified
stock options, which would decrease taxable income relative to book income. The tax return only requires
stock option information starting in 2003. We use the 2003 tax return Schedule M-1 book-tax difference
scaled by assets as a proxy for substantial option deductions. This proxy is negatively associated with
TaxSimMTR with a t-statistic of -3.00. The backward-looking proxy is undoubtedly extremely noisy, but
suggests that better stock option data could improve marginal tax rate simulations.


                                                                                                        25
taxable income includes all sources of loss, including any extraordinary items and

discontinued operations that the book forecast of taxable income excludes. Finally,

TaxSimMTR is higher in the presence of substantial foreign pretax income. We conjecture

that foreign income could proxy for size or repatriations, making U.S. taxable income

higher or more consistently profitable than worldwide net income.

         In untabulated tests, we find that a wide-scale data-fitting exercise that includes

additional Compustat variables does not improve the fit in a stable, informative manner.17

We conclude that the coefficient estimates in the parsimonious Model A of Table 4 can

be used to create a reasonable approximation of the simulated tax return MTR for

researchers without access to Treasury data.

         We also estimate TaxSimMTR without BookSimMTR for cases where

BookSimMTR is missing. Model B in Table 4, Panel A shows that the R2 falls to 51

percent, but the overall fit remains strong and the coefficients are similar in magnitude

and significance.

         Model C shows that the categorical variables are also useful in estimating the

BookSimMTR. Researchers who would like to use a simulated book MTR but find it

unavailable for certain firms or in certain years can use the coefficients in Model C to

estimate the MTR.

         Our results (untabulated) are unchanged if we include industry (1-digit SIC) and

year controls, and the coefficients on the industry and year dummies are insignificant.


17
   We consider 58 additional candidate explanatory variables from the income statement, balance sheet, and
statement of cash flow (list of variables is available on request). Using ordinary least squares forward
selection, we evaluate each of these variables. Only about ten variables meet the 0.01 significance level. As
in the main specification, BookSimMTR and the dummy variables for having negative U.S. pretax book
income (book net operating loss carryforward and negative pretax book income) are among these top ten
variables; however, the new significant variables are sensitive to the sample (test versus holdout), so we do
not pursue this analysis any further.


                                                                                                          26
This suggests that our explanatory variables work reasonably well across industries and

our three-year time period. We also estimate our main regression (Table 4, Panel A,

Model A) by industry (1-digit SIC) and by year. Only for SIC1 = 6, financial services, is

the regression fit substantially different, with the R2 decreasing to 25 percent. Our main

results are robust to omitting the 61 firm-year financial services observations.

       Panel B of Table 4 presents the results for an analogous set of regressions to

estimate prefinancing MTRs. Results are qualitatively the same as in Panel A. Consistent

with univariate results from Table 3, TaxSimMTR is more closely associated with

BookSimMTR on a prefinancing basis than on a post-financing basis, as indicated by the

larger t-statistic in Panel B. As before, researchers who would like to use a simulated

prefinancing book MTR but find it unavailable could use the coefficients in Model C to

estimate BookSimMTR.

5.2 Analysis using the holdout sample

       In Table 5, we report holdout sample correlations between the various tax

variables and TaxSimMTR. Because Table 4 presents only the significant variables from

among several candidate regression specifications, it is important to determine whether

the implications are consistent in the holdout sample.

       We compute EST_TaxSimMTR by interacting the regression coefficients

estimated in Model A of Table 4 with the applicable variable values for the holdout

observations. EST_TaxSimMTR is highly correlated (75.1 percent) with TaxSimMTR in

the holdout sample. The 75 percent correlation is equivalent to a univariate regression R2

of 56.25 percent, and recall that the R2 of the predictive regression in Table 3 was 58

percent. Thus, most of the model’s predictive ability carries over to the holdout sample,




                                                                                       27
indicating that our findings are not driven by data snooping.

         The holdout results also shed further light on the univariate relations between the

various variables. As in Table 3, BookSimMTR is more highly correlated (65.3 percent)

with TaxSimMTR than are the other financial statement proxies (highest correlation

equals 63.7 percent).

         We replicate these tests on a prefinancing basis in the second column of Table 5.

The results are remarkably similar. The prefinancing EST_TaxSimMTR is strongly

correlated (ρ = 0.723) with the prefinancing TaxSimMTR in the holdout sample. Like in

the test sample, BookSimMTR is more highly correlated on a prefinancing basis with

TaxSimMTR than on a post-financing basis. Similarly, the prefinancing BookSimMTR is

more highly correlated with prefinancing TaxSimMTR than are the other prefinancing

financial statement tax variables.

6. Tax credits and the alternative minimum tax

         Our simulation model is based on regular taxable income. Although we simulate

income paths and permit loss carrybacks and carryforwards, we ignore tax credits and the

alternative minimum tax. In this section, we explain why we believe our simulated rates

are reasonable without considering credits and AMT.

         Few firms have tax credits that shield a substantial proportion of tax.18 In

untabulated tests, 30 percent of the firms in our sample have no tax credits on their tax

returns. Further, the firms with the largest proportional credits also have the highest

taxable income and the highest foreign tax credits. On average, for firms in the top one-

fifth of pretax income, total credits shield 34 percent of tax, and foreign tax credits alone


18
  Of the 1,409 observations that report credits, the 95th percentile of credits to total tax is 82 percent and
the 99th percentile is 94 percent.


                                                                                                                 28
shield 31 percent of tax. Thus, most of the credits for large firms are foreign tax credits,

which should not generally reduce the marginal income tax rate on a dollar of U.S. source

income.19 The evidence implies that the tax rates that we simulate are likely similar to

the marginal tax rates one would obtain if one were to simulate tax rates including the

effects of tax credits.

         Our simulations also ignore the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).20 Untabulated

tests using tax return data indicate that firms that pay AMT often claim a NOL deduction

(ρ = 0.35). Because our simulation likely assigns a low MTR to firms whose regular

income is sheltered by carryforward losses, we have not misstated the MTR materially by

ignoring AMT. If a firm pays AMT because of the NOL limitation, the tax rate is

effectively two percent. Thus, we do not introduce much error by assigning a zero percent

MTR rather than the present value of a two percent temporary AMT rate.21 Recall also

that in Table 3, TaxSimMTR (which ignores AMT) is highly correlated with the

FutureSimple tax rates that incorporate AMT, again indicating that ignoring AMT in the

simulations does not appear to cause significant problems.

7. Which marginal tax rate best captures capital structure tax incentives?

         In this section, we test the relative power of prefinancing BookSimMTR and

TaxSimMTR to explain capital structure. As in most extant research, we measure capital

19
   We acknowledge that foreign tax credits can affect the marginal benefit of an additional dollar of interest
deduction (Newberry 1998 and Graham 2003).
20
   Graham (1996a) developed his simulated rates shortly after the Tax Reform Act of 1986 created a new
AMT adjustment for half of any positive difference between book and taxable income, which was easy to
model in the simulation program. This adjustment expired in 1990 and was replaced by an adjustment that
is 75 percent of the gap between taxable income and adjusted current earnings (ACE). Because ACE is
closer to taxable income and the adjustment can be positive or negative, we do not explicitly account for
AMT in our simulations.
21
   Also, the AMT is a temporary tax that reverses through a credit when the taxpayer pays regular tax. Both
BookSimMTR and TaxSimMTR are significantly, negatively correlated (-44 percent and -45 percent) with
the ratio of AMT to tax before credits in untabulated tests. Thus, the simulated MTRs are already low for
firms subject to AMT, further confirming the reasonableness of a simulation that ignores AMT.


                                                                                                           29
structure with financial statement debt ratios. The trade-off theory of capital structure

predicts that firms with high marginal tax rates should use more debt than firms with low

tax rates because the benefit of interest deductions is greater for high tax rate firms.

         Despite this straightforward prediction, empirically testing for tax effects is

difficult because a spurious relation can exist between the financing decision and many

tax variables. Specifically, interest expense is tax deductible, so a firm that finances its

operations with debt reduces its taxable income, potentially reducing its expected

marginal tax rate. If not properly addressed, this endogeneity of the tax rate can bias an

experiment against finding a positive relation between debt ratios and taxes. To avoid this

difficulty, we follow Graham et al. (1998) and use a prefinancing measure of the

corporate MTR (that is based on taxable income before interest deductions) because it is

not endogenously affected by financing decisions. This allows us to regress debt ratios on

tax rates without concern of the possibility of a spurious negative relation.

         We model leverage (debt to book value of assets in one specification and debt to

market value of assets in another) as a function of the prefinancing MTR and control

variables:

Leverageit = b0 + b1 PrefinancingMTRit + b2 LagSalesit + b3 LagMarketToBookit

+b4 LagDividendit + b5 LagROAit + b6 LagCollateralit + eit ,

where

Leverage = total debt (Compustat item #9 + #34), scaled by total assets (#6) in one
       specification, or by market value of assets (total assets minus book equity plus
       market equity (#6 - #60 + #199*#25)) in a second specification.22
PrefinancingMTR = PreIntBookSimMTR or PreIntTaxSimMTR.

22
  Like Mills and Newberry (2005), we do not use leverage ratios from the tax return Schedule L balance
sheet because Schedule L is supposed to be a book balance sheet. Further, the assets and liabilities often
exceed the worldwide consolidated book amounts, a surprising result that arises from some firms not
posting consolidation elimination entries (Boynton et al. 2004).


                                                                                                             30
LagSales = one-year lag of book sales (#12)
LagMarketToBook = the lagged ratio of market value of equity (#199*#25) to book value
      of equity (#60).
LagDividend = 1 if the lagged dividend yield (#26*100/#199) is positive, zero otherwise.
LagROA = lagged return on assets (#18/#6).
LagCollateral = the lagged ratio of receivables and property (#3+#8) to assets (#6).

           To aid comparison across specifications, we limit the sample to the 1,771

observations that have nonmissing data in all specifications. We expect the simulated

book MTR to be better than the simulated U.S. tax return MTR at explaining leverage

because, like all Compustat-based research, we define leverage with financial statement

data. As discussed above, TaxSimMTR is based on U.S. taxable income, where only

domestic corporations owned 80 percent or more are included as affiliates of the U.S.

parent, and therefore is defined on a different basis than the dependent variable.

           Table 6 shows that PreIntBookSimMTR is strongly positively related to the debt to

assets ratio (coeff = 0.294, t = 4.50). The 0.294 coefficient on PreIntBookSimMTR in the

debt/assets specification indicates that a one standard deviation increase in the tax

variable leads to a debt ratio that is two percentage points higher. For example, if a firm

with the sample mean tax rate (0.305) has the sample mean debt ratio (0.26), then if its

MTR were one standard deviation (0.102) higher, its debt ratio would change to 0.29

(=0.26+0.294*0.102). We also find that PreIntTaxSimMTR is positively related to the

debt to assets ratio (coeff = 0.138, t = 2.02). The explanatory power of the book MTR

regression (R2 = 7.3%) exceeds the explanatory power of the tax MTR regression (R2 =

6.4%) based on a Vuong (1989) test (p-value = 0.0496).23

           PreIntBookSimMTR is strongly, positively related to the debt to market value ratio

(coeff = 0.433, t = 7.73). Likewise, PreIntTaxSimMTR is positively related to the debt to

                                                                                          31
market value ratio (coeff = 0.271, t = 4.59). As above, the R2 (11.4%) of the book MTR

regression exceeds the R2 (9.5%) of the tax MTR regression based on a Vuong (1989)

test (p-value = 0.0048). The bottom line is that the book simulated MTR appears to best

measure worldwide capital structure tax incentives in our sample, leading us to conclude

that researchers can continue to use book simulated rates in most capital structure

settings.24 This result highlights that tax return data are not the “holy grail” in all

experiments, and in fact measuring tax incentives with book data is preferred in some

settings (as summarized in Figure 1).

8. Conclusion

         Companies likely consider their tax return MTRs when making many decisions

but tax returns are not publicly available to researchers investigating those decisions.

Therefore, most researchers measure corporate tax incentives using financial statement

data. In this paper we access corporate tax return data to simulate a MTR that captures

dynamic tax return effects. We compare financial statement tax variables to this (usually

unavailable) dynamic tax return MTR to determine which, if any, book MTRs can be

used to reliably proxy for the tax return variable when it is unavailable.

         We find the simulated financial statement MTR (of Shevlin (1990) and Graham

(1996a)) is the best financial statement-based tax rate in terms of most closely

approximating the simulated tax return MTR. Thus, our recommendation is that


24
   In untabulated tests, we consider two other tax rate variables: 1) The presence of a net operating loss,
disclosed either in the financial statements (Compustat #52) or on the tax return (Schedule K); 2) the
average tax rate, either worldwide current tax expense divided by pretax income (Compustat #16/#170), or
tax after credits divided by net income (line 28 on the tax return), computed for observations with positive
numerators and denominators. The alternative tax variables do not perform well. Firms with NOLs have
higher leverage, opposite the predicted relation. The current worldwide book effective tax rate is positively
related to leverage, as predicted, but the tax return average effective tax rate is negatively related. We
conclude that both of these tax variables are poor measures of debt tax incentives. Further details are
available on request.


                                                                                                          32
researchers use the simulated book MTR when it is available, assuming that dynamic tax

rates are appropriate for a given research setting (see Figure 1). Because the simulated

MTR is not always available, we provide coefficients that can be used to create a

“predicted” book simulated MTR when it is missing.

       We also discuss how different tax rates (book versus tax; dynamic versus static)

might be preferred in different experimental settings. For example, we find that financial

statement debt ratios, which arguably are the variable under consideration in many capital

structure decisions, are highly correlated with the book simulated MTR, consistent with

the appropriateness of this tax variable in this setting. In contrast, in other settings, such

as transfer-pricing or the issuance of U.S. debt, dynamic tax return MTRs best capture

corporate tax incentives, and therefore a simulated tax return MTR would be most

appropriate. Because tax return data are often not publicly available, we provide

coefficients that can be used to create a “predicted” dynamic tax return MTR.

       Finally, as summarized in Figure 1, we also discuss which tax rates might affect

decisions in short-term or myopic research settings, such as decisions by retiring

executives. Future research is needed to more thoroughly investigate the appropriate tax

variable that is or should be used in these short-term settings.

  Pre-financing vs. Post-financing: Pre-financing MTRs remove the effect of past financing decisions (that are still part of existing capital structure) and are
  appropriate to use when the dependent variable is a stock measure of capital structure (like a debt ratio). Post-financing tax rates are based income after interest
  deductions and are the appropriate MTRs in most other settings, including those in which the dependent variable measures future incremental financing choices.

  Effective Tax Rates: Accounting-based effective tax rates measure the average tax burden and are typically measured as tax divided by income. See Plesko
  2003 for discussions of various numerators (current vs. total tax, U.S. versus worldwide) and denominators (U.S. versus worldwide, with or without adjustments).



 Figure 1 – Marginal corporate income tax rate to use in different empirical settings. This chart summarizes various corporate income
 tax rate variables and the setting in which each is appropriate. This chart is not intended to be used as a cookbook. The specific theoretical
 and empirical circumstances must be considered to determine the best MTR variable in any particular setting. The figure dichotomizes on
 worldwide vs. domestic because due to consolidation rules, financial statement (“book”) data generally represent the worldwide operations
 of a firm, while tax return data generally represent domestic income only. The short-term considerations depicted in the figure represent
 situations where a company responds to short-term tax incentives, sometimes optimally and sometimes because the decision-makers
 are overly focused on the short-run. In either case, short-term tax variables could be empirically correlated with the company’s decisions.    36

TaxSimMTR and BookSimMTR represent simulated marginal tax rates using tax return data or Compustat
financial statement data, respectively. The simulation follows and adapts Graham’s (1996a) method. The
tax rates are simulated to account for the effect of tax-loss carrybacks and carryforwards on the present
value tax liability of adding an extra dollar of current period taxable income.

Table 1 – Sample Composition Summarized by Year and Industry

This table identifies the year and industry for the observations in our full sample. The sample of 3,667 firm-year observations is
derived from the U.S. Department of Treasury’s matched file of Compustat and tax return data for which a panel of firms from 1992-
2000 is available. We limit our tests to 1998-2000 to consider years when the net operating loss rules consistently carryback two years
and carryforward 20 years.

Table 2 – Descriptive statistics for the matched Compustat and tax return test sample of 1,833 firm-year observations in 1998, 1999
and 2000. Panel A describes the key tax variables. BookSimMTR is the simulated marginal tax rate using Compustat data, following
and adapting Graham (1996a). The simulated marginal tax rates are simulated to account for the effect of tax-loss carrybacks and
carryforwards on the present value tax liability of adding an extra dollar of current period taxable income. If beginning net operating
loss carryforward (prior year Compustat data item #52) equals zero, then Binary1 equals 0.35. Otherwise, Binary1 equals 0. For the
other categorical variables, pretax income is generally Compustat data item #170, but for the prefinancing variables pretax income is
before interest, #170 + #15. If beginning net operating loss carryforward equals zero and pretax income is nonnegative, then Binary2
equals 0.35. Otherwise, Binary2 equals 0. If beginning net operating loss carryforward equals zero and pretax income is nonnegative,
then Trichotomous equals 0.35. If beginning net operating loss carryforward is positive and pretax income is negative, then
Trichotomous equals zero. Otherwise, Trichotomous equals 0.17. If beginning net operating loss carryforward equals zero and pretax
income is nonnegative, then PseudoStatutory equals 0.35. If beginning net operating loss carryforward is zero and pretax income is
negative, then PseudoStatutory equals 0.15. If beginning net operating loss carryforward is positive and pretax income is positive, then
PseudoStatutory equals 0.25. Otherwise, PseudoStatutory equals zero. If beginning net operating loss carryforward equals zero and
pretax income is nonnegative, then Uniform equals 0.35. If beginning net operating loss carryforward is zero and pretax income is
negative, then Uniform equals 0.11667. If beginning net operating loss carryforward is positive and pretax income is positive, then
Uniform equals 0.23333. Otherwise, Uniform equals zero.

TaxSimMTR represents simulated marginal tax rates using tax return data, adapted as described in the text. If net income (tax return
Line 28) less NOL and special deductions (Lines 29 a and b) is less than or equal to zero, then FutureSimple equals zero, but if
Alternative Minimum Tax exceeds zero FutureSimple equals 2 percent. If net income less NOL and special deductions is greater than
zero, FutureSimple equals 35 percent, but if Alternative Minimum Tax exceeds zero FutureSimple equals 20 percent.
FutureSimple2000 and FutureSimple2003 are the year 2000 and 2003 values of FutureSimple. AvgDiscountedFutureSimple1999-2004
is the average of FutureSimple for each year 1999-2004 discounted to 1998, using a discount rate of 7.5 percent, the approximate
Moody’s corporate bond rate for that period. Panel B describes various financial statement and tax return (Form 1120) characteristics
of our test sample, where variables are defined within the table.

Table 3 – Pearson correlation coefficients between the tax return simulated marginal tax rate
(TaxSimMTR), and naïve actual simple forecast tax return rates, with financial statement measures of
marginal tax rates. Variables are defined in Table 2. We use our test sample of 1,833 firm-year
observations from 1998-2000 for the correlations with TaxSimMTR and use observations from 1998
only for the correlations with the FutureSimple foresight rates. All correlations are significant at <
0.0001 p-value.

Panel A, All marginal tax rates are post-financing, reflecting actual interest deductions.

Panel B, All marginal tax rates are prefinancing marginal tax rates and permit no interest deductions.
For the naïve FutureSimple marginal tax rate, we recompute taxable income on a prefinancing basis
to determine whether the company is in a loss (0 percent rate or 2 percent with AMT) or profit (35
percent rate or 20 percent with AMT).

Table 4 – Ordinary least squares regression of the simulated MTRs on financial statement variables for a test sample of 1,833 firm-
year observations in 1998, 1999 and 2000. Table 4 coefficient estimates in Models A and B can be used to predict the simulated tax
return marginal tax rate (TaxSimMTR) using financial statement variables, and Model C coefficients can be used to “predict” the
simulated book MTR. Variables are defined in Table 2 or in the table below. Panel A uses post-financing marginal tax rates that allow
100 percent of interest deductions. Panel B uses prefinancing marginal tax rates that allow 0 percent of interest deductions.

the estimated tax return MTR (EST_TaxSimMTR) and other financial MTR measures
using holdout samples of 1,834 post-financing and 1,963 prefinancing observations from
1998-2000. The estimated tax return MTR (EST_TaxSimMTR) is calculated using
coefficients estimated from the test sample in Table 4, Model A, Panels A and B. The
first column presents correlations for the post-financing tax rates, and the second column
presents correlations for the prefinancing tax rates. All correlations are significant at <
0.0001 p-value.

Table 6 – Estimates of pooled ordinary least squares regressions of debt ratios on
prefinancing simulated marginal tax rates and controls for leverage, using a test
sample of 1,771 firm-year observations in 1998, 1999 and 2000, limited to
observations that are not missing in any specification. PreIntBookSimMTR and
PreIntTaxSimMTR are measured before interest to avoid the spurious negative
correlation between income after interest and debt usage (Graham, Lemmon, and
Schallheim 1998). All other variables use financial statement Compustat data.
Leverage = total debt (Compustat item #9 + #34), scaled either by total assets
(#6) or by book assets minus book equity plus market equity (#6 - #60 +
#199*#25). LagSales = one-year lag of book sales (#12) in thousands.
LagMarketToBook = one year lag of market value of equity (#199*#25) divided
by book value of equity (#60). LagDividend = 1 if the one year lag of dividend
yield (#26*100/#199) is positive, zero otherwise. LagROA = one year lag of
return on assets (#18/#6). LagCollateral = one year lag of the ratio of inventory
and property (#3+#8) to assets (#6).
