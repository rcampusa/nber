                                           ABSTRACT

Eliciting time preferences has become an important component of both laboratory and field experiments,
yet there is no consensus as how to best measure discounting. We examine the predictive validity of
two recent, simple, easily administered, and individually successful elicitation tools: Convex Time
Budgets (CTB) and Double Multiple Price Lists (DMPL). Using similar methods, the CTB and DMPL
are compared using within- and out-of-sample predictions. While each perform equally well within
sample, the CTB significantly outperforms the DMPL on out-of-sample measures.

I     Introduction
Time preferences are fundamental to theoretical and applied studies of decision-making, and
are a critical element of much of economic analysis. At both the aggregate and individual
level, accurate measures of discounting parameters can provide helpful guidance on the
potential impacts of policy and provide useful diagnostics for effective policy targeting.
    Though efforts have been made to identify time preferences from naturally occurring
field data,1 the majority of research has relied on laboratory samples using variation in
monetary payments.2 Despite many attempts, however, the experimental community lacks
a clear consensus on how best to measure time preferences; a point made clear by Freder-
ick, Loewenstein and O’Donoghue (2002). One natural challenge which has gained recent
attention is the confounding effect of utility function curvature. Typically, linear utility is
assumed for identification, invoking expected utility’s necessity of linearity for small stakes
decisions (Rabin, 2000). In an important recent contribution, Andersen et al. (2008) show
that if utility is assumed to be linear in experimental payoffs when it is truly concave, esti-
mated discount rates will be biased upwards.3 This observation has reset the investigation
of new elicitation tools.
    1
      These methods investigate time preferences by examining durable goods purchases, consumption profiles
or annuity choices (Hausman, 1979; Lawrance, 1991; Warner and Pleeter, 2001; Gourinchas and Parker, 2002;
Cagetti, 2003; Laibson, Repetto and Tobacman, 2003, 2007). While there is clear value to these methods
they may not be practical for field settings with limited data sources or where subjects make few comparable
choices.
    2
      Chabris, Laibson and Schuldt (2008) identify several important issues related to this research agenda,
calling into question the mapping from experimental choice to corresponding model parameters in monetary
discounting experiments. Paramount among these issues are clear arbitrage arguments such that responses
in monetary experiments should reveal only the interval of borrowing and lending rates, and thus limited
heterogeneity in behavior if subjects face similar credit markets (Cubitt and Read, 2007; Andreoni and
Sprenger, 2012a, 2012b). This last concern may be beyond the reach of most experimental samples. Evidence
from Coller and Williams (1999) suggests that even when the entire arbitrage argument is explained to
subjects, heterogeneity remains and responses do not collapse to reasonable intervals of borrowing and
lending rates. Following most of the literature, the experiments we conduct will focus on monetary choices,
taking the laboratory offered rates as the relevant ones for choice. Importantly, the methods we describe are
easily portable to other domains with less prominent fungibility problems. One recent example using the
Convex Time Budget described below with choices over effort is Augenblick, Niederle, and Sprenger (2013).
    3
      Frederick, Loewenstein and O’Donoghue (2002) also provide discussion of this confound and present
three strategies for disentangling utility function curvature from time discounting: 1) eliciting utility judg-
ments such as attractiveness ratings at two points in time; 2) eliciting preferences over temporally separated
probabilistic prospects to exploit the linearity-in-probability property of expected utility; and 3) “separately
elicit the utility function for the good in question, and then use that function transform outcome amounts to
utility amounts, from which utility discount rates could be compute” (p. 382). The third of these techniques
is close in spirit to the Double Multiple Price List implemented by Andersen et al. (2008) described below.


                                                       1
       Andersen, et al. (2008) (henceforth AHLR) offer the clever use of measures of risk
taking to incorporate utility function curvature, which we refer to as a Double Multiple
Price List (DMPL). Andreoni and Sprenger (2012a) (henceforth AS) used variation in linear
budget constraints over early and later consumption to identify convexity of preferences,
a device they call a Convex Time Budget (CTB). Both methods show promise, as each is
easy to implement in both the lab and the field, and both are successful at tightly estimating
“credible” values of key parameters. The objective of this study is to work toward a consensus
by comparing these two methods.
       One criterion should, obviously, be simplicity. In particular, researchers eliciting prefer-
ences put a premium on devices that are simple for subjects, easy to administer, transportable
to the field, and can be easily folded into a larger research design. Both methods seem to
succeed equally well on this dimension.
       More central to our analysis, we propose that predictive validity as the the second and
most relevant criterion. In particular, parameter estimates generated from a specific data set
should yield good in-sample fit, have out-of-sample predictive power, and predict relevant,
genuine economic activity.4
       We document two main findings when examining predictive validity. First, we reproduce
the broad conclusions of both AHLR and AS, that is, there are clear confounding effects
of curvature that need to be controlled for in estimating discounting. Second, when taking
these estimates out-of-sample we find that the CTB-based estimates markedly outperform
the DMPL-based estimates when predicting intertemporal choice. We show that the key
driver of these results is the different assumptions employed to identify utility function
curvature–risk aversion (DMPL) versus neo-classical demand theory (CTB). Interestingly,
we find that the relatively large number of corner solutions observed with the CTB (an aspect
of the method criticized by Harrison, Lau and Rutström, 2013) is precisely the quality of
the CTB that generates the greatest improvement in predictive power over the DMPL. The
DMPL greatly over-predicts interior solutions in the CTB, while the CTB is equally good
   4
    Though this seems a natural objective, there are relatively few examples of research linking laboratory
measures of time preference to other behaviors or characteristics (Mischel, Shoda and Rodriguez, 1989;
Ashraf, Karlan and Yin, 2006; Dohmen et al., 2010; Meier and Sprenger, 2010, 2012). These exercises at
times demonstrate the lack of explanatory power for prior time preference estimates (Chabris et al., 2008).



                                                    2
as the DMPL at predicting choices on the MPL for time allocations. In predicting other
experimental choices over time, the DMPL predictions offer no marginal explanatory power,
while CTB estimates are significant predictors.
       Section 2 describes our preference elicitation techniques and experimental protocol. Sec-
tion 3 presents estimation results and evaluates the success of the CTB and DMPL at
predicting choice both in- and out-of-sample. Section 4 concludes.



II        Techniques and Protocol
Before introducing the two considered elicitation techniques, we first outline the nature of
preferences. Consider allocations of experimental payments, xt and xt+k between two periods,
t and t + k. Preferences over these experimental payments are assumed to be captured by
a stationary, time-independent constant relative risk averse utility function u(xt ) = xαt . We
assume a quasi-hyperbolic structure for discounting (Laibson, 1997; O’Donoghue and Rabin,
1999), such that preferences over bundles are described by


                                                xαt + βδ k xαt+k   if t = 0
                             U (xt , xt+k ) =                                                         (1)
                                                xαt + δ k xαt+k    if t > 0.

The parameter δ captures standard long-run exponential discounting, while the parameter
β captures a specific preference towards payments in the present, t = 0. The one period
discount factor between the present and a future period is βδ, while the one period discount
factor between two future periods is δ. Present bias is associated with β < 1 and β = 1
corresponds to the case of standard exponential discounting.5
       We consider two elicitation techniques, the DMPL and the CTB, designed to provide
identification of the three parameters of interest, α, δ, and β, corresponding to utility function
curvature, long-run discounting, and present bias, respectively. Given that any functional
form of utility one estimates will be misspecified to some degree, different methods are likely
to yield different parameter estimates. While these differences are important, our view us
   5
   We abstract away from any discussion of sophistication or naiveté wherein individuals are potentially
aware of their predilection of being more impatient in the present than they are in the future. Our imple-
mented experimental techniques will be unable to distinguish between the two.


                                                      3
that the first concern is to have a method that is useful as a predictive tool for the researcher
community.


II.A        Elicitation Techniques

We begin by presenting the DMPL, which consists of two stages. The first stage is designed
to identify discounting, potentially confounded by utility function curvature. The second
stage is designed to un-confound the first stage by providing information on utility function
curvature through decisions on risky choice. In the first stage, individuals make a series of
binary choices between smaller sooner payments and larger later payments. Such binary
choices are organized into Multiple Price Lists (MPL) in order of increasing gross interest
rate (Coller and Williams, 1999; Harrison Lau and Williams, 2002). The point in each price
list where an individual switches from preferring the smaller sooner payment to the larger
later payment carries interval information on discounting. Figure 1, Panel A, presents a
sample intertemporal MPL.6
       Importantly, one cannot make un-confounded inference for time preferences based on
these intertemporal responses alone. Consider an individual who prefers $X at time t over
$Y at time t + k, but prefers $Y at time t + k over $X’<$X at time t. If t 6= 0 then
one can infer the bounds on δ to be δ ∈ (X 0α /Y α , X α /Y α ). Though standard practice for
identifying δ often (at times implicitly) assumes linear utility, α = 1, it’s clear that a concave
utility function, α < 1, will bias discount factor estimates downwards, understating the true
bounds.7 Further, without some notion of the extent of curvature, one cannot un-confound
the measure. This motivates the second stage.
   6
     This implementation appears slightly different from others for coherence with our implementation of the
CTB. In effect, individuals choose between smaller sooner payments and larger later payments. However,
we clarify that choosing the smaller sooner payment implies a subject will receive zero at the later date, and
vice versa.
   7
     Correspondingly, a convex utility function biases discount factors upwards. A similar issues exists for
identifying β when t = 0.

                                                 Panel B: Holt-Laury Risk Elicitation

                                       Figure 1: Sample DMPL Decision Sheets

   The second stage of the DMPL is designed to account for utility function curvature by
introducing a second experimental measure. In particular, a Holt and Laury (2002, hence-
forth HL) risk preference task is conducted alongside the intertemporal decisions. Subjects

                                                                                         5
face a series of decisions between a safe and a risky binary gamble. The probability of the
high outcome in each gamble increases as one proceeds through the task, such that where
a subject switches from the safe to the risky gamble carries information on risk attitudes.
Figure 1, Panel B, presents a sample HL task. The risk attitude elicited in the HL task iden-
tifies the degree of utility function curvature, α, which is then applied to the intertemporal
choices to un-confound the discounting bounds. In effect, α is identified from risky choice
data, and δ and β are identified from intertemporal choice data.
       The CTB takes a different approach to identification. Instead of incorporating a second
experimental elicitation, the CTB recognizes a key restriction of the standard multiple price
list approach. When making a binary choice between a smaller sooner payment, $X, and a
larger later payment, $Y, subjects are effectively restricted to the corner solutions in (sooner,
later) space, ($X, $0) and ($0, $Y). That is, they maximize the utility function in (1) subject
to the discrete budget constraint (xt , xt+k ) ∈ {(X, 0), (0, Y )}. If the utility function is indeed
linear, such that α = 1, the restriction to corners is non-binding.8 However, if α < 1,
individuals have convex preferences in (sooner, later) space, preferring interior solutions,
and leading the restriction to corners to meaningfully restrict behavior.
       This observation leads to a natural solution. If one wishes to identify preferences in
(sooner, later) space, one can convexify the decision environment. In a CTB, subjects are
given the choice of ($X, $0), ($0, $Y) or anywhere along the intertemporal budget constraint
                                                                                  Y
connecting these points such that P xt + xt+k = Y , where P =                     X
                                                                                      represents the gross
interest rate. Figure 2 presents a sample CTB allowing for interior solutions between the
two corners.9 In the CTB, sensitivity to changing interest rates delivers identification of α
while variation in the timing of payments identifies the discounting parameters, β and δ.10
   8
      A key caveat to this is that while the restriction of the data to corner solutions in non-binding in the
case of linear utility, it does not mean that the same set of choices on restricted and unrestricted data will
yield the same parameter estimates. Corner choices on unrestricted data have very different implications for
preferences than corner choices on restricted data. This turns out to be key for our results.
    9
      Notably, the version of the CTB we use is different than that of AS. AS used a computer interface to
offer individuals 100 tokens that could be allocated to the sooner or later payoffs in any proportion. By
condensing the budget to 6 options, we can represent the choice in a check-the-box format that fits onto a
sheet of paper. While information is lost in this discretization, it puts the CTB on the same footing as the
DMPL in terms of ease-of-administration and portability.
   10
      This is shown explicitly in section 2.3.

       The most important distinction between the two methods is the source of identification
of curvature. The DMPL identifies utility function curvature based on the degree of risk
aversion elicited in the HL risky choice. In contrast, the CTB identifies curvature based on
the degree of price sensitivity in intertemporal choice. These varying sources of information
for the shape of the utility function should be equivalent under the utility formulation in
(1). The parameter α determines both the extent of intertemporal substitution and the
extent of risk aversion.11 However, there may be reason to expect differences in the extent of
measured utility function curvature and hence discounting estimates across the two methods.
AHLR document substantial utility function curvature in HL tasks, leading to substantial
changes in discounting estimates when accounted for in the DMPL. In contrast, AS document
substantially less utility function curvature from CTB choices.12
  11
    Provided α is the sole source of curvature and expected utility maintains in atemporal choice.
  12
    However, the AS estimates do differ significantly from linear utility. Further AS show that the extent
of CTB utility function curvature is correlated with the distance between standard price list discount factor
estimates and CTB discount factor estimates. Individuals with more concave CTB-measured utility functions
have more downwards-biased discount factor price list estimates.

II.B       Experimental Design

In order to assess the predictive validity of the DMPL and CTB elicitation methods, we
designed a simple within-subject experiment. Subjects faced 4 intertemporal MPLs, 2 HL
risk tasks, and 4 CTBs of the form presented in Figures 1 and 2. For the intertemporal
decisions the CTBs and MPLs took the exact same start dates, t, delay lengths, k, and gross
interest rates, P . The experimental budget was always $20 such that the intertemporal
budget constraint in each decision was P xt + xt+k = 20. Hence, as presented in Figures 1
and 2, the only difference between the implemented CTBs and MPLs was the presence of
interior allocations. Table 1 summarizes the parameters of the intertemporal choice portion
of the experiment. The interest rates, experimental budgets and delay lengths are chosen
to be comparable to those of AS. As presented in Figure 1, Panel B, in the two HL tasks
subjects faced a series of decisions between a safe and a risky gamble. In the first HL task,
HL1 , the safe gamble outcomes were $10.39 and $8.31, while the risky gamble outcomes
were $20 and $0.52. In the second HL task, HL2 , the safe gamble outcomes were $13.89 and
$5.56, while the risky gamble outcomes were $25 and $0.28. These values were chosen to
provide a measure of curvature at monetary payment values close to those implemented in
the intertemporal choices and are scaled versions of those used in the original HL tasks.13
       Our sample consists of 64 undergraduates, evenly divided into 4 sessions, conducted
in February of 2009. Upon arriving in the laboratory, subjects were told they would be
participating in an experiment about decision-making over time. Subjects were told that
  13
    See Appendix A.8 for the full instructions. In the HL baseline task, the safe gamble outcomes were $2.00
and $1.60 and the risky gamble outcomes were $3.85 and $0.10. Our HL1 scales the largest payment to $20
and keeps all ratios the same. The second task, HL2 , increases the highest payment to $25 and increases the
variance.

                                                          8
based on the decisions they made, and chance, they could receive payment as early as the
day of the experiment, as late as 14 weeks from the experiment, or other dates in between.
All of the payments dates were selected to avoid holidays or school breaks, and all payments
were designed to arrive on the same day of the week. All choices were made with paper and
pencil and the order in which subjects completed the tasks was randomized. Two orders were
implemented with the HL tasks acting as a buffer between the more similar time discounting
choices: 1) MPL, HL, CTB; 2) CTB, HL, MPL.14 Subjects were told that in total they would
make 49 decisions. One of these decisions would be chosen as the ‘decision-that-counts’ and
their choice would be implemented.15 The full instructions are provided in Appendix A.8.
       A primary concern in the design of discounting experiments is to equalize all transaction
costs between different dates of payment. Eliminating any uncertainty over delayed payments
and convenience of immediate payments is key to obtaining accurate results. We follow
the techniques used in AS and take six specific measures to equate transaction costs and
ensure payment reliability.16 Subjects were surveyed extensively after the completion of the
experiment. Importantly, 100% of subjects said that they believed that their earnings would
be paid out on the appropriate dates.
       Once the decision-that-counts was chosen, subjects participated in a Becker, Degroot and
Marschak (1964, henceforth BDM) auction eliciting their lowest willingness to accept in their
  14
      No order effects were observed.

      Our randomization device for implementing the decision-that-counts favored the intertemporal choices
over the HL choices. Whereas each time preference allocation was viewed as a choice (48 in total), the
HL tasks were viewed as a single choice. When the HL tasks were explained, subjects were told that if
these were chosen as the decision-that-counts, then a specific HL choice would be picked at random (with
equal likelihood) and a 10-sided dice would be rolled to determine lottery outcomes. Payment would be
made in cash immediately in the lab, and subjects would receive a show-up fee of $10 immediately as well.
We recognize that this favored randomization may limit the attention subjects pay to the HL tasks. Our
results, however, are comparable to other findings of risk aversion in Holt and Laury (2002) and to other
implementations of the DMPL (Andreoni and Sprenger, 2012b).
   16
      As in AS, all participants lived on campus at UC San Diego, which meant that they had 24 hour access
to a locked personal mailbox. Our first measure was to use these mailboxes for intertemporal payments.
Second, intertemporal payments were made by personal check from Professor James Andreoni. Although
this introduces a transaction cost, it ensures an equal cost in all potential periods of distribution. In addition,
these checks were drawn on an account at the on-campus credit union. Third, for intertemporal payments
the $10 show-up fee was split into two $5 minimum payments avoiding subjects loading on one experimental
payment date to avoid cashing multiple checks. Fourth, the payment envelopes were self-addressed, reducing
risk of clerical error. Fifth, subjects noted payment amounts and dates from the decision-that-counts on
their payment envelopes, eliminating the need to recall payment values and reducing the risk of mistaken
payment. Sixth, all subjects received a business card with telephone and e-mail contacts they could use in
case a payment did not arrive. Subjects were made aware of all of these measures prior to the choice tasks.

sooner payment to forgo a claim to an additional $25 in their later payment with a uniform
distribution of random prices drawn from [$15.00, $24.99].17 The instructions outlined the
procedure and explicitly informed subjects that “the best idea is to write down your true
value...”.18 Subsequently, subjects completed a survey including demographic details as well
as two hypothetical measures of patience. The first hypothetical measure asked subjects to
state the dollar amount of money today that would make them indifferent to $20 in one
month. The second hypothetical measure asked subjects to state the mount of money in one
month that would make them indifferent to $20 today.19
       While there were 64 subjects in total, our estimation sample for the remainder of the
paper consists of 58 individuals. Five individuals exhibited multiple switching at some
point in the HL task. One individual never altered their decision from a specific corner
solution in all 4 CTBs and thus provided insufficient variation for the calculation of utility
parameters. These 6 subjects are dropped to maintain a consistent number of observations
across estimates.


II.C        Parameter Estimation Strategies

The data collected in the experiment are used to separately identify the key parameters of
utility function curvature, α, discounting, δ, and present bias, β for both the CTB and the
DMPL. Preferred estimation strategies for recovering these parameters differ between the
two elicitation techniques. The CTB is akin to maximizing discounted utility subject to a
future value budget constraint. Hence, a standard intertemporal Euler equation maintains,

                                                  xα−1
                                         M RS = t tk α−1 = P,
                                               β 0 δ xt+k
  17
      Subjects were potentially aware of their payment amounts at this point if they remembered their choice
exactly.
   18
      This follows the protocol of Ariely, Loewenstein and Prelec (2003). A copy of the elicitation and instruc-
tions can be found in Appendix A.8.
   19
      The exact wording of the first question was ‘What amount of money, $X, if paid to you today would
make you indifferent to $20 paid to you in one month?’ The exact wording of the first question was ‘What
amount of money, $Y, would make you indifferent between $20 today and $Y one month from now?’

where t0 is an indicator for whether t = 0. This can be rearranged to be linear in our
experimental variations, t, k, and P ,

Assuming an additive error structure, this is estimable at either the group or individual level,
with parameters of interest recovered via non-linear combinations of regression coefficients
and standard errors calculated via the delta method. Equation (2) makes clear the mapping
from the variation of experimental parameters to structural parameter estimates. Variation
in the gross interest rate, P , delivers the utility function curvature, α. For a fixed interest
rate, variation in delay length, k, delivers δ, and variation in whether the present, t = 0, is
considered delivers β.
    Three natural issues arise with the estimation strategy described above. First, the allo-
                    
                 xt
cation ratio ln xt+k   is not well defined at corner solutions.20 Second, even if the optimality
condition were defined at corner solutions, the preferences we assume cannot generate such
choices in the form of point-identified maxima. Indeed, this issue is a common point of
criticism of CTB approaches (Harrison et al. 2013). Third, this strategy effectively ignores
the interval nature of the data, created by the discretization of the budget constraint.
       To address the first issue, one can use the demand function to generate a non-linear
regression equation based upon

                                                                        1
                                                        20(β t0 δ k P ) α−1
                                               xt =                         1   ,                         (3)
                                                      1 + P (β t0 δ k P ) α−1

which avoids the problem of the logarithmic transformation in (2). However, this demand
function is only defined for α ∈ (0, 1), so the use of either of these techniques is still subject
to bias incurred by the second issue above.21 While this is issue is minimized by the fact
that our metric for success is predictive validity, we propose a third technique, Interval
  20
     In our application we solve this issue operationally, by transforming the $0 payment in a corner solution
to $0.01 such that the log allocation ratio is always well-defined. Additionally, we consider exercises adding
in the fixed $5 minimum payments to each payment date and qualitatively similar results. See Appendix
Table A2.
  21
     Assuming that the degree of misspecification depends on the experimentally varied parameters to some
degree, this will be problematic.

Censored Tobit (ICT) regression, that is robust to all three issues mentioned above. While
this technique is less transparent and more complicated to perform, it serves as a robustness
check for approaches (2) and (3). The details are discussed in Appendix A.1.22
       Preferred methodology for estimating intertemporal preference parameters from DMPL
data, as per AHLR, relies on maximum likelihood methods. Binary choices between $X
sooner and $Y later are assumed to be guided by the utilities UX = δ t X α and UY =
β t0 δ t+k Y α . AHLR assign choice probabilities using Luce’s (1959) formulation based on these
utility values
                                                                  1
                                                                UXν
                                   P r(Choice = X) =        1         1   ,                          (4)
                                                          UXν + UYν
where ν represents stochastic decision error. As ν tends to infinity all decisions become
random and as ν tends to zero, all decisions are deterministic based on the assigned utilities.
The log of this choice probability represents the likelihood contribution of a given observation.
       In order to simultaneously estimate utility function curvature and discounting param-
eters, AHLR also define a similar likelihood contribution for a HL risk task observation,
constructed under expected utility. An alternate stochastic decision error parameter, µ, is
estimated for risky choice. As in AHLR, we provide estimates based on only the intertem-
poral decisions, assuming α = 1, and on the combination of time and risk choices. We
additionally provide estimates using only the risky data to demonstrate the extent to which
estimated utility function curvature is informed by the HL choices. Appendix A.2 provides
full detail of the maximum likelihood strategies for DMPL data.
       A subtle, but critical difference between these estimation strategies is how choice ‘errors’,
instances in which the option with the highest utility conditional on the estimated parameters
is not selected, occur. Errors enter the CTB specification nested in the context of optimality:
unobserved mean-zero shocks specific to one decision that perturb the tangency condition
from what would be expected based on estimated parameters. In the DMPL framework,
‘errors’ come from estimated parameters, ν and µ, that are constant across the estimation
sample, and represent how deterministic the relationship is between utility, conditional on
estimated parameters, and choice. An econometric model of probabilistic choice cannot be

    AS provide a variety of estimates using both demand functions and Euler equations and several utility
formulations such as CARA and CRRA. Broadly consistent estimates are found across techniques.

derived from a model of economic optimization without the use of a specialized distributional
assumption on the unobservables. If one is concerned about the applicability of the estimates
to a more general choice space, it is worth carefully evaluating the preferred source of the
structural assumptions that provide identification. We return to this issue in Section 3.B.3.



III      Results
We present the results in two stages. First, we provide estimation results based on the DMPL
and CTB elicitation techniques, drawing some contrasts between the parameter estimates
across the two methods. Second, we move to choice prediction and conduct two complemen-
tary analyses, attempting to predict choice across methods and attempting to predict choice
out-of-sample to our BDM and hypothetical choice data.


III.A      Parameter Estimates

Our main estimation results are presented in Table 2, providing aggregate estimates of α, β,
and an annualized discount rate r = δ −365 − 1 for both elicitation techniques and the variety
of estimation strategies described in section 2.3.23 Standard errors are clustered on the
individual level. To begin, in columns (1) and (2) we separately analyze the two components
of the DMPL. In column (1), we assume linear utility and use the intertemporal choice data
to estimate β and r. When assuming linear utility, we estimate an annual discount rate
of 102.2 percent (s.e. 22.3 percent). In column (2), we use only the HL data to estimate
utility function curvature, estimating α of 0.549 (0.044), comparable to other experimental
findings on the extent of small stakes risk aversion (e.g., Holt and Laury, 2002). Based on
this curvature estimate, an individual would be indifferent between a 50-50 gamble over $20
and $0 and $5.67 for sure, implying a risk premium of $4.33. The extent of concavity found
in column (2) suggests that the estimated annual discount rate of 102 percent in column (1)
is dramatically upwards-biased. In column (3) we use both elements of the DMPL to

    For a summary of the raw results, please see Appendix Figure A1, which presents the choice proportions
for the binary intertemporal MPL and HL data and the average allocations for the CTB data. We also
estimate the parameters of interest on an individual level. Median estimates correspond generally to those
in Table 2. These results and additional discussion are found in Appendix A.4.

Note: Standard errors clustered at the individual level in parentheses. Each individual made 20 decisions on the HL, 24 decision
on the MPL (and therefore 44 decisions on the DMPL) and 24 decisions on the CTB. In columns (1) through (3) HL, MPL
and DMPL estimates are obtained via maximum likelihood using Luce’s (1959) stochastic error probabilistic choice model. The
CTB is estimated in three different ways: ordinary least squares (OLS) using the Euler equation (2), non-linear least squares
(NLS) using the demand function (3) and interval-censored tobit (ICT) maximum likelihood using the Euler equation (2). All
maximum likelihood models are estimated using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) optimization algorithm.

simultaneously estimate utility function curvature and discounting. Indeed, we find that
the estimated annual discount rate falls dramatically to 47.2 percent (10.3 percent). The
difference in discounting with and without accounting for curvature is significant at all con-
ventional levels, (χ2 (1) = 15.71, p < 0.01). This finding echoes those of AHLR, though our
estimated discount rates are higher in general. Note that the curvature estimate is virtually
identical across columns (2) and (3), indicating the extent to which the measure is informed
by risky choice responses.
      Next, we consider the CTB estimates. Table 2, columns (4) - (6) contain estimates
based on the three methods described in section 2.3. In column (4), ordinary least squares


                                                                14
estimates based on the Euler equation (2) are presented.24 The annual discount rate is
estimated to be 74.1 percent (s.e. 39 percent), generating wide intervals for the extent
of discounting. Hence, the discounting estimate from the DMPL method would lie in the
95 percent confidence interval of the CTB estimate. Importantly, the estimates of utility
function curvature in column (4) are far closer to linear utility than that obtained from the
DMPL. Based on CTB methods, we estimate α of 0.947 (0.003). With this level of curvature,
an individual would be indifferent between a 50-50 gamble over $20 and $0 and $9.62 for sure,
implying a risk premium of $0.38. Column (5) provides non-linear least squares estimates
based on the demand function (3). Broadly similar findings are obtained. Column (6)
presents interval censored tobit estimates based on the Euler equation (2), accounting for
the interval nature of the response data. We draw attention to the estimate of α, which is
not directly comparable to our other estimates as this parameter is only identified up to a
constant of proportionality (see Appendix A.1 for detail). Beyond this difference, similar
estimates for discounting parameters are obtained. Though our estimated discount rates
are higher than those of AS, broad consistency in discounting and curvature estimates are
obtained across techniques with CTB data.
       One point of interest in all of the estimates from Table 2, is the extent of dynamic con-
sistency. Confirming recent findings with monetary payments when transaction costs and
payment risk are closely controlled, we find virtually no evidence of present bias (Andreoni
and Sprenger, 2012a; Gine, et al., 2012; Andersen et al., 2013; Augenblick, Niederle, and
Sprenger, 2013; Kuhn, Kuhn, and Villeval, 2013). Across elicitation techniques and estima-
tion strategies, the present bias parameter, β, is estimated close to one.
       Substantial differences in estimates, particularly for utility function curvature, are ob-
tained across the DMPL and the CTB. It is beyond the scope of this paper to provide a
theoretical foundation for which elicitation is more likely to yield correct estimates. We in-
stead take the approach that predictive validity is the relevant metric for assessing the value
of each method. Our prediction exercises are considered next.
  24
    The dependent variable is taken to be the chosen option in all interior allocations. For corner solutions
in order for the log allocation ratio to be well defined we transform the value $0 to $0.01.




                                                     15
III.B        Predictive Validity

We consider predictive validity in two steps. First, we test within and between methods.
That is, we examine the in- and out-of-sample fit for CTB and DMPL estimates on the
CTB data. Correspondingly we examine the in- and out-of-sample fit for CTB and DMPL
estimates on the DMPL data. Though one would expect the in-sample estimates to out-
perform the out-of-sample estimates, this exercise does yield one critical finding: the CTB
estimates perform about as well out-of-sample as the DMPL estimates perform in-sample
for intertemporal choices.
       Second, we test strictly out-of-sample for both methods. We examine behavior in a
BDM mechanism eliciting willingness to accept to relinquish a claim for $25 at a later date
and two hypothetical measures for patience. These three out-of-sample environments are
constructed such that model estimates generate point predictions for behavior. Hence, one
can analyze differences between predicted and actual behavior and the correlation between
the two. Importantly, in both exercises we account for individual heterogeneity by estimating
discounting parameters for each individual separately (see Appendix A.4 for details). For the
CTB, individual level estimates are constructed based upon the estimation strategy of Table
2, Column (4). Individual level estimates of α, β and r are obtained for all 58 subjects.25 For
the DMPL, individual level estimates are constructed based upon the estimation strategy of
Table 2, Column (3). Individual level estimates of α, β and r are obtained for all 58 subjects.
These analyses demonstrate that CTB-based estimates outperform DMPL-based estimates
in all three out-of-sample environments.26
  25
      We opt to use the OLS estimates from Table 2, column (4), because individual level estimates are obtained
for all 58 subjects. Using the NLS estimates of Table 2, column (5) very similar results are obtained, though
the individual-level estimator converges for only 56 of 58 subjects.
   26
      To account for estimation error, we also used the standard errors of the estimation to bootstrap the CTB
and DMPL estimates for each person-choice combination. Since the results are quantitatively and qualita-
tively similar to those using the estimates alone, we do not report them here. One important dissimilarity,
however, should be noted. When making DMPL predictions the bootstrapping procedure generates negative
estimates of α in about 40% of the cases. If we exclude these, the predictive success of the bootstrapped
individual level DMPL estimates is modestly better than the estimates alone. However, if we count these as
incorrect predictions, the predictive success of the individual level DMPL estimates is reduced dramatically.
Excluding negative α’s skews the remaining α’s toward 1, which we demonstrate below favors more accurate

III.B.1      Within and Between Methods

We begin by analyzing the CTB data. First, consider the in-sample fit for the CTB estimates.
We use the parameter estimates from Table 2, column (4) to construct utilities for each option
within a budget and compare the predicted utility-maximizing option to the chosen option.
Using the aggregate CTB estimates, the predicted utility maximizing choice was chosen
45% of the time. Using individual CTB estimates, the predicted utility maximizing choice
was chosen 75% of the time. Next, consider the out-of-sample fit for the DMPL estimates.
We use the parameter estimates from Table 2, column (3) to construct utilities for each
option within a budget and compare the predicted utility-maximizing option to the chosen
option. Aggregate DMPL estimates predict 3% of CTB choices correctly and individual
DMPL estimates predict 16% of CTB choices correctly.
       The key out-of-sample failure for the DMPL estimates on the CTB data is generated by
the high degree of estimated utility function curvature. Indeed, the majority of CTB choices
are close to budget corners.27 Figure 3 presents an example budget with corresponding pre-
  27
    To be specific 88 percent of CTB allocations are at one of the two budget corners. Additionally, 35 of
58 subjects have zero interior allocations, consistent with linear utility.


                                                                17
dicted indifference curves and choices based on CTB and DMPL estimates. The high degree
of curvature prevents the DMPL estimates from making corner predictions and hence leaves
the estimates unable to match many data points.28 Stated differently, the data themselves
are a non-parametric rejection of the utility curvature estimate generated by the HL data,
and the gains from the alternative source of curvature identification in the CTB swamps the
bias incurred by using optimality to approximate corner solutions.
       We perform an identical exercise for the DMPL data. We focus specifically on the in-
tertemporal MPL choices.29 In-sample aggregate DMPL estimates predict 81% of MPL
choices correctly and individual estimates predict 89% of MPL choices correctly. Inter-
estingly, the CTB estimates perform almost as well out-of-sample as the DMPL estimates
perform in-sample. Aggregate CTB estimates also predict 81% of MPL choices correctly and
individual estimates predict 86% of MPL choices correctly.
       From this exercise we note that using individual level estimates both estimation tech-
niques perform well in-sample. However, the CTB estimates predict out-of-sample with
greater accuracy than the DMPL estimates. In order to put the two methods on equal foot-
ing, we next consider the predictive ability of the techniques in environments where both
sets of estimates are out-of-sample.


III.B.2      Pure Out-of-Sample

Following the experimental implementation of the CTB and DMPL, subjects were notified
of their two payment dates, based on a randomly chosen experimental decision. We then
elicited the amount they would be willing to accept in their sooner check instead of $25 in
the later check using a BDM technique with a uniform distribution of random prices drawn
from [$15.00, $24.99].30 All 58 subjects from our estimation exercise provided a BDM bid.
The mean willingness to accept was $22.36 (s.d. $2.18). Figure 4, Panel A presents the
distribution of willingness to accept BDM responses.
  28
     See Appendix A.6 for the the exercise conducted on all experimental budgets.
  29
     The HL data are considered in Appendix A.7 and demonstrate, unsurprisingly that the DMPL estimates
vastly outperform the CTB estimates on the HL data.
  30
     Hence, stating a willingness to accept greater than or equal to $25 implied a preference for the later
payment in all states. Four subjects provided BDM bids of exactly $25 and no subjects provided a BDM
bid greater than $25. Stating a willingness to accept lower than $15 implied a preference for any sooner
payment. No subjects provided a BDM bid less than $15.

   Based on the payment dates, we use the individual parameter estimates from the CTB
and DMPL to predict subject responses. These predictions account for the fact that relevant
payment dates may involve different values of t and k. Responses that are predicted to fall
outside of the price bounds described above are top and bottom-coded, accordingly. The
mean CTB based prediction is $22.47 (s.d. $3.09), while the mean DMPL prediction is $22.48
($2.95). Tests of equality demonstrate that we fail to reject the null hypothesisof equal means

between the true data and both our CTB and DMPL estimates, (t57 = −0.247, p = 0.86),
(t57 = −0.251, p = 0.80), respectively. The predicted distributions from the CTB and
DMPL estimates are also presented in Figure 4, Panel A. Though similar patterns to the
true data emerge, Panel A does demonstrate some distributional differences, particularly at
extreme values. Indeed, Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of distributional equality reject the null
hypothesis of equal distributions between observed and both CTB and the DMPL predic-
tions, (D = 0.414, p < 0.01), (D = 0.241, p = 0.06), respectively. This suggests somewhat
limited predictive validity at the distributional level.
       Table 3, Panel A, columns (1) through (3) present tobit regressions analyzing the cor-
relation between predicted and actual BDM behavior. In column (1) we show the CTB
prediction to be significantly positively correlated with BDM bids. In contrast, an insignif-
icant correlation is obtained in column (2) where the independent variable is the DMPL
predicted bid. Further, in column (3) when both predictions are used in estimation, we
find that DMPL predictions carry little explanatory power beyond that of the CTB. This
indicates predictive validity of the CTB estimates, though not the DMPL estimates, at the
individual level.
       Our final two prediction exercises involve hypothetical data collected during the post-
experiment survey. First, we asked subjects what amount of money, $Xtoday , today would
make them indifferent to $20 in a month. Second, we asked subjects what amount of money,
$Ymonth , in a month would make them indifferent to $20 today. Both measures are noisy
with subjects at times answering free-form.31 56 of 58 subjects from our estimation exercise
provided values for $Xtoday and $Ymonth . Figure 4, Panels B and C present these data. The
data for $Xtoday are top-coded at $20 while the data for $Ymonth are bottom-coded at $20.
Following an identical strategy to that above, Panels B and C also present the distribution
of responses predicted from CTB and DMPL individual estimates, top and bottom-coded
accordingly. One subject’s DMPL estimates produced a predicted value of $Ymonth in excess
of $1,000 and a $Xtoday value of approximately $0. Excluding this outlier, our analysis focuses
on 55 subjects. In nearly all cases, we reject the null hypothesis of equal means between
  31
    In the first question, one subject responded ‘Any amount over $20’. This response was coded as $20.
This subject gave the same response in the second question and was again coded as $20. In the second
question, one subject responded, ‘$19.05 plus one dollar in a month’. This was coded as $20.05.

predicted values and actual values.32 Further, distributional tests frequently reject the null
hypothesis of equality suggesting limited predictive validity at the distributional level.33
   When considering the extent of correlations at the individual level, a different conclusion
is drawn. Table 3, Panels B and C present tobit regressions similar to Panel A, where the
dependent variable is either $Xtoday or $Ymonth . Again we find the CTB predictions to carry
significant correlations with the true measures. Though in Panel B, the DMPL prediction
does significantly correlate with observed behavior, the DMPL predictions provide limited
added predictive power beyond the CTB predictions. This again indicates predictive validity
of the CTB estimates at the individual level.
   Across our three out-of-sample exercises we find that both the CTB and DMPL can
mis-predict, at times importantly, the distribution of behavior. However, at the individual
level predictive validity is apparent, particularly for CTB-based estimates. DMPL-based
estimates at times provide little independent and additional predictive power in our out-of-
sample environments.


III.B.3    Probabilistic Choice and Multiple Switching

While all of the predictions discussed above were generated via utility maximization, con-
ditional on parameter values, the Luce model strategy suggests that another way of doing
so would be to use a utility index with a decision error parameter to construct choice prob-
abilities. This decision error allows one to connect preferences to choice probabilities via
some functional form.34 The aggregate in-sample fit of these models (estimated via maxi-
mum likelihood) may be very good but the out-of-sample prediction may falter. This may
   32
      The mean actual value of $Xtoday is $18.79 (s.d. $1.50). The CTB-based prediction for $Xtoday is
$18.29 (s.d. $2.36). The DMPL-based prediction for $Xtoday is $18.44 (s.d. $1.76). We reject the null
hypothesis of equal means between the true data and our CTB estimates ,though not our DMPL estimates,
(t54 = 2.13, p = 0.04) , (t54 = 1.63, p = 0.11), respectively. The mean actual value of $Ymonth is $24.27
(s.d. $6.62). The CTB-based prediction for $Ymonth is $22.35 (s.d. $3.86). The DMPL-based prediction
for $Ymonth is $21.92 (s.d. $2.46). We reject the null hypothesis of equal means between the true data and
both our CTB and DMPL estimates, (t54 = 2.04, p = 0.05) , (t54 = 2.48, p = 0.02), respectively.
   33
      The KS statistic for the comparison of $Xtoday across the true data and the CTB prediction is D =
0.184, (p = 0.25). For the comparison of $Xtoday across the true data and the DMPL prediction is is
D = 0.222, (p = 0.10). The KS statistic for the comparison of $Ymonth across the true data and the CTB
prediction is D = 0.207, (p = 0.14). For the comparison of $Ymonth across the true data and the DMPL
prediction is is D = 0.259, (p = 0.04).
   34
      The specific functional form comes from the assumed random utility model and error distribution.



                                                   22
be for reasons of the parameter estimates being inapplicable or due to the assumption of
probabilistic choice itself. In the case of price lists, a lot of decision error means a lot of
multiple switching because the decision error is agnostic with regard to preferences.
      Therefore, another way of asking whether the estimates faithfully describe the data is
to consider the degree of randomness in choice exhibited and the degree predicted. Of the
64 subjects who took part in the experiment, none exhibited multiple-switching behavior
in the MPL task.35 However, the Luce probabilistic choice model used to estimate the
DMPL parameters (and probabilistic choice models generally) predicts choice probabilities
that necessarily allow for switching more than once with some non-zero probability. We
simulate 1000 sets of our MPL data using these predicted choice probabilities and find that
the DMPL parameters and Luce model predicts that 86% of subjects should exhibit an
“irrational” switch.
      How much of this gap is due to the model and how much is due to the parameters them-
selves? To determine this, we run the CTB parameters through the Luce model, borrowing
the DMPL estimate of ν, to again simulate 1000 sets of our data. This exercise predicts that
57% of subjects should exhibit an “irrational” switch. Given that a curvature parameter
away from 1 directly attenuates utility differences between options, the CTB-DMPL gap
make sense. The remaining Data-CTB gap is due to the Luce model itself; there are no
hallmarks of probabilistic choice in the data.



IV         Conclusion
We compare two recent innovations for the experimental identification and estimation of
time preferences, the Convex Time Budget (CTB) of Andreoni and Sprenger (2012a) and
the Double Multiple Price List (DMPL) of Andersen et al. (2008). Both innovations focus
on generating measures of discounting which are not confounded by utility function cur-
vature. The primary avenue along which the methods are compared is predictive validity.
We examine the extent to which estimated utility parameters can predict behavior across
experimental methods and in out-of-sample environments. At the distributional level, we
 35
      All exclusions for multiple-switching were from violations on the HL task.



                                                      23
find that both methods make predictions close to average behavior, though they often miss
key elements of the distribution. At the individual level, we find CTB-based estimates to
have increased predictive power relative to DMPL estimates.
   Our experiment suggests one prominent explanation for the observed differences between
CTB and DMPL-based estimates. The key distinction in identification strategies across
the two methods comes from the source of information for utility function curvature. In
the CTB, curvature is informed by sensitivity to changing interest rates. In the DMPL,
curvature is informed by risky choice. The most striking difference in parameter estimates
across the two methods is the level of curvature. It is beyond the scope of this paper
to state definitively which source of identification is correct. However, if one is interested
in predicting intertemporal choice, our results demonstrate that the latter generates less
informative estimates. Importantly, this is precisely because CTB data consist mostly of
corner solutions. We wish to emphasize that this aspect of the CTB approach is in fact the
critical feature of the data that is responsible for such substantial improvements in predictive
validity over the DMPL, and in particular, over using the HL device to identify curvature.
   In motivating our study we suggested predictive power as a primary metric of success. We
take the first step in this direction by exploring out-of-sample choices of our subjects made in
the experiment. An essential test that remains, however, is to use these measurements of time
preference to predict behavior outside of the experiment. In addition to laboratory refinement
of the techniques presented here, a key next step is expanding to target populations for
whom extra-lab choices are observable. Linking precisely measured discounting parameters
to important intertemporal decisions is a promising avenue of future research.
