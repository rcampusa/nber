                                         ABSTRACT

China's real estate has been a key engine of its sustained economic expansion. This paper argues,
however, that even before the Covid-19 shock, a decades-long housing boom had given rise to
severe price misalignments and regional supply-demand mismatches, making an adjustment both
necessary and inevitable. We make use of newly available and updated data sources to analyze
supply-demand conditions in the fast-moving Chinese economy. The imbalances are then
compared to benchmarks from other economies. We conclude that the sector is quite vulnerable
to a sustained aggregate growth shock, such as Covid-19 might pose. In our baseline calibration,
using input-output tables and taking account of the very large footprint of housing construction
and real-estate related sectors, the adjustment to a decline in housing activity can easily trim a
cumulative 5-10 percent from the level of output (over a period of years).

I. Introduction
          It has long been argued that despite China's truly epic real estate boom over the past

three decades (as documented in a number of previous papers),3 the central government's

ability to tightly monitor the financial system, and to resolve insolvencies quickly in the event

of a crisis, makes it relatively immune to conventional housing-related financial crises. At the

same time, however, this view has been largely untested thanks to the country's extraordinary

growth performance, with expectations of further fast growth underpinning ever higher

housing prices. How much of a vulnerability might the real estate sector prove in the wake of

the Covid-19 shock?

       This paper's contribution is threefold. First, we make use of newly available sources, to

extend and significantly update earlier work on the size and scale of China's housing market.

We especially take advantage of the digitization of China's statistics, which has helped

provide both more extensive and more accurate data. Fang et al. (2015) document housing

price growth in major Chinese cities from 2003 to 2013, while Glaeser et al. (2017) track

changes in China's construction square footage, household vacancy rates, etc. from 2002 to

2012. We find that significant changes, even before the Covid-19 pandemic, have taken place

since. During 2013-2018, for example, real estate investment increased by 30% and

household leverage ratio rose from 33% to 60%. Another important factor is that China

underwent a major change of leadership in 2013, and that has heavily influenced the

country's real estate policies. Thus, using data (some of which runs through 2020) gives a

significantly more accurate picture of China's rapidly-evolving housing market.



3
    See, for example, Fang et al. (2015), Chivakul et al. (2015), Glaeser et al. (2017), and Koss and Shi (2018).

                                                                 2
     Second, we provide a quantitative characterization of the upstream and downstream

contribution to GDP of China's real estate sector by exploiting newer input-output tables.

Our updated measure, based on cross-industry correlations derived from China's most recent

input-output matrix, and taking into account higher-order effects (in addition to first-order) is

29%, even higher than in earlier studies.4

     Real estate activity involves both the production of property and the provision of services

related to property. The former refers to building, renovating, repairing and maintaining of

property, while the latter includes buying, selling, renting and managing of property.5 In

addition, real estate is closely linked to an array of industries through the supply chain. To

complete a real estate project, various inputs are needed, including intermediate inputs, such

as steel and concrete, from the manufacturing sector, labor input from the construction sector,

capital input from the banking sector, etc. Hence to estimate the sum effect of real estate on

the economy, we consider not only the output of real estate sector alone, but also the output

share of closely related industries. Using the input-output table, we find that a 20% fall in real

estate activity could lead to a 5-10% fall in GDP, even without amplification from a banking

crisis, or accounting for the importance of real estate as collateral.

     Third, we present a substantial body of evidence from the last 20 years using a variety of

Chinese and international datasets that strongly suggests the existence of a housing bubble in

China. Extant literature has largely concentrated on China alone (Fang et al., 2015; Ding et




4
  Previous studies using narrower measures of housing's impact typically put the size of the sector around 16% (e.g.,
Glaeser et al (2017), Liu and Xiong (2018)). Our measure is closest in spirit to Cook et. al. (2018) who use an earlier (2012)
input output table and arrive at a 22% contribution of housing. See the Technical Appendix.
5
  According to the International Standard Industrial Classification (the SIC codes), real estate is classified as a tertiary
industry, encompassing only the provision of property-related services, which is merely part of housing activity.

                                                              3
al., 2017), with a few papers drawing comparison with the United States (e.g. Glaeser et al.,

2017). We take a cross-country perspective, starting with classic housing booms from

advanced economies while zooming in on China's current boom, to enable comparison on a

global scale. Despite the repeated argument that China is different, we note that it shares

striking similarities with other boom episodes in the run-up of housing prices, the scale of the

construction sector, the debt accumulation etc. Indeed, given the severity of many economic

indicators, China's decades-long housing boom shows many signs of having hit a potentially

precarious peak.6

     The structure of the paper proceeds as follows. Section II briefly reviews the most

closely-related literature. Section III presents recent developments of China's housing market

up to the Covid-19 pandemic (though we include some very recent 2020 data just before the

conclusions.) Section IV analyzes housing supply-demand dynamics. Section V examines

real estate's linkage to the economy and its resilience to the Covid-19 stress. Section VI

concludes. Appendices provide data description and technical details.




II. The literature

     The most closely-related studies to ours include earlier papers such as Fang et al. (2015),

Chivakul et al. (2015), Glaeser et al. (2017), and Koss and Shi (2018). Using data ending in

2013, 2014, 2012 and 2016 respectively, all of these papers explore the unique features




6
 A considerable body of research has shown that housing sector is closely linked to business cycles (Leamer, 2007; 2015),
Mian, Sufi and Verner (2017) and to post World War II financial crises (Reinhart and Rogoff, 2009; Jorda, Schularick and
Taylor, 2016).

                                                            4
characterizing China's housing market, and, like ours, analyze the possibility and

macroeconomic severity of potential bubble bursts.

    Employing detailed information on the profile of mortgage borrowers, Fang et al. (2015)

find that housing price appreciation is largely matched by household income growth. The

participation by bottom-income mortgage borrowers in the housing market remains steady

despite onerous financial burdens, and their mortgage loans are protected by down payments

usually in excess of 35%. Therefore, an imminent financial crisis triggered by the housing

market is unlikely to happen in China.

    Chivakul et al. (2015) identify China's housing oversupply based on various datasets,

and consider a number of scenarios to restore supply-demand balance. The paper concludes

that the process of adjustment implies negative growth impacts, with the adverse effect being

stronger in smaller cities, as well as cities in the northeast region.

    Glaeser et al. (2017) examine a variety of factors that help sustain China's soaring

housing prices, highlighting, among other factors, the capacity and determination of the

Chinese government to regulate housing prices. The authors also warn about the potentially

significant social costs associated with the overemphasis on housing price stability, and

propose the alternative solution of accommodating high levels of housing construction and

supply.

    Koss and Shi (2018) discuss the history of China's property market and then assess its

resemblance to classic housing bubbles. In the event of a price drop and bubble burst, the

authors propose a battery of near-term policy prescriptions, ranging from the tightening of




                                                 5
mortgage requirements to the improvement of legal infrastructure, to help China withstand

the impact.

III. Recent Developments in the Rapidly Evolving Landscape

1. China's Real Estate Boom

    China's real estate market started to form in the year 1988, when major urban housing

reforms intended to commercialize housing according to the demands of a socialist planned

economy were initiated. Since then, real estate has quickly emerged to be a "pillar" industry

and housing prices have taken off (Figure 1).

       There are three important growth episodes in China's modern real estate history. The

first one originated in 1989 from Hainan province, the nation's largest and southernmost

island featuring cultural tourism. Within three years' time, housing prices went from just 300

yuan per square meter to around 7,500 at the peak. When interest rates began rising in 1993,

housing prices plummeted to 1,000 yuan per square meter and remained there until the early

2000s. The second growth episode came on the heels of the global economic crisis in 2008.

Banks set interest rates barely above inflation and easy money boosted investment demand

for housing. Home prices rose rapidly from 2009 until significant policy tightening starting in

the second half of 2010. After a moderate softening in 2014, the most recent growth spurt

began in early 2015, driven by a combination of loose monetary policy and expansionary

fiscal policy.

     Since 2002, housing prices in China's tier one cities have risen more than six-fold

compared to the 80% overall national increase in US housing prices between 2000 and 2005,7

or the increase in Ireland of 100% and Spain of 230% in their respective housing booms.8

With the crash of Japan's real estate market in the 1990s and the bursting of the U.S. housing

bubble during 2006-2007 as precedents, Chinese authorities have long been wary of the risks

associated with overheating housing prices and, at various times, have taken measures to

clamp down on speculation. Nevertheless, housing prices in China have risen at

unprecedented rate (Figure 2). Until Covid-19, whenever the Chinese government looked to

it to stimulate growth, it often did so by fueling credit to real estate acquisition and

construction.

    China reputedly has a two-speed housing market, reflecting the heterogeneous growth

rates between the better-off first-tier cities and all the rest. In the more up-to-date data

however, we see that starting in 2017, first-tier cities slowed in terms of housing price

appreciation, and fell below that of second- and third-tier cities, where appreciation

accelerated (Figure 3).

     Certainly, by international standards, the scale of China's real estate boom is

unprecedented. Currently, the home price to income9 ratios in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen,

and Guangzhou are comparable to the world's most expensive cities (Figure 4). In particular,

the price to income ratios in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen exceed a multiple of 40

compared to 22 in London and 12 in New York.10 Of course, such price to income ratios

might be justified if the expectation is that very fast income growth will continue indefinitely.

But even aside from the Covid-19 pandemic, China's rapidly aging population, a shrinking

technological gap with the west, and normal decreasing returns to investment, all suggest that

future growth will likely be trending downward.

2. The Role of Real Estate in the Chinese Economy

     China's real estate has been an extraordinarily important driver of its economy. Real

estate investment rose from 5% of GDP in 1995 to over 13% of GDP in 2019, of which more

than 70% is devoted to residential building.11 However, as we have emphasized, focusing on

real estate services alone understates the sector's impact. Real estate not only accounts for

23% of household consumption,12 but it also connects to various sectors of the economy

through investment, construction, and the financial system.




11
   Unless otherwise indicated, all data are from the National Bureau of Statistics of China.
12
   Household consumption consists of household expenditure on 1) food, tobacco and liquor; 2) clothing; 3) residence; 4)
household facilities, articles, and services; 5) transport and communications; 6) education, cultural and recreation; 7) health
care and medical services; 8) miscellaneous goods and services. Housing related consumption here refers to household
expenditure on residence. If we also include expenditure on household facilities, articles, and services, the figure rises to
30%.

                                                                                         10
    China's economic rise largely relies on an investment-driven growth model, and the ratio

of total fixed assets investment to GDP has reached 70-80% in recent years, of which a

significant proportion is in the real estate sector. In 2018, real estate investment composed

13% of China's GDP, while historically in the United State, this figure has been about 5%

(Figure 5).

    Real estate is naturally related to the construction industry in that developers basically

make profits by managing the construction process and turning raw land into salable

property. In 2016, real estate and construction industries combined accounted for around 29%




                                                                     11
of China's GDP,13 comparable only by pre-crisis Spain and Ireland. Real estate and

construction are also crucial for job creation, making up around 20% of urban non-private

employment (Figure 6).14

     Although our later analysis of an impact of real estate activity decline is entirely on the

real side and does not build in amplification from a financial crisis, of course real estate is

also closely related to the financial system. This is especially true for the banking sector, as

bank lending represents the primary source of real estate funding. Through the fourth quarter

of 2018, real estate loans amounted to 38.7 trillion yuan, accounting for about 28% of total


13
   This number is obtained by calculating the total demand on upstream and downstream industries generated by the real
estate sector based on input/output table. Details are provided in Section V.
14
   Similar estimates are given by Glaeser et al. (2017).

                                                                     12
loans and 40% of new loans in financial institutions. The growth in real estate loans far

outweighs that of the other sectors: from 2014 to 2018, the average annual increase in real

estate credit was 20%, whereas the number was 6% for manufacturing.15

       Excessive concentration of financial resources in real estate related industries has created

various distortions in the economy. As banks rely on real estate and land holdings as the main

collateral securing loans, they extend more credit to firms with land holdings, crowding out

credit to those without. Rising housing prices also induce firms whose core business is

unrelated to real estate to make land investments, shifting talents and resources away from

areas of economic need such as trade, manufacturing, and technological innovation (Bleck

and Liu, 2014; Chen et al., 2016; Hau and Ouyang, 2018).

       Local governments are also heavily involved in real estate activity. On one hand, land

sales fueled by a thriving housing market constitute a principal source of local fiscal revenue

(Figure 7); on the other hand, local officials are promoted or demoted depending on their

ability to generate economic growth (Li and Zhou, 2005), and construction activity itself

represents measurable economic output.

       For average households, home ownership is not only a necessity for marriage expected

especially of young men, but also an appealing financial asset given a record of robust capital

gains and a lack of alternative investment instruments. The result is a housing market with

valuation far exceeding that of other financial assets (Figure 8). Housing wealth now forms a

far larger share of overall Chinese assets (including stocks, securitized loans and bank

lending) than it does in the United States, accounting for 78% of all assets compared to 35%

for the United States.16 This makes Chinese private consumption significantly more sensitive

to a decline in housing prices.

    It is worth noting that although the GDP of China is roughly comparable to that of the

United States when measured at PPP exchange rates, (and significantly smaller measured at

market exchange rates), the market value of the housing stock is more than double that of the

United States, and more than triple that of Europe. Such comparisons are reminiscent of the

Japanese housing bubble of the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the market value of real

estate in the Japan was also more than twice that of the United States compared to less than

1/3 the value today.




IV. Supply-Demand Dynamics

    Following years of massive housing construction, China's per capita residential space

has reached 41 square meters, on par with wealthy European countries such as Germany and

France (Figure 9). The question then is: is there an oversupply in housing?

                                                                  15

       A survey conducted by Survey and Research Center for China Household Finance17

suggests that up to 2017, Tier 1 cities had an average 17% vacancy rate whereas Tier 2 and

Tier 3 cities had vacancy rates over 20% (Figure 10), which is higher than the level of most

countries in the world (Figure 11). The emergence of "ghost cities", which refer to fully built

but unoccupied cities due to the development of residences well ahead of population growth,

also raises concerns about a possible excess supply of housing.

        China's housing boom appears truly epic in comparison to all but a couple of post-war

booms around the world, both in terms of cumulative price increase and in terms of the

dependence of the Chinese economy on residential construction.18 It is tempting to conclude

that housing oversupply is a problem in China, based on its pure volume and by international

standards. However, at least until recently, there have been other arguments suggesting that

China's housing market is different. Steady income growth, strong household balance sheets,

limited investment alternatives, and most importantly, implicit support or even promotion by

the government make it less susceptible to a sudden price drop or crisis.

        In the next sub-section, we examine China's current housing supply relative to the

country's growing needs. Although the forces sustaining high housing prices have dominated

until recently, the trends supporting ever-rising prices are muting substantially, suggesting

risk of a large housing market adjustment.


1. Slowing Housing Demand


        Classic factors that determine housing demand include housing price, population growth

and income growth. Housing prices in China are apparently beyond affordability, as

evidenced by the astonishing home price to income ratios across all city tiers (Figure 12).

According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, an average home

costs only 2 to 4 times the median annual income in most parts of the United States. In




18
     Again, understanding that housing price and construction data is of mixed quality even in the advanced economies.

                                                              18
addition to price, the other two factors--demographics and income--also seem to have

changed for the worse.

    Demographic trends suggest a sustained decline in new household formation as China's

population ages, and as it digests the long-run consequences of its policies to slow population

growth. The problem is most acute in Tier 3 cities, but it is still considerable in Tier 1 cities.

The age group of 20-50, who comprises the majority of homebuyers, keeps shrinking. The

abolition of one-child policy effective from January 2016 is unlikely to reverse the downward

demographic trend, since escalating cost of living substantially reduces people's willingness

to have children. Late marriage and marriage with no children have become increasingly

popular in metropolitan areas. On the other hand, real estate developers build residences well




                                                                    19
ahead of population growth, leaving behind them sprawling new neighborhoods devoid of

inhabitants.

     More importantly, as China's economy inevitably slows, household income growth is

also expected to decline. As Glaeser et al. (2017) caution, the current (pre-Covid) prices

cannot withstand a sustained income growth slowdown.

     At the same time, China's household leverage ratio, which is defined as the ratio of

household debt to GDP, has risen rapidly to 60% at the end of 2018,19 up from 18% before

2008 (Figure 13).

   According to the Bank for International Settlements, China's household leverage ratio was 52.6% in 2018, whereas it was
estimated at 60.4% by the People's Bank of China.

                                                                   20
    Fang et al. (2015) argue that China's mortgage loans are relatively secure, owing to high

down payments usually in excess of 35 percent. However, the more recent data suggests

greater fragility today. As the central bank cut the minimum required mortgage down

payment to 20 percent from 25 percent for first-home purchases, and to 30 percent from 40

percent for second-home purchases in 2016, outstanding mortgage debt quickly increased to

38 trillion yuan, making up over 70% of total household debt. In fact, China's household

leverage ratio is now close to the level of major advanced economies such as Europe and

Japan, and much higher than the emerging market average.

       By 2019, housing loans constituted about 30% of the value of Chinese bank loans,20

during a period when bank lending has been expanding significantly faster than GDP growth.

Although Chinese household leverage remains below that of the United States before the

2008 financial crisis (compared to 42%),21 it is already above where Spain was in 2008

(26%),22 and as Figure 14 shows, it has been rising rapidly. It is sobering to recall that U.S.

regulators never expected that housing prices would fall by 36% from peak to trough (by the

Case-Shiller index); even the very cautious pragmatic Chinese regulators may not yet be fully

anticipating the depth of the possible fall in China's housing prices.

       China's urbanization drive, traditional notion of home ownership as a marriage necessity,

and the purchase of property for investment purposes etc. are often quoted as unique national

characteristics that complicate any demand analysis. However, there are limits, as China's

policymakers have increasingly recognized in recent years. President Xi famously stressed

that houses are "for living, not for speculation" at the 19th National Congress of the

Communist Party of China and the government subsequently imposed stricter tightening

measures. Meanwhile, urbanization has reached the point where home ownership is over 90%

for the total of 276 million urban households,23 comparable to countries with the highest

home ownership in the world (Figure 15).

    With urbanization rate reaching about 60% and projected to remain relatively stable, the

urbanizing process will surely have much less of an impact on urban housing prices going

forward. (Indeed, it seems quite plausible that the demands of social distancing in crowded

cities could also have a negative impact on prices). With 87% of new homebuyers already

having more than one dwelling (Figure 16) and price to rent ratios among the world's highest

even before Covid-19 (Figure 17), owners of multiple homes have growing pressures to sell

(Figure 18).

    Home ownership is a symbol of social status and financial strength in traditional Chinese

culture. As mortgage loans climb to historical heights, there is little room for additional debt

capacity in the household sector.

    It is true that, in principle, individuals' desire to upgrade their housing could still sustain

demand for construction, even if the existing stock of housing seems large by international

standards. Still, statistics from the third National Economic Census show that the majority of

China's housing was built after the 1990s (and almost all of it since the 1980s), indicating

little urgent need for large-scale home improvement in the near future (Figure 19). The large

overhang of supply (particularly outside Tier I cities) suggests a significant slowdown in

construction is likely needed over medium term.

                                                                 25

    We acknowledge some important caveats. Given the powerful intervention that the

government can exercise on land and credit, China's housing market is subject to great policy

uncertainty as the government constantly switches between tightening and easing policies,

often to prevent a decline in growth. With changing dynamics of international relations and

mounting trade pressures, lower interest rates can be expected. Furthermore, our analysis

does not take into account shadow banking, and income statistics obtained through the survey

methodology may fail to cover the wealthiest population who often owns more than one

property for investment purposes.


2. Housing Supply



                                                                  26
    On the supply side, we follow Chivakul et al. (2015) and look at various measures of

housing inventory to determine the possible existence of an oversupply.

    In Figure 20, excess supply is measured as the gap between total housing completed or

under construction and total housing sold. Based on this measure, housing oversupply

amounted to about 2200 million square meters in 2017 with considerable heterogeneity

across city tiers. As can be seen, Tier 2 cities are faced with the most severe oversupply--it

would take more than three years to absorb the existing inventory at the current rate of sale.

    This figure reports the ratio of unsold housing floor space to sold housing floor space in first-, second-, and third-tier cities

    Note: Housing unsold refers to the difference between cumulative residential floor space completed plus floor space under
    construction minus cumulative residential floor space sold. Housing sold refers to floor space sold in a given year.




    Alternatively, excess supply can be defined as the gap between total residential floor

space started and total residential floor space sold. The advantage of using this definition is

that the measure of floor space starts is directly related to real estate investment in a given

                                                                     27
year. In comparison, the measure of floor space under construction includes floor space

planned but not completed in previous years. Based on the second measure, total housing

oversupply is estimated at about 2,850 million square meters in 2018, in which case it would

take an average of two years to absorb the existing inventory, assuming no new construction

(Figure 21).



                                                                      Figure 21. Housing Inventory

   In comparison with our approach that estimates housing inventory at the aggregate level, Glaeser et al. (2017) calculate
inventory based on developers' inventory data for 32 major Chinese cities and generalize the result to 232 other cities. The
latter approach risks underestimating housing stock particularly in tier-3 cities. Most critically, it is subject to biases inherent
in self-reported data, as the figures are submitted by real estate developers.

appears that, even prior to the Covid-19 pandemic housing supply trends were outpacing the

demand trends in an environment already characterized by significant excess supply.

    The widening gap between housing supply and demand, coupled with various negative

spillovers of housing price appreciation to the real economy, suggests that even prior to the

pandemic, there was downward pressure on prices in many areas. If so, this will make finding

a soft-landing challenging, especially as current levels may well derive from the expectations

of outsized future appreciation.

V. Housing Activities amid COVID-19

     The outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic poses great uncertainties for the housing

market. With the economy still battered even though recovering, the housing market has

started to adjust, with rents already falling.

1. Coronavirus Pandemic as a Negative Shock on Housing Activities

     China's housing market slowed down as a result of the coronavirus pandemic reducing

transactions and causing financial hurdles for many families. In February 2020, housing price

in 70 medium and large-sized cities saw the slowest growth over 57 months.25 Given that

market liquidity measured by sales volume dropped by 25% in the first quarter,26 rent serves

as a better indicator of housing market conditions. According to the Weifang rent index

compiled by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, housing rent plunged for five

consecutive months through May 2020 (Figure 23).

     Among first-tier cities, Shenzhen and Beijing took the hardest hit. Shenzhen's rent

experienced the largest fall in May 2020, down by 3.2%, and rent in Beijing fell to its lowest

level since January 2018 when the index was first launched. Housing prices in all second-tier

cities except for Xiamen and Fuzhou were on the decline, for up to 14%.

2. The Effect of Declining Housing Activities on the Economy

       Since real estate constitutes a key source of fiscal revenue for China's local governments

and an important form of collateral for enterprises, even modestly declining price, compared

to the usual pattern of ever rising prices, could pose a considerable risk.

       There are at least three channels through which declining housing activities exert a direct

effect on the economy. First, a massive reduction in home sales strains developers' cash

flows and likely puts many out of business. Rental companies have also come under immense

pressure from lockdown policies and reduced travel. According to Bloomberg,27 over 100

real estate firms active in China filed for bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2020. As 1.46

trillion yuan of corporate debt in the real estate industry is due by the end of 2020, another

tidal wave of bankruptcies is expected to come if the coronavirus pandemic does not remain

                                                                    31
contained. Second, surge in real estate insolvencies will cause people to lose their jobs or at

least part of their income, which again puts a downward pressure on housing demand. Third,

there is the financial accelerator mechanism through which property price affects the balance

sheet of households and corporates and their ability to contract loans. Housing price

movement, therefore, impacts both credit growth and financial stability.

    As we have already discussed, real estate has an amplifying effect due to its linkage to

other sectors of the economy, for example construction, household appliances, furnishings,

leasing services, etc. Therefore, a reduction in housing activities may contribute to a

downward spiral in the economy, leading to further declines in employment, income,

consumption, and investment.

    In this section, we use input-output modeling to explore the size of the impact of housing

market shocks on the economy, making use of China's latest input-output table (for the year

2017). We quantify the interdependency between sectors in the industrial network as




                                    = ( - )!"                                                (1)




where  is the vector of total output of each sector.  is the vector of final demand. 

signifies the matrix of direct requirement coefficients. Multiplying total output of each sector

with the rate of value added yields the magnitude of impact on total value added.

    In 2016, real estate investment amounted to 10,258 billion yuan, of which 7,630 billion

goes to construction and installation, 146 billion is used to purchase equipment and

instruments, and the remaining 2,482 billion is invested in other items. Investment in other

items, which is mostly land, does not form fixed assets directly and is therefore excluded

from the calculation. The estimated impact of real estate on the economy can be found in

where M is the matrix formed by diagonalizing each sector's share of imports in domestic

demand. In this case, the aggregate economic impact of real estate comes to 24% of GDP,

whereas a similar definition gives U.S. at about 15%.

        In a similar work by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Cook et al. (2018) used

the earlier (2012) version of China's input-output table and determined the magnitude of real

estate activity to be 22% of GDP. The reason that their results is slightly different from ours

is partly due to the growing importance of real estate activity to the Chinese economy from

2012 to 2017, and partly reflects the different ways we estimate real estate construction. In

Cook et al. (2018), the value of housing-related construction is computed based on the share

of fixed capital formation related to the real estate sector in total fixed capital formation,

whereas in our paper, the value of real estate construction is obtained by subtracting land

purchases from real estate investment.

    Applying a similar method, we can estimate the dependence on real estate sector of other

major economies in the world (Figure 24). China is even more dependent on housing

3. Impact of the Housing Sector under Different Scenarios for the Pandemic

       The coronavirus pandemic has created severe social disruption. Different responses to it

can lead to distinct scenarios of economic consequences. According to the Australian

National University, China's GDP is projected to fall by 6.5-9.5% depending on how well the

pandemic is brought under control, and investment will be down by 7.0-10.2% in each

scenario (Table 2). Based on the results from the input-output table, a reduction in real estate

investment of the same scale implies an additional 2.0-2.9% decrease in GDP.

       This table reports the estimated impact of real estate on the economy under different scenarios of the coronavirus pandemic.

VI. Conclusion

       This paper identifies an excess supply in China's real estate sector through cross-country

comparison and supply-demand analysis. We present new and significantly updated data to

suggest the real estate sector has an outsized footprint on China's economy, and that broadly


                                                                     35
construed (using an input-output table and taking into account higher-order effects)

constitutes 29% of China's economy, even higher than previous estimates. (Taking into

account the external sector lowers the estimate to 24%.) Moreover, demand supply factors

have tilted significantly in recent years, suggesting the possibility of significant downward

pressures, especially due to slowing trend growth.

    Based on input-output and scenario analyses, we find that 20% fall in the housing sector

and related activities (if one did occur), could lead to a roughly 5-10% decline in the level of

output.

    It is true that Chinese authorities have enormous administrative power over the value of

housing. Not only is there extensive zoning and regulation, but in China private entities

cannot own land, a fact that further underscores just how massive the Chinese real estate

explosion has been. However, as our analysis shows, authorities face a delicate balancing act

as many of the policies they could enact to hold up prices (for example tightening regulation

over the building of new homes) might help existing owners, but at the expense of more rapid

employment and production decline.

Appendix: Technical Details

        There are two types of input-output matrices, direct requirement matrix and total

requirement matrix, both of which are published in coefficient form. The direct requirements

coefficients show the amount of inputs required directly to produce one unit of output. The

total requirements coefficients show the sum of direct and indirect inputs required to produce

one unit of output.

        In this paper, we use China's input-output total requirement matrix from 2017,29 which

is also the latest official version available for our analysis (Table 3).

    In Table 3, the economy is divided into 17 industries (n=17), each a row. Given the

limited space, we only present the two columns that are relevant to the current study. The

coefficients in each column of the matrix indicate the production required directly and

indirectly in each row sector when the final demand for the column sector (that is, demand

for domestic production) increases by one unit.

    Adding up the coefficients in the column corresponding to the construction industry

gives us 2.12, which means one unit of increase in construction demand requires a total of

2.12 units of inputs from upstream and downstream industries. A similar calculation

performed for the manufacture of machinery and equipment industry gives us 2.51.

    In 2016, real estate investment amounted to 10,258 billion yuan, of which 7,630 billion

goes to construction and installation, 146 billion is used to purchase equipment and

instruments, and the remaining 2,482 billion is invested in "other items". Investment in other




                                                    40
items, which is mostly land, is not directly related to production and therefore we exclude it

from the calculation.

     Investment creates domestic demand. A 7,630-billion-yuan investment in construction

and installation will create an increase in demand of the same magnitude in industries that are

inputs to construction, the most relevant industry being the construction industry. Based on

the total requirement coefficients obtained above, it implies 16,176-billion-yuan economy-

wide production (Table 4); this includes of course the direct 7,630 billion yuan into

construction. Similarly, we assume that the demand created by 146-billion-yuan investment

in equipment and instruments mainly occurs in the manufacture of machinery and equipment

industry. Using the sum of total requirement coefficients, we estimate that a total of 366-

billion-yuan production is required from upstream and downstream industries in the

economy.

    In previous studies, Glaeser et al. (2017) focused on the construction industry alone

without taking account of its production repercussions on entire industries. As a result, they

estimated the scale of construction industry employment to be around 16%, which is

consistent with our findings. Based on the calculation by Liu and Xiong (2018), China's

housing sales totaled 13.37 trillion yuan, accounting for 16.4% of GDP in 2017. The paper

that is closest to ours is a working paper by Cook et al. (2018) of Federal Reserve Bank of

Kansas City, using an earlier (2012) version of the input-output table. More than half

difference in results (their 22% versus our 29%) is due to the higher upstream and

downstream effects of real estate found in the updated input-output table. This alone raises

the estimate from 22% to 26%. The remaining differences have to do with (1) that our

multiplier calculation takes into account higher order (e.g. second and third round, etc.)

effects of real estate expenditure. (Recall from eq., (1) in section V.2 that we are calculating

the impact of a shock to real estate

                                        = ( - )!" 

and not just including direct intermediate inputs. Also, we account for the fact that a portion

of real estate investment goes directly into equipment and instruments. Lastly, we use the

construction share of real estate investment (instead of construction value added) as real

estate-related construction demand.
