Introduction

It seems to be a universal rule that, in every country, foreign-owned firms and plants pay higher

wages, on average, than domestically-owned ones. That is true not only in developing countries,

but also in high-income countries, such as Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom.

Part of the gap in average wages can be explained by industry composition. Foreign direct

investment tends to take place in relatively high-wage industry sectors. However, the gap exists

within industries as well; in most industries, in almost all countries, foreign-owned firms or

plants pay higher wages than domestically-owned ones.

       These wage gaps raise two related questions. One is about how labor markets operate

and the other is about labor market impacts, which are relevant to decisions about policy toward

inward investment.

       The labor market operation question is whether foreign-owned firms pay a higher price

for labor, in the sense that they pay more for labor of a given quality, at least as measured by

education and broad skill categories. They might do so for several reasons. One is that they may

be forced to do so by host-country regulations or home country pressures. Another might be that

workers have a preference for locally-owned employers. A third is that foreign-owned firms

might wish to reduce employee turnover, because they invest more in training than locally-

owned firms, or because they fear the leakage of their technological advantages if employees

move to other employers. Finally, foreign firms may, because of a lack of knowledge of the local

labor market, pay higher wages to attract good workers. In other words, domestic firms might be

in a better position to identify and attract good workers without paying a wage premium.

       The labor market impact question is whether the wage level of an industry, a region, or a

whole country will be raised if a host country reduces the barriers to foreign firms or actively



                                                 1
encourages them. Such an increase in wages could result from foreign firms paying a higher

price for labor than domestic firms, as described above, but there could be impacts on wages

even if foreign and domestic firms paid the same price for labor within any industry or region.

The inflow of foreign firms might increase wages simply by raising the demand for labor. In

addition, foreign firms might introduce new high-wage industries to a country or expand a

country’s high-wage, high-skill, sector. Moreover, foreign firms might, by introducing new or

more advanced technology, cause the upgrading of average skill levels within industries. Finally,

foreign firms might shift the composition of plant sizes in the industries in which they operate

toward larger scale, higher wage operations.

           In this paper, we attempt to shed light on both of these questions as they relate to the

Indonesian manufacturing sector. The analysis is based on a cross-section of Indonesian

manufacturing plants in 1996. It has the advantage over most earlier studies of including data on

the educational level of the employees in each plant.



The Indonesian Manufacturing Sector: Data sources and Description

Manufacturing production was of low importance in Indonesia as late as in the beginning of the

1980s, and the country depended heavily on the oil sector. Foreign firms were not viewed

favorably, and their operations in Indonesia were restricted. The hostility toward FDI was a

heritage of Presidents Sukarno’s campaign against foreign interests in Indonesia, which

culminated in the nationalization of foreign firms in the 1950s. However, falling prices of oil and

other raw materials in the mid 1980s forced the government to make changes in its economic

policies, including a reduction in foreign investment regulations. 1 The reforms continued during

    See e.g. Guillouet (1990), Thee and Pangestu (1995), and Pangestu (1997).



                                                          2
the late 1980s and early 1990s, in part because of the emergence of China and other Asian

countries as strong competitors for foreign investment. The severe economic crisis, starting in

1997, has led to further liberalization and deregulation of the Indonesian economy. For instance,

the Indonesian government has been under pressure from the IMF to open new sectors of the

economy to foreign firms.

        Foreign firms have been found to pay relatively high wages in a number of countries. For

instance, foreign firms pay about 30 per cent higher wages than domestic firms in such different

countries as Mexico, Venezuela, and the United States (Aitken, Harrison, and Lipsey, 1996).

Studies on South East Asia find that foreign firms pay high wages, at least partially attributed to

their larger size and their higher capital intensities (Manning and Pang, 1990). In the case of

Indonesia Hill (1990) and Manning (1998, Ch. 6) observed that foreign and domestic firms differ

in several aspects including relatively high wages in the former. 2

        Our analysis will be based on Indonesian manufacturing data supplied by the Biro Pusat

Statistik (Central Statistical Office). All plants in the manufacturing sector with more than 20

employees are included in the census by the statistical office. There were 22,997 plants known to

the Statistical Office in 1996. However, some of the plants did not respond to the questionnaire

and Statistical Office staff estimated their data from earlier responses and average changes

within the same industries. We have excluded such estimated data from our analysis, leaving

19,911 plant observations.

        There is information for each plant on detailed industry, type of ownership, value added,

energy consumption, geographical location, and labor characteristics, separately for white-collar

and blue-collar employees. The information about the labor force includes number of employees,


2
 There are exceptions. For instance, Indonesian establishments of firms based in the Asian NIEs in the 1990s did
not always pay high wages Manning (1993).


                                                         3
wages, and the distribution by level of education completed, less than primary, primary, junior

high school, senior high school, and university.

        Among manufacturing industries at the 2-digit ISIC level, Textiles, Apparel, and Leather

(ISIC 32) is the largest in terms of both value added and employment (Table 1). That industry

and Food, Beverages, and Tobacco (ISIC 31) together constitute almost 40 per cent of value

added and over 50 per cent of employment in Indonesian manufacturing. Fabricated Metal

Products (ISIC 38) is also of major importance in terms of value added.

        The foreign share is defined as the share of production or employment in all plants with

any foreign ownership. 3 For Indonesian manufacturing as a whole the foreign shares are 16 per

cent of employment and 30 per cent of value added, indicating an average output per employee

in foreign operations around twice as high as in domestically-owned plants. The foreign shares

are relatively large in Basic Metal Industries, Fabricated Metal Products, and Other

Manufactures, but small in such labor intensive industries as Foods, Beverages, and Tobacco,

and Textiles, Apparel, and Leather. The highest government shares of employment are in Foods,

Beverages, and Tobacco, Paper and Printing, and Chemicals, and of value added in the last two

of those industries.

        The high-wage industries in Indonesian manufacturing are Paper and Printing and the two

metals industries, with Chemicals close behind. The low wage industries are Foods, etc. and

Other Manufacturing (Table 2). On average, white- collar workers earn well over twice as much

as blue- collar workers.




3
  Most foreign-owned plants are joint ventures with a foreign majority share. The average foreign share among
plants with any foreign ownership is 72 per cent. 23 per cent of the plants have 100 per cent foreign ownership and
18 per cent a foreign minority share.



                                                         4
         Wages in foreign plants are relatively high in all sectors except Basic Metal Industries

(ISIC 37), and Other Manufactures (ISIC 39). The average wage in foreign plants is about 50 per

cent higher than in private domestic plants within three-digit industries. That margin is

substantially higher than the difference reported for Mexico, Venezuela, and the United States by

Aitken, Harrison, and Lipsey (1996, Table 6). In addition, other types of labor compensation in

Indonesia, such as bonuses, gifts, social security, insurances, and pensions, are typically higher

in foreign firms. More specifically, if all such forms of labor compensation are included, foreign

plants pay about 60 per cent higher total labor compensation than private domestically-owned

plants (not shown). 4 Finally, government owned plants pay high blue-collar wages relative to

private domestically-owned plants.

         Some of the explanation for the higher wages in foreign plants is evident in Tables 3 and

4, which give the distributions of blue-collar and white-collar employees by educational

attainment. Among blue-collar employees, over 5 per cent of those in private and government

domestic plants had less than a primary education and more than 30 per cent only primary

education, while in foreign-owned plants, only 2 per cent had less than a primary education and

17 per cent only primary schooling. At the other end of the distribution, about a third of the

employees in domestic plants had stopped after completion of high school and only between 1-

2.5 per cent had a university education, while more than half the employees of foreign-owned

firms had completed high school and 3 per cent had a completed university education.

         The difference in education among white-collar employees is mainly in the elementary

school and university levels. Domestic plants, particularly government-owned ones, had a high


4
  The figures on other types of labor compensation than wages have to be treated with caution, since many plants do
not release this information. Therefore, our further analysis will mainly be restricted to differences in wages rather
than differences in total labor compensation.



                                                          5
proportion of workers with only an elementary education, but only 13 per cent of workers in

private plants and 11 per cent in government plants had completed university education, as

compared to 19 per cent in foreign-owned plants. The differences in education between

employees in foreign and domestic plants are lower for white-collar than for blue-collar workers,

in contrast to the differences in wages.

         Some other characteristics of foreign- and domestically-owned plants are described in

Table 5. Foreign-owned plants used more energy per worker and more of other current inputs per

worker, by about the same margin. They were also much larger in terms of average employment,

almost five times as large as domestically-owned plants. 5 Finally, foreign plants have the highest

proportion of female workers and government -owned plants the lowest. If there is wage

discrimination against female employees, we would expect this to have a negative effect on

overall relative wages in foreign plants.



Econometric Estimations

The figures above show wages in foreign plants to be substantially higher than wages in

domestic plants. The result is in accordance with other studies on foreign ownership and wages.

However, we have also seen that the educational levels of both blue- and white-collar employees

are higher in foreign than in domestic plants and that foreign plants use more inputs and are

larger in size.




5
  Capital stocks were reported but do not seem reliable. For instance, the ratio between foreign and domestic plants’
capital labor ratios went from about 3 in 1995 to 0.7 in 1996. One likely reason is that the Central Statistical Office
changed the definition of capital stocks in the questionnaire for 1996. Apparently, the new definition did not yield
satisfactory responses and the Statistical Office later returned to the old definition.



                                                           6
        In examining the determinants of plants’ wage levels, we estimate an equation of the

form:



        lnW = f(Foreign owner, Government owner, Education, Sector, Location, lnX),           (1)



where W is a plant’s average wage (separately for blue and white-collar employees), Foreign

owner and Government owner are dummy variables for different ownership, Education is the

education level of the employees (the share of the employees with primary, junior, senior, and

university education), Sector and Location are dummy variables for industries and provinces, and

X is a vector with plant specific characteristics such as size, the share of females, and the use of

inputs. Descriptive statistics for the variables are found in table A1.

        Table 6 examines the effect of foreign ownership and education on wages. All the

equations here assume that the premiums paid for each higher level of education to blue-collar

and white-collar workers are identical across industries (3 digit level of ISIC), regions

(provinces), and types of ownership.

        Regressions 1 and 2 show that the higher average wages in foreign-owned plants are not

simply a reflection of higher labor quality, as measured by education. They represent a higher

price for labor of a given quality, and by a large margin: a third for blue-collar workers and 70

per cent for white-collar workers.

        The Indonesian labor market has become increasingly integrated during the 1990s

(Manning, 1998). Most migration within the manufacturing sector is from the outer islands to

industrial centers on Java, and the mobility of educated labor seems to be the highest. Still,

Indonesia’s vast archipelago and relatively poor communication means that some segmentation




                                                  7
of the labor market is likely to remain. Moreover, FDI in Indonesia tends to be clustered in

certain industries and regions (Sjöholm, 1999a, 1999b). We therefore add 3-digit industry and

province dummy variables in Regressions 3 and 4, because we do not wish an industry or region

wage effect due to historical development or to the location of government or other industries, to

masquerade as an effect of foreign ownership. That addition reduces the coefficients for foreign

ownership and for each level of education. Use of the dummy variables produces a more

conservative estimate of the effects of ownership, with some risk that effects of foreign

ownership may disappear into some of the dummy variable coefficients. Even this form of the

equations indicates that foreign firms pay a higher price for labor than domestic firms do. The

foreign premium is about a quarter for blue-collar workers and over a half for white-collar

workers.

       As previously said, foreign-owned operations are clustered in a few provinces. More

precisely, 80 per cent of value added in foreign owned plants is produced in three provinces on

Java – East Java, West Java, and Jakarta. As an alternative to using province dummy variables,

we examined the difference between foreign and domestic plants in these three provinces alone

but the previous results remained largely unaffected (not shown).

       Increased education has a positive effect on wages in all groups of plants, and the

differential for university education is particularly high. It seems to be higher, surprisingly,

relative to both the omitted group (primary education completed) and to high school graduates,

for blue-collar workers than for white-collar workers. The inclusion of the industry and province

dummy variables reduces the university differential, as well as the foreign ownership differential.

       Foreign-owned plants tend to use energy, and other inputs more intensively than do

domestically-owned ones, as shown in Table 5. Those factor intensities should imply higher




                                                  8
marginal productivity for workers in foreign-owned plants and higher wages on that account if

labor markets are not perfectly competitive. Foreign-owned plants are also much larger than

domestically-owned plants, on average, and it is typical of most countries that larger plants pay

higher wages than smaller ones. The possible influence of these characteristics is examined in

Table 7.

        The additional input variables all affect wage levels positively. Size, too, has the

expected positive effect, and the degree of explanation of wage levels improves. The female

share of the labor force, finally, has a negative and statistical significant effect on wages. The

wage differentials for foreign ownership itself are still significant, but the coefficients are

reduced. The remaining direct effect of foreign ownership is about 12 per cent higher wages for

blue-collar workers and about 22 per cent for white-collar workers. 6 The implication of the

reduction in the foreign ownership differential is that part of the gross differential operates

through larger size and higher inputs per worker in foreign-owned plants, partially offset by

greater use of female workers by foreign plants.

        Not only the foreign-ownership wage differential, but also the education premiums are

reduced somewhat by the addition of the other input measures. That is more true for blue-collar

than for white-collar workers and the difference suggests that some of the surprisingly large

differentials in return to education may reflect plant characteristics, rather than education itself.

        Table 8 analyzes some of the interrelationships between size and the other variables by

examining three size classes separately. The foreign plant wage differential is insignificant for

white-collar workers in the smallest size class, partly because there are few foreign plants there,

only 31 in all industries combined. The differential is large in the medium size class, and


6
 The coefficient for Foreign Owner increased to about 0.24 for blue-collar workers and about 0.26 for white-collar
workers when we used total labor compensation, instead of wages, as the dependent variable.


                                                        9
significant even though, with only 111 foreign plants, 30 industries, and 27 provinces, there are

many cells empty of foreign plants. The differential for the large plants, the class containing

most foreign operations, is similar to that in Table 7 for all plants, and confirms that size alone is

not the explanation of the higher wages in foreign plants.

       The wage differentials for all levels of schooling except university completion are larger

for white-collar than for blue-collar employees. Those for schooling below the university level

do not differ greatly across plant size classes. However, the differential for university education

is much higher in the large plants, especially for blue-collar employees.

       The equations in the tables so far have assumed that education premiums are identical

among all ownership groups. That assumption is tested in Table 9, which shows versions of

equation 1 fitted to data for private domestic, government, and foreign plant workers separately.

       In the private domestic sector, there are clear negative effects on wages from failure to

complete elementary education. The coefficients in the foreign-owned sector are of similar size,

but are not statistically significant, perhaps because the number of observations for such workers

is much smaller. In the government sector, the wage effects are much smaller than in the other

two.

       The largest differences by type of ownership are for university completion. The

premiums are larger in government and foreign-owned plants than in private domestic ones.

And they are particularly large for blue-collar workers in those two sectors, well above the

premium paid to white-collar workers for university completion.

       There is evidence here that some of our assumptions, such as the equality of wage effects

across different plant sizes and types of ownership, are questionable. For example, education

effects on wages are largest for foreign-owned plants, and greater within the larger plants than in




                                                  10
others. However, the previous results regarding a wage premium in foreign plants seem robust.

For instance, estimating the previous regressions on determinants of average wages, but allowing

for different wage effects in plants with different ownership, did not change our main results (not

shown).



Does FDI affect wages in domestic plants?

        We have found that wages in foreign plants are higher than in domestic plants, even after

differences in labor quality (employee education) and plant characteristics are taken into account.

FDI could also raise the wages of employees in domestic plants even if there were no differential

between wages in foreign-owned plants and those in domestic plants. That would be the case if

labor markets were close to being perfectly competitive. For instance, foreign firms might raise

the demand for labor or increase competition in labor markets, and thereby force domestic plants

to increase wages. Moreover, technological externalities – spillovers – from FDI may increase

productivity and, possibly, wages in domestic plants. 7 Labor turnover, demonstration effects, or

support of linkage industries may for instance cause such spillovers and raise the technological

level in domestic plants.

        To examine the effect of FDI on wages in domestic plants we estimate equation 1

including only domestic plants, but add the variable FDI, which is the share of an industry’s

value added produced in foreign plants. The foreign share is calculated at several different levels

of the industrial classification, each implying a different definition of a labor market. Equations

with foreign shares measured at a 2-digit ISIC level imply that a labor market consists of workers

throughout Indonesia within a 2-digit industry. It assumes that workers move freely among

  Blomström and Sjöholm (1999) and Sjöholm (1999a, 1999c) find spillovers from FDI on domestic plants’
productivity in Indonesia.


                                                     11
firms and among the 3-digit and 5-digit components of a two-digit industry, but not from one 2-

digit industry to another. When the share is calculated at a 3-digit level, the implication is that

workers do not move from one 3-digit sub-industry to another, even within the same 2-digit

industry, but do move among 5-digit industries. The equations with foreign five-digit ISIC

industry shares assume labor mobility only within single 5-digit industries, implying that 5-digit

industries define labor markets in which foreign and domestic firms compete for labor.

       We would expect the coefficient for FDI to be positive and statistically significant if FDI

leads to higher wages in domestic plants. That expectation is strongly confirmed in Table 10,

whatever the level at which the FDI shares are calculated. While the coefficients for the other

variables are not much affected by the level used for the FDI share variable, the FDI coefficient

diminishes as the industrial classification becomes more detailed. One might expect the opposite

result if competition for labor were most severe among firms in the same narrow industry.

However, the narrowing of the classification may have the effect of reducing the number of cases

in which foreign and domestic establishments, similar in various characteristics, co-exist in the

same industry.

       The potential impact on wages from FDI may be conditioned on geographic proximity.

For instance, previous studies of patent citations suggest that technological spillovers benefit

mainly other actors in the same region (Jaffe et al. 1993). Moreover, as previously discussed,

there are reasons to believe that the Indonesian labor market shows some degree of regional

segmentation. We therefore calculate an alternative measure of FDI – FDI province – which is

the share of an industry’s output in a province that is produced in foreign plants. We would

expect a positive and statistically significant coefficient on FDI province if foreign firms affect

wages in domestic plants in the same industry within the same province.




                                                 12
        Table 11 shows equations for wages in domestic plants where the FDI share is measured

within each province. In the first equation of each set, white-collar and blue-collar, the implicit

assumption is that labor is mobile among industries within a province, but not across provinces.

Therefore, the effect of FDI presence in any industry is felt in all industries in the same province.

The FDI share coefficient at the province level is positive and statistically significant, and about

the same size as the national FDI share variable at the 2-digit level in Table 10. The next pair of

equations, with the FDI share in the province calculated at the two-digit ISIC level, implies that

FDI presence affects wages only within the same two-digit industry in the same province. The

coefficients for FDI share are again statistically significant, but much smaller, though one might

expect the effect to be stronger within the same two-digit industry than across all industries in a

province. As the industry breakdown becomes finer, the coefficients on FDI share decrease

further, but they are always significant. 8



Conclusions

        The clearest labor market conclusion from our analysis is that foreign-owned plants in

Indonesia pay a higher price for labor than domestically-owned plants. They pay higher wages

for workers of a given educational level, by a margin of about a quarter for blue-collar workers

and over a half for white-collar workers. Furthermore, those higher wages for workers of a given

educational level do not reflect only the greater size and larger inputs per worker in foreign

plants, or their industry or location. Even taking account of all these factors, wages in foreign-

owned plants are about 12 per cent higher than in private domestic plants for blue-collar workers

and by more than 20 per cent for white-collar workers.

 Regressions with total labor compensation as dependent variable confirmed the results with marginally larger
coefficients for the different FDI variables.

       Foreign ownership in an industry, or an industry within a region, could affect wages in

domestic plants, or in all plants taken together, even if there were no differential in wage levels

between foreign and domestic plants. Higher foreign ownership in an industry, or in a province,

or in an industry in a province, appears to raise the level of wages in domestically-owned plants

for workers of a given educational level. It raises their wages aside from the influence of plant

size and the extent of energy and other inputs.

       Since higher foreign presence raises the level of wages in domestically-owned plants, and

foreign-owned plants pay higher wages than domestically-owned plants, higher foreign presence

must act to raise the wage level for all plants, domestic and foreign, taken together. This effect

on wages is in addition to the effect of the larger average size of foreign-owned plants and their

typically higher average inputs of other factors of production.
