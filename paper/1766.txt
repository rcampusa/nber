     Among the interesting changes in the U.S. economy in recent years
have been the substantial changes in the age distribution of income and
its components. These changes are interesting in and of themselves, but
also are an important background against which to interpret aggregate
economic statistics.

     In this paper we present detailed data on both the shares of
income, and the relative income per household, of households headed by
persons of different ages. These data are supplemented by analogous
data for the various components of income: earnings, property income,
Social Security, unemployment insurance, welfare, and pensions. These
data are tabulated from 17 years of the annual Current Population
Surveys (CPS).

     Among the most interesting trends are the dramatic increase in the
share of income received by households over the age of 65 and also in
their relative incomes; the enormous growth in the absolute and relative
contribution of Social Security income to the incomes of households 55-
64, and 65 and over; the sharp decrease in the share of total earnings
and of the relative earnings of these two most elderly cohorts; and
swings in the shares of total income of the other age cohorts which
reflect in part changes in the numbers of persons in households of
different ages, e.g., due to the aging of the baby-boom generation.

1.   Introduction

     Among the important changes in the U.S. economy in the last twenty

years have been the dramatic shifts in the age distribution of income

and its components. There are undoubtedly many reasons for these

shifts, although the large increases in real Social Security benefits in

the early l970s and the continuing trend toward early retirement and

disability probably play a prominent role. In addition, substantial

changes in the age/sex/experience/occupational mix of the labor force

and changes in the nature of household composition are undoubtedly

important. As an input to other research1 we have compiled

substantial time series data from 17 years of current population

surveys. Many commentors on this other research have indicated to us

that it might be extremely valuable if we provided these data for use by

other researchers. The purpose of this paper is to present both an

overview of the broad trends and changes in the age distribution of

income in the United States from 1968 to 1984, and to provide the

detailed data for such possible use.

     Changes in the age distribution of income are important for a

variety of reasons. Pronounced changes affect our ability to interpret

conventional aggregate statistics, such as consumption or saving rates.

They can be of potential use in testing alternative economic theories,

e.g., those concerning saving behavior.2 Of course, they are

Test of the Neutrality Hypothesis," Carnegie-Rochester Conference
Series, Summer 1985.

interesting in and of themselves in documenting important trends and

developments in the economy.

     Such data have not been available previously for a number of

reasons. Most of our concern with time series on income and its

components has focused on aggregates or on disaggregation by income

group rather than age. Fortunately, the March Supplement to the Current

Population Survey (CPS) provides detailed information on income and its

components disaggregated in a number of ways, including by age of head

of household.3 We have merged the 1968 through 1984 CPS tapes in

order to produce the data on the age distribution of income and relative

incomes per household of different age cohorts.

     In Section 2 we discuss the general patterns which emerge in

examining the age distribution of total income. We also discuss some of

the interesting features revealed in the time series on the age

distribution of the components of income, such as earnings, property

income, Social Security, etc. We also mention several caveats on using

the data, such as the likelihood of systematic underreporting of

property income and some inconsistencies in the classification of income



3. The term "household" as used in this manuscript deserves elaboration.
The disaggregation we sought for our research was the proverbial
"economic decision-making unit." In practice, that is not always a
household, nor is it always a family. Obviously we consider any
dwelling occupied by immediate family members only as a household. If
two or more families occupy the same dwelling, they are each counted as
a separate household. Finally, any unrelated individuals occupying the
same housing unit are counted as separate households. Henceforth, we
shall refer to all economic decision-making units delineated as
indicated above as a "household."

        This section also contains charts presenting the time series

changes in the age distribution of income and its components and

comparisons among age cohorts, of relative household incomes.

        In Section 3, we present more detail concerning the adjustments we

made to the CPS data and possible issues which may arise when using the

data.

        We also present full time series data for total income and each of

the components of income in an Appendix for those who will find them of

use in their own research.


2. Major Trends in the Age Distribution of Income and Its Components

        Figures 1 and 2 present a visual summary of the major trends in the

share of total income received by households headed by persons of

different age groups and in the ratio of income per household of

different age groups to the 35-44 year old group's average income per

household. The full data on total income shares and group income per

household relative to the 35-44 income per household, together with

various other aggregate statistics are presented in the Appendix in

Table 1. In addition to the share of income and the relative income,

the data on income per household and the number of households are also

of substantial interest in the discussion which follows.

        The age distribution of total income has changed substantially over

the period 1968-1984. The share of total income received by households

headed by those 65 and over increased over 30%, while the share

accounted for by those 45-54, for example, declined substantially. The

other major change from the beginning to the end of the period was the

substantial increase in the share of total income received by households

with heads age 25-34. These total income share statistics must be read

in combination with those on the number of households.   For example,

from 1968 to 1984 the total number of households increased by about 47%.

The number of households increased more than proportionally for the 15-

24 year old age group and the 65 and over group, and less than

proportionally for the 35-44 year old, the 55-64 year old and the 45-54

year old groups. Most pronounced was the 25-34 year age group, whose

number of households doubled.

     The shares of total income received over the period suggest a

substantial shift, therefore, from the mature households in the 45-54

year age category to the baby-boomers, age 25-34 in this period, and the

elderly, those over 65.

     A different pattern emerges, however, when we look at the relative

incomes per household for the different age categories in Figure 2.

Clearly, some of the shift in total income to the elderly and young

adults occurred for purely demographic reasons reflecting the number of

households. The 25-34 year old group, for example, had about a 20%

increase in its share of total income, but when we examine the income

per household, we find that income per household declined by about 12%

relative to the 35-44 year old group's income per household. Most of

the trends in income per household relative to the 35-44 year old group

are monotonic over the period, whereas the total income shares often

peak or trough in the mid-1970s, reflecting the movement of the baby-

boom generation from age group to age group.

     Also of substantial interest in Figure 2 are the substantial gains

in income per household relative to the 35-44 year old group made by 45-




                                6
54 year olds, 55-64 year olds, and those 65 and over. From the

beginning to the end of the period, the gains amounted to approximately

7%, 10%, and 25%, respectively. Correspondingly, the 15-24 year old and

25-34 year old groups experienced relative declines of 27% and 13%,

respectively.

     We present the full data in Table 1.     It should be emphasized that

no control is made for the typical size of household or the average

number of workers per household, which may well     vary not only across

different age groups but also through time.

     Figures 3 - 8 convey a pictorial summary of the data contained in

Tables 2 - 7 in the Appendix. These data disaggregate the components of

income and examine the shares of the total for each component, and the

groups average per household relative to the 35-44 year old groups

average per household, for each component of income.

     Among the many interesting features of these figures and tables, we

point out the following:

     1.   For both those over age 65 and those 55-64, the group's

relative earnings moved opposite to their relative incomes. Both groups

had major gains in their incomes per household relative to the 35-44

year olds, but their earnings relative to this group dropped

substantially. For the 65 and over group, this undoubtedly reflects the

continued decline in labor force participation which apparently

accelerated in the early part of this period.4

     For the 55-64 year olds, it may also reflect declining labor force

participation, the increased trend to accepting Social Security benefits

at age 62 rather than at age 65, and the growth in disability. While

the 55-64 year olds had about the same share of total income in 1984 as

in 1968, their share of total earnings declined almost 10%. While the

65 and over group had an increase in their share of total income of over

30%, their share of total earnings, which was already small in 1968,

fell   still further.

       For all other groups, the movements in earnings were very similar

to movements in total income, since earnings tend to dominate total

income for these groups. Data analogous to those for total income in

Table 1 are presented for earnings in Table 2 in the Appendix.

       2.   We turn next to the data on property income given in Table 3

in the Appendix and note that the share of all property income increased

substantially for the 25-34 year olds for a large part of the period,

but began to decline somewhat around 1981. Undoubtedly, this partly

reflects the passage of the baby-boom generation into the next age

cohort. The share of property income for 35-44 year olds and 55-64 year

olds varies somewhat over the period, but for each the share at the end

of the period is very close to the share at the beginning. The most

pronounced movements are the decline in the share of property income of

45-54 year olds and the substantial increase in the share of property

income of those 65 and over. The increase for the latter group was

about 12%, while the decline for the former was about 30%. Again, these

shares of all property income reflect the differential growth in the

number of households in these age groups mentioned above and presented

in Table 1. The age-group-specific property income per household

relative to the 35-44 year olds' property income per household exhibits
substantial variation and often no monotonic trend. This may partly

reflect systematic underreporting of property income in the CPS and

other household surveys. This component is probably the least reliable

of any of the components.

     3.   When we look at Social Security income, which includes

survivors' benefits, disability payments, and (after 1976) Supplemental

Security Income (SSI), not surprisingly we see that the overwhelming

bulk of this income accrues to those in the 65 and over group. Still,

their share of all Social Security income, a component which grew much

more rapidly than income in general, grew throughout this period. Part

of this is due to the slightly larger increase in the number of

households as well as various features of the Social Security system.

The average nominal Social Security income per household increased six-

fold over this period, while the price level increased 270%

    The share of all Social Security income received by households in

the 55-64 age group also increased substantially, ranging from about 12%

in the 1968-72 period to close to 16% in its peak in 1978, and declining

thereafter to 14-15%. The Social Security income per household in this

group grew by 750% in nominal terms over this period. Examining just

the Social Security income per household undoubtedly can be misleading.

Most of these households received no Social Security income, whereas a

modest fraction received very substantial Social Security benefit

payments, i.e., those who were disabled or those, especially in the age

62-64 group, who had retired.    While there are some modest changes in

the shares of total Social Security payments for the other age groups,

the total amounts are very small relative to those of the two oldest age

groups. Perhaps the most noticeable is the fall in the share of all


                                19
Social Security income from about 8% to 4% for those in the age 45-54

year old group, reflecting in part the relative decline in the share of

total households represented by this age group.

     Prior to 1976, a variety of old age benefits were included in

welfare income which were subsequently included in Social Security

income. Therefore, as detailed in Table 5, the share of welfare income

received by those 65 and over was 30% in 1968, but only 4% in 1984, the

fall primarily due to the fact that substantial benefit payments were

reclassified as Social Security. Thus, the welfare statistics must be

interpreted with this proviso in mind. Even with this correction, it is

still clear that the young age groups experienced substantial real

increases in welfare income per household.

     Data on age specific income and relative income from unemployment

insurance by year from 1968-1984 are presented in Table 6 in the

Appendix as well as graphically presented in Figures 3 - 8.   Since the

amount of unemployment insurance reflects not only a secular increase in

the generosity of unemployment insurance, but cyclical factors in the

economy (witness the substantial increase in unemployment benefits in

the 1975 recession, for example), we choose not to elaborate on this

specific component. Undoubtedly, it would be interesting to merge these

data with age-specific unemployment rates by year, but that is beyond

the scope of this paper. It should be noted that for some purposes,

researchers might wish to aggregate unemployment insurance with welfare

and/or Social Security income.

     Table 7 in the Appendix elaborates the information contained in

Figures 3 - 8 on age specific shares of pension income and relative

pension income. Not surprisingly, pension income has risen



                                 20
substantially in all but the youngest age groups. The overwhelming bulk

of pension income, obviously, is received by those 55 and over. Indeed,

in 1984, over half of total reported pension income was received by

those over the age of 65. This age group's total pension income of $40

billion was almost 15 times its nominal pension income in 1968. For

the 55-64 year old group, the aggregate was $25.7 billion, in 1984, a

25-fold nominal increase over the period.   For 1968-75, the changes in

the data are very modest and are also obscured by the inclusion of net

royalties, alimony, and other regular contributions. After 1975, the

pension income series is much closer to what one might expect of the

typical definition, including only private and government pensions and

annuities. This changed nature of the recording of the component is

partly responsible for the decline in the (albeit very modest) pension

income of the two youngest age groups in this period.

     Pension income may also be systematically understated as is

property income. Unfortunately, the proclivity to underreport pension

income is not as well-studied as the proclivity to underreport other

types of property income. Obviously, for different types of analyses,

researchers may wish to combine the pension income data with those on

property income, and in other cases, with those on Social Security.

    We have followed certain major trends in the age distribution of

income and its components in the period 1968-84 in the United States.

Substantial changes, some monotonic and others not, occurred in this

period, both in the individual components and in the aggregate. These

reflect, obviously, demographic trends, economic events (such as high

interest rates in recent years), and the changing impact of various

fiscal programs (e.g., Social Security). Changes in the typical size of



                                21
households and the average number of workers per household have much to

do with the changes noted. We have deliberately avoided trying to

decompose these changes by their potential causes, not because this is

not a worthwhile subject of inquiry, but because our purpose is to

present broad trends and make the data available to the research

community. Perhaps these data will be useful as an input into generating

research precisely on these questions.


3. Technical Issues

     In addition to the discontinuities associated with many of the

series on income components discussed in Section 2, other problems with

the CPS March Supplement tapes are likely to be of interest to those

considering use of this data set.

     The first issue confronting a researcher using the CPS data is

selection of the type of record from which to gather information. For

purposes of testing economic theories, one must have data decomposed

into the relevant decision-making unit. The relevant unit in most cases

is the family. Although the CPS data file contains a record for each

family, there are two drawbacks to using family records directly.

First, prior to 1976 the family records do not offer a detailed

breakdown of income by source. Furthermore, the family record

aggregates the income information of primary families and subfamilies

when the two inhabit the same dwelling (a subfamily is a family with

members related to the primary family in the household). To the extent



5. The precise nature of these discontinuities is noted after the
respective tables in the Appendix.




                               22
economic decisions are made independently by primary families and

subfamilies, this aggregation is undesirable.

     By using income information found on person records in the data

file, one can circumvent these problems. Person records provide a

detailed breakdown of income sources throughout the sample and also

permit separation of primary family and subfamily data. Unfortunately,

there is another problem that is unavoidable, regardless of the record-.

type chosen.

     This second problem stems from the truncation of income amounts in

reporting. If income exceeds a designated ceiling in some category, the

ceiling value is reported rather than the actual amount of income

received. The nominal value of the ceilings changes over the sample

period. In the interest of partial consistency, we chose to truncate

each income source at the same real amount throughout the sample. A

base year was selected for each category in which the given nominal

ceiling represented the minimum ceiling in real terms for the entire

sample period. Nominal ceiling levels in all other years were then

calculated by applying the implicit personal consumption expenditure

deflator to the real value of the ceiling.

     Once the nominal ceilings have been determined for each category

and each year, the procedure is one of simple truncation. If the

reported value exceeds the nominal ceiling, only the ceiling value is

added as we aggregate income totals by source across the various

cohorts. This truncation obviously biases the dispersion of income

downward, but our procedure of truncating at equivalent values in real

terms may make our measures more consistent over the sample. It is

certainly conceivable that one could get a more accurate measure by



                               23
employing more sophisticated statistical techniques to estimate the

upper tail of the distribution for each category and each cohort. Our

procedure is admittedly simple, but served our purpose. Truncation is

likely to cause more distortion in some components of income, such as

earnings and property income for which the ceiling amounts were more

likely to be binding.

     Despite these caveats, the CPS March Supplement remains a

potentially valuable source of data for researchers interested in income

information decomposed by source, age group, race, etc. Table 1

presents data on the age distribution of total income. Tables 2-7

present data on the age distribution of the components of income:

earnings, property income, social security, welfare, unemployment

insurance, and pensions. We hope other researchers find these data

useful for their own research.

 1.   This category includes income from unemployment insurance, veterans payments, and
 workman's compensation throughout the sample. From 1968-1975 government employee pensions
are also included. Consequently, there is a drastic reduction in the share of this income
going to households headed by individuals 65 and over after 1975.

     Pension income as defined in the CPS
                                           includes private pensions, annuities, net
royalties, alimony, and other regular contributions from 1968-1975. After 1975, pension
income consists of only private and
                                    qovernrnent pensions and annuities. Hence, there is severe
discontinuity in these statistics.
