           This paper examines the effects of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards (CAFE)
on the automobile product mix, prices, and fuel consumption.         To this end, first a discrete choice
model of automobile       demand and a continuous model of vehicle utilization are estimated using
micro data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey for 1984-1990,            Next, the demand side model
is combined with a model of oligopoly and product differentiation         on the supply side. After the
demand and supply parameters are estimated, the effects of the CAFE regulation are assessed
through simulations,      and compared to the effects of alternative policy instruments,          such as a
powerful gas guzzler tax and an increase in the gasoline tax. Our results can be summarized                 as
follows:
           Vehicle utilization is in the short run unresponsive to fuel cost changes; vehicle purchases,
however, respond to both car prices and fuel cost.          These results taken together imply that (1)
contrary to the claims of CAFE opponents, higher fleet fuel efficiency is not neutralized by increased
driving, and (2) policies aiming at reducing fuel consumption by shifting the composition         of the car
fleet towards more fuel efficient vehicles are more promising than policies that target utilization.
Policies with such compositional effects operate through two channels: changes in vehicle prices and
changes in the operating costs. Contrary to the claims of environmental        groups, our results do not
indicate the existence of consumer “myopia.”        Nonetheless, we find that the gasoline tax increase
necessary to achieve fuel consumption reductions equivalent to the ones currently achieved through
CAFE       is 780%;    whether   an increase   of this magnitude    is currently   politically   feasible   is
questionable.    In general, our results indicate that the CAFE regulation was effective in reducing fuel
consumption;      however, shifts in the classification   of products as domestic vs. imports may have
weakened the effectiveness of the standards.

I. Introduction


   The Corporate —-Average Fuel Efficiency standard (CAFE) has caused controversy since
Congress enacted it in 1975. According to the CAFE regulation, every seller of automobiles
in the U.S. had to achieve by 1985 a minimum                 sales-weighted   average fuel efficiency of 27.5
Miles per Gallon.        This standard   had to be achieved for domestically           produced    and imported
cars separately.       Failure to meet the prescribed       standard   incurred    a penalty   of $5 per car per
1/10 of a gallon that the corporate         average fuel economy fell below the standard. 1 The CAFE
regulation      has remained    in place for the last 19 years; in fact, in recent years there has even
been public debate on proposals          to raise the standard     up to 50 MPG.2

    The original goal of the CAFE regulation             was to reduce fuel consumption           in a period of
high oil prices. Today the rationale has shifted towards reducing consumption                  for environmental
purposes.       CAFE opponents,     however, claim that regulating       fuel economy may act ually increase
fuel consumption.      3 This perverse effect could arise, for example, if the regulation          increased    the
relative price of large cars and consumers           with a strong preference for these cars switched              to
less fuel-efficient,    used vehicles, rather    than to small cars.     Another     possibility y is that higher
fuel efficiency induces consumers        to drive their cars more.

    In addition     to affecting fuel consumption,     the CAFE standard          is also claimed to have trade
effects.    Because fuel efficient imports      cannot be used to offset less efficient domestically           pro-
duced cars, there is a disincentive       for domestic producers       to move the production       of small cars
abroad;     in this sense, the CAFE standard         has a job protection     function.    On the other hand,
Japanese     producers     with fuel efficient fleets are not effectively constrained          by the standard,
and can therefore        compete   more successfully in the market for large and luxury cars that has
traditionally     been dominated     by domestic manufacturers.

    Despite the lively debate surrounding          CAFE and the numerous             articles on the subject       in
the public press, empirical        evidence on the effectiveness       of the program     has been scarce and
inconclusive.4     While improvements      in the average fuel efficiency of the new car fleet in the 1980s
   lIf, however, manufacturers exceed the minimum average required for any given model year, they are permit-
ted to carry forward the surplus to subsequent years. In some circumstances, they are also allowed to borrow
against future surpluses.

   4Most of the work on environmental regulation in the auto industry has focused either on theoretical argu-
ments (e.g. Kwoka (1983)), or on the analysis of Auto Emission Standards (e.g. Gruenspecht (1982), Breshna-

have been uncontroversial,         the contribution      of the CAFE regulation       to these improvements           and
the implications      for fuel consumption      savings are still open questions.         To my knowledge,           only
three studies have attempted          to resolve these issues by estimating       the short run effects of CAFE,
each yielding diffe~e”ntresults:       Mayo and Mathis (1988) regressed the average fleet fuel efficiency
on CAFE standards             and found that the CAFE coefficient was statistically               insignificant;     they
interpreted     this as evidence that the CAFE regulation              was ineffective.   Their results, however,
refer to 1978-84, a period          in which CAFE was not mandatory.                 Greene (1990) estimated                a
polynomial      distributed    lag model for 1978-89 to determine the relative contributions                of past and
current fuel price changes and CAFE standards                   to the fuel efficiency improvements;          he found
the impact      of the CAFE regulation         to be significant.      A common feature          of the two studies
cited above, is that they focus on the relationship               between CAFE standards          and fuel economy
improvements;        the key question     of whether       these improvements      led to fuel savings, remains
unanswered.        Yee (1991) provided       a more structural        treatment    of the CAFE regulation,                by
estimating     a model of the U.S. auto market using aggregate data, and employing simulations                            to
assess the effects of alternative      policy scenarios.     He found that CAFE reduced fuel consumption;
but the credibility     of the results is limited by the fact that his approach               does not model either
vehicle utilization     or the oligopolistic    interaction      between automobile       manufacturers,          so that
the elasticities    needed in the simulations         have to be obtained     from external      sources.

    An essential prerequisite        for any assessment      of the effects of the CAFE regulation,           is knowl-
edge of the automobile           demand    and supply parameters,          the elasticities     of substitution       and
vehicle utilization     parameters     in particular.     The purpose     of this paper is to obtain         these pa-
rameters      by estimating     a model of the U.S. Automobile         Industry   using micro data, and use the
results to analyze the short term environmental                 effects of CAFE standards.        In particular,     this
project aims at addressing          the following questions:

1) What are the effects of the CAFE standard                on automobile     prices, sales and product            mix?

2) What are the expected environmental             effects of the CAFE standard?          In particular,      what are
the effects on vehicle utilization        and fuel consumption?          From an environmental           perspective,
the relevant variable is obviously not the average fuel efficiency of the new car fleet, but rather
the Tot al Gallons consumed           by U.S. drivers in a particular       time interval.      Expressing     the fuel
consumption        of each driver as the product        of Total Miles driven in a certain period on each car
times Gallons per Mile for each car, (Miles * Gallons/Mile),                 allows us to address two separate

han and Yao (1985), Kahn (1994)). Crandall and Graham (1989) analyzed the long term effects of CAFE by
examining the impact of fuel economy rules on automobile design.


                                                            2
questions:     First,    how do the-CAFE         standards        affect the choice of new vehicles?              (Does the
CAFE regulation           really lead, as claimed by its proponents,                 to substitution    towards     smaller,
more fuel efficient cars? ) Second, how does fuel efficiency affect vehicle ut ilizat ion? If higher
fuel efficiency resulted      in increased     driving, this would erode any beneficial effects the CAFE
regulation     might have.

3) How does the CAFE regulation               affect the location of production?

4) How does CAFE compare to alternative                   fuel efficiency measures,        a gasoline tax in particular?

    To address the above questions            I combine a disaggregate          model of automobile         demand and
utilization    with an aggregate         oligopoly      and product      differentiation      model.    The theoretical
framework      is similar to the one developed             in Goldberg     (1995) with two main differences:             On
the demand        side, I extend    the model considered             in Goldberg        (1995) to incorporate       vehicle
utilization,   that is miles driven on each new car purchased.                   On the supply side, I allow firms
to employ – in addition         to prices – another          strategic   variable:     the location    of production,     or
more accurately,        the percentage     of their sales that is classified as ‘(imports”             according     to the
EPA definition.         This allows me to analyze the trade policy aspect of the CAFE regulation.

    The remainder          of the paper     is organized       as follows.    Section II presents        the theoretical
framework      and the estimation         strategy      in detail.   Section 111 briefly discusses         the data.      In
Section IV I detail the demand,           utilization      and supply parameters           estimated   using the model,
and discuss their implications       for questions        1-3 above. Section V presents the simulation              results
for alternative    fuel efficiency measures          and assesses the effectiveness          of the CAFE regulation.
Section VI concludes.


II. Theoretical         Framework


11.1 Automobile           Demand     and Utilization


    The modelling         of the consumer     side of the auto market requires a unified model of vehicle
choice and usage. To illustrate          the necessity of such a model, consider a utilization               equation     of
the following form:




                                                              3
The variable Zi denotes the usage of vehicle Z, as measured                        by the miles driven on that vehicle
in a specific time interval.           Vehicle usage will generally depend on the “price per vehicle mile”,
pi, which      varies    by vehicle    type     as it is given   by the product of gasoline price and Gallons per
Mile, a vector si ~f ‘vehicle characteristics,               such as horsepower,       cylinders,      etc., and a vector of
household       characteristics,      w, such as income, family size, age, etc. A more general specification
of the above equation           will also include interactions          of vehicle and consumer specific attributes,
e.g. interactions         of the “price per mile” variable with income or family size, to account for the
fact that different consumers             may exhibit different price elasticities          depending      on their value of
time, income, etc. The error term q stands for unobserved                          consumer    characteristics,      while the
remaining       Greek letters denote parameters              to be estimated.

     By estimating          the above equation,         one hopes to retrieve the short run price elasticity                   of
mileage demand.            In the context of a CAFE regulation              analysis, the parameters         of interest     are
the ones relating vehicle specific attributes               to vehicle usage. As a result of the CAFE standards
one expects the relative prices of large cars to rise, inducing a shift towards smaller, more fuel
efficient cars. Consider a household,                which because of this price increase switched from a large
to a small car. This switch changes not only the vehicle specific attributes                            in the household’s
utilization     equation      (the vector Si, and the choice dummy a~), but also the “price per mile”
variable,     since the latter        depends     on the fuel efficiency of the new vehicle.             For an evaluation
of the CAFE         regulation,       it is essential      to know how utilization         will respond      to higher fuel
efficiency.

     Estimation         of the utilization      equation    by OLS requires the identification            assumption       that
the error term q is uncorrelated                with the right hand side variables.            As shown by Dubin and
McFadden        (1984) in the context            of the utilization     of household      appliances     (demand     for elec-
tricity),     this assumption         is unlikely to be satisfied.        In particular,      economic theory        suggests
that the error term q should be correlated                  with the vehicle specific attributes          in the utilization
equation.      Hence, estimation         by OLS is inappropriate          as it may result in biased coefficients.

     To understand          the source of this correlation,           note that the demand for a durable,              such as
an automobile,          and its usage are interdependent              decisions.    Demand     for a vehicle arises from
the flow of services provided             by the vehicle’s ownership.          Consumers       choose the car type that
maximizes the utility they expect to derive from driving it; hence, the expected usage of the car
is likely to affect the vehicle type choice. The intensity                   with which the automobile             is utilized,
on the other        hand,     depends     on the vehicle type.           This intensity     generates     derived     demand



                                                                 4
for gasoline.       Both the indirect   utility the consumer         derives from owning an automobile,                 and
the intensity     of the car’s usage are affected by factors unobserved                  to the econometrician          that
are included  in the error terms of the utility function and utilization equation respectively. If
                   —.
these error terms were uncorrelated, one could proceed by estimating the utilization equation
by OLS, accounting          for the dependence       of usage on vehicle type through              appropriate      choice
dummies,    or interactions      of vehicle attributes      with fuel price. Yet, in practice,          it is likely that
the error terms of the utility and usage functions include some common unobserved                             attributes,
that induce correlation        between the two error terms, and, hence, correlation                    between vehicle
specific attributes      and the error term of the usage equation.               Such unobserved       factors could be
safety concerns, fashion awareness,          or dist ante to work. Concern for safety, for example,                   may
increase the utility derived from the purchase of a large car, and hence increase the probability
of its selection,     while simultaneously     reducing the intensity           of its use.

    To properly       address this simultaneity     issue, it is necessary to develop an integrated              model of
auto demand and usage; such a model does not only explicitly demonstrate                         the link between the
two decisions, it also guides the search of appropriate                  instruments     in the utilization     equation.
Consider   a consumer       who faces a choice between N mutually                  exclusive vehicle types.       Vehicle
type z has an annualized        cost ~i. The conditional        indirect utility Ui associated         with the choice
z is given by a function of the following general form:


                                         Ui = v(si,~,pi,y         – ‘i, ‘i,~)


where ~i and w denote, as before, vectors of vehicle and household                        specific attributes     respec-
tively, pi is the price per mile, y is income, Ci includes the unobserved                 attributes   of alternative       ~,
and q consists of unobserved         consumer characteristics.           This formulation      of the utility function
takes into account the dependence            of the vehicle choice on the price of usage, pi.

    The consumer         will choose the alternative        associated     with the highest utility level, Hence,
the probability y of selecting alternative        i is:




    The theoretical       link between demand5and            usage is provided         by Roy’s identity.        Usage of
vehicle Z, or, equivalently,     demand for miles driven on i, is (by Roy’s identity):
   ‘Just as in the case of a continuous demand function, the discrete choice model explains the ezpected value of

                         —
To empirically         implement      the model, it is necessary to choose a specific functional                         form for the
utility     function    and specify the distribution                of the error terms.           The parameterization           of the
model was guided by three criteria.                   First, the functional             forms should be consistent             with the
restrictions     imposed      by economic theory; in particular,                      the utility function       should satisfy the
properties      of an indirect       utility function.      Second, the functional               form assumptions         should give
rise to plausible       substitution       patterns      across automobile             types,     Finally, the model should be
computationally         tractable.      A specification       satisfying the above criteria is the following:



                                                                                                                                    (1)


       Application     of Roy’s identity to the above function yields a utilization                        equation that is linear
in income:



                                                                                                                                    (2)


       The error term ●i is assumed                to follow the generalized              extreme     value distribution.          This
distributional       assumption       gives rise to a nested logit structure                  for the automobile      choice model.
In the following, I discuss the properties                 and advantages             of this specification       in more detail.


The Automobile               Choice     Model:

The utility specification         in (1) allows us to derive a discrete choice model of automobile                             demand;
to this end, it is useful to rewrite the indirect utility function Ui, as the sum of two components,
a deterministic        component       Vi) and a stochastic           term ~i.

                                                           Ui=~+Ui

where Vi = (a: + ~ + alpi               + ‘i ‘6+    W’vi + ~(y –         T1))e-ppi.     The     presence     of the vehicle specific
term      e-PP’ in equation     (1) complicates         the specification;            because    this term     is multiplied     by the
the quantity purchased. In the discrete choice context, demand for a specific vehicle is, at the individual level,
represented by an indicator variable that takes the value 1 if this alternative is purchased, and ‘Ootherwise. The
expected value of this variable is the probability of selecting the corresponding alternative. The terms demand
and selection probability are therefore used interchangeably here.


                                                                     6
error term of the utilization         equation   q, the composite                  error term of equation      (1) becomes

                                                      u~ = ~e ‘9Pi        +   ~i

                          —
Unfortunately,      the distribution       of the new error term ~i does not preserve the computational
advantages       of the generalized      extreme value distribution                  I assumed for the term ~i. To retain
these advantages,         I follow the approach suggested by Mannering                      and Winston     (1985) and apply
a Taylor series expansion           around the mean price per mile (P). Assuming                       that the higher-order
terms are not significant ,6 the composite error term becomes ui = q e ‘~~ + ci. The advantage                                     of
this formulation        is that the first component         of the composite              error term, qe -~~, does not vary
bY vehicle, and therefore does not affect the selection probabilities.

    Given the assumption            of a generalized     extreme value distribution               for the error terms e, the
selection probability ies are given by the nested logit formulas .71n part icular, the vehicle choice
model is nested according to Figure 1. The reason for adopting                              this nesting structure     is that a
similar model was estimated              in Goldberg     (1995) and tested against               alternative     specifications.
The model was shown to fit the data quite well and give rise to plausible                               own and cross price
elasticities.

     The set of vehicles is partitioned          into k disjoint subsets                 according    to the criteria of new-
ness (n), market          segment   (c), and origin (0), so that each vehicle                  type   is indexed     bY a triPle

subscript,      (n, c, o). In accordance       with automobile        industry     publications,    the empirical    analysis
distinguishes      between nine market            segments     (Clasl-Clas9):       subcompacts,       compacts,     interme-
diate,   standard,luxury,
                  —.      sports, pick-up trucks, vans, and miscellaneous (models like utility
vehicles that are not assigned to any of the previous categories). This classification is based
primarily     on vehicle characteristics          and prices.*

    The joint probability         of choosing a new vehicle type (n, c, o) is:

                                            P n,c,o –— Pb * Pnlb * P./ntb * l’o/.,n,b


where Pn,c,o denotes the joint probability y of a household                      selecting the vehicle type (n, c, o), Pb
is the marginal         probability     of purchasing      an automobile         during the current       year, Pnlb is the
probability y of buying a new car conditional                on buying a car, and P./n,b, and PO/c,n,b,represent
probabilities     of selecting class and origin respectively,            conditional    on the previous stage decision,

    As shown in McFadden               (1981), the assumption         of the generalized extreme value distribution
implies that the conditional            choice probabilities     at each node of the tree, as well as the marginal
probability      of purchasing        a car, will be given by mult inomial logit formulas.               The link between
subsequent        nodes of the tree is provided              by the inclusive        value terms,     which measure       the
expected aggregate utility of each subset; the coefficients of the inclusive value terms, which are
estimated       along with the other parameters            of the model, reflect the dissimilarity           of alternatives
belonging to a particular         subset.     As McFadden has shown (1981), the nested structure                    depicted
in Figure 1 is consistent        with random utility m~imization                   if and only if the coefficients of the
inclusive value terms lie within              the unit interval.        As the dissimilarity         coefficients   approach
1, the distribution         of the error terms tends towards                an iid extreme         value distribution    and
the choice probabilities         are given by the simple multinominal logit model.                      As the coefficients
approach      O, the error terms become perfectly              correlated    and consumers          choose the alternative
with the highest strict utility.          If the parameters         of the inclusive values are greater than 1, there
is substitution      across the nests and, as noted above, the nesting is not consistent                        with utility
maximization.       g
   ‘It should be noted here that this classification is somewhat subjective; it does not correspond exactly to the
segmentation proposed in the Automotive News Market Data Book (ANMDB) under “EPA Mileage Ratings
for 198* Models” in which the only criterion for defining market segments is fuel efficiency (defined as Miles
per Gallon (MPG) ). The latter classification suffers from the obvious shortcoming that it groups together
Droducts
.         with verv different characteristics, such as a BMW and a Toyota Corolla. In addition to MPG, I use
information on prices, body type and size, as reported elsewhere in the ANMDB, to assign vehicles to one of
the above cat egories.

       The computational      burden associated        with the estimation      of the above model can be signif-
icantly reduced by employing             sequential   m~imum        likelihood to decompose         estimation    in four
stages, It is well known that this procedure results in consistent (though not efficient) parame-
                   --
ter estimates but fails to produce consistent estimates of the covariance matrix; to correct the
latter,   the recursive formulas derived in McFadden                (1981) were applied.

       The demand     model differs from other logit analyses common to this literature,                       in that it
adopts a transactions        rather than a holdings approach.            This offers two advantages:          The mod-
elling of the first stage of the decision process (purchase                of a vehicle) incorporates         an outside
good in the demand          estimation;      the outside    good represents       the possibility     that    consumers
forego the purchase of a car by holding onto their older vehicles. Taking this possibility                       into ac-
count is crucial in deriving the effects of environmental               regulation,   given that I do not explicitly
model scrappage       decisions.   Scrappage      receives in the current framework            a reduced form treat-
ment: Suppose a consumer           decides to scrap a vehicle in the current stock to purchase                   another
car; this will appear in our framework as a positive observation                 in the first node of the tree, and,
depending      on whether     the consumer       buys a new or used car, it will also enter the subsequent
nodes of the tree, If, on the other hand, the consumer decides to postpone                       scrappage,      this will
appear as a ‘trio purchase”        decision in the first node; hence, to the extent that the probability
of scrappage     is linked to the probability         of buying another       car, modelling    of the outside good
takes that into account.        The second advantage            of the transactions     approach     is that it allows
for a better    treatment     of dynamics      as it utilizes data on past purchases;           information      on pre-
vious automobile       holdings for each household          is incorporated     in the model, accounting          for the
temporal     dependence     in the automobile         choice process.    Such information      includes the number
of cars the household        currently    owns, the average age of the stock, the age of the newest car,
etc.

       The primary    focus of the model is on demand for new vehicles. Used vehicles do enter the
model, both as parts of the current automobile                holdings and as substitutes        for new cars at the
second node of the tree. Hence, it is possible to derive the elasticities                  of substitution       between
new and used cars.          The modelling       of used car purchases         in the second stage of the tree, in
conjunction     with the presence of the “outside” good in the first node, allows us to address the
“Gruenspecht”        effect of the CAFE regulation,             that is the regulation’s    impact     on the vehicle

reflects correlation patterns among unobserved factors across alternatives as they result from patterns             in the
econometrician’s lack of information rather than from the household’s decision process.

       The nested     structure     of the automobile      choice model places less structure             on the car se-
lection process than simple multinominal logit models,                  It does so by dropping           the assumption
of “independence        of irrelevant    alternatives    (11A)”. The nested logit structure             assumes inst cad,
that     choices within     each stage are similar in unobserved             factors,    so that       11A holds for any
pair of alternatives       within each stage, but not for the entire choice set .llThe relaxation                   of the
11A property       translates     into more plausible substitution        patterns,     enabling the econometrician
to capture       the consumer       specific response    to unobserved      characteristics      that are common          to
products       within a specific class.

       Two of the parameter          estimates     of the discrete    choice model are of special interest:            the
coefficient on “Price per Vehicle Mile”, and the coefficient on vehicle price. 12The first one gives
insight into consumer           preferences      for fuel efficiency; the second one allows us to derive the
elasticities    of substitution     between various vehicle types, and thus assess the effects that price
changes resulting       from the imposition         of the CAFE standard        may have on the composition             of
the new car fleet. Our approach               assumes that vehicle prices are econometrically              exogenous    in
the est imat ion of micro level demand functions. 13This assumption                     is justified    if the error term
of the utility      function      does not include a common          across households,        aggregate     component;
such a component         could, for example, arise from unobserved            product     quality or macroeconomic
shocks.     The use of micro data allows us to control for this aggregate                    component       in the error
term, by including        macro variables (GNP, employment              rates, etc.. ) and vehicle fixed effects in
the specification .14

       A noteworthy     difference between the model estimated            here and the one of Goldberg            (1995),
is that    the nested     logit of Figure        1 does not incorporate      the choice between          vehicle models
at the very last stage, but rather               stops with the choice between          Domestic       and Foreign;    the
latter choice is assumed to depend on averages of vehicle characteristics                     .15This aggregation      was

  lzvehicle prices enter the model throughthe annualized cost variable; along with vehicle sPecific dummies
(country of origin dummies, for example) vehicle prices are used u proxies for the annualized cost of the new
vehicles.
  lsThe ~xogeneity of prices in the econometric sense at the estimation level is not to be confused with the
endogeneity of prices in the automobile market model; at the simulation stage, prices are treated as endogenous
variables and their equilibrium values are solved for.
   14See Goldberg (1995) for a detailed discussion of this issue.
   15The nesting of Figure 1 results, in fact, in quite homogeneous vehicle cl-ses; the vehicle models included
in each subset at the l-t stage have approximately the same fuel efficiency, the same cylinders and horsepower,

considered      necessary to reduce the computational               burden associated      with solving for the equi-
librium in the automobile           market (see Section V). This simplification            limits the applicability      of
the results as it precludes             an evaluation    of the CAFE effects for different corporations.           Anec-
dotal evidence suggests that there was some variation                    in the impact      of the CAFE regulation
across corporations,          with Chrysler      being the least restrained        as it produces    a higher share of
small cars.lGYet 7 the political            debate surrounding       CAFE is often cast in terms of the nation-
alit y of the auto manufacturers;              domestic manufacturers,       for example,    claim that the current
regulation      reduces their competitiveness            at the benefit of the Japanese.     Such questions,      as well
as the environmental           aspect of the CAFE regulation,           can still be addressed      within the current
framework.


The Utilization         Equation:

To account       for the potential         endogeneity     of the choice specific explanatory         variables   in the
utilization     equation,     equation      (2) is estimated     by instrumental     variables   and a reduced        form
method    along the lines proposed             in Dubin and McFadden         (1985 ).17T0 this end, it is helpful to
rewrite equation       (2) as




where j stands for the various alternatives               available to the household,      and @j is a dummy equal
to 1 if z = j.     When the instrumental            variable method      is used, the estimated       probabilities     Pj
from the discrete choice model are used as instruments                    for yj.    The validity of the estimated
probabilities     as instruments         in the estimation     of the usage equation      stems from the fact, that
these probabilities         represent    the expected values of a household’s        demand for particular        vehicle
types;18as such they are by definition              orthogonal      to the error terms of the demand        equations.

the same prices. The main differencesacross vehiclemakes belonging to the same class are related to the option
packages offered and, of course, to their brand. See also Goldberg (1995).
   16This is due to the fact that Chrysler took preemptive steps in the 1980s to avoid being CAFE constrained by
shifting its production mix towards small cars. In contrast, GM and Ford concentrated their efforts in lobbying
against the CAFE regulation.
   17The utilization equation focuses on new cars alone; information on the mileage of used cars is available in
the CES, the information on used car characteristics, is, however, not detailed enough to allow estimation of
the utilization equation inclusive of used cars. For example, the CES does not report the exact production year
for used cars, so that the fuel efficiency of the used car models is unknown.
   ISASmentioned above, in the discrete choice framework, demand for a particular vehicle type at the individual
level corresponds to an indicator variable, which is 1 when this vehicle type is purchased and O otherwise. The
expected value of this indicator variable is the probability of choosing that alternative.


                                                               11
In the reduced form approach-, OLS is applied to the equationlg




Both methods        yield consistent        parameter       estimates      if the choice dummies yj and the error term
q are correlated.


    In summary,        estimation         of the consumer level model involves two steps:                   First, the vehicle
choice model is estimated.                The estimation        results from this stage are used in calculating             the
predicted   probabilities         of choosing particular              vehicle types.    Second, the utilization      equation
is estimated,       by a reduced          form method          or by instrumental          variables,    using the predicted

    The link between             demand      and supply is provided            by aggregate      demand;     the latter   is the
sum of the demands             of individual      consumers,          and is computed      as the weighted sum of vehicle
selection probability ies :20

consumer h in the U.S. population,                  P~,c,o is the probability       that consumer h selects vehicle type
(n, c, o), and v~C~ is a stochastic              i.i. d component          that measures    deviations     of the actual from
the expected        d~rnand.

  aOA~mentioned earlier, individual demand in the discrete choice framework corresponds                         to an indicator
variable, which assumes the value 1 when a particular vehicle type is purchased. This indicator variable can,
in turn, be expressed as the sum of its expected value (the probability of vehicle selection) and a stochastic
component that represents the deviation of the expected from the actual value.

    On the supply side, the automobile                     industry       is modelled   as an oligopoly         with multiprod-
uct firms.       It is assumed      that each period firms m=imize                  profits myopically           with respect     to
two variables:       pn’ces and the fraction              of their production       classified as domestic          according to
the EPA definition            (domestic     content).     In particular,      given expected      aggregated      demand    EDi,
firms choose the fraction ~i that will be characterized                      as domestic, and the fraction (1 – ~i) that
will be classified as imported.             Our treatment        of ~i as a choice variable abstracts             from capacity
installment      or utilization     issues, as it presumes that shifts in the origin of a firm’s inputs can be
decided and executed within a short period; this is a reasonable                        assumption,       if firms already op-
erate production         plants both domestically            and abroad. 21The distinction           between domestic           and
imported      products        corresponds     to the way ~’imports” are defined by the EPA. The classifica-
tion criterion     used in the implementation               of the CAFE standards             is not location of production,
but domestic       content;      cars with 75 percent or more Canadian                  and U.S. content          are treated    as
domestic.     It is interesting      to note that this criterion differs from the one used in the application
of the VERS, or the one used by the U.S. Treasury                             Department       for duty purposes        (country
of assembly). 22 This multiplicity               of ‘timport” definitions          supports     the modelling       of domestic
content decisions as being dependent                    on the CAFE regulation,          given that the implementation
of other policies (VERS, for example)                   is based on different classification         criteria.

    The assumption            that firms use prices and import classification                 as strategic variables reflects
the focus of the paper on the short tem                       effects of the CAFE standards.               In the short run,
vehicle characteristics         are assumed to be fixed; in the longer run, firms have, of course, the op-
portunity     to vary vehicle characteristics             in response to environmental            regulation,     by developing
new technologies         that may combine fuel efficiency with larger size or horsepower.                         Our approach
abstracts     from the development           of such technologies as well as the choice of characteristics                 other

   21A priori, it seems unlikely that auto manufacturers would establish plants in foreign countries only to avoid
CAFE penalties; the anecdotal evidence suggests that other considerations, such as exchange rate movements, or
restrictive trade policies had a larger impact on foreign direct investment (FDI). Our approach does not attempt
to model FDI; instead, the existence of foreign plants is taken as given when manufacturers consider shifts in
the domestic content of their vehicles. In this sense, it is not unreasonable to presume that environmental
regulation has a considerable impact on domestic content decisions.
   ZzThe implications of these definitions can be best illustrated in the csse of the Nissan Sentra. This model
is assembled in the U.S, and therefore excluded from the VER related calculations; nevertheless, the product
is - with exactly 74% domestic content – treated as an import by the EPA. Similarly, the Honda Accord and
Toyota Camry are produced both abroad and in the U.S., but the combined fleet is in both cases t rested as
imported by the EPA.


                                                                 13
than prices, as this would complicate               the analysis considerably;23        the focus is instead     on the
short run responses of the firms, that is the shift in the product                mix and import       classification.

    Given the aggregation       of vehicle types according to market segments and origin, it is reason-
able to distinguish     between two types of firms, Domestic and Foreign, with each firm offering a
product    mix corresponding         to the market segments discussed above. The equilibrium                    concept
is Nash.    In the presence of the CAFE standard                  the profit maximization        problem    takes the
following form:24



                                al      {~   ~iq; –    ~iqici –   (1 – ~i)~iCj] – F’}
                                         i=l



where qi denotes production,          nt is the number of products         produced      by firm f, Ff denotes the
firm’s fixed costs25 ( for both domestic and foreign operations), ci is the unit variable cost for
the fraction of product z classified as domestic, and c; is the unit variable cost for the fraction
of z classified as imported,        expressed in U, S. currency.       Assuming firms set production           equal to
expected    demand,     qi can be replaced by EDi.          26

    One way to introduce       CAFE standards          in the supply side is to formulate       a constrained     max-
imizat ion problem for auto manufacturers             (firms maximize profits subject to the constraint            that
their average fuel efficiency is greater than or equal to the prescribed                  standard),   and estimate
the associate    Kuhn-Tucker         multipliers,     Such a formulation      would, however, be inconsistent
with the current      regulation,    as the latter allows producers        to fall short of the standard         at the
cost of high penalties.      Furthermore,       the actual figures on the achieved fuel efficiency of auto-
mobile manufacturers        are not consistent        with a model predicting         a mass at the point where

   23See Bresnahan and Yao (1985) for an analysis of the effects of fuel economy standards on vehicle
characteristics.
   ZqThe relevant prices in the iupply side of the model are the wholesale prices; the demand side estimation,
on the other hand, uses transactions prices. Wholesale prices are obtained by applying dealer margins on the
suggested retail prices. See Goldberg (1995) for more details on this issue.
   25The latter drop out from the first order conditions of the profit maximizing firms; therefore it is not necessary
to further specify their functional form.
   26The above profit m~imization expression refers to a domestic firm. Similar conditions apply to foreign
firms. All monetary variables are expressed in U.S. dollars, so that exchange rates do not enter the specification.
This formulation of the profit maximization condition ignores the presence of the VER on Japanese autos. As
I discuss in the data section, however, the empirical analysis concentrates on the 1985-1990 period. Anecdotal
and empirical evidence suggest that the VER had much weaker - if any - effects after 1985; consistent with
this evidence is also the fact that the Japanese, without any particular pressure from the American government,
volunteered to extend the VER for a few more years in 1985. To the extent that the VER w= not binding after
1985, ignoring it in the profit maximization formulation does not entail any loss of information.


                                                           14
the constraint       becomes binding; while Japanese           corporations    consistently    exceed the prescribed
fuel efficiency, corporations         such as GM and Ford are often well below the standard.27These
considerate ions argue for modelling             the CAFE constraint       as part of the cost function.
                    --
      In particular,     the variable unit cost function for product           z is modelled as follows:




The terms n~ and nc~ denote the unit variable costs for the “domestic”                         and “imported”     frac-
tion of product         z in the absence of CAFE constraints;             these components       are assumed     to be
constant        2s 29 The terms ui and u: are stochastic           i.i. d. components,   observed by the firm, but
unobserved        by the econometrician.

      The CAFE regulation           introduces      a discontinuity    in the cost function,     at the point where
the constraint       becomes binding,      This is captured        by the last two terms in the above equations;
CAFE denotes the standard             and FE is the fuel efficiency of individual        vehicle types as measured
by MPG. 11 and 12 are dummy variables                    which are equal to one if                    < CAFE       and
                                                                                         w
~.(l-aj)qjFEj
~                    < CAFE      respectively.     The terms 5011(CAFE          – -)             and 501z(CAFE       –
~~i-=j)qjFEj
-)                     reflect the penalties     associated   with not meeting the~tandard.         As mentioned     in
the Introduction,         this penalty is $5 per car for each 1/10 of a gallon that the corporate              average
fuel economy falls below the standard.

      The non-differentiability       of the cost function at the point where the CAFE standard                becomes
binding,        complicates    the characterization       of the equilibrium     Conditions”     In general)    We can
distinguish       between two cases. In the first case, there is an interior solution, which may or may
not involve CAFE penalties;            in the second case, the solution occurs on the boundary             separating
     ZTOr more accurately, they would have been well below the standard,     if this had not been decreased as a
result of their lobbying efforts.

                                                              15
the region in which the CAFE-standard           is met from the one where the constraint              is not satisfied.
Within      each of the above cases, we can can make further              distinctions     depending        on whether
the constraint    is satisfied (or binding) for domestic products           only, imports        only, or both.
                     —.

    The reason we need to characterize          the equilibrium       at this stage of the project is to obtain
the unit variable costs of production         (both gross and net of CAFE penalties).               This task can be
substantially    simplified by making the following observation:            For each year in our sample, the
fractions    of domestic and foreign production,         ai and (1 – ~i)) are data.        Once the demand             side
of the model is estimated,       the expected       aggregate   sales for each product,          EDi are also data.
Given this information,       the firm’s estimate     of its average fuel economy can easily be computed;
                        ‘ for the firm’s domestic products, and
‘he latter ‘s=                                                  -                                ‘or ‘ts ‘mPorts”
If these fuel eco~omy figures lie below or above the CAFE stand~rd,                       then we know that we
have an interior solution.      In other words, to the extent that the prescribed                standard    is not met
ezactly by the firm, the equilibrium          occurs in the differentiable         area of the profit function.30.
This indeed turns out to be the case in the data; both our estimates                      and actual        data on the
achieved fuel economies of automobile           manufacturers      imply interior solutions          for every single
year in our sample.       Hence, for the purpose of obtaining         the unit variable costs, we can restrict
ourselves to characterizing      equilibria   in the differentiable     area of the profit function. 31 In this
case, differentiation     of the profit function     with respect to pi and ~i yields the following first
order conditions:




                                                                                                              i=l,...,nf

                                                                                                                           (6)

    Equation     (5) is the standard    first order condition      in a Bertrand         game.     Note that       in the
presence of the CAFE standard,          marginal      costs (though     constant     when the CAFE penalty                  is
not incorporated)       depend on the allocation of production         across vehicle types with different fuel
efficiencies, and therefore on relative prices; this effect is captured              through     the last two terms

-or      ex=mple, if the CAFE standard is 26.0 MPG, and a firm has an average fuel economy of 25.0 MPG
for its domestic products and 27.0 MPG for its imports, then we know that we have an interior solution with
ll=landlz=O.
   31A complete characterization of the equilibrium configurations is available upon request; given that we never
observe boundary solutions in the data, the derivation of the equilibrium conditions for this case w= omitted
from the paper for expositional reasons.


                                                         16
in equation     (5). Equation      (6) also has an intuitive        interpretation;     the first and the third terms
represent the additional         cost associated with infinitesimally        increasing the fraction of production
classified as domestic, at the expense of production classified as imported; this additional cost
                    -—
is at the equilibrium counterbalanced   by the cost savings resulting from reducing production
of imports     (second and fourth terms).          Note also that if a firm’s average fuel economy exceeded
the CAFE standard,         the last two terms in (6) would be zero. Equation                   (6) would then reduce
to the standard      arbitrage     condition of international        production,      stating that at the equilibrium
marginal      costs of production     for domestic and imported            products     have to be equal, if a firm is
observed to produce        the same product         in more than one locations ;320therwise there would be
an incentive for manufacturers           to shift production       to the “lower cost” country.          In the presence
of the CAFE        standard      this arbitrage    condition      becomes slightly       more complicated,       as it is
potentially     beneficial for a firm to shift production            towards a “more expensive”           country,    so as
to reduce the CAFE penalty.            This effect is captured        through      the last two terms in (6).

    Given that the data indicate the presence of interior solutions,                    it is easy to retrieve the unit
variable costs using the first order conditions           of the profit maximizing          producers,    equations      (5)
and (6): If we have N products,            the first order conditions         define a system with 2N equations
and 2N unknowns,          namely the unit costs of production              for domestic     and imported       products.
Since these first order conditions          have to hold at the equilibrium              ezactly, they can be solved
for the unit costs.

    To summarize,        the empirical strategy      involves the following steps. First, the discrete choice
model of Figure       1 and the continuous          utilization     model are estimated;        as noted earlier,        the
estimation     results from this step are interesting             in their own right.      Next, the parameter        esti-
mates are used in conjunction            with the population          weights provided       in the CES to compute
the expected      aggregate      demand according to Formula (4). This expression                 is then substituted
into the first order conditions        of the profit muimizing           producers,     to solve for the unit variable
costs. In the same step, we compute               the average fuel efficiency of each firm as implied by the
model, compare it to published           figures, and use it to infer the CAFE penalty term entering the
unit cost formula.       Having retrieved      the unit costs both gross and net of CAFE penalties,                      the
effects of alternative     policy scenarios are then addressed through                 counterfactual     simulations.


III. Data

     The primary      data source for this project is the Consumer         Expenditure       Survey (1984-1990)
conducted      by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.         The survey includes detailed information             on the
demographics       and-- automobile holdings of about 7,000 distinct households per year. The in-
formation      on automobiles includes the make/model and purchase price of each car, financing,
disposal of old vehicles, and a large set of vehicle characteristics.              Most importantly,     the CES
includes the mileage of each car owned by the household                during each quarter.33      This informa-
tion is used to derive a measure of the utilization             of each new car purchased;       to measure       the
utilization    of the new car, I average its mileage across the quarters           following its purchase.      This
procedure      makes the results less sensitive to reporting         error or extraordinary      utilization     in a
single quarter.     The mean utilization       of new cars in the CES sample is 2252 miles per quarter,
while the median       is 1900 miles.       Details about the data set as well as tables with summary
statistics    can be found in Goldberg        (1995).

    The CES file is supplemented            by a data set on vehicle characteristics       based on the Auto-
motive News Market          Data Book.       The latter   includes information      on size, performance,        fuel
efficiency and standard       options    of various models and is used to construct            the averages that
are used in the demand        estimation.      Information     on gasoline prices by region (incl. state and
local taxes) is taken from the Statistical         Abstract.    This information     is needed to compute        the
“Price per Mile” for each vehicle. A big advantage              of focusing on the 1985-1990 period is that
it includes the sharp decline of gas prices at the end of 1985 so that there is ample variation                    in
the data to identify the consumer responses to lower operating               vehicle cost.

    Institutional    details about the implementation          of the CAFE standard      as well as information
about the classification     of vehicles according to the “domestic content”           criterion are taken from
the Automotive       News Market Data Book and Ward’s Automotive                 Yearbook.     This information
is summarized       in Table 1. The first column reports the effective CAFE standards              for passenger
cars for 1985-1990; the corresponding          standard   for trucks was 20 MPG during that period.              The
standards     implemented     in each year often deviate from what was initially             announced       by the
Department      of Transportation       (DOT). In 1986, for example, GM and Ford petitioned               DOT to
lower CAFE; the DOT responded               by lowering the standard      from the initially    announced        27.5
MPG down to 26 MPG for the 1986-1988 period, and to 26.5 MPG for 1989.

is that as of 1990 there were-no foreign brands                       classified as “domestic”,       and this despite the
expansion     of foreign transplants             in the U.S. after 1987; even when certain models qualified as
domestic according—.to the “domestic content” criterion (this is, for example, the case with the
Honda Accord or the Toyota Camry), the EPA treated the combined fleet as imported.          This
implies that the variable ai in the profit maximization                         conditions,     indicating     the fraction      of
production        located    in the U. S., is always zero in the case of foreign manufacturers.                           As for
American      cars, there has been a steady                 trend in the 1980’s towards           increasing     the share of
small cars produced          abroad, but at the same time, the share of large cars produced                        abroad has
increased too. This latter phenomenon                  has often been attributed          to the existence of the CAFE
standard.

      IV.1 Results          from the Estimation             of the Discrete         Choice      Model


      The discrete     choice model of Figure              1 was estimated        by sequential       m=imum       likelihood
in four steps each of which corresponds                    to a branch of the tree depicted             in Figure     1. The
parameter     estimates,      standard     errors34and t-statistics        are reported       in Appendix      B, Tables Bl -
B4; a complete list of the variables included in the estimation                       is provided in Appendix            A.

      At the first stage of the estimation            (domestic       vs. foreign) the specification         includes vehicle
attributes,   (price, horsepower           divided by weight, car size, price per vehicle mile), household
characteristics      (age, education,       family size, regional dummies,            employment        stat us, income and

  34The standard errors were corrected using the recursive formulaa derived in McFadden (1981).

                                                               19

was also experimented
                  -.   with, but these interactions were statistically insignificant                       and therefore
dropped from the specification. The statistical insignificance of these interactions                       is not surpris-
ing given that household         characteristics     are included directly in the estimation.        The coefficients
associated      with these characteristics         are choice specific, and as such they already represent               in-
t eractions    of household     and vehicle specific attributes;       the age coefficient, for example, informs
us how the probability y of buying a foreign car changes with age. In addition,                     the specification
includes a dummy variable which assumes the value 1 if the household                       has purchased        a similar
vehicle type in the past; this variable is highly significant             indicating     that past purchases         have
a significant     impact on current choices.35

    At higher stages, the explanatory              variables consist of household       characteristics,      year dum-
mies, macroeconomic           variables (personal      disposable   income, unemployment          rat e, int crest rate
for auto loans), and the inclusive value terms.             Ownership     dynamics which become increasingly
important       as we move towards           the top of the tree, are accounted        for by variables        related   to
the existing     vehicle stock.     These include the number of cars currently              owned, the age of the
newest car, the average age of the stock, and the square terms of the above variables                              which
account for nonlinear         depreciation     schemes. In the absence of any information           on maintenance
or repair costs, such variables act as proxies for the condition of the existing vehicle stock; this
presumably       plays a big part in the decision to purchase a new car vs. hold onto the old vehicles.

    In general,     the parameters        are precisely estimated       and the results      seem consistent         with
conventional      wisdom.     For example, the results from the estimation             of the domestic vs. foreign
branch      confirm the belief that          foreign cars are most popular      in the West and among high
income households.          Similarly,   the results from the estimation        of the market       segment branch
indicate that large households           are more likely to purchase large cars, while luxury automobiles
are preferred by high income consumers.                The choice between a new and used car seems to be
primarily     dictated   by financial ability; this is also true, but to a lesser extent, for the buy vs.
not buy decision. The coefficients on the inclusive value terms are (with one exception)                        between
O and 1, thus supporting         the nestirig sequence adopted in the modelling of the demand side; the
exception     refers to the first node of the tree (buy vs. not buy), where the estimated                     coefficient

  35This finding is consistent with the marketing literature results on brand loyalty. Nevertheless, it is important
to note that our results should not be interpreted as evidence in favor of a brand loyalty effect; alternatively,
they may indicate that the same unobserved factors that influenced the vehicle choice in the paat, are present
today. This is the well known problem of “state dependency vs. unobserved heterogeneity”.

the ones discussed          in Goldberg    (1995), I refer the reader to that               paper for more details          and
specification    testing;    in the following, I concentrate          on those results that are most relevant for
the analysis of the CAFE standard              regulation.     These are summarized             in Table 2.36

    The upper part of the table reports             the number of observations                at each estimation        stage,
as well as the frequency          of the observed      choices 37.In the lower part of the table,                    I report
the parameter     estimates      required in computing          the substitution       effects induced by CAFE and
in evaluating     consumer       preferences    for fuel efficiency (standard              errors in parentheses).        The
price parameter      estimates     are in line with those reported           in Goldberg        (1995), and imply quite
plausible    own and cross price elasticities         of demand.         A noticeable         difference from Goldberg
(1995) is the coefficient estimate for the inclusive value term at the new/used                        stage; this estimate
is much larger in this paper (0.4 instead of 0.01) implying higher substitution                               effects between
new and used cars.           From an environmental           perspective,     the fuel cost coefficient is of special
interest;   the estimated      parameter   implies that increasing the cost of a mile on a certain vehicle
by 1 cent, 3greduces the probability y of buying that vehicle type by ca. 10% on average, implying

operating      costs.


    IV.2      Results-from         the     Estimation     of the Utilization         Model

    The results from the estimation              of the utilization    model (equation       (3)) are reported    in Table
3. Three alternative          estimation     methods    were used. The first one is simple OLS (column 1); as
noted earlier, this method will potentially              lead to biased parameter        estimates    if the error terms
of the discrete choice and the utilization              models are correlated.       The s,econd column in Table 3
reports results from the reduced form approach,                   and the third column reports the results from
the IV estimation.           The list of instruments       includes all the exogenous          variables of the system
and the estimated          choice probabilities     from the discrete choice model 39.

    The striking feature of the estimation               results is that the effect of operating        cost on vehicle
utilization    disappears       once the endogeneity         of the vehicle choice dummies            is accounted    for.
Ordinary      Least Squares yields a parameter              estimate    of -110.7 for fuel cost, implying         a short
run40mileage elasticity” of ca. 2270. In addition,                the OLS coefficients on various choice specific
dummies       are positive and significant,        suggesting     the presence of a portfolio effect. Both effects
disappear      once the reduced form, or the instrumental                variables    approach     is employed;    in the
reduced form method,           for example, the point estimate of the fuel cost coefficient drops to -57.2,
implying a mileage elasticity of only 1170; in the instrumental                 variables approach the coefficient
becomes positive.          More importantly,       the coefficient is in both cases highly insignificant,         so that
the hypothesis          of a zero mileage elasticity      cannot be rejected.        The same results apply to the
vehicle choice dummies,          which also become insignificant          when the reduced form or instrumental
variables approach          is applied.41
  sgThe standard errors were computed UsingWhite’s formula; this method yields unbiased standard errors.
  AoSince this ~laticitY is b=ed on on the conditional (on vehicle choice) usage equation, it is best viewed M
short run.
  AITable3 reports results from the most parsimonious specification. Various other specifications w= experi-
mented with, some of which included a larger set of vehicle attributes, such as vehicle price, size, horsepower,
etc. None of the estimated coefficients for these attributes was, however, statistically significant, while the
OLS parameter estimate for fuel cost was slightly lower, implying a mileage elasticity of ca. 1670. Estimating
these alternative specifications with instrumental variables or the reduced form method produces exactly the
same pattern as in Table 3, namely the fuel cost coefficient becomes much smaller in absolute value, and both
the fuel cost and vehicle choice dummies become insignificant. The results were also robust to an alternative
specification, in which both regional and vehicle specific dummies were dropped from the estimation. These
dummies belong to the utilization equation, by virtue of Roy’s identity. Nevertheless, one might be concerned
that they absorb all of the variation in FUELC, given that the latter is computed as the product of regional
gasoline prices and MPG figures. However, without the dummies, the instrumental variables estimate of the
fuel cost parameter remains essentially unchanged (24.9, with standard error 197.4).

the results    for a specification       in which fuel cost is interacted          with car ownership        dummies
(upper    part of Table 4). Two different fuel cost coefficients are estimated:                     one (FUELCM)
for multi-vehiclehouseholds, and one for one-vehicle households (FUELC1),   Approximately
                 .
17% of the sample households own only one automobile. Intuitively, one would expect multi-
vehicle households      to exhibit     larger mileage demand elasticities          for any single vehicle in their
stock, as they can respond to a fuel price increase by driving their most fuel efficient cars more
often.44 This expectation          is indeed confirmed in Table 4; the point estimates              for multi-vehicle
households     are substantially      larger than the ones for one-vehicle households,              which are found
to be completely      price inelastic,     even in the OLS specification.        If one considered      the elasticity
figure for one-vehicle      households       to be a good estimate          of the elasticity    that   multi-vehicle
households    exhibit with respect to their entire stock, one would have to conclude, on the basis
of Table 4, that mileage demand             is totally   unresponsive       to changes in operating      costs.   This
unresponsiveness      is present even in the OLS regressions;               the correction   for simultaneity     bias
pushes the coefficients of the fuel cost variables               (for both multi- and one-vehicle        households)
further towards zero.

   ~’41tis important to note that the mileage demand eluticity here refers to a single vehicle in the stock (~i
denotes miles driven on car i); the elasticity for the utilization of the total stock, however, should be substantially
smaller. The reason multi-vehicle households are expected to be more price elastic than one-vehicle households
with respect to any single car, is that they can substitute towards more fuel efficient cars within their existing
stock rather than reducing their total driving; but this implies that their total mileage should be relatively
unresponsive to fuel cost changes.
   45The variable FUELCM is the product of fuel cost and a dummy variable which is equal to 1 for multi-vehicle
households. FUELC1 is similarly defined for one-vehicle households. The variables FUINCL and FUINCH
represent interactions of fuel cost with dummy variables corresponding to households with annual income below
$30000 and above $30000, respectively. The numbers in parentheses are T-statistics.

    The low elasticity        estimate     for mileage demand           contrasts     with Dahl and Sterner’s           (1991)
broadly      cited figure of 0,20, though          it is in agreement           with some of the individual             studies
included      in Dahl and Sterner’s review.               Given the plethora        of alternative     methodological       ap-
proaches,     sample periods and countries              considered     in previous work, a one-to-one           comparison
of our approach      with previous studies is impossible.                In interpreting      our results in the context
of the previous literature,       however, the following observations                may be of use:

    First,    our results    should not be interpreted               as evidence     that   consumers      do not respond
at all to fuel cost increases.           The short run elasticity          of gasoline       demand      is derived from a
conditional     vehicle usage equation;         thus, the proper interpret ation of our estimation                 results is
that conditional on the vehicle choice the decision how much to drive is price inelastic.                          However,
consumers      alter their vehicle choices in response to changes in operating                        costs, as the results
from the discrete choice model suggest.              Since gasoline demand is determined               by both utilization
and fuel efficiency of the vehicle stock, this implies that the elasticity                    of gasoline demand in the
longer run is higher.

    Second, our results refer to the U.S, and to the 1984-1990 period.                        Comparisons     with studies
referring to different countries or sample periods may be misleading,                        for two reasons:     First, one
would expect gasoline demand               elasticities     to vary across countries;         European      countries     with
developed public transportation            networks will presumably             exhibit much larger elasticities          than
the U, S., where private        car transportation          is the only option in some areas.             Second, there is
no reason to believe that the utilization                 equation    would be structurally          stable over long time
periods, especially if the latter include major shocks, such as the fuel price shocks of the 1970s.
This is particularly        relevant     when our results        are compared        to those of studies        referring    to
the 1970s, or when one tries to extrapolate                   our findings to historical        time series phenomena.
The fuel cost variation        in our data is relatively             small, compared        to the one witnessed        in the
1970s.     Our results,     properly     interpreted,      suggest that driving does not respond                to fuel cost


                                                               26
changes that lie within the range of variation             in our data. It is, however, possible that a major
shock (a major gasoline price increase, for example)                  induces a structural      break.    This is likely
to be the case if there are high adjustment               costs associated     with a household          changing   their
driving habits;        for ‘modest fuel price increases,        the time costs of finding ways to reduce the
miles travelled,       by organizing      car pooling,   acquiring    information     about public transportation
alternatives,   coordinating       with other household members, etc., may exceed the expected savings.
Dramatic     price increases, however, make the effort worthwhile.46

    Finally, as mentioned          earlier, the usage equation        (3) is estimated     for new cars alone .47 A
priori, there is no compelling           reason why the mileage demand elasticities             associated     with used
cars should be different; yet, in the absence of any empirical results for used cars this possibility
cannot be eliminated.          As discussed earlier, the major factor driving the decision between new
and used automobiles          seems to be financial ability.         This suggests that one reason the mileage
demand elasticities        might differ across these two car categories,            is because of the interaction      of
price with income effects. To get a rough idea how important                 this interaction     might be, equation
(3) was reestimated        replacing the fuel cost variable with two interaction            terms between fuel cost
and income (see Table 4): the variable FUINCL represents                    fuel cost for consumers          with annual
income less than $30,000, while FUINCH denotes the fuel cost for consumers with income above
$30,000.     The income threshold          of $30,000 is arbitrary,     but it reflects the fact that consumers
with income less than $30,000 are less likely to buy a new car.4*As the lower part of Table 4
indicates,   the point estimates         are slightly higher for high income consumers,            but the difference
is not statistically      significant.   As before, the coefficients tend to zero once the endogeneit y of
   qGAggregate time series data on the average annual miles traveled per vehicle between 1960 and 1990 seem
to support this interpretation; according to the AAMA Motor Vehicles Facts and Figures (various issues),
the average mileage was 9,446 in 1960 and 10,272 in 1970. Between 1970 and 1975, the period that included
the first oil price shock, the average mileage declined to 9,690. Between 1975 and 1980 fuel costs increased
significantly because of the second energy shock, and average mileage declined further to 9,141. After 1980, fuel
costs remained relatively stable and so did the average annual mileage. The latter increased by ca. 150 miles
per year between 1980 and 1990 to reach 10,548 miles in 1990. It is interesting to note that the modest fuel
price decreases in 1985 and 1986 were not matched by an incre=e in mileage; mileage incre~ed by only 2 miles
between 1984 and 1985, and 65 miles between 1985 and 1986, despite a decrease in the per mile cost of 1.68
cents in this time interval. The per mile cost slightly increased in the 1986-1990 period, but annual mileage
kept rising by ca. 200 miles per year. Of course, cross year comparisons do not control for other factors that
may influence mileage demand, such as changes in demographics, so that the conclusions that can be drawn
from them are only suggestive.
   qTBecause we correct for simultaneity bias by instrumenting the vehicle specific attributes in the usage equation
(using the predicted probabilities from the vehicle choice model aa instruments), the focus on new cars does not
imply sample selection biaa in our results; however, the estimated el=ticity cannot be interpreted u anything
else but the eluticity for new cars only.
   4aExperimenting with alternative thresholds or multiple income brackets produced the same results.



                                                           27
the vehicle attributes       is accounted      for,

    These qualifications       notwithstanding,        the striking feature of our results is that the elasticity
implied by the O-LS regression             is within the range of Dahl and Sterner’s               estimate;     it is the
simultaneity       bias correction   that pushes the elasticity          estimates     towards zero. This indicates
that the methodological        aspect may be the dominant             factor in explaining      the divergence of our
estimates   from previous studies.

    In summary,        the estimation       results   suggest that      the same unobserved        factors leading      to
the choice of fuel efficient cars lead to high vehicle utilization,                  and vice versa.    This produces
the negative correlation       between operating         cost and utilization        captured   in the OLS regression
coefficients; mileage elasticities        based on these coefficients are thus biased upwards.             Accounting
for the endogeneity       of the vehicle choice dummies suggests that the mileage demand                       is in fact
price inelastic.     It seems that other factors, unrelated             to the vehicle operating        cost, are more
important      in explaining    utilization.     Driving distance       to work is the one coming immediately
to mind. Availability y of public transportation            is another.     Unfortunately,      our data set does not
include any information         on the characteristics       of the work place, such as location           or distance
from home, nor does it report the state of the household residence.                     The parameter    estimates     for
age and Northeast,        however, are consistent         with dist ante-to-work,         and public-transport      at ion
based explanations        respectively,     as they suggest      that     older individuals      drive less, and that
average utilization      in the Northeast,      where the public transportation           network is more developed
than in the rest of the country, is lower.


   ‘IV.3 Implications          of the Demand            Side Results for Environmental                 Regulation


    To evaluate the effects of alternative            environmental      policies, it is useful to express the total
gasoline consumption        of U.S. households         as the product     of two terms, Total Miles driven, and
Gallons per Mile:


                                Total Gallons = Miles x (Gallons per Mile)


Policies aimed at reducing gasoline consumption                  can target either the first, or the second, or
both components         of this product.        It has often been argued that            policies aimed at reducing
driving, such as an increase in the gasoline tax, are preferable,                as they target fuel consumption
in a direct and transparent          way. The results from the discrete               choice and utilization      models
speak directly to this issue.

                                                            28
    The parameter         estimates   of the utilization       model suggest that mileage demand           is affected
by neither the operating          cost, nor the composition            of the vehicle stock.   This finding has two
implications  wit h respect to environmental regulation. First, policies aimed at reducing driving
                   -—
by increasing the operating cost of vehicles (by increasing, for example, the gasoline t ax49) are
unlikely to be effective. Second, the beneficial effects of policies that shift the composition                    of the
new car fleet towards more fuel efficient vehicles (CAFE standards,                     for example) are not offset
by an increase in the utilization            of the fuel efficient vehicles.       This implies that policies with
compositional       effects are likely to be more effective than policies aimed at reducing                      gasoline
consumption        without     altering the composition        of the car sales.

    Of course, policies with compositional             effects will not reduce gasoline consumption                if the
compositional       shift occurs in the direction       of used, less fuel-efficient,      cars.   The results from
the estimation       of the discrete choice model are of direct relevance here. The low value of the
coefficient on the inclusive value term at the “new vs. used” node implies that the substitution
effects bet ween new and used cars are relatively small. 50Similarly, the coefficient on the inclusive
value term at the very first node (buy vs. not buy) is not significantly                       different   from zero,
implying     no substitution      effects between the “outside”           good and cars; put differently,         vehicle
characteristics     entering    the subsequent     nodes of the tree (such as prices of new cars) have no
impact on the buy vs. not buy decision. A direct implication                   of this finding is that price changes
resulting    from the CAFE regulation           will have no effect at all on the sum of the new and used
car sales, they will cause small shifts in the allocation                 between new and used car sales,51 and
will have substantial        compositional     effects within the fleet of new cars.

    The above results do not necessarily imply that fuel efficiency standards                      are superior to an
increase in gasoline taxes; the composition             of the car sales depends itself on both the gasoline
prices and the fuel efficiency of the new car fleet. As indicated by the parameter                   estimates     of the
discrete choice model, consumers             do respond to both price and operating            cost of new vehicles;
while vehicle utilization        does not depend on operating            cost, vehicle choice does. A question of
particular     interest   for environmental      regulation        is whether consumers   appear to be “myopic”,
  4gThe gas tax increases we have in mind here, are ones of approximately the same order of magnitude as the
fuel price variation observed in our data; aa mentioned in the previous subsection, the consumer response to
dramatic price increases (like the ones associated with the oil shortages of the 1970s) may well be different.
  ‘“Recall that this coefficientwas estimated to be 0.4 for the the 1984-1990 period. In earlier work, I estimated
the same coefficient to be 0.01 for 1983-1987. These two sets of results provide some weak evidence that the
substitutability of used cars h= increased during the 1980s; the results for the earlier years imply that consumers
viewed new and used cars as almost completely distinct products.
   511n other words, CAFE hw no Scrappage effects; consumers may decide to purchase a used instead of a new
car, but they will not cancel a car purchase completely.


                                                              29
in the sense that they respond                         more to current             changes in vehicle prices, than to changes in
fuel costs that           are felt over several periods.                    As noted earlier, our empirical                             results imply an
average fuel cost elasticity of – 0.5, while the average vehicle price elasticity is —3,01. Hence,
                  ——
a proportional increase in vehicle prices will have a substantially larger effect on vehicle choice
than a proportional                increase in fuel costs.               This calculation,            however, ignores the fact that the
absolute       dollar amount              associated        with a proportional               increase in vehicle prices is much larger
than the one associated                   with a similar increase in fuel costs; the average vehicle price in 1987 was
ca. $12,000, while the average per year fuel costs were ca. $300. A more informative                                                             calculation
would,       therefore,       involve       semi-elasticities          rather     than       elasticities,      Assuming              a discount        rate    of
5%, and         an average          vehicle        holding      period     of 7 years,           produces           vehicle     price,        and fuel cost
semi-elasticity           estimates         that    are very similar            in magnitude.                Even     though          these    calculations
are sensitive         to assumptions                about     vehicle     holding         periods      and      discount            rates,    the    numbers
used      above      seem       realistic     enough         to safely     say that           we do not          have         any     reason        to believe
that     consumers           are myopic.            Hence,      changes         in operating          costs     can,     from         an environmental
perspective,         be as effective          as changes in vehicle                prices.


       Operating        costs      can,     in turn,        be affected         either     by changes          in the fuel efficiency of new
vehicles      as measured              by Miles       per    Gallon,      or by variations              in the Price per Gallon for gas.
Which of the two approaches                         is more effective           in shifting       the composition               of the new car sales
towards       a more fuel efficient                mix, cannot         be judged          without      solving        for the equilibrium               of the
model;       This involves         computing          the aggregate        consumer            response       to alternative            policy scenarios,
feeding      this    response        back     to the suppliers’           profit       m=imization             problem,             and solving        for the
new equilibrium              prices,      market      shares,     and locational             parameters.             This     task      is undertaken           in
the last part         of the paper,           where      the simulation           results      are reported.

       The    predicted         choice      probabilities        from the discrete              choice model            are used in conjunction
with the population               weights      of the CES to compute                     aggregate      demand         and market             shares. 52The
results      from this procedure                   are reported         in Table         5; the left panel of the table                         reports        the
predicted         figures,    which         are compared          to the actual             ones displayed             in the right            panel    of the
table.

  52While the demand model waa estimated for the 1984-90 period, the aggregation procedure as well as the
analysis of the fuel efficiency regulation refer only to 1985-90. As noted earlier, the year 1984 was excluded,
because the empirical evidence suggests that the VER might still have been effective during that year.



                                                                            30
    The comparison         between predicted           and actual shares is interesting             for two reasons:             First,
it provides    a measure     of how representative           of the U.S. population            the CES sample            is. Second,

it gives us an idea-—as to whether           our approach          is promising     in analyzing           the effects     of CAFE
standards;  given that the average           fuel efficiency      of the new car fleet depends              on the allocation         of
sales across   market      segments,     accurate      model    predictions      of the market      shares      are essential       for
any further    analysis     of the fuel efficiency       regulation.     Table     5 reports     results     for two years,        one
towards   the beginning       of our sample         period     (1985)   and one towards         its end (1989);          both    years
were associated      with heated       debates      on the appropriateness         of environmental           standards.        53 The
aggregation     results    for the other    years are similar.




   53The year 1985 was the first year in which CAFE was in effect; Both GM and Ford were well below the
prescribed standard of 27.5 MPG, and lobbied therefore intensely to reduce the standard to 26.0 MPG. The
1988/1989 period was marked by proposals to make environmental standards stricter, by raising, among other
things, the CAFE standard to 50 MpG by 2000.

    As is evident from Table 5, the model suffers from underpredicting                                              total     demand;          this     is
exactly      the    same      problem       encountered         in Goldberg           (1995),   and      as discussed          in that         paper,
it is due to the fact             that    the CES focuses             on household         purchases       alone,     ignoring        fleet     sales.
Nevertheless,          conditional        on the prediction           of total    new car sales, the model              predicts       the shares
corresponding              to the various       market      segments,          as well as the import         shares,         quite    accurately.
For the      analysis         of the     fuel efficiency       standards,         it is the     shares     alone      that      matter         in the
computation          of the average           fuel efficiency.         Underpredicting          total    demand         does not         therefore
limit the applicability              of the model.

    This is also reflected               in Table 6, in which the predicted                average       fuel efficiency        of each manu-
facturer     is reported.        To facilitate       comparisons,            the second    column       repeats      the CAFE          standards
for 1985-90.         The third         column     reports      the average         fuel efficiency       of domestic          producers          com-
puted      for their        domestic      products       only, as implied          by the model.          The fourth          column          reports
the same figure for those                 products       classified     as imports,       while columns           5 and 6 report            the cor-


                                                                          32
responding          figures for foreign manufacturers;                as noted earlier, according                      to the EPA import
classification       rules,   no foreign     brand      classified   as domestic          during      our sample         period;     therefore,
column       5 in Table       6 is left blank.         The    computations          suggest        that    the CAFE          constraint       was
binding      for the domestic        producers         for every     single     year between              1985 and       1990 for their       do-
mestic      production,       and had the strongest             effects in 1985.       The products             classified     as “imports”
fared     better,    meeting     the CAFE        standard        every     year but        1985 and         1990, when the standard
was highest,         The implied CAFE penalties                 range from $5 per domestically                   produced          car in 1986,
to $130 per car in 1985.            Similar     computations         for pick-up          trucks     indicate     that     the average        fuel
efficiency      of domestic      manufacturers           was slightly         below   the     CAFE          standard       in almost      every
year      between     1985 and     1990 (ea.          19,5 MPG),         for both     domestically           produced        and imported
trucks.      The foreign      manufacturers’          average    fuel efficiency,     on the other           hand,      was well above the
standard       during     the same period,       for both       passenger       cars and pick-up             trucks.     These      figures   are
fairly consistent         with published       data    on the fuel efficiency         of domest ic and foreign                corporations.

       The final step of the empirical            analysis involves solving the first order conditions                               for profit
maximization         for the unit variable        costs.      Note that       according      to the results          of Table 6, firms are
   SAAdirect comparison of the figures in Table 6 to published data is hampered by the fact that the latter are
typically broken down by corporation, while our predicted fuel efficiencies refer to domestic firm averages. To
get a rough idea about the accuracy of the model, the following back-of-the-envelope calculation was conducted:
The officially reported fuel efficiency of each corporation was multiplied by the share of that corporation in
the domestic car sales to construct a national average. For 1985, the relevant figures are 25.1 MPG and 64~o
market share for GM, 25.9 MPG and 22% market share for Ford, and 27.1 MPG and 14% share for Chrysler,
which average to 25.5 MPG. This figure is slightly above the 24.9 MPG implied by our model. Note, however,
that the above calculation did not distinguish between domestically produced, and imported cars. Confining
the computation to domestically produced cars alone, would bring the computed average further down. In
later years, the predicted average fuel efficiencies in Table 6 generally lie below the averages reported in the
Automotive News Market Data Book, but display similar trends in terms of the differences between domestic
and foreign firms.


                                                                     33
– with one exception – never at the point where the constraint                                           is ezacilg satisfied;          55 the exception

refers to the average             fuel efficiency            of the imports           of domestic          firms in 1987.            This implies,          that
with the exception -. of 1987 for domestic firms, the equilibrium occurs                                                in the differentiable               area
of the profit function.   Hence, we can apply the first order conditions                                                    given    by (5) and           (6) to
compute        the unit variable             costs.    Take, for example,                the year 1989. In this year,                       domestic      firms
do not meet          the standard            for their         domestic       products,        but    the average             fuel economy             of their
imports       is well above          it.    Hence,          11 = 1 and 12 = O for domestic                          firms,      The     computation              of
unit costs is much easier for foreign                         firms,    since these do not produce                     any products            classified        as
domestic          and they     are well above               the standard           in every     single year.           The first order           conditions
for foreign        firms     are further       simplified         by the absence              of the CAFE              penalty       terms;      given      that
foreign     firms meet the standard                   every year, their unit variable                      costs are equal            to their     marginal
costs     (nc~ ), and do not vary with                      quantity.

      The results           from the unit            cost     calculations         can be found              in Table        7, which         reports       unit
variable      costs, inclusive         of CAFE         penalties,        for “domestic”             and “foreign”            production          separately,
for 1989. The average             CAFE         penalty         for domestically          produced,           American         cars is $40 per vehicle
for this year.

      The results in Table                 7 are quite         intuitive,      as they        indicate       that      production           costs increase
with vehicle         size, and are highest              for the market              segment       of luxury         cars.     A noteworthy             feature
of the      unit    cost     figures       is that     production            costs     in the       U.S.      differ    from        costs     abroad.         As
noted      in Section        II. 2, this      is a direct         consequence            of the existence              of binding           fuel efficiency
standards.         More interest           ingly, our model             estimates        variable      costs for subcompacts,                    compacts,
and intermediates             to be lower abroad                than     in the U. S., while this pattern                      is reversed        for larger
and      luxury     cars.     This     implies        that,      were       it not     to avoid       higher        CAFE         penalties,        domestic
manufacturers           would      move        the production               of small      cars abroad,           and keep           the production             of
larger     cars in the U.S. .56 The differing                      cost patterns          for small          and large cars suggest                that      the
cost differences            bet ween domestic               and foreign        production           are probably             due to more          than      just
differences        in input     prices       (such     as lower wages                in foreign      countries);         the production             of large
cars could,         for example,           require     specialized          labor,     or parts       that     are cheaper            in the U.S. than
abroad,      while foreign         countries          may have a comparative                    advantage           in the production               of small
cars,     which     they     already       produce          for their       local markets.           For foreign            manufacturers,             no unit

V. The          Effects      of Alternative             Policies


       In this section,        the empirical           model     of Section       III is used to evaluate            three     policy     proposals
that     have     been      actively        debated    in recent      years:       1.    Abolishing      the      current      CAFE        program;

2. Replacing          the CAFE              standard    by a powerful           gas guzzler       tax; and 3. Replacing                 the current
fuel efficiency           standards         with   higher      gasoline    taxes.        The method           used    to address         the effects

of these        policies     is the one of count erfactual                 simulations.         The parameter               estimates      obtained
in the previous            sections        are substituted        into the model            which     is then      solved     under      alternative
assumptions          concerning            the environmental         policy      in effect.     All of the simulations             considered          in


                                                                           35
the following sections                 involve policy scenarios            other      than CAFE            standards.        The derivation         of the
new equilibrium              for each of these             cases is straightforward;               The CAFE           penalty      terms      are absent
from       the unit        variable      cost functions,         so that      unit      variable     costs     are equal         to marginal        costs.
Consequently,              the- allocation         of production         between         “domestic”          and      “imports”        is independent
of environmental                rules;   firms choose          the lower cost alternative,                  so that       ~i = 1 if nq        > nc~ and
al = O if nci < nc~, The equilibrium                           is thus described           by conditions            (5) and (6), where           the last
two terms          in each equation               have dropped         out ,57

       The data used in the simulations                          refer     to 1989.        This      year     was chosen           for two reasons:
First,     it is relatively            recent,      so it provides         us with       a fairly     good      idea      of what       the    effects    of
alternative          policies      would         be if these     were introduced             now.      Second,          for 1989,       the   predicted
aggregate         market        shares     and fuel efficiency             patterns       fit the actual           data    quite      well, indicating
that      the    1989 CES          sample         was truly     representative           of the U.S. population.5aGiven                       the focus
of this paper          on the environmental                   and trade       effects     of the CAFE              regulation,        the subsequent
discussion         will focus          on three       types     of questions.           First,      what     are the        effects     of alternative
policies        on prices,       and     market       shares?        In particular,         how does          the     composition          of the     new
car fleet       change       in response           to environmental           regulation,           and how large            are the substitution
effects     towards         used cars?           Second,      how is fuel efficiency             affected      by this compositional                shift?
Which       policy     yields the largest            fuel consumption             savings?       Third,      how is the allocation              between
“domestic”           and     “imported”           products      affected     by alternative           measures?            How significant          is the
job protection             function      of fuel efficiency          standards?



       V.1 The Effects of Abolishing                            CAFE         Standards


       One way to assess the effects of the current                            CAFE        standards         is to solve the model              as if no
environment          al regulation          were in effect,          and compare          prices,     market        shares      and fuel consump-
tion to the ones implied                   by the model          in the presence             of CAFE          standards.           The results       from
this exercise         are summarized               in Table     8.




   sTThis is because in the absence of the CAFE regulation the derivatives of the unit costs with re5Pect to Price
and fraction of domestic production are zero.
   5eAs noted in the previous section, this is true for the other years too, though 1989 fits the data best. In any
case, for the simulation exercise, the choice of the particular year is of secondary importance (u long as the
sample for this year is fairly representative of the U.S. population), given that - by definition – simulations do not
tell us what really happened during a year, but what would have happened, had the policy under consideration
been implemented.

    In the absence of CAFE standards,                        the last two terms          in equation      (6) would          drop out,    and
so would the CAFE penalty terms in the unit variable                               cost formulas;       consequently,          firms would
produce       “domestic”       products         if nci < nc~ and         “imports”       if nq   > nc~,       The results       in Table         7
indicate      that     the first    condition      is met     for all passenger          car categories       of domestic        firms    but
subcompacts           and compacts.          ‘“Hence 2 in the absence           of the CAFE        regulation,       we would         observe
a decrease      in the fraction        of domestically         produced        subcompacts       and compacts,          and an increase
in the fraction        of domestically         produced      large cars.       The last column       in the bottom           part of Table
8 reflects     this    shift   in the allocation          of production         between      domestic     and imported            products
for the American           brands.      For foreign        brands,     there    are no allocation       effects,     given that       foreign
firms were above           the CAFE          standard      for 1989 anyway.

    A first      idea about         the environmental           impact       of the CAFE         regulation        can be obtained          by
examining        its effects       on the average         fuel efficiency      of domestic       and foreign        firms;    these    effects

  ‘“The numbers reported in Table 7 include the CAFE penalty of $40 per passenger car domestic manufacturers
pay in 1989 on their domestic products. To calculate ~i (unit costs net of CAFE penalties) I subtract $40 from
the figures in column 3; for example, the unit variable costs for subcompacts are 6033 – 40 = 5993. Since the
CAFE standard is met for the imports of domestic firms, a similar calculation is not necessary for column 4.
As mentioned earlier, light trucks faced a different standard of 20.5 MPG in 1989. The average fuel efficiency
of domestically produced trucks w= estimated to be 20 MPG in our model, implying CAFE penalties of $25
per truck. This number is subtracted from the cost figures referring to light trucks in Table 7 to get the unit
costs net of CAFE penalties.


                                                                       37
are largest           for the domestic                production          of U.S. manufacturers,                     whose     corporate             average      fuel
efficiency         would       be lower by 1.2 MPG                   in the absence            of CAFE          standards.          Note,      however,          that
this     number         alone—.is insufficient for judging CAFE’s effectiveness, as it includes the import
classification          shifts resulting from CAFE; a large part of the 1.2 MPG drop in the domestic car
fuel efficiency             is due to the fact that                 in the absence             of CAFE,            small,    fuel efficient           cars would
be “imported”                 and       hence     excluded        from      the calculation              of the average          fuel efficiency            of the
domestic           fleet.      This      creates       the illusion         that    CAFE           has led to enormous                 fuel savings             when
in fact      most       of the increase               in the average          fuel efficiency            is due to the shift                in the allocation
between        “domestic”               and     “imports”.        Nevertheless,            there      is also a fraction           in this change              of the
average       that      reflects         CAFE       induced        compositional             shifts      towards       more     fuel efficient           vehicles.
The lower panel of table 8 shows how these shifts come about.

        In the absence of the CAFE regulation,                               domestic manufacturers                     would set higher prices for
small, fuel efficient                  cars, and lower prices              for large vehicles.              As a result        of these        price changes,
the composition                    of the new car fleet would                    shift towards           more       fuel inefficient         cars,     while      the
total      sales     of new cars              would     go up.        The        projected         prices     of import        cars      exhibit        a similar
pattern,       but      the        magnitude          of the predicted             price     effects     is much        smaller.        Nevertheless,             the
impact       on the import               market       shares     would be quite significant;                  because        domestic         manufacturers
are dominant                in the categories           of intermediate             and standard             cars, the price          reductions          of large
cars resulting              from abolishing            the CAFE           regulation         would boost            domestic       sales at the expense
of imported           brands,          whose combined             market         share     would go down by a whole percentage                              point.

        From an environmental                      point of view the most interesting                        projection        refers to the total fuel
consumption             in the absence              of CAFE         standards.           The change           in aggregate         fuel consumption                 is
computed           as the difference               between        total     gallons        consumed         with,     and total         gallons       consumed
without       CAFE,           according          to the formula:



  AGallons             = ~         ~    Wh * P,h * (l/MPGi)                 * Miles!         – }—:~, Wh * P~h * (l/MPGi)                             * Miles?
                              hi                                                                    hi


       To compute              total      fuel consumption                with     and      without         CAFE,        I sum        the     expected          indi-
vidual      fuel consumption                    on each vehicle            i, over consumer                 and vehicle        types,        after     weighting
each individual               observation           by the       CES population               weight        Wh. The expected                  individual         fuel
consumption             on vehicle             i is in turn        given      by the product                of each      consumer’s            probability         of
purchasing           that     vehicle         type (P,h), times           the fuel efficiency            of that     vehicle    (l/MPGi              ), times     the
miles the household                    drives on that          vehicle.     Given that         according           to the results        of the utilization


                                                                                   38
model, mile consumption                    does not depend on vehicle choice, we need not worry about how the
compositional          shifts induced by the CAFE regulation                        affected mileage; the miles driven on each
vehicle are household,
                  -.   but not vehicle specific (Miles: = ~iles~h = Milesh).   Hence, in the
fuel consumption calculations I use the reported mileage on the household’s new vehicle as an
estimate      of ~ilesh.           In the absence          of any utilization           effects,     the change          in the aggregate            fuel
consumption          comes entirely          from the compositional                shift of car sales, reflected                 in the change          of
the purchase         probability y of each vehicle                 type from pi to ~j.             As noted        earlier,    the vehicle        choice
model      incorporates         the outside       good; hence          the subscript        z denoting            the vehicle      type     refers not
only to new, but also to used cars.                       The inclusion of used cars in the fuel consumption                                  calcula-
tions    is essential,       as CAFE        leads    to substitution            towards      used cars61 which                have on average               a
lower fuel efficiency           than    new cars,

    The results          from      these     calculations,          shown      in the     upper       part        of Table       8, indicate         that
CAFE       standards         have substantial            effects     on fuel consumption;              without          CAFE,       the aggregate
fuel consumption             would     be higher         by approximately           19 Million         Gallons        per year.


    V.2 The          Effects        of Raising           the Gas Guzzler             Tax


    In this section         I examine       the effects of replacing             the CAFE           standard        regulation      by a powerful
gas guzzler      t=.        Just     like the     CAFE        standards,         the gas guzzler             t=      was enacted          in 1975 to
encourage      efficiency       when fuel short ages were feared.                   The t ~         gradually         tightened      in the 1980s;
in 1988 the Congress               voted    to double        the tzx beginning             with      the 1991 models.              Table     9 shows
the tax schedule            for each of the years            between          1985 and 1993.

    In contrast        to CAFE,         the gas guzzler            tax is applied       to individual             models,     and is paid by the
consumer.        ln its current          form,      the t=         attaches     a severe     monetary             penalty      to fuel inefficient
cars with     fuel economy             below     22.5 MPG.           The penalty         starts     with     $1,000         for cars in the 22.0-
22.5 MPG        bracket       and reaches           its m=imum            at $7)700 for cars with                  fuel economy           below      12.5
MPG.       Despite     these stiff “penalties”,             the environmental             effects of the gas guzzler               tax during        our
sample     period      (1985-1990)         should    be rather         small, given that           the number          of vehicles        affected     by
the tax is limited           to a few models             with relatively        small market          shares;        in the 1987 model            year,
for example,         only    18 makes          were subject          to the tax.        The number             rose to 24 in 1988 and 49
in 1989; from the 49 models                    subject      to the t=         in 1989, however,            43 were expensive               European

  ‘lThe substitution effects towards used cars should, however, be viewed u short run effects. In the longer
run, one would expect the prices of used cars to rise in response to the higher demand, limiting the increase in
the sales of second-hand cars. This effect would make the CAFE regulation even more effective.


                                                                          39
luxury    models.   This market    segment      is characterized     by not only a small market               share,   but also
a relatively    low price elasticity     of demand,      so that   the t=     induced    price increases         are unlikely
to initiate   significant substitution      towards    more fuel efficient       vehicles.     But,     on the other       hand,
                       —.
recent    gas guzzler tax increases        were rarely     mot ivated       by environmental            considerations;      the
1988 tax increase      was enacted       to help pay for two other           unrelated       measures      approved       by the
Senate.

nents     are Germany             and the European              Community         who criticized           the tax increase              as an unfair

power in Washington    is weak; and as Senator Bentsen noted, commenting  on the expected price
increases      for models          with     six-figure    price tags,      such as Aston-Martin                     and Lamborghini:              “...       I
have little      sympathy          for the impact         on the buyer          of such cars.          I’m really        not concerned           about
him paying           another      $3,800 .”63.

      Though the gas guzzler tax has rather weak effects on fuel consumption                                               in its current         form,
it could     potentially          provide      a powerful        environmental         tool;        its effects     are direct,          transparent,
and      of large      magnitude.           However,         to be effective,        the      tax     would       have    to include          low fuel
economy        models      that      fall into more          price   elastic    market        segments,         such      as intermediate             and
standard       sized cars.         To assess the environmental                  potential       of the tax,          I therefore         concentrate
in the following          on a policy         scenario    in which       the tax is applied             more broadly.           This       scenario      is
depicted      in the last column             of Table     9; the characteristic             feature      of this column            is that     the t=
figures     are similar        in magnitude          to those    subsequent        to 1990, but the tax brackets                     are extended
to include      models         with fuel economy          below 25.5 MPG.             From an environmental                     standpoint,           this
policy     of extending           the t=      base    should      be more       effective      than      a policy        of increasing         the t=
wit hin each previously               defined     bracket.

      The simulation             results for this scenario           are depicted      in Table         10. The simulation                is based      on
the assumption            that     a powerful        gas guzzler       tax is replacing             the current        CAFE        standards.           As
noted     earlier,    in the absence          of CAFE,        any incentives        to shift the allocation               between         ‘(domestic”
and “imported”            products         to reduce     the average          fuel efficiency         of the domestic           fleet,     disappear.
Hence,      producers          will produce       wherever        the unit variable            costs    are lower,         and the distinction
between       the domestic          and imported         fleet becomes          irrelevant.         Therefore,        I only report          the total
fuel efficiency        averages      for the domestic            and foreign       firms in Table             10.

     The first         question       of interest        considers         the     incidence        of the     tax;     if auto       manufacturers
respond         to the tax increase            by lowering        the wholesale            prices    of their        vehicles,     the transactions
price     increase       induced       by the     t=     will be lower             than     the t=       amounts         in the       last     column        of
Table      9.    The     second       column     in the lower          panel        of Table        10 assesses         the importance                of this
effect;     the new gas guzzler               tax affects      the prices          of intermediate,           standard,          luxury       and sports
passenger        cars,     as well as the prices             of vans and utility             vehicles .64 The wholesale                      prices    of all
these     vehicle      classes      decrease     slightly      as a result         of the tax;        the effect        is largest        for the most
price     elastic     classes     (standard      and vans),          and lower for luxury                and sports           cars.     This     decrease
of the wholesale            prices,    even though           small     in magnitude,             implies      that     part      of the gas guzzler
tax cost is born           by the producer.             The largest        part,     however,        is born by the consumer.                      Column
3 of Table          10 reports      the increase        in transactions            prices;     the increase           is substantial,          especially
for the market             segments      of standard          sized,   luxury          and sports        cars.       The higher           prices      of the
cars included          in these classes induce              substitution          towards      more fuel efficient             vehicles;       as evident
from the third             column     of Table      10, the big winner                 is the market         segment          of compacts             with   a
15% increase           in their market         share.     Subcompact             sales also increase,          but by a smaller               percentage
of 3.6%.        The price increases            also encourage          substitution            towards       used cars; but as with                   CAFE
standards,          these substitution          effects are weak (used car sales increase                            by only 0.670).           Note that
the large       magnitude         of the substitution            effects implied            by the powerful            gas guzzler           tax are due
to the fact that            the tax applies         to the price elastic               classes of intermediate                 and standard            sized
cars; though           the tax amounts           applied       to these          market      segments        are not higher            than      the ones
currently        applied     to the European             luxury      automobiles,            the higher        price     elasticities         of demand
for non-luxury           cars lead to larger            substitution         effects      towards     compacts          .65
  GqBecaUse~ff.road users, such ~ farmerg, loggers and miners are excluded from the tax, and because a large
fraction of these users presumably uses pick-up trucks, the simulation excludes trucks from the gas guzzler tax;
in contrast to the current regulation, however, the gas guzzler tax considered in the simulation applies to vans
and utility vehicles.
   65The average price elasticity for models in the intermediate and standard sized classes is -4.0, as opposed to


                                                                            42
       These      substitution           effects .translate           tosignificant            fuel savings.         Using the method             described
in the previous               subsection         to compute           fuel consumption                 with     and without         the more         powerful
version        of the   gas guzzler tax, the resulting fuel savings are estimated to be approximately
                           ——
48 million         Gallons, more than twice the amount saved by CAFE. The average fuel economies
of American             and     foreign         brands      increase      by O.4 and             O.3 MPG          respectively,            In summary,               a
powerful        version        of the gas guzzler              tax     applying         to a wide range              of relatively         fuel inefficient
vehicles       appears         to be an extremely               effective      environmental              tool.


       V.3 The Effects of Raising                             Gasoline         Prices


       The final policy scenario                    to be considered                in the      simulations          involves       an increase          in the
gasoline       t~es.       CAFE         opponents          have often expressed                 the view that         replacing       the fuel economy
regulation         by higher          gasoline      taxes      would      provide        a more          effective      environmental           policy        that
would      target       fuel consumption                  directly.      Our        earlier     results       suggest      that     an increase          in the
vehicle      operating          cost     is unlikely          to affect      utilization          in any        noticeable         manner.       Yet,         it is
possible       that     the     compositional             effects     of higher        gasoline        prices     outweigh         those     of the      CAFE
regulation,           Cent rary        to the CAFE            standards,        gasoline         taxes     affect not only new but also used
cars, so that          there        is no reason         to expect       any substitution               towards      less fuel efficient,         used cars
when      taxes       are raised.

       To compare             the     environmental            effects      of a gasoline           tax       increase      to those       of the       CAFE
standards,         we posed           the following          question:       How large would                  a gas t=        increase       have to be in
order     to achieve          the same fuel savings                 as with the CAFE               regulation?            According        to our results,
this    increase        would        have       to be extremely             high:      78070.          As noted         earlier,    the    vehicle       choice
estimation         results      do not suggest              consumer         myopia,           The primary           reason        for the     78070 figure
is simply       that      the absolute           dollar     amounts         associated          with     changes      in fuel tues           are miniscule
compared          to those          associated      with vehicle          price changes.

       A second        reason        for the large         magnitude         of the required              gasoline       tax increase,        is related        to
its effects on vehicle               prices.     Note that          in the case of CAFE                  standards        all price changes           work in
the same        direction;           the prices      of small         cars slightly       decrease,           the prices      of large       cars increase,
and these         price       changes       combined          induce      a shift      towards         smaller,      more      fuel efficient         cars.     In
the case of a gasoline                  price     increase,      the price effects              work in the opposite                direction     from         the
fuel cost effects;            in particular,         our results         suggest        that     in response         to a gasoline           price increase

the -1.2 elaaticit y estimated for luxury and sports cars.



                                                                               43
manufacturers            lower      the relative          prices     of luxury          and     standard         sized    cars;     while      these         price
decreases      are quite          small,       they     partly     offset     the negative            impact      of higher        fuel prices          on the
demand for these market segments.
                 -.

     In short,       our results        suggest        that   in order to achieve               noticeable        changes        in fuel consumption
through       a gasoline        tax increase,            the increase         has to be substantial.                  Whether         such a policy              is
politically      feasible,      given      the regressivity            of the gas t~,            is questionable.


    VI. Conclusions                    and Further Research


    Environmental policies aimed at reducing automobile fuel consumption have two aspects:
a “utilization” aspect that concerns the miles driven on the current car fleet, and a ‘~compo-
sitional” aspect that is related to the relative sales volume of vehicle types with different fuel
efficiencies. The goal of this paper was to provide an evaluation                                              of the CAFE standards                     in the
automobile          industry      in terms         of these        two aspects.          The empirical             analysis       suggested           that     for
relatively     small     changes         in fuel costs,           utilization         effects       are negligible;        therefore,         policies        ori-
ented     towards      shifting        the composition             of the car fleet towards                more fuel efficient              vehicles         seem
more      promising.         With       this    in mind,         the effects         of the CAFE           regulation            were computed                and
compared       to the ones of alternative                     policy      measures.          The basic          conclusion        is that     the current
standards      – despite        the presence            of substitution          effects towards           used cars – were quite                    effective
in reducing         fuel consumption.                  Nevertheless,          the fuel savings            would       be substantially               larger      if
the CAFE         standard         regulation           were replaced         by a powerful             gas guzzler        tax.     Gasoline          taxation
can also be effective             as an environmental                  policy        tool;    but     for the taxation            to have noticeable
effects on fuel consumption,                    the t=        increases      will have to be substantial.                    Of course,         the choice
of the appropriate             environmental             policy     is not determined                by environmental             concerns           alone.     A
powerful      gas guzzler         t=     of the form described                  in Section          V.2 is likely to meet            the strong          resis-
tance     of auto     manufacturers             just     as was the case with                 CAFE       standards;         a substantial            increase
in gasoline      taxes       would      probably         cause     a public        outcry.       The strong         progressiveness             of the gas
guzzler      tax and      CAFE          standard         regulation,         however,         make      these     two measures              better      candi-
dates     for a politically          viable      environmental              policy     than     the gasoline         t=      (traditionally            viewed
as regressive66).

    The trade effects              of the current             CAFE        standards           were also found             to be quite          significant.

  65The view that the gasoline tax is regressive has recently been challenged by Poterba (1991). Poterba relates
gasoline expenditures to household expenditure rather than income, arguing that the former is a better proxy
for permanent income, and finds that outlays for gasoline are roughly proportional to household spending.


                                                                              44
Whether        the CAFE regulation                 has a job protection                  function        is, however,           ambiguous.         While
CAFE encourages keeping the production                               of small cars in the U. S., it also encourages                       moving         the
production    of large cars abroad. Moreover, the simulation                                  results      indicate      that     the import       shares
                      ——
rise as a result of the current CAFE regulation,    reducing                                     the profits       of domestic        manufacturers
even further.

      To the extent         that     the supply          side of the automobile                   market       model        focused     on price        and
domestic      content      decisions        conditional       on product          types,      the results          should     be interpreted            with
caution.      As was emphasized               earlier,    the environmental               effects of the CAFE                regulation        discussed
in this paper       are best       viewed       as short      run effects;        in the longer            run the adjustment                 process     to
environmental           policies    is more       complex          as manufacturers                may     alter    vehicle      characteristics          or
introduce      new technologies             in response          to stricter     regulation.          Another         limitation       of the present
analysis     concerns       the aggregation              of product       types         across     manufacturers.               Unfortunately,           the
current      computational           technology          does not allow us to solve for both                           equilibrium        prices        and
locational       parameters         when      products        are further          disaggregated;              therefore,        it is not      possible
to assess     the   regulation’s         impact          on each manufacturer                    separately,        via simulations.             Finally,
our   analysis      abstracts        from      other      policies     that     have       been      simultaneously              in effect,     such      as
emissions      standards,          policies     to encourage            the     early     scrappage          of old vehicles,           etc.      Future
research     facilitated      by the        collection       of better         data     and      improvements            in the       computational
technology       may be able to address                  these     shortcomings.
