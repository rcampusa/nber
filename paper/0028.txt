                       The higher the real income of a society, the greater
                   the weight that the society as a whole is likely to put
                   on the nonmonetary side of occupational choice. The
                   president of an American university remarked not long
                   ago that as real income continues to rise we may well
                   see the day when a garbage collector is paid more than
                   a full professor"
                                                        W. Boweri [   5 ,P. 19]

          Despite its simple and static nature, conventional leisure income analysis

seems to be useful in the interpretation of long-run trends in labor supply.

Thus, the shortening of the working week is explained by a dominant incoma effect

in the demand for leisure (see Lewis [11]). The emphasis of this approach is on

the quantity of work while the quality of work is often neglected. The purpose

of this paper is to indicate similar regularities in the area of occupational

choice.

       A simple one-period model is used to examine the effect of changes in

nonhuman and human wealth on the choice of an occupation. Just as in usual

income-leisure analysis we have two alternative interpretations of the one-period

model in mind. One is the allocation of time in the short run among work activities

within an occupation and for a given level of skill. A switch from one such job to

another is assumed to have a negligible effect on future earnings opportunities.

Another interpretation is based upon viewing a whole lifetime as a single period.

In this approach the relevant wages are permanent," that is, proportional to

present value of lifetime earnings.

          The results of the paper are summarized in five simple propositions on

the wealth effects under conditions of certainty and uncertainty. It is argued

that under certainty: An increase in nonwage income will increase the propensity

to choose pleasant low paying work activities. An increase in human capital, which
                                            —2—


we define to be a uniform proportional increase in wage earnings capacity, will

also induce a choice of pleasant work activities if the income effect is dominant.

Under conditions of uncertainty an increase in nonwage income will tend to

encourage the choice of risky high-paying work activities if their monetary returns

are uncertain. If the rionmonetary returns of an occupation are uncertain the

propensity to choose it will tend to decrease with wealth. Finally, an increase

in human capital is likely to discourage the choice of occupations with risky

monetary returns.

       None of the above propositions is particularly novel or surprising.-' It

is hoped however that bringing them under a unified treatment will be useful.

       The understanding of the income effect may be helpful in explaining long

run and short run changes in labor supply and the corresponding changes in wage

differentials. Furthermore, since wage earnings are endogenous within the model

it is natural to inquire into the (reduced) relation between rionwage and wage

earnings. Clearly, if wealthy individuals also earn higher monetary returns on

their human capital, then, other things being equal, the distribution of trans-

ferable wealth becomes less equal as time passes and generations evolve. The

reverse may be true if originally wealthy individuals prefer jobs in which

relatively low monetary returns are expected. It will be shown that the relation

between wage and nonwage income is likely to be of a different sign under conditions

of certainty and uncertainty.


                                The Model Ut'1er Certainty


       Consider an individual who allocates a given amount of time among m time

activities. Let t.    be the portion of the period spent at activity i and let
w. be the real wage per period in activity i .       In   this section we assume that

wages are known with certainty. We assume that activity m is a leisure activity
                                                   —3—



with W =     0   ,   all      other activities are work activities and offer a positive wage.

The amount of time spent on consumption activities is assumed to be predetermined.

Throughout the discussion we shall assume that prices of goods are given and

known with certainty. All goods can therefore be aggregated into a single com-

posite commodity ("consumption") which we shall denote by x               The price of

x will be set at 1.

       We restrict the discussion to a one-period model in which savings are

taken to be predetermined. The budget constraint assumes the form

                     m
1.     x=A+ i=l
             t.w.
                1 1


where the period's real nonwage earnings are denoted by A

       Jobs are of different quality and the amounts of time spent at different

jobs are treated as different commodities. The individual's preferences with

respect to the various consumptions and allocations of time are represented by

an ordinal utility function:


2.     u =   u(x,    t
                         1,
                              t2   .   . tm )




       It is essential for our analysis that an unambiguous common ranking of

occupations exist in terms of their "pleasantness." For this purpose we shall

assume that preferences are identical across individuals. Furthermore, we

require that the ranking is independent of the market wage structure. A

necessary condition is that utility will be separable and an aggregate ii(t1.. tm)

exist such that:


3.     u =   u(x,    n(t1, t2
                                       ..   t)).
                                                     -4-




            Further restrictions depend on the "degrees of freedom" which we allow

 in the allocation of time. Through most of the analysis we shall assume that

 individuals can choose only one work activity, and that the amount of work in

 each job is fixed. Let us denote by n.                the level of n when t.
 tm=   1    -   t°   ,   and the rate of work in all other activities is
                                                                         put at a zero
 level. We shall say that job 1              is   more pleasant than j    if     >0   and
 n. > n. .       The numbers n1, n2 .. n          may be interpreted as the nonmonetary

 returns associated with the various time activities.             We may thus distinguish
 jobs in terms of their, exogenously given,
                                                       norimonetary returns as well as on the
 basis of the wage rate which they offer. The operational meaning of the above

definition is quite clear. Job i is more pleasant than j if when the wages

 (and thus consumptions) of the two job are set equal, then job i is chosen.

Due to the separability assumption this choice is invariant with the level at

which the two wages are set equal. We may thus assign numbers n,                           n
                                                                                 r12 ...

and an appropriate utility index to represent this ranking. The choice of these

indices must, however,             satisfy one further restriction. The rate of substi-
tution between the monetary and
                                          nonmonetary returns of any two jobs must be
invariant under all admissable transformations
                                                           on n( ) and u( ).   Operationally,
this rate of substitution is revealed by the wage compensation which is required

for unpleasant work.

           It should be emphasized that in the present analysis nonmonetary returns

are viewed as an ordinal index which is associated with the
                                                                         alternative occupa-
tions. This reflects our distinction between the quality and quantity of work.

In some cases it is, of course, possible to ascribe differences in nonmonetary

returns to differences in measurable (up to a linear or a ratio scale) "objective"

quantities, such as, hours of work, or temperature and level of noise at the

place of work. In general however, it is not operationally feasible to produce
                                                        —5—




 objective and separate measures of factors such as effect on health, effort,

repetitiveness, challenge, and other working conditions which are known to be

"relevant." We therefore restrict the discussion to propositions which do not

depend on the assumption of measurable characteristics of jobs.-"

        Consider any two jobs i and               j such that job i                    is more pleasant.

It is clear that for anyone to choose occupation                                 we   must have w > w,     4/
                                                                            j


However, not all individuals require the same compensation. Since by assumption

tastes are identical the only source of variation lies in the presumed unequal

distribution of wealth.

        Let q.. denote the compensating wage change (in job 1) which will induce

indifference between the two jobs. That is q.. is defined as the solution of-1


4.      u(A +   w.,
                 1
                      n.) = u(A
                       1
                                  + w. +   q..,   n.)
                                     •3     1]     J


Clearly, q.. depends on w1, w, n, n and A. The testable properties of this

function depend upon the restrictions imposed on the utility function. In partic-

ular it can be showrr' (See Rosen [16J) that:

Proposition 1.        If nonmonetary returns are viewed as a "normal good"
                u

              (j—) > 0) then n > n implies

                                                              -\
                                                              c'q.
                                                                       1]   >   0.
                 x

Wealthier individuals will require a higher wage compensation for unpleasant work.

        Note that the assumed normality of nonmrnetary return is invariant under

monotone transformation on n .-

        If nonhuman wealth is the only source of ariation across individuals then
it follows from proposition 1 that there exists a unique level of nonwage income

A', such that every one with a higher income will prefer the pleasant low-paying

job i to the unpleasant high-paying one,                  I        .    All     individuals with lower

nonwage income will prefer the high-paying unpleasant job.
                                                -6—




       The analysis can be extended to cover individual differences in human

wealth. In the present context we may identify human capital with general earning

capacity. An increase in human capital is assumed to be equivalent to a uniform

proportional increase in the earning capacity in all jobs. (An increase by the

same absolute magnitude is, of course, equivalent to an increase in nonhuman

wealth).

       A proprotional wage increase involves a price effect. If the individual

is to switch from job i to j he will gain more in terms of consumption for

the same loss in nonmonetary returns. Due to the opposing income and substitution

effects' the net result is ambiguous. As in standard leisure-income analysis

we may tentatively assume that the income effect is dominant.

       It may be argued that an increase in human capital opens new opportunities

for more pleasant work activities. In other words nonmonetary returns are also

likely to increase with variables such as ability and schooling which are summa-

rized in the human capital concept. This leads to a more complicated analysis

which we shall not pursue.

       The choice of leisure in each job can also be incorporated in the analysis.

Let n.(t) denote the value of n when the individual works at the rate t in

occupation i (i.e. t. =      t   tm =   l-t   and t. = 0 for j           i, m). In the present

context we shall say that job I is more pleasant then j                    if n.(t) > n.(t) for

1 > t > 0. Again, a higher wage must be paid to induce any individual to work at

the unpleasant work. To see this note that if w = w.
                                              1
                                                                     ,   the individual can
                                                                 3

always "buy" the optimal (x, t') while working in job i and thus be better off.

       Consider any two jobs i and            j such that i is more pleasant (i.e.

n.(t) > n.(t)). Define a compensating wage differential by

5.    u(x.(A,w.), n.(t.(A,w.))) =       u(x.(A,w.+q..),   n.(t.(A,w.+q..)))
                                                  —7—




Note that (x,, t.) and (x., t.) are now subject to choice, hence the appearance

of their demand function in 5. Theeffects of changes in nonwage income on the

choices within each occupation and on the propensity to switch jobs are summarized

in proposition 2.

Proposition 2     If work satisfaction is a normal good (i.e.                           > 0) and if

the relatively pleasant work activities are normal inputs in the 'roductio& of

         The definition of normal "inputs" requires further explanation. Consider

the sub-problem of maximizing x for a given level of n (i.e. n.(t.) =                        n.(t.)    =   n)
Clearly job i will be chosen depending upon whether w. n.1(n)                            w.n.'(n).
By normality in the context of exclusive alternatives, we mean that as n

increases, wages remaining the same, the propensity to choose the pleasant work

activity increases. Formally, this is equivalent to the requirement which appears

in proposition 2.

        As in the fixed leisure case for any given wages w, w. there is a

critical level of nonwage income A' such that every individual with a lower

wealth will prefer the relatively unpleasant high paying job, Consider an

individual with A < A' .   As his wealth increases wages remaining the same he

will purchase more work satisfaction that is more n            .
                                                                       Initially   this is achieved

by reducing the number of hours at the job at which he currently works. Eventually,

however, as A increases above A' more work satisfaction is achieved by switching

to a more pleasant low paying job. It is quite possible that upon switching he

will decide to work more hours)" Such a pattern may in fact be observed over

some phases of the   individual's   life cycle. A similar observation may                 apply   to

a   cross section. Wea-!iy individuals will tend to work at              more pleasant work
                                         -8-




 activities and earn less, but they may work longer hours. It is of course, not

 surprising that such "anomolies" my exist in the relation between hours of

work and income. The reason is that in the present analysis hours of work are

not homogenous.

       If one is willing as a first approximation to ignore the effects of risk

then the following rather obvious implications follow.     Over time the exogenous

increases in nonhuman wealth and in productivity will tend to increase the (real)

absolute wage differentials between pleasant and unpleasant jobs or occupations
                                               rema in
Provided, of course, that demand conditions /      roughly the same. In jobs or

occupations which are both unpleasant and "nonprogressive" (i.e. have slow rate

of technological advance, see Baumol [3J) considerable wage hikes will be necessary

to attract labor. Thus, we expect garbage collectors, plumbers, construction

workers, police and firemen to be paid an increasingly higher absolute real
                                                                               wage
compensation as time passes. If due to budgetary constraints or moral codes there

is a fixed or slowly adjusting upper bound on real wages in these low status jobs,

shortages will develop.   Of course, the quality of jobs need not be a datum.

Employers may substitute investment in improving working conditions for wage

hikes. We shall, therefore, expect some decrease in the quality differences

among jobs as productivity and nonhuman wealth increase.

       Similar implications may be tested across countries or states. The often

mentioned shortage of domestic servants, waiters, nurses, plumbers, construction

workers, etc. in advanced economies may be ascribed to an income effect which

                                                                                  12/
reduced the supply of these presumably unpleasant or socially inferior occupations.—

      The implications regarding the distribution of transferable wealth are less

clear. The reason is that human wealth is not independent from the initial stock

of nonhuman wealth. Mainly due to imperfections in the capital market we expect
                                                -9-




that individuals with more inherited wealth will also acquire a higher stock of

human capital. At the same time, due to the assumption that wealthy individuals

have a higher propensity to forego monetary returns in favor of more pleasant

work activities, we expect them to have lower monetary return on their human

capital. The net effect on               earnings is therefore ambiguous.


                                       The Effects of Risk

        The analysis of the previous section was seen to yield some plausible

implications of broad scope. Admittedly, many important aspects of the occupa-

tional choice problem such as life cycle patterns were neglected or "maximized

out" of the problem. Our decision to single out the effects of risk for further

discussion is not necessarily a reflection of a taste for complicated analysis with

ambiguous results. Our purpose is to point out some observable regular wealth-

type of job patterns. Indeed, there are well known postulates due to Arrow

fl, Ch. 3J which hypothesize a systematic relation between wealth and attitudes

towards risk.

        Let there be S states of the world. Each state is a specification of

the wages and the other characteristics in every job. Adopting the expected

utility hypothesis the maximization problem assumes the following form:

        To simplify the analysis, we assume that leisure is fixed and that the

individual can work in only one job. Specifically, let t = 0 and t. = 0,      1

 for i = 1, 2 .. rn-i.    Let n .        be the value of n when the individual works

 at job i and state s       occurs. Thus each occupation may be viewed as a two

 dimensional lottery ticket offering a joint distribution of monetary and non-

monetary returns. Note the dual role which is now played by the index of non-

monetary returns' Given the same wages it provides an ordering over states of the

world as well as over occupations.

       In dealing with risky occupations or work activities one should be careful

to distinguish the monetary and nonmonetary aspects. We shall say that only

monetary returns are risky if when the individual works at job 1, w•                   varies
with s while n.        is independent of the state of the world (i.e. n. =                n.).
                 is                                                               is       i
Such may be the case of a prospective lawyer for instance. We shall say that

only the nonmonetary returns are risky if w.          is independent of the state of

the world (i.e. w. =
                 is      w.)

of a professional soldier with a guaranteed wage. His utility from the same

amount of earnings will depend upon whether he is healthy or injured, a combat

hero or an uriknown.--' His distinction and level of health
                                                                          depend, of course,
on the (unknown) state of the world.

       For the sake of simplicity we restrict the analysis to comparisons between

a risky occupation and a nonrisky one. Furthermore we deal only with extreme

(and unrealistic) situations in which the variance is located at only one type

of return, and deal separately with the case of uncertain monetary returns and

uncertain nonmorietary ones. We assume that risk aversion is predominant.

       Consider, first, the case in which only monetary returns in say job i

are uncertain and let there be another job, say j          ,   in   which returns (both

monetary and nonmonetary) are certain. As before let us define a compensating

wage differential q.. , which would iuake       the two   jobs equivalent. The appro-

priate compensation is   defined   by:

(We use        on top of   variable to indicate randomness)

          We first examine the effect of an increase in nonhuman wealth on the reauired

compensation. There are now two forces at work. One is the presumed normality

of pleasant work activities, the second is decreasing absolute risk aversion.

Combining these two aspects we have the following proposition.it"

Proposition 3     If n is a normal good, and if absolute risk aversion for

monetary returns is decreasing (— (--—u) < 0) then n1 > n implies that

q.

       A special case is in which the two occupations are equally pleasant n1                     fl,.


It is then seen that increase in nonhuman wealth increases the propensity to

choose the more risky (in the monetary sense) occupation. Since n. = n.                    also

implies that the risky job pays a higher expected wage we get an empirical impli-

cation which is in sharp contrast to the results of the previous section. As

nonhuman wealth increases the (expected) monetary returns from human capital tend

to increase.

       The above special case should serve as a sufficient warning against the

merging of variability in return with other undesirable attributes. While there

is similarity in that both command a compensating wage differential, there is a

difference in the direction of the income effect. It is well known for instance

that the government and educational institutions pay lower salaries (for the same

level of schooling) than private industry. If one interprets this differa-ice

mainly as a (negative) compensation for the presumably more pleasant academic

life, then one   would expect that wealthy ir1i ,iduals would be more likely to accept
jobs in universities nr    in     the gov.ernment and to       forego   the monetary advantage
                                         -12-




associated with private industry. (see Freeman 17, p. 4]). On the other hand

it is also known that private industry is more risky in its monetary returns

(see Weiss 122]). If one interprets the observed higher mean earning in private

industry mainly as compensation for risk, then one would predict that the

relatively wealthy be more likely to take on jobs in private industry. clearly,

taking into account both possibilities leads to the conclusion that the effect

of family wealth on such choices is not easily predictable.

       The notion that more wealthy individuals are, other things being equal,

more inclined to prefer risky work activities is, at first glance, in variance

with casual experience. Is it not the case, for instance, that more wealthy

individuals are less inclined to become professional soldiers, policemen, firemen,

mine workers, etc. than poor individuals with comparable ability and skills?

Here is where our distinction between monetary and normonetary risks comes in.

If risk is concentrated in the nonmonetary aspects of a job then under fairly

plausible conditions increase in nonhuman wealth will diminish the propensity to

choose it.

       Consider, then, a case, in which only the nonmonetary returns of job       i


are uncertain. While, as before, the monetary and nonmonetary returns of the

alternative job j are certain.

       Let us define q.      along the same lines as before. Let n be the
                       1_i                                        1

certainty equivalent level of nonmonetary returns in job i .   That   is,

                1   1            1   1


We shall say that job i is(locally)more pleasant than j if n >        n. .   It

is now possible to prove the following proposition.-'
                                                    l3-


 Proposition 4      If n is a normal good and if the aversion to nonmonetary risks

 is nondecreasing with A(i.e.                                  then n < n. implies             qi.
                                            (   -     >   0)
                                                                                                        < 0.


          In other words, wealthier individuals will require a lower wage compensation

 in order to switch to the less risky and more pleasant job.

          As seen proposition 4 depends on the nature of risk dependence (see Keeny

 [8]). The assumption made is that increase in monetary wealth reduces the propen-

 sity to take nonmonetary bets of a given size. For instance a wealthy individual

with higher consumption potential will be more averse to uncertainty of future

health, the reason being, essentially, that more is put at stake. In some cases,

of course, risk independence is more reasonable.               Teaching for instance involves

uncertain nonmonetary returns in terms of respect of students and the like but the

variance in the utility of income in teaching is not likely to depend upon the level

of income. Note that the direction of risk dependence, i.e., the sign of—

( -   —)     is invariant under the choice of index for nonmonetary returns.—

          The apparent puzzle is thus resolved upon noting two different meanings of

Uriskinestt In comon usuage risk is most frequently associated with the danger

of injury, rather than with earning variability. As we have just seen such

occupations are likely to be inferior goods. Casual evidence seems to be consis-

tent with this result)i"

          The analysis may be extended to cover the effects of changes in human

capital. Let the monetary returns of some job, say i                  ,    be uncertain, and compare
it with another job, say j ,        with   certain returns. Suppose again that changes in

human capital are equated with a uniform equi-proportional increase in earning

capacity in all occupations and all states of the world. The effects of such an

increase depend on the behavior of the parti'i dgree of risk aversion (see

Menezes   and 1!ans3ii [14J and   I)i;irnond and tigJi    tz 16]) .       Tf   we accept   L1e second

postulate of Arrow [1, Ch. 3] namely increasing relative risk aversion then partial

risk aversion will also increase. If the two occupations are equally pleasant
    an
then/increase in human capital will induce a shift towards the unrisky occupation.

If the two occupations are not equally pleasant then it is necessary to combine

attitudes towards risk with attitudes towards monetary and nonmonetary returns.

The following proposition can be derived)-"

Proposition 5.   If the partial degree of risk aversion towards monetary returns
                        wu
is increasing       (        ) > 0 for     w ÷ A) and if the income effect is

dominant for choices under certainty, then n. < n. implies         < 0. That is if

the unrisky occupation is also more pleasant individuals with high earning capacity

will be more inclined to choose it.

       Notice that for the special case n. = n•    there is a contrast between the
                                         1     3

effect of human and nonhuman capital. While inherited family wealth increases

the propensity to choose the risky (and on the average high paying) occupation,

native abilities or acquired human wealth diminishes it. This reflects •the built-

in assumption that increase in human capital increases the variance of earnings

while increase in A does not.

      An interesting empirical question is whether individuals do in fact obey

the two Arrow postulates. Decreasing absolute risk aversion and increasing

relative risk aversion are after all empirical hypotheses which may be falsified.

In the case of portfolio choice casual observation and empirical evidence are

consistent with the above postulates. In the case of occupational choice it is

difficult to eliminate the nonmonetary effects which as we have seen influence

the nature of the testable implications of the two hypothesis. Casual evidence

is therefore not so closely at hand.-_V Some attention should also be given to

interdependences of individual utilisies in the context of risk bearing. While
                                              —15—




    each person in isolation may be risk averse, the desire to p.rove oneself as a

    superior individual may lead to a behavior which would appear to imply risk

    preference.


                          Multiple Job Holdings and Divisible Careers

           The analysis so far assumed that during the period under discussion the

    individual specializes in one job. For most purposes this is a reasonable assump-

    tion. The cause for specialization lies in the accumulation of specific work

    experience which imposes high (and increasing with age) costs on occupational

    mobility (see Weiss [23]. However, both in the short run, and in a lifetime context

    individuals may combine work activities. A nurse may divide a period between day

    shifts and night shifts, a sailor may divide a lifetime between work on sea and

    some other occupation on the shore; similar cases would include professional

    pilots, athletes or soldiers. Finally a physician may divide his life between

    salaried and independent employment.

          At the price of some gross oversimplifications-' such career and lob

    patterns may be analyzed within a one-period model. Suppose that only two jobs

    are considered, and that the amount of leisure is fixed. We may define job 1

    as being more pleasant than 2 if t1 =                              >
                                               t2    implies that
                                                                           2   that is,

    if, when time is equally divided between the two jobs, then a transfer of a unit

    of time from job 2 to 1 will increase utility. Given the same demand conditions

    it follows from this definition that in market equilibrium
                                                                    w1 < w2
           The comparative static analysis may now be carried out in terms of
                                                                                   t1

    and t2 the proportions of the period spent at jobs 1 and 2 respectively. The

    results are essentially the same as in the previous sections and will not be

    repeated here.---' There is however one new aspect of the analysis which is of a

S   considerable   empirical importance which 1 wish to point out.
                                          —16—



       Due to a negative income effect the short run supply of labor into

unpleasant work activities is likely to be wage inelastic and in extreme cases

even backward bending. An increase in the pay for night shifts for, say, nurses

who are free to choose the desired combination of day and night shifts may

encourage them to increase the share of       shifts. To take another example,

it has been noted that despite very substantial rates of returns for maritime

schooling, the number of applicants is low and decreasing." Furthermore wage

hikes tend to shorten the proportion of life spent at sea. In such circumstances

employers may find it cheaper to invest in improved working conditions instead of

wage hikes. In the case of sailors, for instance, money is spent in an attempt

to facilitate the joining of wife and children to shorten the duration of trips,

and to lengthen the periods on shore.


                                  Cônc lus ions


       The analysis of this paper suggests that unpleasant and pleasant jobs may

be classified according to two related criteria: (1) Higher wage is paid (in

equilibrium) for unpleasant work (2) The supply elasticity with respect to wealth

is negative for unpleasant jobs. More generally it is suggested that it is possible

to identify a fairly stable pattern of income (wealth) elasticities for occupations.

The estimation of these elasticities should prove useful for prediction purposes.

1.   That increase in wealth is likely to induce a shift towards

     pleasant low—paying work activities had been noted by Reder [17],

     Rapping [18], Freeman [71 and Rosen [16]. Analysis of the income

     effect on the choice of career under uncertainty is contained in

     King [9] and in Diamond and Stiglitz [6]. None of the above references,

     however, attempt to combine attitudes towards noumonetary advantages

     with attitudes towards risk.

     Clearly such alternations have no effect in the results. The

     definition in the text is preferred since it makes explicit the fact

     that the individual takes wages as data.

     The proof can be established geometrically in an (n, x) space, noting

     that due to normality the vertical distance between successive indif-

     ference curves is increasing with x.

     formed one by V(X,fl). By assumption i                            = h(n)   with ht (n) > 0. Since

     u( )   is   unique up to a positive monotone transformation we must have

      that n(t.) < 0                     ,

10. The following example may be instructive.

     Let u(x,n) = xn                 .




     Suppose that in the absence of any restdction n =           t.                           1m1          2

     + (     a.t.)/(l—tm) so that when the individual can work in only one job

      n.a.1/2t , n= -.t<O and n= —1<0.
      By definition job i is more pleasant than j if a > a.                .    Note

      that in this example pleasant work activities are normal, a. > a.

      and n.(t) =       n.(t.)     imply that t   >   t.   and thus n(t.) <           n'.(t.).
      For a suitable choice of the parameters it can be shown that upon

      switching to the pleasant work activity the individual is going to

      work more hours. For instance, let a1 =                ,        =               =
                                                                 a2            , w1
      and w2 = 8.       It is easy to verify that at A = 1           the individual is

      indifferent between the two jobs. The optimal levels of t1                 and      t2
      are   then    and          respectively. At lower levels of wealth the

      individual attains a higher level of utility at job 2, and the reverse

      is true for levels of wealth above 1. The specific solutions for

      q1. and      t,   t as functions of A are given in the graph below

11.   Secular increase in the variance of real wages across occupations and

      industries is reported by Becker [4, p. 54n] and Lewis [11, Table 29—3].

      These results are consistent with our hypothesis. There are, however,

      alternative explanations. See, for instance, Becker [4, pp. 52—54].

      Note also, that if the pleasant jobs require high skills and thus pay
                                         —21—



      more, our hypothesis implies a reduction in the variance in real wages.

      This was noted by Reder [17, p. 2671. It is thus c[ear that an appro-

      priate test of the hypothesis requires that the level of skill is held

      constant. The 1950, 1960, 1970 U.S. Census data on earnings by schooling

      and occupation (occupational characteristics) provide some illustrative

      examples. For instance, plumbers', and brick masons' median annual

      earnings exceed that of an average participant with a comparable median

      years of schoolings. Over the period 1950-1970 these differences tend

      to increase in real terms.        In the case of brick-masons the increase in

      relative pay is associated with decrease in employment indicating a supply

      shift. In the case of plumbers there is some increase in employment.

12.   It is worth noting that in both the over-time and cross-section discussion

      the effect of the distribution of income on the supply and demand for labor

      in the various occupations should be incorporated. It is argued by Robinson

      [19] and Stigler [21, p. 6] that a more equal distribution of income will,

      ceteris paribus, reduce both the supply and demand for domestic servants.

13. A similar distinction is a familiar one in the literature on the economics

      of health. See Arrow [2]. Note, however, that in the framework of

      occupational choice health becomes a partially controlled variable. In

      this case 'health dependance' does not imply '       state   dependance'.

14. The proof follows in the lines suggestad by Pratt [16]. Using condition

      (7) in the text we obtain

      Furthermore, under normality we have

      It   is therefore sufficient to show that

      Due to the assumption of decreasing bsolute. risk aversion v'[v'(t)]

      is a convex function of           t .    It follows that
             E {u(A+., n.) —        u(A+w,         ii.) = E   v'[v(t)]} -   v'[v(E{t})]   > 0

15.   As before we define               by

             E {u(A+w., ii)} u(A+w.+q.,             flj)


      where n.1 is now random and all other variables are known with

      certainty. We thus have

                     E                         —u                 n.)

              dA -
                         U(A+w+1j nj)
      using the definition of n in (8',                    and the assumptions that n <
      and that n is normal we obtain

             ux(A+w., n) -
                  1   1
                                u

                                                    j      < 0.


      It   is therefore sufficient to show that

            ux(A+w., n)

    so that n. v(t) . Also by definition n =                            v'[E   t}].

    Therefore

16. Let u(x, n) be the original utility function and let v(x, ii)                      be   the

    transformed one where n =            h(n) with h'(n) >          0   .   Under the expected

    utility hypothesis u(x, n) is unique up to a linear transforms so that

    v(x, h(n)) E   F[u(x, n)] with F'(u) >                  0 and F"(u) = 0

    We thus have

          F'(u)u =
                       vh'(n)
    and

          F'(u)u    = v__ [h'(n)]2 + vh"(n)

17. Again the 1950, 1960, 1970 U.S. Census data on earnings by occupation

    and level of schooling provides some illustrative examples. Firemen's

    Policemen's and Blaster's and powdermen's median annual earnings exceed

    that of the average participant with a comparable median years of schooling.

    Over the period 1950—70 these differences have increased, in real terms,

    considerably. It is worth noting that firemen and policemen report a

    higher than average number of hours per year. If one adjust to this,

    perhaps nominal, difference then policemen and firemen are paid less than

    the average employee. The trend of increase in relative pay is, however,

    uneffected by this adjustment. Again one must bear in mind the increase in

    employment which occurred in these occupations.

18. Let q.. be defined by the following equality

         E{u(A+H, n)} = u(A+Hw?+q.., n)

    where w, which is random, and w denote the earning capacity of an

       w u (A+Hw, n)< w u (A+Hw +                            n.)



It is therefore sufficient to show that

       if   (v1(t)-.A) v'(v1(t) ]        is   concave in t.



By taking the derivative with respect to t it is immediately seen

19. A first systematic test was attempted by King (9] who reports a

    significant positive correlation between family income and the

    propensity to choose occupations with high earnings variability.

    However, King's study ignores the "noise" which is introduced by

    nonmonetary returns.


20. In particular we ignore issues associated with the ordering in

    time of the various phases of an individual career. Clearly

    in a world with a positive interest and learning by doing the

    ordering in time "matters" (see Weiss [23]).

21. We shall sketch the proof            for the analogues of propositions 1

    and 3.

    Consider first the case of certainty. We assume that job 1 is

    more pleasant and that w2 >
                                          w1.

    The individual's maximization problem is of the

           max              =   u(A + w2 + (w1—w2) t1, n(t1, 1 — t1)]
                    V(t1)
              tl

              interior optimum V'(t1) = 0
                                                 and v"(t)< 0.   We wish to show that

    —         > 0. It is sufficient to show that — = u (w -

    Consider next, the case in which w1 is random. We assume that

    at the optimum t1 is locally more pleasant, that is >

    Furthermore, the term in the square brackets on the R.H.S. is

    first negative and then positive. Using the first order condi-
                           u
    tion and the fact thatU — is monotone increasing (due to
                                           x
    the assumption of decreasing absolute risk aversion) the R.H.S.

    is seen to be positive.


22. A study on the ratesof return for investment in maritime schooling

    in Israel [15] estimates the private rate of return at about 25

    per cent. The study by Rapping (18] on the earnings of seamen

     in the U.S. indicates a trend of an increase in their relative

    pay.
