Affirmative Action and Stereotypes in Higher Education Admissions

                                             ABSTRACT

We analyze how admission policies affect stereotypes against students from disadvantaged groups.
Many critics of affirmative action argue that lower admission standards cause such stereotypes and
suggest group-blind admissions as a remedy. We show that when stereotypes result from social inequality,
they can persist under group-blind admissions. In such cases, eliminating stereotypes perversely requires
a higher admission standard for disadvantaged students. If a school seeks both to treat students equally
and limit stereotypes, the optimal admission policy would still impose a higher standard on disadvantaged
students. A third goal, such as equal representation, is required to justify group-blind admissions. Even
when there is such a third goal, group-blind admissions are optimal only when the conflicting goals
of equal representation and limiting stereotypes exactly balance. This is an implausible justification
for group-blind admission because it implies that some schools desire higher standards for disadvantaged
students. Schools that do not desire such higher standards will typically find some amount of affirmative
action to be optimal.

       “I not only question the principle upon which racial a¢ rmative action is based; I even
question its e¤ ectiveness in achieving the desired goal of advancing a particular race. . . .
When one reads the Bakke case, the most striking factual data is the enormous divergence
in the average college grades and average test scores of the regular admittees and the special
(minority) admittees of the Davis Medical School for the years Bakke was rejected. . . .
To put the issue to you in its starkest form: If you must select your brain surgeon from
among recent graduates of Davis Medical School and have nothing to go on but their names
and pictures, would you not be well advised-playing the odds-to eliminate all minority group
members?”

       Professor Antonin Scalia,1 The Disease as Cure (1979)

       Most critics of a¢ rmative action argue that it is discriminatory. Many also argue that
a¢ rmative action harms its intended bene…ciaries. For Justice Scalia and other critics,
one reason that a¢ rmative action is harmful is because it results in the stereotype that its
bene…ciaries are less quali…ed or able than others.2
       In this paper, we analyze how admission policies a¤ect stereotypes through statistical
discrimination against students from disadvantaged groups. Contrary to what some critics
of a¢ rmative action suggest, a concern for the e¤ects of stereotypes does not imply that
a school should adopt group-blind admissions. We show that when stereotypes are a re-
sult of social disadvantage, they can persist even if schools adopt group-blind admissions.
Eliminating stereotypes requires a school to adopt higher admissions standards for students
from disadvantaged groups in such cases. Such a perverse double standard is clearly un-
acceptable. If stereotyping is a concern, the appropriate question to ask is not whether it
can be eliminated, but how much an admission policy should target stereotypes relative to
pursuing other goals.
       We present a simple model to illustrate the relationship between admission policies and
stereotypes. A school chooses to admit students from an advantaged and a disadvantaged
group based on a score which may aggregate various measures of academic (and possibly
nonacademic) accomplishment or aptitude. The disadvantaged group has a lower average
score than the advantaged group.3 We de…ne a negative stereotype as statistical discrimi-
nation (Arrow (1972), Phelps (1972), Coate and Loury (1993)) against the disadvantaged
   1
     Justice Scalia was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1986.
   2
     In response to this view, a large literature in social science attempts to measure whether a¢ rmative
action programs have an e¤ect on the perceived competence of bene…ciaries (Heilman et al (1992 and
1997), Nye (1998), Evans (2003)). A related literature examines whether stereotypes directly a¤ect student
performance (Steele (1997), Steele and Aronson (1998), Fischer and Massey (2006)), which would compound
the injury.
   3
     In particular, we assume that the distributions of scores for individuals from these groups satisfy the
monotone likelihood ratio property. This implies that the distribution of scores for individuals from the
advantaged group …rst-order stochastically dominates the distribution from the disadvantaged group. This


                                                     2
group on the basis of this score. This de…nition is consistent with how test scores and other
measures of academic performance are used in many discussions of a¢ rmative action. It
clearly informs Professor Scalia’s (1979) well-known observations on the Bakke case. A¢ r-
mative action skeptics continue to focus on grade and test-score di¤erentials. For example,
in his concurring opinion in Fisher v. Texas (2013), Justice Thomas criticizes the e¤ects of
a¢ rmative action by pointing out that among students admitted outside of the University
of Texas’s Top Ten Percent Plan, “Blacks had a mean GPA of 2.57 and a mean SAT score
of 1524; Hispanics had a mean GPA of 2.83 and a mean SAT score of 1794; whites had a
mean GPA of 3.04 and a mean SAT score of 1914; and Asians had a mean GPA of 3.07
and a mean SAT score of 1991.”4
    We …rst demonstrate that negative stereotypes can persist even under group-blind ad-
missions. For example, if all students above a given score are admitted, there may be few
disadvantaged students with very high scores and many with scores just above the admis-
sions cuto¤. As a result, admitted students from the disadvantaged group may still have a
lower average score than other admitted students. We show that a negative stereotype will
exist under any group-blind admission policy if the distributions of scores for the groups
satisfy the monotone likelihood ratio property. To illustrate the plausibility of this prop-
erty, we show that it holds in a representative sample of ACT scores of high school students
who self identify as “black”and “white.”5 As a result, racial stereotypes would continue to
exist under any race-blind admission policies based on the ACT or similar tests.
    Perversely, eliminating a negative stereotype requires actively discriminating against
disadvantaged students. We show that to eliminate stereotypes a school must make it
more di¢ cult for disadvantaged students to gain admission than for advantaged students.
This causes the percentage of admitted students who are disadvantaged to be even lower
than the percentage under group-blind admissions. The greater the inequality between
the two groups, the greater the admission penalty that must be imposed on disadvantaged
students to eliminate any stereotype. Using ACT data, we show that eliminating the racial
stereotype through admission policy would require a substantial penalty on black students
and greatly reduce their representation.
    An admission policy that would eliminate stereotypes is, admittedly, extreme. We
therefore ask if other goals in admissions change this extreme result. We show that if a
school is willing to consider tradeo¤s between equal treatment and combating stereotypes,
assumption re‡ects the view that deeper social forces give rise to the inequality between the two groups.
For example, a student from a disadvantaged group will have fewer opportunities to acquire many of the
characteristics valued by schools in admissions.
   4
     These …gures are the SAT scores and freshman-year GPAs for freshmen who entered the University of
Texas at Austin in 2009.
   5
     The ACT does not entirely determine any school’s admission policy, but tests like the SAT and ACT do
play a substantial role in admissions for many selective colleges (Krueger, Rothstein, and Turner (2006)).



                                                    3
it is still optimal to set a higher admission standard for disadvantaged students. We de…ne
equal treatment as the desire to treat all applicants the same, regardless of group status,6
and consider the choice of admission policy by a school with preferences over both equal
treatment and limiting stereotypes. When both these ends are valued with diminishing
margins, it is never optimal to choose a group-blind admission policy.7
       In fact it requires a third goal, such as equal representation, to justify group-blind
admissions. We de…ne equal representation as the desire for the demographics of admitted
students to re‡ect those of the broader population and consider the choice of admission
policy by a school with preferences over equal treatment, combating stereotypes, and equal
representation. We show that group-blind admissions are optimal only when concerns over
equal representation and reducing stereotypes exactly balance. Because this is a knife-edge
case, it is an implausible justi…cation for group-blind admissions. Given any heterogeneity
among schools, if some schools are in perfect balance, this implies that other schools should
actually desire higher standards for disadvantaged students. No school, however, would
support such a discriminatory double standard. Therefore, some amount of a¢ rmative
action is typically optimal (except in boundary cases) if a school values all three of these
goals with diminishing margins.
       We conclude that harm from stereotypes, as we have de…ned them, contributes little to
the case for group-blind admissions. Many critics of a¢ rmative action who are concerned
with the e¤ects of stereotyping advocate group-blind admissions in all circumstances. Ac-
cording to our analysis, this view is best described by a lexicographic preference for equal
treatment. Such preferences are actually suggested implicitly by Justice Thomas in his
concurring opinion in Fisher v. Texas, when he states that “for constitutional purposes”it
does not matter whether the e¤ects of a¢ rmative action are “insidious” or “benign.”
       Our conclusions follow when stereotypes are based on di¤erences in the distributions
of characteristics in two admitted-student populations, and do not necessarily apply to all
forms of stereotyping. In particular, our conclusions do not apply to “stereotypes” that
only exist in the presence of a¢ rmative action. For example, if a negative stereotype is
de…ned as the probability that a student is admitted because of a¢ rmative action, then
ending a¢ rmative action would eliminate the stereotype.
       The e¤ect of admission standards on group stereotypes is one of many concerns in
formulating an admission policy. A¢ rmative action will not limit such stereotypes to the
same extent as group-blind admissions. However, when stereotypes result from disadvantage
they are a likely feature of any admission policy, except perverse ones that discriminate
   6
    This formal or procedural de…nition tracks the way equality is described by critics of a¢ rmative action.
   7
    Throughout, we make the distinction between (i) a preference for equal treatment in admissions that
may exist alongside other preferences, and (ii) the choice of a group-blind admission policy. We try to be
clear in the text when we are referring to a preference or a choice.

against the disadvantaged.        If stereotypes against the disadvantaged constitute a harm,
the issue for admission policy is not whether it can eliminate stereotypes, but how much it
should seek to a¤ect them relative to pursuing other goals.
     This paper contributes to the literature analyzing a¢ rmative action and statistical dis-
crimination (Fang and Moro (2011)). It is closely related to Coate and Loury (1993), who
explain how racial stereotypes can be self-ful…lling as a result of the strategic interaction
between workers and …rms. Unlike Coate and Loury (1993), we focus on the decision prob-
lem of a school and ignore the e¤ort choice of students so as to consider di¤erent values in
admissions. It is also related to Chan and Eyster (2003), who analyze optimal admission
policies when schools value racial diversity and student quality, but are constrained from
explicitly using race. Other papers analyzing optimal admissions under similar constraints
include Fryer, Loury, and Yuret (2008), Chan and Eyster (2009), and Ray and Sethi (2010).
Section I describes the relationship between admission policy and stereotypes. Section II de-
scribes admission policy when schools also value equal treatment and equal representation.
Section III discusses how our de…nition of stereotype is related to other de…nitions.


I     Admission Policy and Stereotypes
A     A Simple Model of Admissions
      Consider a single school that accepts students under competitive admission. The ad-
mission pool consists of advantaged (A) and disadvantaged (D) groups of applicants, where
 A   and   D   represent the fraction of each group in the pool (   A+ D    = 1). The scores for an
individual from each group are random variables sA and sD distributed on [s; s] according
to FA (s) and FD (s) with associated probability density functions fA (s) and fD (s). We …rst
consider admission policies that take the form of a cuto¤ score (cA and cD ) for each group
so that students with scores above the cuto¤ for their group gain admission. We then
consider more general admission policies.
     We assume that the distribution of scores for D is worse, in a statistical sense, than
                                                                                    fD (s)
the distribution for A. In particular, we assume that the likelihood ratio          fA (s)   is weakly
decreasing in s. The monotone likelihood ratio property implies that the the distribution
FA (s) …rst-order stochastically dominates the distribution FD (s) (FA (s)         FD (s) 8s). Un-
der …rst-order stochastic dominance, any rational decision maker who prefers higher scores
would choose a student from A over D if they knew only the student’s group.                    It also
implies that the mean score for D is lower than A (      D   <   A ).   This property motivates our
de…nition of a negative stereotype.

De…nition 1 A group D experiences a negative stereotype in relation to A if FA (s)


                                                 5
FD (s) 8s.

    Group-blind admissions will not eliminate the negative stereotype experienced by D.
Suppose that the school wishes to accept students so that it achieves the highest average test
score subject to the constraint that it can only accept a …xed proportion (K) of applicants.
The admission problem can be formulated as:


                                    Z   s                         Z    s
                         1
                  max      [   D            sfD (s)ds +       A            sfA (s)ds] subject to
                  cD ;cA K           cD                            cA

                          D    (1       FD (cD )) +       A       (1       FA (cA )) = K

The optimal admission policy that solves this problem is group blind. It takes the form of
a common cuto¤ score cD = cA = c where c is determined by:

                          D    (1       FD (c )) +        A       (1       FA (c )) = K

This policy does not eliminate the negative stereotype against admitted students from D.
The likelihood ratio among admitted students is:

                                      fD (s)
                                    1 FD (c )       fD (s) 1               FA (c )
                                      fA (s)
                                                =
                                                    fA (s) 1               FD (c )
                                    1 FA (c )

By assumption, this ratio is weakly decreasing in s. Therefore, the distribution of scores for
admitted students from A continues to …rst-order stochastically dominate the distribution
for admitted students from D. The mean score of admitted students from A is also higher
than the mean score of admitted students from D.
    In fact, admitted students from D will experience a negative stereotype under any
group-blind admission policy. Suppose that an admission policy consists of (i) a set of
student characteristics, (ii) a score for each student based on these characteristics, and (iii)
a probability of admission for each student based on this score. Such a policy is group blind
if the student characteristics, score, and probability of admission do not vary by group.

De…nition 2 An admission policy is given by [X; s(x); qA (s); qD (s)] where: (i) X denotes
the set of student characteristics that are relevant for admission apart from membership in
D or A, (ii) s(x) : X ! < assigns a score to each student, and (iii) qA (s) : < ! [0; 1] and
qD (s) : < ! [0; 1] assign a probability of admission for each score to types A and D.

De…nition 3 An admission policy is group blind with respect to D and A if qA (s) = qD (s)
for all s.

                                                      6
    It follows that group-blind admission policies will not eliminate negative stereotypes.

                                               fD (s)
Proposition 1 If the likelihood ratio          fA (s)   is weakly decreasing in s then, under any group-
blind admission policy, admitted students from D experience a negative stereotype relative
to admitted students from A .
Proof. The likelihood ratio among admitted students is given by:

                           R qD (s) fD (s)         R
                             qD (u) fD (u)du         q (u) fA (u)du        fD (s)
                                               =   R A
                           R qA (s) fA (s)           qD (u) fD (u)du       fA (s)
                             qA (u) fA (u)du

          qD (s)
because   qA (s)   = 1 under group-blind admissions. By the monotone likelihood ratio property,
this expression is strictly decreasing in s.

    Under the monotone likelihood ratio assumption, group-blind admission policies will
not eliminate negative stereotypes. If negative stereotypes are a cost of a¢ rmative action,
they are also a cost of group-blind admissions.

A.1     An ACT Illustration

      We illustrate the persistence of negative stereotypes under group-blind admissions us-
ing a random sample of ACT scores. We limit our data to students who self-identify as
black or white on the ACT. We choose this example because the use of race in higher-
education admissions is the most debated issue in a¢ rmative action in the United States,
and because tests like the ACT are an important, though by no means exclusive, component
of admissions (Krueger, Rothstein, and Turner (2006)).8 We take no position on whether,
as an empirical matter, (i) such stereotypes are widely held or acted upon, or (ii) admitted
students are harmed by it. Our aim is to demonstrate the persistence of a racial stereotype,
as we have de…ned it, under a simple model of race-blind admissions.
    The unconditional distributions of scores for both groups is depicted below.
   8
     Internationally, it is not uncommon for admission to academic programs to be based on scores from
a single test. For example, admission to the National Law Schools in India is based exclusively on the
Common Law Admission Test. These law schools practice a¢ rmative action on the basis of gender and
caste.




                                                         7
   In our data, black students comprise 17% of test takers and white students comprise the
remaining 83%. White students have a mean score of 21.8, and black students have a mean
score of 17.1, implying a di¤erence in means of 4.7. In terms of percentiles the mean black
score is at the 18th percentile of the white distribution, while the mean white score is at
the 92nd percentile of the black distribution. As seen in …gure below, the two distributions
satisfy the monotone likelihood ratio property. Therefore, the assumptions under which a
negative stereotype exists under any race-blind admission policy are satis…ed for this data.
We suspect they are likely to hold in other cases where a¢ rmative action policies are used.




   We consider a race-blind admission policy in which the school admits the top 60% of
students on the ACT. This implies admitting all students with ACT scores greater than
or equal to 20.   This policy maximizes the expected ACT score of admittees subject to


                                             8
the constraint of admitting 60% of applicants. Under this policy, admitted white students
continue to have a higher average ACT score than black students. This di¤erence in means
is 1.9, which is about 40% of the pre-existing di¤erence (4.7). In terms of percentiles, the
mean score for admitted black students is at the 37th percentile of the distribution for
admitted white students. The mean for admitted white students is at the 88th percentile
for admitted black students. A race-blind policy substantially reduces the percentage of
black admitted students relative to the population of test takers.   Black students would
make up only 5.3% of admitted students, while white students would comprise the remaining
94.6%.




    Black students would continue to su¤er from a negative stereotype, even though admis-
sions are race blind. The distribution of ACT scores for white admitted students …rst-order
stochastically dominates the distribution for black students. Visually this can be seen from
the fact that the likelihood ratio (D=A) among admitted students is decreasing. A¢ rmative
action policies may leave in place negative stereotypes, but ending a¢ rmative action would
not eliminate these stereotypes. Therefore, critics of a¢ rmative action who emphasize the
harm of such stereotypes should be also be concerned with their e¤ects under group-blind
admissions.

B    Eliminating Negative Stereotypes
     If negative stereotypes are harmful to disadvantaged students, what would it take to
eliminate them? We show that eliminating such stereotypes would require making admission
standards higher for disadvantaged students than for advantaged students. This, in turn,
would reduce the representation of disadadvantaged students among admittes to an even
greater extent than a group-blind policy.

                                             9
B.1      Equalizing Mean Scores

       Consider again a simple admission policy that takes the form of a cuto¤ score and
maximizes the expected score of admitted students. A policy that combats stereotypes by
equalizing the mean score of admitted students from D and A solves:


                                      Z   s                      Z   s
                           1
                    max      [    D           sfD (s)ds +   A            sfA (s)ds] subject to
                    cD ;cA K           cD                        cA

                         D   (1       FD (cD )) +     A     (1       FA (cA )) = K and                 (i)
                                      ED [sjs > cD ] = EA [sjs > cA ]                                 (ii)

The optimal policy (cD ; cA ) is determined entirely by the two constraints.                     From our
previous analysis, we know that if cD               cA admitted students from A have a higher mean
score than admittees from D. It follows that cD > cA . Disadvantaged students must clear
a higher threshold in order to gain admission.
       There is a fundamental tension between a commitment to group-blind admissions and
a commitment to eliminating stereotypes. Perversely, eliminating the negative stereotype
against admitted students from D requires not equality, but making it more di¢ cult for
students from D to gain admission. This reduces the representation of admitted students
from D even more than a group-blind policy. If negative stereotypes are indeed harmful,
then an “equal-mean” policy would help admitted students from D, but it would do so by
preventing other disadvantaged students from gaining admission.9
       We illustrate this conclusion using data from the ACT. Below, we depict the optimal,
(approximately) equal-mean policy fcB ; cW g that admits 60% of students.
   9
    An equal-mean policy would also result in a lower expected score for admitted students, relative to a
group-blind policy.




                                                       10
   Black students are required to score above 22 to gain admission whereas white students
are required to score 20. Under this equal-mean policy, black students comprise only 2.8%
of admitted students. This is a 54% reduction in the representation of black students
relative to a race-blind admission policy, for which black students comprise 5.3% of admitted
students. This example illustrates that trying to eliminate stereotypes could dramatically
and adversely a¤ect the admission prospects of disadvantaged students.

B.2    Equalizing Distributions

      Even if an admission policy equalizes the mean scores across admitted students from
A and D, there will still be a larger fraction of students from A with very high scores.
This can be seen by examining the distributions in our ACT example. Admission policies
that assign a probability of admission to a score can completely eliminate stereotypes by
equalizing the distribution of scores across A and D. However, eliminating stereotypes still
requires making it more di¢ cult for many disadvantaged students to gain admission.
   Consider a general admission policy (De…nition 2) that maximizes the expected score
of admitted students, subject to the constraints that a constant proportion K of students
are admitted and that the distribution of scores across admitted students from D and A
are identical. Let   D   and   A       denote the probability of admission for each group, so that:
                                   Z                              Z
                          D    =        qD (s)fD (s)ds;   A   =       qA (s)fA (s)ds

An optimal admission policy solves:

   In contrast to contractual screening, in which a principal wishes to maximize an objec-
tive function while separating types, this admission policy can be thought of as contractual
“shrouding.”The principal wishes to maximize an objective function while preventing third
parties or agents themselves from making inferences about each other’s type.

for appropriately chosen thresholds sL and sH .
Proof. See Appendix

   Eliminating the negative stereotype requires making admission more di¢ cult for ap-
plicants from D with scores in the interval [sL ; sH ].                                    The probability of admission for
applicants from D is positive and increasing over this range, but it is less than the proba-
bility of admission for applicants from A. Applicants from D with scores in the upper range
[sH ; s], however, are admitted with probability one and are more likely to gain admission
than applicants from A. For applicants from A in this range, the probability of admission is
less than 1 and is actually decreasing. Finally, because the threshold sL is below the cuto¤
score under a group-blind policy, some students in both D and A are admitted under the


                                                                12
no-stereotype policy that would not gain admission under a group-blind policy.10
       We again illustrate these conclusions using ACT data, where qB (s) and qW (s) represent
the probability of admission for a black and white student, respectively, with score s.




       Overall, it is more di¢ cult for black applicants to gain admission than white applicants
under a no-stereotype policy. Black students with SAT scores between 19 and 34 have a
lower probability of admission than white students who score in this range. Black students
who score 35 or more have a higher probability of admission than white students, but in
total only 2:9% of black students are accepted, while 71:7% of white students are accepted.
The percentage of black students among admitted students is :8%, while the percentage of
white students is 99:2%. The no-stereotype distribution of scores among admitted students,
which is identical for black and white admittees, is largely attained by matching the black
distribution to the white distribution. This can seen by comparing the distribution of
scores for black and white admittees under a no-stereotype policy to the distribution under
a race-blind policy that admits all students who score over 20.
  10
    If we constrain the probability of admission to be weakly increasing in s, then all students from A above
a threshold s are admitted with probability 1 and students from D with a score s above this threshold are
admitted with probability qD (s) = ffDA (s)

large, then the percentage of students from D is admitted is extremely small.




                                                        13
    It is also more di¢ cult for black students to gain admission under a no-stereotype policy
than a race-blind policy. Black students who score between 20 and 33 on the ACT have
a strictly lower probability of admission, while the probability is unchanged for those who
score above 33. The percentage of black students among admittees (:8%) is lower than the
percentage under a race-blind policy (5:3%) or a policy that equalizes the mean score of
black and white admittees (2:8%).11
    To summarize, negative stereotypes will continue to exist under group-blind admissions
when admission scores satisfy the monotone likelihood ratio property, and this property
holds in ACT data. If admission policies sought to eliminate group stereotypes, it would
have dramatic consequences for students from disadvantaged groups. Disadvantaged stu-
dents would be subject to even more stringent admissions standards than those applied to
advantaged students. As a result, their representation among admitted students would fall
substantially, even relative to group-blind admissions.
    Admission policies are motivated by many values, but it is nevertheless useful to under-
stand the consequences of particular values in isolation. Unlike a concern for stereotyping,
other ethical values that inform higher-education admissions, when considered on their own,
do not imply outcomes that very few persons would support. For example, a commitment
to equal treatment implies that admission standards should be independent of group sta-
tus. A commitment to equal representation may require admission quotas or other steps
to match the characteristics of admitted students with those of the wider population. In
comparison, the desire to eliminate stereotypes does not stand well on its own.
  11
     Relative to a policy that equalizes the mean score of black and white admits, the probability of admission
for black students under a no stereotype policy is higher for scores between 19 and 21, lower between 22
and 33, and equal when 34 and above.




                                                      14
II      Other Values in Admissions
      Eliminating stereotypes through admission policy would adversely a¤ect disadvantaged
students. We next consider how this conclusion changes when admission policies also em-
body other values. We have already shown there is a tension between a commitment to
equal treatment and concern over negative stereotypes. Proposition 3 below states this
precisely. When both these ends are valued, an optimal admission policy would still make
it harder for disadvantaged students to gain admission. It requires a third value, such as
a commitment to equal representation, for group-blind admission to be optimal. However,
group-blind admissions are optimal only in the knife-edge case when the marginal gains
from equal representation exactly o¤set the marginal cost of negative stereotypes. Some
a¢ rmative action is optimal whenever the former e¤ect is larger.

A      Stereotypes and Equal Treatment
      We show that a commitment to both equal treatment and combating stereotypes is
inconsistent with a group-blind admission policy. Suppose that admission policies again
take the form of a cuto¤ score for each group. We assume that a school has a moral
ordering over di¤erent policies that can be represented by the function:12


                              U (cA    cD ; EA [sjs > cA ]       ED [sjs > cD ])

     All else equal, a school prefers a policy with equal cuto¤s cA and cD to one that dif-
ferentiates applicants according to group status.                The school also prefers an admission
policy in which there is a smaller di¤erence in the average scores of admitted students from
each group. We assume that there are diminishing marginal returns to achieving the most
desired outcome of equal cuto¤s and equal means. In particular, we assume that (i) U is
di¤erentiable, strictly concave, and attains its maximum at U (0; 0); and (ii) for any …xed
x, U ( ; x) achieves its maximum at U (0; x) and U (x; ) achieves its maximum at U (x; 0).
The admission problem is then:
  12
     In our previous examples, a school maximizes the expected score of admitted students subject to di¤erent
constraints. None of the following conclusions change if we also allow schools to value a higher expected
score among admitted students. In this case, the utility function would include a third argument:


               A (1   FA (cA ))                                    D (1    FD (cD ))
                                       EA [sjs > cA ] +                                     ED [sjs > cD ]
     A (1   FA (cA )) + D (1 FD (cD ))                    A (1   FA (cA )) + D (1 FD (cD ))




                                                     15
                      max U (cA        cD ; EA [sjs > cA ]     ED [sjs > cD ]) subject to
                     cD ;cA

                                 D   (1    FD (cD )) +     A   (1   FA (cA )) = K

    We further assume that the distribution functions FA (s) and FD (s) are di¤erentiable,
          0
with FA 6= 0 so that we can use the Implicit Function Theorem to …nd a function cA (cD )
that will locally satisfy the constraint. Under these assumptions, the optimal admission
policy would, perversely, make it harder for disadvantaged students to gain admission,
despite the preference for equal treatment.

Proposition 3 For the above preferences, an optimal admission policy will have a higher
admission cuto¤ score for disadvantaged students (cD > cA ).
Proof. Suppose that cA = cD = c . Appealing to the Implicit Function Theorem, we can
de…ne cA (cD ) so that the constraint is satis…ed in an open interval containing c . Observe
that c0A (cD ) < 0 because increasing the cuto¤ for D requires lowering it for A to satisfy the
constraint. The derivative of U with respect to cD can be signed as follows:

                                       dU (cA (cD ) cD ; EA [sjs > cA ] ED [sjs > cD ])
                                                                                         jcD =c =
                                                             dcD
                                              d(EA [sjs > cA (cD )] ED [sjs > cD ])
               0
    U1 (0; +) cA (cD )        1     U2 (0; +)                                       jcA =cD =c
    | {z } |       {z           } + | {z } |                   dcD
                                                                     {z                        } >0
        0         ( )                 ( )                           ( )

Observe that (i) U1 (0; +) = 0 because U ( ; x) is a maximized at 0 for any x; (ii) U2 (0; +) <
0 because U (0; ) is maximized at U (0; 0) and U is strictly concave; and
        d(EA [sjs>cA (cD )] ED [sjs>cD ])
(iii)                  dcD                jcD =c   < 0 because raising cD and lowering cA lowers the
mean di¤ erence in scores by raising ED [sjs > cD ]) and lowering EA [sjs > cA ]. Therefore
cD = cA cannot be an optimum because increasing cD by a small amount, while changing
cA to satisfy the constraint, increases the objective function.
    A similar argument shows that cD                  cA . The sign of the derivative of U with respect to
cD is given by:

                                      dU (cA (cD ) cD ; EA [sjs > cA ] ED [sjs > cD )

                                                d(EA [sjs > cA (cD )] ED [sjs > cD ])

       ( )         ( )                   ( )                         ( )

Observe that (i) U1 (+; +) < 0 because for any given x, U ( ; x) is a maximized at U (0; x)

                                                         16
and U is strictly concave; and (ii) U2 (+; +) < 0 because for any given x, U (x; ) is a
maximized at U (x; 0) and U is strictly concave.
    Therefore cD < cA cannot be an optimum.

    Starting from group-blind admission policy (cD = cA ), increasing the cuto¤ for students
from D and correspondingly lowering it for students from A has two distinct e¤ects. First,
there is a loss from violating equal treatment, but this loss is small (technically, second-
order) starting from an optimum. Second, there is a gain from lowering the mean di¤erence
in scores between the two groups and thereby reducing the stereotype against admitted
students from D. This second e¤ect is …rst-order and dominates, so the school can do
strictly better by increasing cD .       On the other hand, starting from an admission policy
with a¢ rmative action, where cD < cA , increasing the cuto¤ for students from D and
correspondingly lowering it for students from A has two salutary e¤ects: …rst, it decreases
inequality of treatment, and second it decreases the loss from stereotyping.
    The optimal policy would not eliminate stereotyping. At that point, reducing the in-
equality of cuto¤s by a small amount would have …rst-order gains from increased equality
of treatment and only second-order losses from increased stereotyping. Admissions cuto¤s
would be higher for disadvantaged applicants, but not so high as to eliminate stereotyp-
ing. An optimal admission policy in this setting would entail both unequal treatment and
stereotyping.
    These conclusions are closely related to those of the previous section. Admitted stu-
dents from D experience a negative stereotype under group-blind admissions. Therefore, a
school that values both equal treatment and combating stereotypes would increase admis-
sion standards for disadvantaged groups in order to limit stereotyping.13

A.1    Other Preferences Over Equal Treatment and Stereotypes

      There are other ways to describe preferences over equal treatment and stereotypes
that do not imply this result.        In our view, the best way to represent the preferences of
advocates of group-blind admissions is to accord a lexicographic priority to equal treatment.
Admission policies would …rst be ranked in terms of their proximity to a group-blind policy.
If there are any ties on this dimension, they would then be ranked in terms of their e¤ect
on negative stereotypes. Such preferences re‡ect a concern for both equal treatment and
combating stereotypes, but the optimal admission policy under these preferences would be
group blind. Because preferences are revealed through choices, a lexicographic preference
  13
     Note that advocating group-blind admissions is distinct from arguing that, starting from a¢ rmative
action, admission policy should move in the direction of equal treatment. The latter argument is consistent
with the preferences we have described for equal treatment and reducing stigma, but the former is not.
With these preferences, one should move not just toward equal treatment, but past it.


                                                    17
for equal treatment will usually be observationally equivalent to preferences that completely
ignore stereotypes. Therefore combating negative stereotypes should not play an important
role when making the case for group-blind admissions.14
       Are there other preferences over equal treatment and stereotypes that imply group-
blind admissions? The choice of group-blind admissions is a “corner solution”in a decision
problem where the other corner is eliminating stereotypes. We cannot analyze the entire
set of preferences that would produce this outcome, but we can consider other plausible
alternatives.     For example, corner solutions often arise for linear preferences where the
marginal bene…t of increasing equality or reducing stereotypes is constant and does not
depend on the level of equality or stereotype.
       Linear preferences do not adequately explain group-blind admissions. Suppose an op-
portunity arises in which a small change in the equality of treatment can result in a large
change in the stereotype experienced by the disadvantaged group. Lowering the standard
for the advantaged group could result in admitting a large number of students that would
lower the average score for that group.          Under linear preferences, a decision maker may
then switch to a no-stereotype policy. This logic also applies if there are increasing marginal
returns to equalizing treatment and reducing stereotypes.               Therefore, we do not believe
that such preferences adequately rationalize the choice of group-blind admissions.
       Nor are discontinuous preferences, which re‡ect a large, …xed cost of moving away from
group-blind admissions, a plausible alternative. Consider a group of candidates (tier 1)
that a school would strictly prefer to admit on the basis of their scores and a second group
of candidates (tier 2) that the school is indi¤erent between admitting or not. Compare (i)
the decision to favor candidates from D in tier 2 over candidates from A in tier 2 to (ii) the
decision to favor a candidate in D from tier 2 over a candidate in A from tier 1. If there is a
large …xed cost to violating equal treatment, then a decision maker would perceive a greater
ethical violation in moving from a group-blind policy to (i), than in moving from (i) to (ii).
We view this as implausible. Moreover, the existence of a large …xed cost of moving away
from group-blind admissions would be observationally equivalent to advocating group-blind
admissions in all circumstances.
       We conclude that a lexicographic preference for equal treatment best explains the sup-
port for group-blind admissions.         This conclusion also applies to the constitutional view
articulated by Justice Thomas. In his concurring opinion in Fisher v. Texas, Justice
Thomas states that “for constitutional purposes” it does not matter whether the e¤ects
  14
    Group-blind admissions would also be optimal if a school had a constraint (or lexicographic preference)
that disadvantaged groups be treated no worse than advantaged groups in the admission process. This
can be described as an “antisubordination principle.” If a school had, in addition, preferences over equal
treatment and combating stereotypes with diminishing margins, the antisubordination principle would result
in the choice of group-blind admission. We thank David Weisbach for bringing this point to our attention.



                                                    18
of a¢ rmative action are “insidious” or “benign.” In our view, Justice Thomas’s statement
also describes normative arguments for group-blind admissions that do not explicitly rely
on constitutional interpretation.

B       Stereotypes, Equal Treatment, and Equal Representation
        Finally we consider admissions when equal representation is valued in addition to
equal treatment and combating stereotypes. We de…ne equal representation as a desire
for the demographics of admitted students to be similar to the general population. Equal
representation can also be described as a concern for diversity. Other goals of a¢ rmative
action policies, such as remedying past or current discrimination, will usually be satis…ed
by moves toward more equal representation.
       We show that it requires a third value such as equal representation for group-blind
admissions to be optimal. However, group blind admissions are only optimal in the knife-
edge case when preferences over equal representation and stereotypes exactly balance. We
suggest that this perfect balance does not adequately capture the case for group-blind
admission. When all three of these ends are valued, the most plausible conclusion is that
some amount of a¢ rmative action is optimal.
       Consider a school with preferences over equal treatment and combating stereotpes. The
school also prefers more equal representation.15 All else equal, the school would like the
relative proportion of admitted students from groups A and D be as close as possible to
their population proportion. These preferences can be represented by the function:16


                  U (cA     cD ; EA [sjs > cA ]           ED [sjs > cD ]; FD (cD )          FA (cA ))

       We again assume that there are diminishing marginal returns to achieving the most
desired outcome of equal cuto¤s, equal means, and equal representation. In particular, we
assume that (i) U is di¤erentiable, strictly concave, and attains its global maximum at
U (0; 0; 0); and that (ii) for any …xed x and y, U ( ; x; y) is maximized at U (0; x; y), U (x; ; y)
  15
     As in the previous section, our conclusions do not change if we also allow the school to prefer a higher
expected score among admitted students.
  16
     If the ratio of advantaged to disadvantaged students in the population is D   A
                                                                                     , then the ratio among
admitted students is:
                                       A (1 FA (cA ))
                               A (1 FA (cA )+ D (1 FD (cD ))           A   (1   FA (cA ))
                                                                =
                                      D (1 FD (cD ))                   D   (1   FD (cD ))
                               A (1 FA (cA ))+ D (1 FD (cD ))

and the di¤erence between the two ratios is

                                             A       (1    FA (cA ))
                                                 (                         1)
                                             D       (1    FD (cD ))
This di¤erence is zero if and only if the probability of acceptance for both groups is equal.



                                                           19
is maximized at U (x; 0; y), and U (x; y; ) is maximized at U (x; y; 0). Again, we assume that
                                                     0
FA and FD are di¤erentiable and that FA 6= 0 that we can apply the implicit function
theorem.
   The admissions problem is then:



       max U (cA         cD ; EA [sjs > cA ]      ED [sjs > cD ]; FD (cD )       FA (cA )) subject to
       cD ;cA

                              D    (1    FD (cD )) +      A   (1    FA (cA )) = K

Proposition 4 For these preferences, group-blind admissions are optimal only if the mar-
ginal bene…t of reducing stereotype equals the marginal cost of lower representation.
Proof. Suppose that the group-blind policy (cA = cD = c ) that satis…es the constraint is
optimal. Consider e¤ ect of increasing cD and lowering cA according to a function cA (cD )
that satis…es the constraint. Because c is optimal:

        dU (cA (cD )      cD ; EA [sjs > cA ] ED [sjs > cD ]; FD (cD ) FA (cA ))
                                                                                   jcD =c =
                                            dcD
                                d(EA [sjs > cA (cD )] ED [sjs > cD ])
                 U2 (0; +; +)                                          jcA =cD =c
                                                 dc
                 |                              {z D                             } +
                                             M B(+)
                                    d(FD (cD ) FA (cA (cD )))
                      U3 (0; +; +)                             jcA =cD =c
                                                dcD
                      |                        {z                         } =0
                                            M C( )

We know that (i) U2 (0; +; +) < 0 because for any y, U (0; 0; y) maximizes U (0; ; y) and
                                  d(EA [sjs>cA (cD )] ED [sjs>cD ])
U is strictly concave; (ii)                      dcD                jcD =c   < 0 from Proposition 3; (iii)
U3 (0; +; +) < 0 because for any y, U (0; y; 0) maximizes U (0; y; ) and U is strictly concave;
           d(FD (cD ) FA (cA (cD ))
and (iv)             dcD            jcD =c   > 0 because raising cD and lowering cA increases this
di¤ erence by raising FD and lowering FA . Therefore c is an optimum only if the marginal
bene…t of reducing the mean di¤ erence in scores, M B(+), exactly equals the marginal cost
of increasing the di¤ erence in representation, M C( ).

   From Proposition 3, we know that starting from group-blind admissions, the marginal
cost of violating equal treatment by increasing cD a small amount (and correspondingly
lowering cA ) is very small (second-order). Therefore, for a group blind policy to be optimal
the gain from lowering the average di¤erence in test scores must exactly equal the loss from
reducing the representation of disadvantaged students.
   When there are diminishing margins, it requires a third value–such as equal representation–
to rationalize a policy of group-blind admissions.                 Nevertheless, we …nd it unlikely that

                                                         20
such a delicate balancing act explains the advocacy of group-blind admissions. First, few
critics of a¢ rmative action who emphasize the harm to recipients from stereotypes also
voice an equal concern for promoting equal representation through admission policy. Sec-
ond, if many schools found these tradeo¤s to perfectly balance, then given any heterogeneity
among schools, we should expect some to favor further reducing stereotypes and to actually
impose a higher admissions cuto¤ on disadvantaged students. Yet no one takes seriously
the position that admission standards should be higher for disadvantaged students.
           Third, the balance between equal treatment and stereotypes should vary with other
circumstances, such as a school’s quota constraint. For example, suppose group-blind ad-
missions are optimal for a large, less selective school (KL ) that admits all students above
cL . If the schools have similar preferences over equal treatment and stereotypes, then the
choice of group-blind admissions at the large, less selective school should inform the choice
of admission policy for a small, highly selective school (KS < KL ). For the highly selec-
tive school, under group-blind admissions the mean di¤erence in scores between admitted
students from A and D will be lower17 , but the ratio of A to D among admittees will be
higher.18 Relative to the less selective school, the marginal value of increasing D0 s repre-
sentation is higher and the marginal value of reducing D0 s stereotype is lower. Therefore,
some amount of a¢ rmative action should be chosen at the more selective school. By the
same logic, if group-blind admissions are optimal at the more selective school, then the
admission standards should be higher for students from D at the less selective school. Yet
no advocates of group-blind admissions would vary their prescriptions in this way.
           We conclude that it is unlikely that group-blind admissions are explained by equally-
balanced preferences over equal representation and stereotypes. In contrast, some a¢ rma-
tive action is optimal whenever, starting from group-blind admissions, the marginal bene…t
of more equal representation outweighs the marginal cost of greater stereotypes. This will
almost always be the case. Again, if it were not then some schools should advocate higher
      17
           This follows for some KS in our model because:

                                               lim fE[sjs    c]       cg = 0
                                               c!s

Even if s were unbounded, it would be true for some KS as long as:

                                               lim fE[sjs        c]   cg = 0
                                               c!1

This is true, for example, for a normal distribution.

      18
           For any group-blind admission policy with cuto¤ score c, the ratio of A to D among admitted students
is:

                                                 (1 FA (c))
                                                     A
                                                 (1 FD (c))
                                                     D

The monotone likelihood ratio property implies that this ratio is increasing in c.



                                                            21
admission standards for disdvantaged students. Many would agree that equal treatment,
equal representation, and combating stereotypes are worthy goals of admission policy. But
no one would advocate such a perverse double-standard.


III       Other Views of Stereotypes
        We focus on statistical discrimination (Arrow (1972, 1973), Phelps (1972)) to inves-
tigate the e¤ect of admission policy on stereotypes. Our equation of stereotype with sta-
tistical discrimination is consistent with how test scores and other measures of academic
performance are used in many discussions of a¢ rmative action. This is best exempli…ed by
then-Professor Scalia’s (1979) assessment–at the time of the Bakke case–of minority grad-
uates of U.C. Davis medical school on the basis of their GPAs and MCAT scores. Such
comparisons continue to have salience. In his concurring opinion in Fisher v. Texas (2013),
Justice Thomas points out that black and hispanic students admitted outside of the Uni-
versity of Texas’s Top Ten Percent Plan have lower average GPAs and SAT scores than
their white or asian counterparts. Consistent with our results, these di¤erences are similar
for candidates admitted under Texas’s Top Ten Percent program.19 When schools adopt
race-blind admission criteria that are intended to achieve diversity, stereotypes in the form
of average test-score di¤erences will likely still exist.
       Even if the statistical rules that generate stereotypes under group-blind admissions are
not well understood, interested parties would likely make these facts known. For example,
Justice Thomas’s …gures in Fisher come from an amicus brief …led by Richard Sander, a
law professor at UCLA and attorney Stuart Taylor. Sander is well known for his criticism
of a¢ rmative action programs in law schools (Sander (2004)). Di¤erences in test scores
have also been used to measure the extent of a¢ rmative action and “stereotype threat”by
scholars who are broadly supportive of a¢ rmative action. For example, in their widely-cited
study, Fischer and Massey (2007) measure “a¢ rmative action at the institutional level by
taking the di¤erence between the average SAT score earned by blacks or Hispanics and all
students at a particular institution.” The authors use this measure to test for the e¤ect of
stereotypes on a¢ rmative action recipients.
       Finally, the logic of our argument is consistent with any “stereotype”(however de…ned)
that (i) continues to exist under group-blind admissions, and (ii) decreases if admissions
are made more di¢ cult for the disadvantaged group. This includes stereotypes based on
  19
    According to the University of Texas at Austin O¢ ce of Admissions (2010), the average SAT/ACT
scores of entering freshmen admitted under the top 10% program in 2009 by ethnic group were: White
(1864/28), African-American (1584/22), Asian-American (1874/28), and Hispanic (1628/23). For entering
freshmen admitted outside the program, the …gures are: White (1914/29), African-American (1524/20),
Asian-American (1991/30), and Hispanic (1794/27).



                                                 22
false priors about the academic performance of disadvantaged groups. It includes some
accounts of “external stigma”–the perception of a¢ rmative action recipients by others–in
social psychology (Bowen (2010)). It can also include accounts of “internal stigma” such
as “stereotype threat” (Steele and Aronson (1995), (Steele (1997)) if these e¤ects decrease
when admission standards are raised for disadvantaged groups.
       Our conclusions do not follow for stereotypes that only exist in the presence of a¢ r-
mative action. For example, there is evidence that negative inferences against a¢ rmative-
action recipients are mediated by the perceived fairness of the admissions procedure (Heil-
man, McCullough, and Gilbert(1996), Evans (2003)). As another example, suppose that a
negative stereotype is de…ned as the probability that a student is admitted because of a¢ r-
mative action.20 This probability would increase with the extent of a¢ rmative action, but
ending a¢ rmative action would eliminate the stereotype. This de…nition can be thought
of as statistical discrimination, but only on the extensive margin of admissions. While
plausible, this de…nition is incomplete. Admission under a competitive process is valuable
signal only if it provides information concerning some underlying attribute. Therefore, sta-
tistical discrimination should occur on the basis of this attribute in addition to the fact of
admission itself.
       Ultimately, our claim is not that every form of stereotype against a¢ rmative action
recipients would continue to exist under group-blind admissions. Our claim is that many
of them would.


IV        Conclusion
        In this paper, we analyze the use of admission policy to a¤ect stereotypes against
students from disadvantaged groups. Many critics of a¢ rmative action in admissions ar-
gue that lower standards cause such stereotypes. We show that when stereotypes are a
result of social inequality, they can easily persist under group-blind admissions. Perversely,
eliminating stereotypes requires making it harder for disadvantaged students to gain ad-
mission whenever the monotone likelihood ratio property holds for admission scores. Such
an admission policy would increase social inequality and is clearly unacceptable.
       This conclusion does not change if schools seek to both treat students equally and
  20
    This is a reasonable interpretation of Justice Thomas’s statements on the stigma of a¢ rmative action.
In his partial concurrence and dissent in Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), Justice Thomas writes: “When blacks
take positions in the highest places of government, industry, or academia, it is an open question today
whether their skin color played a part in their advancement. The question itself is the stigma–because
either racial discrimination did play a role, in which case the person may be deemed ‘otherwise unquali…ed,’
or it did not, in which case asking the question itself unfairly marks those who would succeed without
discrimination.” Unlike Justice Scalia’s hypothetical of choosing doctors, Justice Thomas’s description of
stigma appears to be motivated by a theory of just deserts. All minority students are viewed as unjustly
enriched through a¢ rmative action, even though some would have been (justly) admitted in its absence.


                                                    23
counteract stereotypes. Under these preferences, an optimal admission policy would still
impose a higher standard on disadvantaged students. Group-blind admissions are optimal,
however, if a school holds an ethically prior, lexicographic preference for equal treatment.
We argue that the best case for group-blind admissions rests on such a preference. Con-
sequently, stereotypes should play a negligible role in critiques of a¢ rmative action that
advocate group-blind admissions.
   If a school is willing to consider tradeo¤s between equal treatment and stereotypes, it re-
quires a third goal such as equal representation to justify group-blind admissions. However,
group-blind admissions are optimal only when the con‡icting goals of equal representation
and limiting stereotypes exactly balance. In our view, this knife edge case is an implausible
justi…cation for group-blind admission. It would again imply a desire on the part of some
schools to have higher standards for disadvantaged students, a possibility which seems un-
likely. Consequently, some amount of a¢ rmative action is almost always optimal if a school
values all three of these goals.

the constraint set is nonempty. In particular, for any choice of                                               D   and   A   that satisfy

characterize the solution. We can substitute for qA (s) using constraint (ii) and rewrite the

The solution function qD (s;                            D)      is weakly increasing in s, and the value function:

is continuous in                   D.


Proof. For any choice of                            D   that satis…es constraints (2) and (4), the objective function is
a continuous function de…ned over the set of functions q (s) that satisfy constraints (1) and
(3), and this set is compact. Therefore, a solution exists and by the maximum theorem,
the value function is continuous in                                        D.      Because the objective function is linear in q (s),
the maximum occurs at a “bang-bang” solution with respect to the constraint set.

Therefore qD (s) = 1, which proves (i). If                                       fD (sH )
                                                                                                       D

                                                                                                       A
then the objective function is ED [sjs > s ], which is strictly decreasing in                                                             D.   This proves
(ii).
     The choice of an optimal, no-stereotype admission policy on the space of functions
(qD (s); qA (s)) is therefore equivalent to a Kuhn-Tucker program in four, real-valued choice
variables (   A;      D ; sL ; sH ):

By the intermediate value theorem, there exist a set of bD in this interval such that

Therefore, this cannot be an optimum and sL > sH . A di¤erent argument is required in the
absence of uniqueness. Consider any b such that s A (b ) = sD (b ) = s . Because both

exists and is strictly negative by the argument above. If (2) holds then the objective function
is equal to ED [sjs                  sD (        D )]   which is strictly decreasing in                        D      in this interval. It follows
that sL > sH .

This proves Proposition 2. We can further say that (sL ; sH ;                          A;   D)   are a (possibly unique)
solution to the …rst-order condition and constraints for the Kuhn-Tucker program:
