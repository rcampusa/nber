The European Central Bank and the Euro: The First Year

JEL No. F33

                                            ABSTRACT

        The creation of the euro and the European Central Bank is a remarkable and unprecedented
event in economic and political history: creating a supranational central bank and leaving eleven
countries without national currencies of their own. The experience of the first year confirms that
“one size fits all” monetary policy is not suitable for Europe because cyclical and inflation conditions
vary substantially among countries. Labor market policies during this first year will increase this
problem in the future and may lead to more trade protectionism. The paper explores reasons why
cyclical unemployment, structural unemployment, and inflation may all be higher in the future as a
result of the single currency. Although some advocate the euro despite its economic problems
because of its assumed favorable effects on European political cohesiveness, the paper argues that
it is more likely to lead to political conflict within Europe and with the Unites States.

        We are meeting today to commemorate the first anniversary of the creation of the euro, a

remarkable and unprecedented event in economic and political history: the creation of a super-

national currency that will, when it is fully implemented two years from now, leave the major

nation’s of Europe without any currencies of their own. Never before has a major country not had

its own currency.

        I say that we are here to commemorate rather than to celebrate this first birthday of the

euro because I believe that the creation of the euro and of the European Economic and Monetary

Union is at best an act of uncertain merit. As I have noted before1 , the euro is likely to have

adverse medium-term and long-term effects on employment and inflation and is likely to be the

source of political conflicts within Europe and between Europe and the United States. If I am

correct, this is certainly not a cause for celebration.

        But whether it is for better or for worse, the introduction of the euro and its survival are

remarkable events. There were many skeptics who thought it could not come into being. But in

the end Germany agreed to abandon its own beloved currency in favor of the unknown euro and

to open the new EMU club to countries that met the tests of membership only by heroic acts of

accounting manipulation.

The First Year Record

        The eleven parents of the newborn child gathered a year ago to admire their offspring and

to predict great things for its future. They declared that it would be a strong new player in the

global economy, reflecting the size of the European market relative to that of the United States.

They warned that the shift of global portfolios to euro assets would depress the value of the

dollar relative to the euro.

        Things have not quite worked out that way. The value of the euro has declined by about

15 percent during the year relative to the dollar and even more relative to the yen. The European

economy remained weak and unemployment remained at more than twice the level in the United

States. The counterproductive tax and social benefit policies, the excessive regulations, and the

anti-business policies of the governments in both France and Germany have contributed to both

of these poor measures of performance. These policies repelled foreign domestic investment

and encouraged European firms to invest outside the euro area; both tendencies depressed the

demand for the euro and therefore its value. Those same policies prevented a decline in

unemployment rates by keeping wage costs uncompetitively high and reducing the incentive for

individuals to seek work or to accept any but the best jobs.

        It nevertheless remains true that this remarkable new and unprecedented currency did

come into being and did survive the first year. Those who projected strength for the euro were

concerned less with economic fundamentals than with political symbols. However the currency

is not the flag and there is no reason to be unhappy that it fell in value, especially since that has

helped to strengthen aggregate demand by increasing Europe’s net exports and has done so

without any obvious increase in overall inflation.


                                                  -2-
       The sharp fall of the euro relative to the dollar and to the yen are a clear reminder,

however, that adoption of the euro did not bring exchange rate stability to European producers

and consumers. While the exchange rate within the euro area is fixed, the exchange rate with

other currencies can vary and may vary even more than it did before the adoption of the euro.

For a German firm that uses oil or other inputs that are priced in dollars, the sharp decline of the

euro has meant an equally sharp increase in the cost of production and a corresponding loss of

competitiveness.

       The survival of the euro occurred despite the antics of Oskar Lafontaine during his brief

tenure as German Finance Minister. Mr. Lafontaine did not seem to understand the notion of an

independent central bank and believed that the European Council of Economic and Finance

Ministers (the ECOFIN) should play an important role in the making of monetary policy. He

clearly believed that a more political monetary policy would mean an easier monetary policy and

assumed that such a policy would lead to lower unemployment. Fortunately, the European

Central Bank (ECB) made it clear that it would act independently and the other leading countries

of the EMU did not follow the German rhetorical line. Even more fortunately, Mr. Lafontaine

burned himself out quickly and vanished, at least temporarily, from the German political scene.

       The European Central Bank is also to be praised for the professional way in which it

managed the initial establishment of the euro in the international markets and the apparent

smoothness of the interbank relations in its first year of operation.

       The ECB was however less successful in communicating the nature of its monetary

policy to a nervous financial system. Unlike the Bundesbank which always spoke in terms of a

target growth rate for its monetary aggregate or the Bank of England with its explicit inflation


                                                 -3-
target, the ECB has adopted a policy in which both money and inflation appear to be the targets

by which monetary policy is guided. The fact that they are referred to as two “pillars” of

monetary policy, rather than as two targets, does not clarify the situation. This seeming violation

of Jan Tinbergen’s first principle of instruments and targets leaves financial markets confused, an

uncertainty that is compounded by the limited information that is revealed about the deliberations

of the ECB and by the occasional tendency for the members of the ECB to speak in contradictory

terms. It is exacerbated also by the apparent lack of agreement about the significance of the

international value of the currency, with some members of the ECB more concerned about that

value per se while others consider it important only to the extent that it influences the domestic

price level. But perhaps these are teething problems of the newborn institution that will soon be

outgrown.

       The one major achievement that can probably be attributed to the creation of the euro is

the expansion of the European commercial bond market. The ability to borrow and lend in euros

and to do so without fear of exchange rate fluctuations between the borrower and the lender has

facilitated substantial cross-border lending within the euro area. Whether this has had significant

effects on the level of real interest rates or on economic production remains to be studied. It has

undoubtedly made it easier to finance cross-border corporate takeovers, a development that has

not generally been welcomed by the governments of the target companies.

       The ECB also succeeded in 1999 in fostering a strengthening of demand that will produce

faster growth of output in the current year. With it may come some increase in inflation, not only

in those countries like Ireland and Spain that are already growing rapidly but also in the core

countries like Germany and Italy.


                                                -4-
       The ECB’s ability to maintain low inflation in the long term will depend on whether its

members can avoid political pressure to overexpand demand. During the past two decades the

countries of Europe have brought down their inflation rates because a failure to do so would have

meant the embarrassment of having to devalue relative to the German mark. That discipline will

no longer be there in the future in a system in which there is no German mark and in which each

country in the EMU has a vote on monetary policy. As I look ahead, I think it is likely that

inflation will rise in Europe and that the increase will be greater because of the euro than it would

otherwise have been.

Not an Appropriate Currency Area

       The experience of the past year has already made it clear that the euro zone is not an

appropriate territory for a currency union, i.e., is not an optimal currency area. In 1999, demand

conditions in Germany and Italy were relatively weak while demand conditions in Spain,

Portugal and Ireland were very strong. The result was a substantial acceleration of inflation in

both Spain and Ireland that threatens their competitiveness and therefore the longer term success

of the industries that have helped them prosper in recent years. Such disparities of demand

conditions will undoubtedly persist in the future because individual countries differ substantially

in industrial composition and in a variety of economic policies that cause their cyclical

conditions to differ.

       As Robert Mundell taught us many years ago, a single currency is appropriate in an area

where labor and product markets are flexible, where labor is mobile among regions within the

area, and where a central fiscal authority automatically provides counterbalancing fiscal transfers.

These conditions are satisfied in the United States but not in Europe. European wages are very


                                                 -5-
inflexible. Labor’s mobility is severely limited by barriers of language and custom even if legal

barriers are no longer present. And there is no significant fiscal transfer to compare to the

roughly 40 percent offset that US taxes and transfers achieve.

       The ECB must make monetary policy for “Europe as a whole” which basically means for

a weighted average of the European economies. This in turn is likely to mean making the

monetary policy that is appropriate for Germany, France and Italy. In 1999 that meant a policy

that was too expansionary for Spain, Portugal and Ireland. The OECD has warned these

countries that they are allowing demand to grow too rapidly. They are now in violation of the

Maastricht principle that the inflation rate of each country must not exceed the average of the

lowest three countries by more than 1.5 percent. But, with no ability to adjust monetary policy,

there was little that they could do other than adopt tight fiscal policies that would have been

politically unpopular and that could have adverse incentive effects.

       In short, “one size fits all” monetary policy is not appropriate for the eleven countries of

the Economic and Monetary Union and it will be even less appropriate as the EMU expands to

include many more countries in the coming years.

Three Counterarguments

       The supporters of the EMU and the single currency often acknowledge these

disadvantages of imposing a single monetary policy on a variety of separate countries but argue

that the result is preferable to the poor monetary policies that would otherwise be adopted by the

smaller countries if left to do so on their own. I do not find this association of small countries

with bad monetary policies at all convincing. Switzerland has had even lower inflation than

Germany during recent decades. Ireland’s monetary and tax policies gave it the strongest rate of


                                                 -6-
real growth in Europe with little inflation. Other small countries like the Netherlands and Austria

chose to tie their currencies to the German mark for many years before the introduction of the

euro while retaining the ability to break that link if external conditions made it advisable. And

not that many years ago the United States followed a monetary policy that allowed our inflation

rate to rise to double digit levels.

        It is also hard to understand why one should believe there is likely to be greater wisdom

about monetary policy in a committee of country representatives than in a system that places

responsibility for domestic inflation with the domestic central bank.

        A further argument of some of the defenders of the single currency is that it will bring

Anglo-American style equity markets to continental Europe, with the resulting benefits of the

increased discipline that results from focusing on shareholder value and on the efficient use of

capital. Such a change in equity markets may well happen in Europe. But there is no reason to

attribute such a change to the adoption of the euro. The Japanese are beginning to move in that

direction for very different reasons. The shift to a system of funded corporate pensions in Europe

in order to cope with the ageing of the population will create a demand for equities that will shift

corporate ownership from the banks to financial markets. More generally, the evidence on the

advantages of a market based equity system of the type seen in the US and the UK, rather than a

system of bank ownership or privately held companies that is characteristic of much of

continental Europe, is a powerful enough force to cause that to happen with our without a single

currency.

        Finally it is argued that EMU is to be praised for its success in reducing fiscal deficits. It

is certainly true that the Maastricht treaty required lower deficits and national debt as a condition


                                                  -7-
for a country’s admission to the Economic and Monetary Union. Some countries achieved this by

accounting tricks and intra-year movements of spending and tax receipts or by treating asset sales

as if they were a real source of revenue for the government. Some countries just failed to come

close to the debt-to-GDP targets but were allowed to overlook there failure to meet the

conditions on the grounds that their debt ratios were moving in the right direction.

       Much of the apparent reduction in the fiscal deficits occurred because interest rates paid

on the national debt came down sharply as inflation expectations improved. This in turn means

that the reductions in the nominal deficits do not imply corresponding reductions in the real

deficits, i.e., in the national debts adjusted for the expected inflation erosion of those debts.

       What matters however is not the extent to which deficits fell in the process of gaining

EMU entry but the effect of the EMU on the size of the future deficits. A very important effect

of the single currency is that a country’s interest rate is no longer a signal of the market’s concern

about the magnitude of that country’s deficits. Although countries can face different interest rates

because of differences in apparent credit worthiness, this market signal will be blurred in practice

by the assumption that the EMU will not let any member country default on its debt. It is the fear

of such fiscal profligacy that caused the members of the EMU to adopt the so-called Stability

Pact that limits the size of a country’s permissible deficit and states that countries will be

penalized financially if they violate these fiscal norms. It remains to be seen whether such

penalties will actually be levied in practice and whether countries will actually borrow less (i.e.,

have smaller budget deficits) when they have a single currency that permits them to borrow

elsewhere in Europe more easily than they could before the beginning of the EMU.




                                                  -8-
Unemployment and Trade Protectionism

        It was lucky for the euro that in its first year the outlier countries were enjoying very

strong growth rather than high cyclical unemployment. But the time will come when the ECB

will set a policy that is too tight for the outlier countries, forcing them to have substantially

higher unemployment rates than they would have chosen if they were free to set their own

monetary policy. Indeed, even without discretionary monetary policies, the interest rates in

countries with weak demand would naturally decline and the external value of their currencies

would also fall, both acting as offsetting stabilizers of the country’s weak demand. But this will

not be possible within the EMU where a single risk-adjusted interest rate and a single exchange

rate prevail.

        I predict that over time the EMU will therefore bring a higher level of cyclical

unemployment than would be possible in a Europe of separate national currencies. Moreover, I

believe that a sustained period of high cyclical unemployment in any country will lead some of

its politicians to turn against their European neighbors for their lack of compassion. I will return

to this problem of political conflict.

        Most of the high unemployment in Europe now is not cyclical but structural, reflecting

bad welfare policies, bad regulations, and high taxes. The ability to solve these problems should

be separate from the monetary arrangement. And yet I suspect that EMU will reduce the

likelihood that countries will solve these structural problems. It will be easier for politicians to

point to the ECB as a powerful force beyond national control that is keeping interest rates too


                                                  -9-
high and thereby maintaining high unemployment. Mr. Lafontaine was not successful when he

tried that line of argument. But there will be others who may be more successful in the future,

especially in countries that lack Germany’s support for low inflation and for an independent

central bank.

       Some of the defenders of the euro have argued that although Europe is not currently an

appropriate zone for a single currency, it will evolve into one as a result of adopting a single

currency. Although that might eventually be true, there is no evidence of it in this first year and

no reason to believe that the future will be better. Certainly there has been no progress in making

labor markets more flexible. Instead we hear more and more about social wages, about 35 hour

maximum work weeks, and about rolling back even the small reductions in social benefits that

had been achieved in Germany by the Kohl government. Worse yet there are attempts attempt to

eliminate differences in labor practices and even differences in wages among the EMU countries.

       The result of all of this will be not only to make Europe less suited to a single currency

but also to exacerbate the structural problems that keep unemployment so high. Moreover, I fear

that these counterproductive policies will reduce the international competitiveness of many

European industries and encourage the adoption of protectionist policies to keep non-European

products out of European markets. If labor standards and environmental regulations become

acceptable subjects for discussion in the context of international trade, it would not be difficult to

imagine Europeans arguing that they should not have to complete with American firms that do

not provide the European-level social benefits to their employees, have longer working hours,

and follow practices that are less friendly to the environment.

       An inward looking Europe that sees itself as more self-contained politically and


                                                -10-
economically could easily move in this direction. The European objection to American

genetically engineered agricultural products and the French unwillingness to import British beef

may be early signs of future protectionism and trade conflicts.



Political Effects and Potential Conflicts

       It is thus hard for even a European to love the euro for its potential economic effects. It is

more understandable to regard the euro as an economically costly device for achieving political

union. Political advocates of the euro may believe that individuals who carry euros in their

pockets will come to think of themselves as Europeans and that this will reduce the risk of a

recurrence of the intra-European wars that have done so much harm during the past century and

half. Perhaps. But I think it is more likely that the attempt to achieve Europe-wide policies will

in itself be a major source of conflict within Europe and with the United States. The existence of

a single currency, and even of a relatively centralized fiscal system, does not guarantee harmony

among the geographic regions, as the experience of the U.S. civil war made clear.

       Forcing a single monetary policy on all of Europe will cause those countries that suffer

what they regard as unnecessarily high unemployment to resent the actions of others. Tax

policies are another potential source of economic conflict. Although tax policies are now left to

national governments, that will not continue indefinitely as attempts at “tax harmonization”

eventually succeed and provide the platform for seeking greater uniformity in tax rates and tax

bases. Attempts to force a Europe-wide tax system on all countries will be a further source of

conflict. To the extent that those taxes are used to redistribute incomes among European

countries, the potential for conflict will be even greater.


                                                 -11-
       The Maastricht treaty that created the Economic and Monetary Union makes no provision

for a country to leave the EMU and return to its own currency. While a country might

nevertheless unilaterally opt to leave, it would risk being denied all of the trade benefits of the

single market and might face other forms of retribution. EMU is meant to be a marriage made in

heaven with no room for divorce.

       One way for European governments to overcome the intra-European conflicts and to

create greater unity within Europe is to have a common adversary. The Soviet Union, which

played that role for the past half century, no longer exists. Today’s Russia is not the threat that

the Soviet Union once was. I worry that the United States will come to be seen as a politically

convenient adversary, an adversary that can be used to permit the European agenda of political

and economic unification to advance despite the tensions that it creates among the countries of

Europe.

       Which brings me back to my initial comment that the successful launch of the euro is

something to be noted but not something to be celebrated.
