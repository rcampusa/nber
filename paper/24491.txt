                                           ABSTRACT

The conventional method for developing health care plan payment systems uses existing data to
study alternative algorithms with the purpose of creating incentives for an efficient and fair health
care system. In this paper, we take a different approach and modify the input data rather than the
algorithm, so that the data used for calibration reflect the desired levels of spending rather than
the observed spending levels typically used for setting health plan payments. We refer to our
proposed method as “intervening on the data.” We first present a general economic model that
incorporates the previously overlooked two-way relationship between health plan payment and
insurer actions. We then demonstrate our approach in two applications in Medicare: an
inefficiency example focused on underprovision of care for individuals with chronic illnesses,
and an unfairness example addressing health care disparities by geographic income levels. We
empirically compare intervening on the data to two other methods commonly used to address
inefficiencies and disparities: adding risk adjustor variables, and introducing constraints on the
risk adjustment coefficients to redirect revenues. Adding risk adjustors, while the most common
policy approach, is the least effective method in our applications. Intervening on the data and
constrained regression are both effective. The “side effects” of these approaches, though
generally positive, vary according to the empirical context. Intervening on the data is an easy-to-
use, intuitive approach for addressing economic efficiency and fairness misallocations in
individual health insurance markets.

1. Introduction


Public and private regulators set prices in health care – to physicians, hospitals, health plans
and other providers – with the purpose of improving economic efficiency of health care
delivery. To implement a payment system, the regulator selects a methodology to establish
prices for each of the thousands of procedures physicians perform, the hundreds of disease
groups treated by hospitals, or per capita prices paid to plans for the nearly innumerable
combinations of enrollees’ health conditions. In many health care settings, prices are set
according to observed costs in the market. In the U.S. Medicare program, a hospital’s payment
for a given inpatient admission is tied to the national average cost of admissions belonging to
the same diagnosis-related group (DRG). In the Medicare Advantage program, the Affordable
Care Act Marketplaces, most state Medicaid programs, and in Germany, the Netherlands,
Switzerland, and other countries, a health plan’s payment for enrolling a given individual is tied
to the average cost of individuals with similar demographics and histories of chronic conditions.
This method for setting prices weakens incentives for inefficient “cream-skimming” behaviors
by insurers (Geruso, Layton and Prinz 2016; Newhouse, et al. 2015).


While acknowledging the benefits of setting prices in this way, this paper explores a previously
overlooked deficiency: when the existing health care system is inefficient or unfair, setting
payments based on observed costs may sustain those inefficiencies or inequities, which may be
precisely the issues the payment system is meant to correct. Consider the following extreme
example: suppose under the current health plan payment system individuals with cancer are
highly unprofitable due to low revenues relative to costs, and insurers rationally respond by
limiting access to care for individuals with cancer to deter those individuals from enrolling in
their plans. Further, assume insurers are so effective at rationing access that individuals with
cancer obtain only very low levels of spending, for example, $1,000. Now suppose a regulator
seeks to address the problem of insurers inefficiently limiting access to care for individuals with
cancer by “risk adjusting” payments to health plans, and they use a standard risk adjustment


                                                                                                   1
system where plan payments are adjusted according to the observed $1,000 of spending for
individuals with cancer. Such a payment system will not solve the problem the regulator sought
to fix, because individuals with cancer will appear relatively inexpensive due to the insurers’
actions limiting their access to care. Thus, this conventional approach to payment will sustain
rather than correct the insurers’ incentive to inefficiently limit access to care for this group.
While this example is extreme, a weaker version of this feedback loop between inefficiencies
embedded in the health care system and the incentives embedded in the payments is likely to
play out in many more realistic settings.1 The general point is that if regulated prices are
intended to move the health care system to be more efficient and fair, using existing
(inefficient/unfair) patterns of care for purposes of payment calibration is unlikely to be the
right approach.


In this paper, we show that data modified to reflect the researcher’s or policymaker’s beliefs
about efficient and fair levels of spending versus the observed spending levels can be used for
calibrating health plan payments. We refer to this approach as “intervening on the data.” The
intuition behind intervening on the data follows from conditions of market equilibrium: set
prices to buy the equilibrium you want, not the equilibrium you currently have. After
introducing background material in Section 2, we lay out the theoretical basis of our approach
in Section 3. The model in Section 3 characterizes the optimal input data (that which leads to
the desired health care system outcomes) at an abstract level, and then translates the ideas for
our empirical applications of health plan payment in Medicare. In Section 4, we describe two
examples of intervening on the data. The first focuses on underpayment for individuals with
chronic illnesses, and the second addresses disparities in health care spending by zip code-level
income. We empirically compare intervening on the data to approaches based on modifying
payment algorithms using existing data. This includes exploring the conventional approach of

1
  Algorithmic fairness with biased data is a growing area of study outside of health care. The theme of using a data-
or algorithm-based intervention to break a feedback loop that reproduces or exacerbates biases in data runs
through many, diverse applications. For example, Lum and Isaac (2016) discuss how using biased data in predictive
policing algorithms can reproduce and amplify the biases in police data, and in some cases lead to a discriminatory
feedback loop between policing practices and algorithm predictions. Hu and Chen (2017) show how a fairness
constraint can be imposed on firms’ hiring practices to ensure both individual- and group-based fairness and
address discrimination in the labor market.

                                                                                                                   2
adding or removing risk adjustor variables from the pricing algorithm. In the chronic diseases
example, we include additional risk adjustors for chronic illness groups, and in the disparities
example we include a low-income neighborhood indicator. We also leave the set of risk
adjustors in place but introduce constraints on the OLS regression that target spending for
groups of interest (van Kleef, et al. 2017).


Both applications demonstrate that intervening on the data is a powerful approach for moving
plan payments closer to the desired levels. In the chronic diseases application, intervening on
the data is the most effective method for improving fit across all groups. Introducing
constraints on the risk adjustment formula also performs well at the group-fit level, while
adding risk adjustors to the OLS regression is the least effective approach. The substantial
improvements in group-level fit for both intervening on the data and constrained regression
come at only a trivial decrease in statistical fit at the individual level (i.e., R2) compared to an
unconstrained OLS regression. In the disparities application, adding a risk adjustor for
neighborhood income is highly ineffective if the objective is to address health care spending
disparities for that group. Such an action aggravates the disparity by income group.
Intervening on the data improves incentives to serve a group, but combining intervening on the
data with adding a risk adjustor is even more effective at altering incentives because it
combines the strengths of both approaches.


2. Background


Medicare Health Plan Payment and Risk Adjustment


Medicare adjusts per person payments to health plans according to age, sex, Medicaid status,
reason for Medicare eligibility, and diagnostic information. The Medicare risk adjustment
formula is calibrated on data from traditional fee-for-service Medicare but used to pay private
Medicare Advantage plans (whose data are not used for calibration purposes). Most efforts to
improve risk adjustment have centered on adding and refining the risk adjustor variables that


                                                                                                       3
indicate the presence of a diagnosis for a particular chronic disease (currently the Hierarchical
Condition Categories, abbreviated HCCs), or on segmenting the population and estimating
mutually exclusive subgroup formulas (e.g., separating community-dwelling and
institutionalized beneficiaries). Medicare tracks regression fit at the individual level, updating
the risk adjustment coefficients every few years by refitting the regression on more recent fee-
for-service data. The most recently publicly evaluated Medicare risk adjustment formula is
CMS-HCC Version 21; the subgroup formula for the largest group, aged beneficiaries, has an R2
of 12.46%.2


Despite a risk adjustment scheme refined over many years, some groups remain vulnerable to
selection-related incentives. For example, plans are underpaid for individuals with certain
chronic conditions in that the revenue a plan receives for members of this group falls short of
the expected costs. Research on Medicare Advantage plans shows plans react to such
“underpayments” by cutting back on services to unprofitable illness groups (Han and Lavetti
2017).


Intervening on the Data as a Policy Tool


The most significant example in the U.S. of intervening on the data for setting provider
payment is the Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) used by Medicare since the early
1990s to set physician procedure prices. Prior to the RBRVS reform, a policy consensus held
that the prices set for “Evaluation and Management” (E&M) procedures (i.e., routine office
visits) were too low and prices for some interventions (i.e., many surgical procedures) were too
high. These payment levels resulted in too little physician time spent with patients and too high
a volume of some procedures – patterns in the existing data policymakers wanted to change
(Newhouse 2002). Rather than accepting these patterns, Medicare incorporated information
about normative time and effort – what doctors should be doing – and raised the prices of E&M


2
 The Medicare risk adjustment model currently used in practice is CMS-HCC Version 22; it includes fewer HCCs
than Version 21 and estimates a greater number of subgroup models.

                                                                                                               4
procedures relative to surgery. In short, the RBRVS fee schedule was designed not to simply
reflect the time spent by physicians for various procedures, it was meant to affect the time
spent.3


We also see limited forms of intervening on the data in regulated health insurance markets in
the Netherlands and the ACA Marketplaces. The Dutch risk adjustment algorithm is estimated
on data modified to incorporate benefit package changes over time (Layton, McGuire and van
Kleef 2016). In the ACA Marketplaces, the risk adjustment algorithm is estimated on a pooled
sample of data not subject to the selection incentives in the Marketplaces, and modified by an
anticipated annual growth rate. The 2017 update of the formula additionally features separate
specialty drug, traditional drug, and medical expenditure trends based on external actuary and
industry reports. Similar to the Dutch approach, the goal of applying a trend modification to the
data is to incorporate expected patterns of spending, not to alter those expected patterns
(Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2016).


3. Conceptual Framework


Here, we develop a general model of plan actions in response to plan payment coupled with
recognition that plan payments are endogenous to plan actions. We explain our idea of
intervening on the data, and then describe how it can be used for addressing spending
allocation problems.


A Model of Intervening on the Data


Define the matrix 𝐗 = {𝑥𝑖𝑠 }, where i indexes individuals in the health insurance market and s
indexes the services provided by health plans. A service could be a particular type of care for a
particular condition or conditions, e.g., office-based care for depression. An element of 𝐗 is 𝑥𝑖𝑠 ,


3
 This is an example of the well-accepted idea that, as Newhouse (2002) pointed out in the context of physician
pricing, provider costs are endogenous to the payment method.

                                                                                                                 5
spending in dollars on service s for individual i. Also define 𝐑 = {𝑟𝑖 }, a vector of payments a
health plan receives for enrolling each individual i. 𝐗 is the performance of the health care
system and 𝐑 is the set of payments chosen by the regulator to influence the system.


𝐗 and 𝐑 are related in two ways. The vector of payments affects the health care system. And
data from the health care system are inputs into the algorithm that generates the payment
vector. We represent these two relations as:
        𝐗 = f(𝐑).                                               (1)
        𝐑 = g(𝐗)                                                (2)


The function f(∙) represents the working of the health care system in response to payment
incentives. Dependent on the payments set for each enrollee, plans set contracts with
providers and engage in other actions, including selection, that lead to an allocation of spending
on various services to each individual. The function g(∙) is the algorithm specified by the
regulator that takes as input the patterns of health care spending and determines a payment
for each person. The empirical methodology used by Medicare to assign risk scores to
individuals based on age and indictors of service use is an example of a g(∙) function.4


In the conventional approach to economic analysis of health plan payment, the payment vector
𝐑 is treated as an exogenous policy choice, and the health care system is characterized by f(∙)
only. This may not, however, constitute a full equilibrium. In general, the health care system
that results from a given payment vector will not, given the payment algorithm g(∙), generate
the original payment vector. We broaden the concept of equilibrium by recognizing the second
relationship between the health care system and payments, represented in g(∙). We say that
with a fixed algorithm g(∙), relating data from the health care system to payment, the system is



4
 Relations (1) and (2) should be understood broadly and remain true even in a system like Medicare where the
payment system calibration is based on data from fee-for-service Medicare. Medicare Advantage plan behavior in
response to payment incentives affects how many and what type of beneficiaries remain in fee-for-service
Medicare. The relations also remain in place even in the case in which the data used for calibration is entirely
disconnected from system performance. In that case, the g(X) function is a set of payments unaffected by X.

                                                                                                                   6
in full equilibrium when both conditions are satisfied. We thus define a full equilibrium in the
health care system (𝐗 𝐞 , 𝐑𝐞 ) as:5
𝐗 𝐞 = f(𝐑𝐞 )                                                   (3)
𝐑𝐞 = g(𝐗 𝐞 )                                                   (4)


To motivate intervening on the data, we assume another allocation, 𝐗 ∗ , is preferred to 𝐗 𝐞 . We
refer to 𝐗 ∗ as the “desired” allocation; 𝐗 ∗ might be preferred to 𝐗 𝐞 for reasons of efficiency or
fairness.


Conventional health policy analysis modifies the g(∙) function (for example, by adding variables
to the risk adjustment regression). With knowledge of the operation of the health care system
(i.e., the f(∙) function), one could solve for the vector of per person payments that would lead to
the desired allocation.6 Call this desired vector of payments 𝐑∗ :
𝐑∗ = f −1 (𝐗 ∗ )                                                 (5)


Equation (5) represents the strand of the health plan payment literature referred to as “optimal
risk adjustment,” with f −1 as the optimal risk adjustment formula.7 Note that (5) is consistent
with a full equilibrium, in the sense that the optimal risk adjustment formula, f −1 , when applied
to the optimal health care system, 𝐗 ∗ , yields the optimal vector of per person payments 𝐑∗ .


In this work, we take a different approach and ask, what 𝐗 matrix, used in equation (2) with a
fixed algorithm g(∙), would lead to the optimal set of per person payments, and thus to the
                                     ⃛ to be this optimal data input matrix:
efficient health care system. Define 𝐗

5
  In practice, data from a previous period are typically used to set payments in the current period. If a system is in
full equilibrium as we describe, such timing does not affect the equilibrium. Out of equilibrium, a system
characterized by (1) and (2) would need to take account of timing and any iterative process leading to equilibrium.
6
  Throughout, we assume that solutions exist, correspond to positive values of all spending, and are unique and
stable. Our Medicare application only requires the assumptions to hold locally.
7
  In Glazer and McGuire (2002), optimal coefficients are those that lead the plan, in profit maximization, to supply
efficient health care. In both of these instances, the coefficients are found by inverting the function describing
system response to the price incentives. Theoretical solutions to optimal risk adjustment are assumed to be
applied to the optimal allocations and are not designed to move the system to optimal based upon some arbitrary
inefficient/unfair initial allocation.

                                                                                                                     7
⃛ = g −1 (𝐑∗ ), or
𝐗
⃛ = g −1 (f −1 (𝐗 ∗ )) , or
𝐗
⃛ = h(𝐗 ∗ )
𝐗                                                               (6)


Equation (6) presents our main idea in abstract form. By disconnecting the data used as input
to the plan payment algorithm from the spending in the current system, i.e., by intervening on
the data, we can induce an efficient health care system. We recognize the h(∙) function is
complex and we have little policy experience with its properties. Nonetheless, we believe (6)
represents a novel and useful observation. Data used as input into payment system calibration,
⃛ in (6), can be chosen by policy. And although the form of (6) is unknown, simple and intuitive
𝐗
modifications to the input data have foreseeable effects on incentives. The correct intervention
on the data that provides insurers with the right set of incentives will at least move the health
care system in the right direction.8


A Medicare Application


To address allocation problems in Medicare we operationalize (6) and illustrate intervening on
the data. We specify the variables and some properties of how the health care system responds
to price incentives (f(∙)), and how the data from the health care system is used to construct
payments to health plans (g(∙)). In this section, we use the chronic diseases application to
translate our model into practice. A parallel method is used in our disparities application. 9




8
  There are direct parallels in our proposed approach of intervening on the data to the theory underlying structural
causal modeling (Pearl 2009). Specifically, we could formulate the two relationships in (1) and (2) as nonparametric
structural equation models with unknown functional forms f(∙) and g(∙), although an explicit representation of
equilibrium does not always apply. We can intervene on the system we have defined to set random variables
(here, payments) to specific values.
9
  We focus on a subset of features of Medicare payment and Medicare Advantage plan spending allocations. Our
examples are concerned only with medical spending predicted by the Medicare Advantage risk adjustment formula
– primary Part A and B spending – not drug spending (which has its own plan payment system). The analyses we
present focus on community-dwelling individuals, the largest set of Medicare beneficiaries. We ignore any joint
cost issues introduced by the presence of other payers of health plan services.

                                                                                                                  8
The Inefficiency


Based on previous research, we start with the premise that the Medicare payment system to
health plans creates incentives to underspend on persons with some chronic illnesses. As
McGuire et al. (2014) show in another context and our data analysis confirms for Medicare,
among the four chronic illness groups we study – cancer, diabetes, heart disease and mental
illness – the incentives are strongest to underspend on mental health care. We therefore
intervene to address the incentives to underspend on persons with mental illness, and track the
incentives for groups defined by the other chronic illnesses.


The Plan Payment Algorithm: 𝐑 = g(𝐗)


The function g(∙) is the algorithm that determines the per person payments paid to health plans
for enrollment of beneficiaries with various indicators for health status (which come from the
data). We implement a slightly modified version of Medicare’s current algorithm, described in
detail in Section 4 and the Appendix.


The Health Care System: 𝐗 = f(𝐑)


The f(𝐑) function relates per person payments to the functioning of the health care system.
This function encompasses not only plan spending and beneficiary enrollment, but also involves
the relationships between providers, hospitals, insurers, and individual consumers. Rather than
making strong assumptions about the form of f(∙), we make a weaker assumption about its
local properties, the signs of the derivatives of f(∙). This assumption is sufficient to determine
the sign of the local effect of a data intervention. Specifically, we assume plans respond
positively to incentives in the sense that if the payment for an individual is increased
(decreased), the plan spends more (less) on that person.10 The assumption implies that in

10
  This assumption is based on the model of health plan choice and plan design presented in Frank, Glazer, and
McGuire (2000). Geruso, Layton, and Prinz (2016), Carey (2017), Lavetti and Simon (Forthcoming), and Shepard
(2016) present empirical evidence supporting this assumption.

                                                                                                                9
response to an increase in the level of plan payment for a group of beneficiaries, plans will
spend more on the services used by those beneficiaries in order to encourage more of that
group to enroll.


4. Data and Methods


We study methods for reducing underpayment (which we assume induces underservice) for the
targeted group in the chronic diseases application, and methods to reduce underservice for the
targeted group in the disparities application. In both the chronic diseases and disparities
applications, we identify the target group using a classification system that is distinct from the
CMS-HCC risk adjustment system. We track the impact of alternative methods on regression fit
at the group and individual levels. As a summary measure, we calculate group payment system
fit (GPSF), which captures how well a given risk adjustment formula matches payments and
costs at the group, rather than the individual, level (Layton, et al. 2017).


Data and Baseline Risk Adjustment Formula


In practice and in this paper, data from fee-for-service Medicare are used to estimate payment
coefficients on the risk adjustment variables for setting capitation payments to Medicare
Advantage plans. We follow CMS and include only individuals with 12 months of continuous
Parts A and B coverage in the base year (2010) and those with at least one month of coverage
in the prediction year (2011). We focus on beneficiaries who are entitled to Medicare on the
basis of age, and exclude those with end-stage renal disease, and those residing in an
institution. After applying these exclusion criteria, we draw a random sample of 1.5 million
individuals in order to approximate CMS’s practice of using a random 5% sample of Medicare
beneficiaries for risk adjustment estimation. Our sample is predominately white (85%) and
urban-dwelling (76%) (Table 1). Approximately two-thirds of our sample has at least one of
four major chronic conditions: cancer, diabetes, heart disease, or mental illness. We combine
the 20% random sample Medicare Beneficiary Summary File on enrollment with Part A, Part B,


                                                                                                 10
home health, and durable medical equipment claims files for 2010 and 2011. We map ICD-9
diagnoses to 87 HCCs, combine age and sex into 24 age-sex cells, and create indicators for
disabled enrollees and individuals enrolled in Medicaid. Our outcome measure, health care
spending in 2011, is total Medicare spending on inpatient, outpatient, durable medical
equipment, and home health, weighted to reflect each individual’s eligible fraction of the
prediction year. To predict spending we use a similar specification as the Version 21 CMS-HCC
risk adjustment formula for the aged, community dwelling subgroup.


We map ICD-9 diagnoses to Clinical Classification Software (CCS) groups and to Prescription
Drug Hierarchical Condition Categories (RxHCCs) (AHRQ 2016; DHHS 2017). CCS groups are used
to identify beneficiaries with a chronic condition because, unlike the HCCs included in the risk
adjustment formula, all ICD-9 codes map to a condition group.11 RxHCCs are the categories used
by the Medicare Part D risk adjustment formula, and capture a greater number of mental illness
diagnoses than HCCs (Montz, et al. 2016). We use the RxHCCs to demonstrate the effect of
inclusion of additional risk adjustor variables.


Defining and Measuring Underpayment for a Group with a Chronic Illness


In our first application we target the systematic underpayment of persons with a chronic illness.
We divide our sample into seven mutually exclusive groups based on clinical diagnoses in CCS
categories: 1) mental illness only, 2) mental illness and at least one other major chronic
condition (diabetes, heart disease, or cancer), 3) diabetes only, 4) heart disease only, 5) cancer
only, 6) multiple chronic conditions, not including mental illness, and 7) no chronic conditions.




11
   In our sample, the mental illness HCCs capture only 44% of individuals in the mental illness group defined by CCS
groups. The difference in how CCS groups are defined versus how the HCC-based risk adjustors are defined
accounts for why some groups are underpaid in the current risk adjustment scheme, despite having HCC indicators
in the formula.

                                                                                                                 11
We define net compensation as the difference between average payments and average costs
for a group.12 We assume an individual’s total Medicare spending is the cost the plan bears for
that individual, and payments to a plan are the predicted values from the risk adjustment
regression: 𝑟𝑖 = ∑𝑖 𝛽̂𝑗 𝑧𝑖,𝑗 , where 𝑟𝑖 is the payment for individual i, 𝛽̂𝑗 is the estimated coefficient
for risk adjuster j, and 𝑧𝑖𝑗 is the value of the risk adjuster j for individual i. We then calculate
group-level net compensation for the average plan based on the predicted values:
Net compensation𝑔 = 𝑟𝑔 − 𝑐𝑔 ,                                  (7)


where 𝑟𝑔 = ∑𝑖∈𝑔 𝑟𝑖 ⁄𝑛𝑔 and 𝑐𝑔 = ∑𝑖∈𝑔 𝑌𝑖 ⁄𝑛𝑔 . Negative values of net compensation indicate
underpayment, where the group-level revenues (predicted spending) are systematically less
than group-level costs (observed spending). Positive values indicate overpayment, where
group-level revenues exceed group-level costs.13


Defining and Measuring a Health Care Disparity


Our second application addresses a disparity between groups defined by a sociodemographic
variable. We divide our sample into individuals residing in low-income zip codes (those with a
median income in the lower 60% of our sample zip code median incomes) and high-income zip
codes (upper 40%).14 We measure the disparity in health care between these two groups.
Measuring and addressing disparities between groups does not require knowledge about the
source(s) of the disparity – many factors contribute to disparities in care across neighborhood
of residence. Rather than seeking to directly address these underlying causes, we rely on the

12
   Papers and government evaluations of underpayment by group in the U.S. commonly measure underpayment in
ratio form (predictive ratios) rather than by a difference (e.g., McGuire, et al. 2014; Pope, et al. 2011). Here we
work with the difference metric to keep net compensation on the dollar scale. Our approach is more in line with
the European literature, which uses the difference rather than the ratio (e.g., van Kleef, van Vliet and van de Ven
2013).
13
   Note that net compensation is defined in relation to observed spending rather than the desired, efficient level of
spending. We return to the matter of using observed vs. efficient levels for payment system evaluation in the
Discussion.
14
   We examined disparities across zip code median income quintiles, and compared two different definitions for
the reference group: the upper 60% and the upper 40%. We found the middle quintile aligned more closely with
the bottom two quintiles, thus we defined the reference group (high-income) as the upper 40% and the group of
interest (low-income) as the lower 60%.

                                                                                                                  12
responsiveness of the health care system to financial incentives to reduce disparities between
low- and high-income neighborhoods: if health plans are paid more to enroll individuals in low-
income neighborhoods, then the plans will act to attract these individuals by providing them
with more care.


Disparity for a group is defined, following the Institute of Medicine’s Unequal Treatment Report
(2002), as differences in health care not due to health status or preferences. Because of the
difficulties in measuring preferences, the literature on disparities compares care for groups
after adjusting for health status only,15 and we do the same. Specifically, we estimate a
disparity in total health care spending between the group of interest and the reference group
as the difference in estimated and observed price-adjusted spending, conditional on health
status. We define disparity as:
           1                             1
𝐷𝑔,ref =        ∑𝑖∈𝑔(𝑌𝑖,𝑔 − 𝑌̂𝑖,𝑔 ) −          ∑𝑖∈ref(𝑌𝑖,𝑟𝑒𝑓 − 𝑌̂𝑖,𝑟𝑒𝑓 ),              (8)
           𝑛𝑔                           𝑛ref




where g is the group of interest, ref is the reference group, 𝑌𝑖,𝑔 is the observed spending for an
individual in the group of interest, 𝑌𝑖,𝑟𝑒𝑓 is the observed spending for an individual in the
reference group, 𝑌̂𝑖,𝑔 is predicted spending conditional on health status (as measured by CCS
categories, age, and sex) for an individual in group g, and 𝑌̂𝑖,𝑟𝑒𝑓 is predicted spending
conditional on health status for an individual in the reference group. We follow common
practice in the disparities literature and also adjust for age and sex, because differences related
to these demographic factors could stem from differences in prevalence of illness correlated
with age and sex, and thus would not constitute a disparity. The first term in (8), for group g
(low-income), is expected to be negative, with actual services received less than predicted
based on health status. The second term is expected to be positive, measuring the excess of
services received by the reference group in relation to their health status. When the difference
between these two terms, the disparity, is negative, it measures the underservice of group g,
conditional on health status, in relation to the reference group.

  For a review of methods for implementing the IOM definition of health care disparity, see Cook, McGuire, and
Zaslavksy (2012).

                                                                                                                 13

The estimation of 𝐷𝑔,ref in equation (8) depends on accurate predicted values 𝑌
“accuracy” can be defined with respect to an underlying squared error loss function.16
Therefore, we employ ensemble statistical machine learning methods to obtain optimal
predicted values in the calculation of the disparity. The Appendix contains additional details on
implementation. As far as we know, this is the first application of big-data methods to
estimating health care disparities.


Intervening on the Data


Targeting Underpayment for a Group with a Chronic Illness


In our demonstration, first intervene on the mental illness group, as identified by CCS category.
Specifically, starting with the basic OLS specification, 𝑌𝑖 = ∑𝑖 𝛽𝑗 𝑧𝑖𝑗 , we increase the Y vector by
10% for each individual in the targeted group. The choice of 10% is arbitrary. Notably, we only
need to intervene on the data once in order to project the effect of changing the transfer by
any amount because of the linear form of least-squares estimators.17 This linearity property
does not, however, hold for the impact of data changes on a quadratic measure of fit.


After intervening to transform the Y vector, we reestimate the regression, ensuring total
payments remain constant by imposing a constraint on the coefficients:
𝑌̅𝑁 = ∑𝑗 𝛽𝑗 𝑧̅𝑗,𝑁 ,                                                    (9)




16
    Other loss functions can be considered, including those for bounded continuous outcomes.
17  Intervening on 𝑌𝑖 leads to a constant change in net compensation because revenues at the individual and group
level are linear in Y:
𝑟𝑔 = 𝑌̅̂𝑔
𝑌̅̂𝑔 = 𝛽̂ 𝑍𝑔
𝛽̂ = (𝑍 ′ 𝑍)−1 𝑍′𝑌
Intervening on the data changes Y, while (𝑍 ′ 𝑍)−1 𝑍′ and 𝑐𝑔 are constant. Thus, any Δ𝑌 leads to the same Δ𝛽, Δ𝑌̂,
and, ultimately, change in net compensation.

                                                                                                                14
where 𝑌̅𝑁 is the sample average of observed total Medicare spending and 𝑧̅𝑗,𝑁 are the sample
means for the j risk adjustor indicator variables. By constraining the coefficients to produce the
observed sample mean spending, we guarantee that the total payments after the data
intervention sum to total costs. Put differently, we implement the constraint (9) so that
spending for individuals without a mental illness is reduced and counterbalances the increase
for individuals with a mental illness.18 From the refitted regression we obtain a new set of
predicted revenues for each individual in the sample.


Using these new predicted spending values, we can then recalculate net compensation for each
disease subgroup in the manner described above. Net compensation reveals how a given group
fares under a particular risk adjustment formula, but does not summarize overall group fit
across the entire sample. We use group payment system fit (GPSF) (Layton, et al. 2017) to
summarize the overall impact of each risk adjustment approach on net compensation:
                ∑𝑔 𝑠𝑔 |𝑐𝑔 −𝑟𝑔 |
GPSF = 1 −      ∑𝑔 𝑠𝑔 |𝑐𝑔 −𝑐̅|
                                                                       (10)



where 𝑟𝑔 comes from the estimated risk adjustment regression and 𝑐𝑔 is the observed,
unmodified vector of spending; 𝑐̅ is the mean of the observed, unmodified vector of spending
for the entire sample; and 𝑠𝑔 is the share of the sample in group g, with ∑𝑔 𝑠𝑔 = 1. GPSF is a
measure of regression fit calculated at the group-level; we use a linear scale to maintain
consistency with our net compensation measure.19 The denominator is the weighted sum of
absolute differences between group-level costs and the overall sample average, and the
numerator is the group-level sum of absolute residuals under a given payment system. GPSF
falls between 0 (the risk adjustment formula is equivalent to paying sample average costs) and
1 (the risk adjustment formula perfectly matches payments and costs at the group level). We


18
   Another way to maintain the same aggregate budget would be to directly deduct the corresponding amount of
spending from the complementary group. Using a constraint, however, is our preferred approach. First, using a
constraint does not require calculating the addition to the target group before running the regression, allowing the
analysis to proceed in one step rather than two. And second, if the intervention on the data is complex – for
example, if there are multiple targeted groups – our approach of intervening on the Y vector to enact the desired
changes for the targeted groups and then imposing an overall constraint is simple and easily implemented.
19
   GPSF on a linear scale is a group-level version of Cumming’s Prediction Measure (CPM) (van Veen, et al. 2015).

                                                                                                                 15
expect the denominator to be large relative to the numerator (and GPSF to be high) in cases
where group-level costs vary widely from the average cost of the entire sample, and group-level
payments are close to group-level costs. In our application, GPSF calculated using the baseline
risk adjustment formula is the floor we seek to improve on with alternative risk adjustment
approaches, and 1 is the ceiling. Comparing GPSF allows us to rank our risk adjustment
approaches based on how well they address discrepancies in net compensation for all of the
defined groups, not just the targeted group of interest. Concerns about how other groups
might be affected by intervening on the data or imposing linear constraints should guide the
selection of the mutually exclusive groups for calculating GPSF.


To compare fit at the individual level of the reestimated regression to the baseline OLS version,
we calculate an R2 as follows:
                            2
SSR = ∑(𝑌𝑖,obs − 𝑌̂i,refit ) ,
                       2
SST = ∑(Yi,obs − ̅
                 Yobs ) ,
R2 = 1 − SSR/SST,                                             (11)


where 𝑌̂i,refit comes from the refit regression; 𝑌i,obs is the observed, unmodified vector of
spending; and 𝑌̅obs is the mean of 𝑌𝑖,obs .


In addition to specifically targeting one chronic illness group, we perform another intervention,
where we proportionally increase spending for a beneficiary with at least one of the chronic
conditions. Here the goal is to provide an additional example to demonstrate how intervening
on the data based on a group categorization can affect subgroups within the broader
classification. We estimate the effect of an initial 5% increase, and show proportional increases
in the range of 0-15% of spending.


Targeting a Disparity




                                                                                                16
In the disparities application, we use the plan payment system to reduce incentives for the
targeted underservice. Recall that the method is agnostic as to the cause of the disparity in the
first place, but makes the simple assumption, discussed above, that increasing the profitability
of the group suffering a disparity will encourage plans to provide that group with more services.
Because we do not modify costs, tracking changes in group-level payments is sufficient to
capture how well intervening on the data addresses disparities. We calculate group-level
payments, 𝑟𝑔 = ∑𝑖∈𝑔 𝑟𝑖 ⁄𝑛𝑔 , by estimating the same CMS-HCC risk adjustment formula
described above to obtain individual level payments (𝑟𝑖 ). Groups that are underserved, like
those living in low-income areas, will likely already have payments exceed costs, i.e., be
profitable. Despite this, the disparity indicates that the incentives conveyed by the payment
system are not strong enough to encourage health plans to compete for these individuals by
providing them with more services, and thus eliminate disparities.


To intervene on the data, we choose to increase spending by 10% for all individuals in the low-
income zip code group, and again reduce spending for the complementary group by imposing
an overall budget constraint. We reestimate the risk adjustment regression with the modified Y
vector and recalculate group-level payments. It is then possible to characterize the tradeoffs
between reducing incentives for disparities and traditional measures of statistical fit for the risk
adjustment system, such as R2, described above in (11). We include an extension of this
example in the Appendix: in an even more targeted intervention, we transfer 10% to the low-
income group, but take funds only from the upper half of the high-income group (the fifth
quintile).


Comparison to Alternative Methods: Adding Risk Adjustor Variables and Constrained
Regression


We compare intervening on the data with two changes to the risk algorithm used to define
payments based on the existing data. First, in the mental illness application, we add RxHCCs
from the Medicare Part D risk adjustment formula related to mental illness and not already


                                                                                                  17
included in the Medicare Advantage risk adjustment formula.20 In the disparities application,
we add a low-income neighborhood indicator to the formula. While this latter change is a poor
choice because it reinforces incentives to underserve, we do so to illustrate that adding
indicators related to socioeconomic status can often be counterproductive and to allow us to
set up a combination approach.


Second, we impose linear constraints on the estimated coefficients from the risk adjustment
regression to ensure group-level payments by chronic illness group hit targeted levels. Thus, to
completely eliminate underpayment for the targeted chronic illness group we set 𝑌̅𝑔 =
∑𝑗 𝛽𝑗 𝑧̅𝑔,𝑗 . To compare constrained regression to intervening on the data, we also apply a
constraint with the same reduction of underpayment as achieved by intervening on the data.
Again, we maintain aggregate spending levels by imposing a second constraint on spending for
the entire sample: 𝑌̅𝑁 = ∑𝑗 𝛽𝑗 𝑧̅𝑁,𝑗 . We do not implement a constrained regression comparator
for the disparities application because it is not possible to directly constrain the target
(disparities) without making strong assumptions regarding how the health care system reacts to
changes in payments.


5. Results


Increasing Net Compensation for Beneficiaries with a Chronic Illness


Prior to intervening on the data, we assess net compensation by chronic illness. In aggregate,
net compensation for individuals with a mental illness is -$652 per person; separating this
group into those with mental illness only and those with mental illness and another chronic
condition shows the latter and larger group is subject to the greatest underpayment (Table 2).
Individuals with heart disease only are the most accurately compensated of the chronic illness
groups we examine, followed closely by the multiple chronic conditions with no mental illness



20
     Detail on the selection of the additional risk adjustors can be found in the Appendix.

                                                                                                 18
group. Those with diabetes only, cancer only, and no chronic conditions are overpaid at $768,
$247, and $294 per person.


After intervening on the data by increasing spending by 10% for all individuals with a mental
illness and refitting the risk adjustment regression, net compensation for individuals with
multiple chronic conditions and mental illness falls from -$1,502 to -$291 per person (Table 3,
Columns (1) and (2)). Net compensation for individuals with only a mental illness increases
from $315 to $644 per person. Notably, compensation for individuals with multiple chronic
conditions but no mental illness, cancer only, and no chronic conditions becomes much more
accurate. Net compensation for the diabetes only group is reduced, and underpayment is
aggravated slightly for the heart disease only group.


Comparison with Alternative Methods Increasing Net Compensation for Beneficiaries with a
Chronic Illness


After adding three RxHCC risk adjustors to the baseline regression, average per person net
compensation for the multiple chronic conditions with a mental illness group is reduced to
-$825. In the mental illness only group, net compensation is increased to $518 per person
(Table 3, Column (4)).


Setting the constrained regression target to be equal to the average spending for the mental
illness group achieved by intervening on the data (so that the two methods are directly
comparable) does more than intervening on the data to increase net compensation for the
mental illness only group ($644 vs. $988; Table 3, Columns (2) and (5)) and less to decrease net
compensation for the multiple chronic conditions with a mental illness group (-$291 vs. -$433).
The constrained regression targeting zero net compensation for all individuals with a mental
illness extends these trends, yielding net compensation of $1,006 per person in the mental
illness only group, and -$416 per person in the multiple chronic condition with a mental illness
group (Table 3, Column (6)).



                                                                                                19
To calculate GPSF we combine the “mental illness only” and “multiple chronic conditions with a
mental illness” group into a single category, which reflects the group targeted by the
intervention. At baseline GPSF is 92.032, leaving a gap of 7.968 between the baseline and
maximum GPSF. Intervening on the data with a 10% spending transfer yields the largest
improvement over the baseline (by 6 percentage points) with a GPSF of 98.009. The
constrained regression approach leads to a 5 percentage point improvement over baseline,
while adding in the risk adjustors generates only a 1 percentage point improvement. In
contrast, adding the risk adjustors has the best individual fit, with an R 2 of 11.170%, compared
to 11.105% for intervening on the data and 11.158% for the base risk adjustment formula.21


Overall, in this application, intervening on the data is the most effective method for addressing
underpayment for individuals with a mental illness within a balanced budget. Adding in risk
adjustors is the least effective method. By design, intervening on the data and constrained
regression are comparable in their results for the aggregate mental illness group, but
intervening on the data moves closer to eliminating under and overpayment in all of the non-
mental illness subgroups. Improvements in fit at the group level essentially come at no
expense of fit at the individual level as measured by R2.


These approaches to addressing underpayment also have differential impacts on subgroups
within the mental illness group. Figure 1 compares changes in net compensation by method,
across mental illness subgroups occurring in at least 10% of individuals with a mental illness.
Intervening on the data substantially increases net compensation for the screening history of
mental health and substance use disorders, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders groups. The
dementia/delirium and alcohol/substance disorder groups have the highest average spending
($21,876/person and $19,766/person) – thus receiving the largest transfers – and become
overpaid after we intervene on the data. The constrained regression performs similarly to
intervening on the data in terms of the impact on mental illness subgroups. The regression that

21                         2
   The baseline regression R is slightly lower than that reported for the CMS-HCC Version 21 regression (12.46%).
However, the correlation between predicted values from our regression and those using the CMS-HCC coefficients
is 98%, indicating our empirical formula is a good representation of the one used by CMS for plan payment.

                                                                                                              20
includes the RxHCCs for bipolar, depression, and major depression performs similarly to the
baseline regression, although compared to constrained regression and intervening on the data
it generates the largest increase in net compensation for individuals without a mental illness
HCC. The formula with the added RxHCCs also substantially increases net compensation for the
mood disorders subgroup, which includes depression and bipolar ICD-9 codes.


Figures 2 and 3 provide a side-by-side comparison of intervening on the data to specifically
target individuals with mental illness (Figure 2) versus all individuals with at least one chronic
condition (Figure 3). Figure 2 shows how increasing spending for individuals with a mental
health illness and decreasing it for all others affects predicted spending – and thus net
compensation – at the group level. Increasing spending by slightly less than 15% would
eliminate underpayment for individuals with multiple chronic conditions and a mental illness,
while the transfer increases the overpayment for the mental illness only group. Figure 3 shows
intervening on the data to increase spending for individuals with multiple chronic conditions
has a similar effect on the multiple chronic conditions groups with and without mental illness.
Given the differing levels of initial net compensation, the multiple chronic conditions with
mental illness group requires a spending transfer of approximately 12% while the multiple
chronic conditions with no mental illness group requires only about a 2% increase to eliminate
underpayment.


Reducing Disparities for Individuals in Low-Income Neighborhoods


The low-income group faces a disparity of $191 compared to the high-income (reference) group
(Table 4). Examined by subgroups (zip code income quintiles), we see the disparity primarily
occurs in the second and third income quintiles, and largely in relation to use in the fifth income
quintile. The goal is to increase the average payment for the low-income group in order to
decrease the disparity. Intervening on the data with a 10% spending transfer to the low-income
group increases payments by approximately $25 per person (Table 5). The overall fit of the
regression is minimally reduced from 11.158% by a 10% transfer: the refitted regression yields
an R2 of 11.114%. By contrast, adding in a risk adjustor for the low-income group has a large

                                                                                                     21
effect and makes average payments equal to average costs, as expected. The combination of
adding a risk adjustor and transferring 10% leads to the most dramatic change in payments. The
addition of the low-income group indicator means there is a risk adjustor in the formula that is
perfectly imbalanced between the group of interest and the reference group. This risk adjustor
provides a clear channel for intervening on the data to work through without greatly disturbing
other coefficients in the risk adjustment formula.


6. Discussion


This paper contributes to the literature on health plan payment on both theoretical and
practical levels. Our central theoretical insight is that there is a two-way relationship between
the data describing the performance of the health care system and the level of payments that
emerge from a risk adjustment methodology. Payments determine behavior, and behavior
generates the data that feeds into payment algorithms. Our paper calls attention to the second
link, and introduces a new mechanism for affecting payment and, thus, health system
performance. The researcher/regulator need not accept the behavior from the flawed health
care system as the input data for use in calibrating payment, and in general, they should not.
The mechanism of intervening on the data is easy to implement in practice, and intuitive, and
therefore may have readier practical application. Health care systems are complex and suffer
from allocation problems related to efficiency and fairness. We show how intervening on the
data is a simple and transparent way to address both types of problems.


We present two empirical applications, which assume the current health care system
underspends on individuals with chronic illnesses and underprovides services for individuals
living in low-income zip codes. In the context of net compensation by disease group,
intervening on the data and constrained regression both outperform the approach of including
additional risk adjustors. Both intervening on the data and constrained regression are effective
methods, have little effect on R2, and improve group fit. Adding in a risk adjustor for low-
income groups exacerbates the health care disparity between low-income and high-income

neighborhoods. Combining intervening on the data with adding a risk adjustor is more effective
at altering incentives than intervening on the data in isolation.


Our goal in this paper is to introduce a new idea for improving the performance of health plan
payment methods. While the empirical applications show how our model might be
implemented, this method requires further practical development in terms of how it would be
implemented with an existing health plan payment system. For example, policy objectives,
groups to be targeted, and outcome measures would all need to be specified in each year of
implementation. We use the Medicare program as the setting for our empirical demonstration,
but in practice it may be more straightforward to implement intervening on the data in a health
plan payment system where the data used for risk adjustment calibration is the same as the
spending data in the current system the regulator seeks to affect. Both the Netherlands and
Germany, for example, have such systems, and would be appropriate settings for further
empirical work or policy applications.


Regulators may choose from a variety of policy alternatives to achieve an efficiency or fairness
goal via the risk adjustment system. Expanding the formula with additional risk adjustors is, as
discussed earlier in this paper, a common approach. However, it not only is harmful in the case
of the disparities example, but it also has potential costs in an efficiency setting, such as
upcoding or other types of gaming, which are avoided by intervening on the data. There is a
very large set of ad hoc, post-estimation adjustments regulators can implement – i.e.,
increasing the prices paid for certain groups after estimating the risk adjustment formula – but
these modifications do not attempt to preserve OLS fit properties and do not take into account
other subgroups, whose coefficients/payments remain untouched. Our approach of intervening
on the data is expands the regulator’s toolkit in order to facilitate achieving objectives that may
be more costly or difficult when implementing other approaches like ad hoc adjustments or
including more risk adjustors.




                                                                                                23
While the main objective of this paper has been to provide a new approach to payment system
design, there is another important implication of the basic conceptual issue we explore here. It
is not only problematic to use observed data to design payment systems, it is also problematic
to use observed data to evaluate payment systems. R2, predictive ratios, and
under/overpayment measures of payment system performance evaluate how well plan
revenues match observed costs. However, more appropriate measures of payment system
performance would evaluate how well plan revenues match efficient levels of spending.
Estimation and evaluation methods are clearly linked, and if a different estimation approach is
warranted, different measures of performance are also likely needed.


A strand of the European literature on risk adjustment proposes to address this problem of
using observed costs to evaluate risk adjustment by instead using “acceptable costs” or
“normative expenditures” for payment algorithm evaluation (Stam, van Vliet and van de Ven
2010; van de Ven and Ellis 2000). Acceptable costs are those which capture medically necessary
care delivered in a cost-effective manner. Our approach is conceptually similar – to set targets
for acceptable levels of spending levels that reflect a social policy choice. We also explore a
different implementation approach: rather than modifying the coefficients assigned to risk
adjustment variables, we modify spending based on our beliefs about what acceptable costs
should be for the groups we are concerned about.


“Getting the prices right” will be a central problem of health plan payment in health insurance
markets around the world for years to come. There are many improvements that can be made
to current methods. Our main argument here is that altering the data itself should be part of
any policymaker’s toolkit.

Appendix

Baseline Risk Adjustment Formula


As described in the main text, the baseline risk adjustment regression we implement is a similar
specification to the Version 21 CMS-HCC formula for the aged, community dwelling subgroup.
We simplify our formula and do not include interaction terms between diseases, which are
sparsely populated, and we also do not modify coefficients post-estimation as CMS does (Pope,
et al. 2011). To calculate risk scores, CMS converts the dollar risk adjustment coefficients into
relative risk factors by dividing by the average per person predicted spending for a designated
year. In our analyses we use the coefficients as dollar weights. With an analysis for one year,
these methods are equivalent.



Super Learner

Machine learning is well-suited to estimating disparities because our definition is formulated as
a prediction exercise and the functional form of any differences is not known in advance. We
therefore adjust for health status in a general and flexible way, using ensemble machine
learning methods. We use the super learner framework, which combines many algorithms into
a weighted average prediction function (van der Laan, Polley and Hubbard 2007, van der Laan
and Rose 2011). While it has not, to our knowledge, been used in disparities work, it has been
deployed for prediction or classification in other applications, such as health outcomes (e.g.,
Petersen, et al. 2015 and Pirracchio, et al. 2015) and health spending (e.g., Rose 2016 and Rose,
Bergquist and Layton 2017).


The super learner takes as input: (1) the data and (2) a collection of algorithms. The first step
involves performing V-fold cross-validation for each algorithm in the collection. An optimal
weight vector is then constructed by regressing the outcome 𝑌𝑖 on the cross-validated
predicted spending values generated for each algorithm. The estimated coefficient for each
column in the matrix of cross-validated predicted spending values is the weight for the
algorithm that produced those values. One can show that this regression selects the optimal

                                                                                                    32
weight vector, and that by restricting the family of possible weighted combinations to convex
combinations (i.e., nonnegative weights that sum to one) performance can be improved (van
der Laan, Polley, and Hubbard 2007). The collection of algorithms the super learner ensembles
can include not only different classes of algorithms (e.g., decision trees and penalized
regressions), but also multiple similar algorithms with alternative tuning parameters (e.g.,
random forests with 250 observations in terminal nodes vs. 500 observations in terminal
nodes). Algorithms, such as penalized regressions, that may select tuning parameters (e.g., λ),
via cross-validation will still do so within the super learner procedure, leading to nested layers
of cross-validation. The final super learner algorithm fits each algorithm on the full data and
combines those functions with the estimated optimal weights to produce a final predicted
value. Our super learner considered six algorithms: a main terms logistic regression, three
penalized regressions, and a random forest with 500 trees and a minimum node size of 250
observations. We implement our analyses using the SuperLearner package in R, which calls the
randomForest and glmnet packages (Liaw and Wiener 2002; Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani
2010).


Additional risk adjustors


We add three risk adjustors from the Medicare Part D risk adjustment formula (CMS-RxHCC),
which has been shown to recognize a greater number of individuals with mental health
conditions in the ACA Marketplace setting (Montz, et al. 2016). The goal is to choose additional
risk adjustors to capture individuals in the mental illness group (as defined by CCS groups) not
already well represented by the included HCCs. Appendix Table 1 shows the overlap in
underlying ICD-9 codes for each mental illness CCS group and the corresponding HCCs and
RxHCCs. We select indicators for bipolar disorders, major depression, and depression to include
in our regression. To pick these three risk adjustors, we first examined RxHCCs with the fewest
ICD-9 codes in common with the mental illness HCCs, and then we chose the RxHCCs that
covered the largest number of individuals in the CCS mental illness group.

Disparities Application Extension


We expand on the primary disparities example by demonstrating an even more targeted
intervention: once again 10% is transferred to the low-income group, but funds are taken from
only the upper half of the high-income group (the fifth quintile), leaving individuals in the

                                                                                                37
fourth income quintile unaffected. To accomplish this we modify the Y vector as before for the
low-income group, imposing an overall budget constraint, and imposing a second constraint
that maintains the spending levels of the fourth quintile, so that only individuals in the fifth
quintile are used to counterbalance the spending for the low-income group.


Appendix Table 2 shows transferring 10% of spending to the low-income group but reducing
spending for only the fifth income quintile generates minimal change in payments for the low-
income group. Adding a risk adjustor for the low-income group does not allow us to specify
what happens within the high-income group, and we see the fourth income quintile receives
substantially higher payments. Combining adding a risk adjustor with intervening on the data is
once again the most powerful approach, although the overall changes are much more modest
(from $10,050 to $10,058 for the low-income group) than when we allowed spending for the
entire high-income group to be reduced.
