        The effect of licensing as a mechanism to control entry into occupations has been a

neglected area of both regulation and labor market research. This study examines the role of

occupational licensing for entry into dentistry, an occupation with standards that vary by state.

Our research first closely replicates Freeman's previous work on labor market cobwebs by

employing national data to examine purely market phenomena in the determination of training

for the dental profession. We subsequently approximate the government barrier to practice in

the profession by adding a weighted average state examination pass rate to the previous

model. Next, we employ pooled cross-section time series analysis to explore market

determinants of professional entry with state level data. Finally, these results are

supplemented by measures of statutory and pass rate entry restrictiveness. Our most

consistent evidence suggests that a higher state licensing failure rate deters entry into dental

practice.

Introduction

       The growth of occupational licensure from approximately 3% of the labor force in

1950 to almost 18% in 1989 has been among the most dramatic changes in labor market

regulation (Kleiner, 1990). Yet the impact of this institutional change on the labor

market response of individuals affected by licensing, beyond wage changes and mobility,

has received relatively little recent attention by economists (Rottenberg, 1981; Kleiner

and Petree, 1988). This paper analyzes occupational entry in the labor market for the

professional services of dentists. Unlike medical doctors, dentists must pass a separate

licensing examination specific to the jurisdiction in which they wish to practice. This

paper will examine the way in which licensure interacts with other variables to affect the

supply of dentists both nationally and state-by-state.

       The cobweb model, which has been adapted to the labor market by Richard

Freeman, is the best-known approach to evaluating responsiveness of entrants to

professional training (1975(a), 1975(b), 1976). The underlying rationale for the cobweb
model is that future labor market conditions are so difficult for an individual to forecast

that entry decisions are made on the basis of present conditions. The supply response to

temporarily high earnings draws people into training for a certain line of work. These

entrants, in turn, depress earnings and lower the number of entrants in subsequent

periods. Just as in the classic agriculture cycle, supply lags generate cobweb responses.1




     Both logic and evidence support stable cobweb adjustments (for a discussion, see Freeman, 1971:16-32).
         In his research in the 1970's, Freeman used these models to study lawyers,

physicists and college graduates.2 He was always careful to acknowledge both the

theoretical and empirical limitations of this approach. In recent years, other models have

rejected the assumption that supply responsiveness to immediate economic prospects

provides the best possible methodolo' (Siow, 1984; Zarkin, 1985; and Orazem and

Mattila, 1991). In particular, future demand conditions modelled through a rational

expectations approach might improve upon a cobweb analysis. For example, Zarkin

argues that rational expectations results obtained for primary and secondary school

teachers may be particularly appropriate because future demand is so easily forecast by

using straightforward demographic techniques. In the case of dentistry, however, many

contrary forces have affected demand in recent decades (see Kudrle and Meskin, 1983),

and forecasting the future demand for dental services, either at the state or national

level, could present considerable difficulty for a potential practitioner of dentistry.3

Moreover, a rational expectations analysis at the state level would be precluded due to

data limitations. Instead, we begin with the familiar cobweb approach and modify it to

take into account the fact that dentistry is a heavily regulated occupation.

          This paper has two major parts and several subsections. First, it closely replicates

the earlier cobweb models to make them appropriate for entering and graduating dental

        In this model career decisions are made such as to maximize the functional form:

                  MaxU(X1, w1 + W)

        where U is an indirect utility function. X1 is the job characteristic vector of occuptton i, w is lifetime
carnings in job i, and W is non-wage income (Freeman. 1971:3).

     The key determinants of dental demand over the past fifty years or so have been income, education.

school students at the national level. The model is then expanded to include a weighted

average pass rate as an index of the additional difficulty of becoming a dentist once

dental school has been completed. The next section of the paper explicitly recognizes

the state level elements of the labor market by including subnational measures of

economic conditions and licensing.

                                THE MODEL AND DATA

       In this section of the paper we present the basic cobweb model and develop the

rationale for our modifications to it. Freeman's initial exploration of the market for

lawyers ignores that the practice of law is also a regulated profession whose port of

entry' is guarded by the states. Formally, his work therefore suffers from omitted

variable bias, which could push the coefficients upward and spuriously increase the

statistical significance obtained from variables in the model. More than the law, dentistry

presents a strong a orion case that varying licensing restrictiveness could affect the choice

of profession. Most jurisdictions give a dental exam no more than twice a year and

sometimes only once. Hence, the cost of failing a dental examination and not being

allowed to practice for six months or a year would be substantial. Moreover, we expect

that variations in the difficulty in passing the exam will affect the flow of dentists into

dental practices in various states.

       The model we propose amends earlier work on occupational entry by adding a set

of variables to capture various dimensions of occupational restrictiveness and their

severity, thus reducing one source of potential omitted variable bias. The three major

elements of restrictiveness we examined were: the pass rate on state licensing exams,

whether or not the state had a citizenship requirement for practice (a dummy variable),

                                               3
and the number of years since there was a major change in the state's dental practice act.



       The first variable is both the most obvious and the most difficult to deal with. Put

most simply, an 80 percent pass rate in California and in Wyoming may not be measuring

the same thing. Hence, cross-sectional or pooled data analysis of the kind we employ

may be incorrectly specified unless that problem is addressed with a selectivity bias

correction (Murnane, Olson and Newstad, 1985). Citizenship is a rather blunt but

obvious restriction, and stability of the states' Dental Practice Act suggests a less risky

professional environment.

       The cobweb model as specified by Freeman for a cohort entering professional

training, revised to include licensing restrictions, can be written as:

  1)     ENT(0) = a1ASAL(0) - a4ASAL(0) -           a3   RES(0) + (1-).) ENT(-1)+â‚¬1

         Where:

         ENT is first year enrollees.

         SAL is starting salaries in the dentist profession

         ASAL is an index of starting salaries in alternative occupations

         RES is a measure of restrictiveness

              is the time period

       The model shows supply adjusting only partially to changed conditions with the

speed of adjustment determined by A.

        For completion of training, the equation would be written as:

  2)     GRAD(t) = b1[SAL(t-n+1) + . . . SAL(t-1)1 - b[ASAL(t-n+1) + .

         ASAL(t-1)] - b3[RES(t-n+1) + ... RES(t-1)]+ b3ENT(t-n) Ã· 62

                                                4
        V/here n=years of professional training

        The second equation explicitly recognizes that a person's completion of training
will depend on conditions prevailing during the training period. Most of the data on

current and future dentists comes from the American Dental Association. Its Survey of

Dental Education, published annually, provides high-quality data gathered from the

nation's approximately 70 dental schools. The data show the home addresses of all

dental students with the information for all first year dental students shown separately.

These data, of course, do not directly tell us about where a person ultimately intends to

practice and hence where changes in state conditions -- salaries, opportunity cost, or

restrictiveness -- should provide foci of concern for persons entering the profession.

       In the data analysis that follows in which first year data are employed, it is

assumed that each student is gearing decisions to the conditions in the state of declared

residence during the first year of dental school. It could be argued that even if the

student does not ultimately plan to practice in the home state, conditions in that State

would be most influential in forming opinions about the general situation in dentistry.

Because it is overwhelmingly likely that new dentists are concerned at least somewhat

with the conditions elsewhere, we also include in our state level estimating equations

measures of national remuneration from dentistry, the national opportunity cost of dental

practice, and average national pass rate.

       We have a completely separate set of data, also from the ADA, that provides the

addresses for all new dentists (i.e., licensed or not). In the analysis employing these data

we make virtually the opposite assumption from the previous case. Instead of assuming

that a future dentist from Iowa, who is attending dental school in Minnesota, intends to

                                              5
return to Iowa and hence views conditions in Iowa as determinative of the relevant

market conditions for future dentists, we assume that the state in which the dentist

actually first practices is the one that was the object of major attention during all of the

previous years. The use of two separately gathered data sets serves as a check on the

potential biases of using each data base separately.

         In the national model, we can replicate the initial occupational entrance approach

advanced by Freeman into professional training and graduation by simply adding an
additional variable for licensing stringency: the weighted average pass rate.4 In the state

evel analysis, the model is necessarily more complicated because of the options provided

for dental practice and other employment in fifty different jurisdictions. Moreover, our

data sets do not permit the examination of state-assigned cohorts as they proceed

through dental school. Hence, equation (2) cannot be directly replicated. The basic

partial adjustment model for the pooled cross-section time series investigation is:

  3)       ENT(O)            a11ASALO) - a,XASAL1(O) - (1-X)ENT1(-1) + XRES(O)

                          + a3?.SAL(O) - a4ASAL(O) + a5XRES(O)

         where i indicates the state under consideration and the urisubscripted variables

indicate national conditions. The alternative data set requires only a slight modification.

NEW(4) is substituted for ENT(O) as the dependent variable and NEW1(3) replaces

ENT(-l) on the right hand side, where NEW are new dentists in the state. Also, due to




       Given the nature ol these statutory data, the aggregation to the national level would likely lead to
muddled results. Furthermore, the variables for restrictiveness variables, citizenship requirements and stability
in state dental practice act.s were insignificant in the individual state regressions and were not employed in the
national regressions.

the state rather than beginning salaries.

ESTIMATES FROM THE MODEL

       In this section of the paper we estimate alternative specifications of a cobweb

model of labor supply for dentists when licensing restrictions are taken into account. We

provide basic tabulations from the data in Table 1. In Table 2 estimates showing the

results of a national cobweb model that uses time series estimates of licensing pass rates

as a variable are provided. Table 3 presents estimates of state level cobweb models in

order to test for the robustness of the results at the subnational level. In Table 4 results

are shown for a state-level cobweb model that accounts for alternative types of state

licensing provisions and pass rates.
       Table 1 presents the means and standard deviations for the labor market and

licensing variables we use to estimate the national and state cobweb models. These data

show considerable variation in the various labor market variables. There is, for example,

over a $9,156 standard deviation in constant dollar dental incomes, and also a $1,908

standard deviation in earnings of new college graduates over the time period 1960 to

1984. Additionally, the three major occupational licensing variables: pass rates,

citizenship, and years since the statute was changed, show considerable variation over

time and across states. There is also considerable change in the number of dental

enrollees and graduates during the different time periods we analyzed. Since we were

able to obtain licensing information and complete labor market data for only the 30 most

populous states, our analysis is somewhat limited. These states, however, account for

over 90 percent of all dentists in the U.S. with no a priori reason to suggest different

                                              7
labor market responses for the remaining dentists. An examination of data from these

states suggest that there is variation in regulatory restrictiveness and that these variables

have the potential to influence the labor market responses of individuals choosing where

to practice.

        In Table 2 we report a national cobweb model of the labor market for dentists,

similar to ones estimated by Freeman for lawyers (Freeman, 1975). The results shown

for both enrollees and new dentists imply that the basic cobweb model is reasonably

robust in explaining variations in new enrollees and in new dentists even when varying

specifications of lagged values are used.5 In columns five and six we replicate Freeman's

lagged adjustment model for dentists shown in our equation (2), which include average

salaries for the total period of professional education (Freeman, 1975). In columns four

and five we anticipate the model used for data availability reasons in the state-level

results that follow. Instead of lagged enrollments, as an explanatory variable we employ

lagged new dentists.

        Columns two, four and six show the estimates of the model when occupational

licensing provisions are taken into account. We use the yearly national pass rate as our

measure of licensing over time since we can directly estimate the potential costs to

individuals who fail the state level exam.6 Our results show that occupational licensing


      The choice of appropriate lags vary since some dental school requirementa vary from three to tour
years. Therefore, we used both three and four year lags in our estimation procedure for national and State
estimates to test for sensitivity and found consistent results. Models with three-year lags are shown;
estimates with tour year lags are available from the authors.

    6 The estimated cost to individuals who fail the exam was approximately $35,000 in 1984. This estimate
waa derived by assuming that the individual becomes a licensed dentist by passing the exam the next time tt
is given, which is about every six to twelve months, and the individual works as a dental assistant during the
intervening period. The estimate includes lost earnings growth of about one percent for the next five years
due to lost experience and normal earnings growth (Polachek, 1981).

                                                      8
as proaed by pass rates are always positive and usually significant in influencing new
enrollees and the number of dental graduates at the national level. However, since

dental licensing is a state-by-state-process, it may be difficult to fully capture the

differences in "national" dental licensing statutes and administrative procedures.7

        National estimates of the impact of licensing pass rates provide evidence of the

impact of regulation on occupational choice, but they fail to capture licensing as a state

by state process. The decision to enter an occupation within a particular jurisdiction is

influenced by state economic conditions as well as the licensing practices that exist in that

state. Therefore, to model the potential impact of state policies on occupational choice

and entry more accurately we estimated occupational choice and entry cobweb models at

the state level.

        The results of the partial adjustment model are shown in Table 3 for both dental

enrollees and new dentists. The model's specification is consistent with the basic cobweb

model, but we expanded it to allow pooling of time-series and cross-section data as well

as having the national dental and state labor market variables as controls.8 More

specifically, we control for the year, state-specific fixed effects and endogenous variables

that are part of the basic model. We also estimate the model with a Newey and West

covariance matrix which corrects for autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity in pooled




     We also estimate all our results as a quadratic (unction with pass rates and   pass   rates squared and
find little change in our basic results. However, the use of the quadratic formula produces a significant
coefficient value of .56 (or dentists, while the values (or enrollees are not statistically significant.

     We also estimate the model employing deviations from national trends. Estimates using a deviation from
the national average approach produced the same qualitative results as in Tables 3 and 4.

                                                     9
time-series analysis (Newey and West, 1987). These sensitivity tests show that our

results arc robust across data sets and econometric specifications.

       The estimates at the state level are generally as robust as the national estimates.

For example, salary estimates for dentists are significant and positive for enrollees.

Further, measures of opportunity costs or earnings of individuals in the state are

significant and negative as hypothesized. Collinearity between state and national dental

incomes and estimated opportunity costs quite understandably render the discovery of

state specific effects more problematic. Table 3 reports results with the national

variables both omitted and included. For new dentists, the national labor market

variables seem to dominate the state level ones in choosing the occupation. Overall

these results strongly corroborate the general appropriateness of the cobweb approach

while confirming the importance of state level variables including licensing restrictiveness.

       The results of a similar model expanded to include measures of occupational

licensing statutes and pass rates along with a selectivity adjustment variable are presented

in Table 4. First, the coefficients for dental salaries in the state remain as hypothesized

and are generally significant. Second, the most important licensing variable is the pass

rate. The coefficients for citizenship and the time since the statute was changed, in

columns three and six, are not different from zero and are consistent with prior

studies.'Â° Further, the introduction of a selectivity adjustment for the number of

persons taking the exam in the State does not change the basic finding of the impact of



     Estimates without Newey-West corrections show no qualitative changes in our results.
    10 This result is consistent with other

variables (Pashigian 1980; Kleiner. Gay and Greene 1982; and Klelner 1990).

                                                    10
licensing pass rates." We also checked for selectivity at time of enrollment by

estimating the relationship between the number of applicants to dental school per

enrollee lagged by three years, on the state pass rate. We found no significant results,

(i.e., results had t-ratios of 1.00 or lower when the estimates are controlled by year).

       The coefficient estimates for the pass rates in Table 4 show a positive and

generally significant impact. In all our specifications for data gathered on enrollees or

new dentists, the pass rate is positively associated with larger numbers of potential or

new dentists in the state. For example, a one percent increase in the pass rate is

associated with an increase in the number of new dental enrollees that plan to practice in

the state using data over the period 1970 to 1984 of between .19 and .32 percent

depending on the specification employed.
        The results presented in Table 4 suggest that models of entry into state-licensed

professions, such as dentistry, suffer from potential omitted variable bias if the role of

state occupational regulation is not explicitly considered. Further, our results are robust;

they show that pass rates on state administered exams have a significant influence in

alternative specifications employing different data sets (i.e., the number of dental school

entrants from the state and the number of new dentists to the state). In occupations

where the state or its designees have significant control over the content of licensing

 exams and the scores required to pass them, this factor is an important variable that

 should be included in estimates of models of occupational choice and entry.




       The selectivity adjustment was estimated in a manner consistent with the 'a method' developed by
 Murnane, Olson, and Newstad (1985). The value for the predicted number of individuals taking the exam was
 added to adjust for potential selectivity bias in the enrollment and new dentist equations.

CONCLUSIONS

       This study has examined the impact of the stringency of occupational licensing

provisions on the occupational entry of dentists. Developing and testing a cobweb model

of occupational entry into dentistry without licensing related variables for occupational

entry, we find that the model works reasonably well at both the national and state levels.

We then introduce the role of state occupational licensing as a potential omitted variable.

In a national time series model we find that licensing as measured by the pass rate is

positive and usually statistically significant. Furthermore, at the state level in pooled

cross section-time series models, we find that more restrictive licensing of dentists, as

measured through the occupational pass rate, is positive and irs most cases significant in

influencing the number of new entrants and graduates of dental school programs. Our

results suggest that economists who examine occupational entry in licensed occupations

may have omitted variable bias by failing to include measures of occupational regulation.

Further, this study adds to the evidence that state occupational licensing continues to

have important labor market consequences for both practitioners and the public.
