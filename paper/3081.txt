           YAGE AND EMPLOYMENT UNCERTAINTY AND THE LABOR FORCE
                 PARTICIPATION DECISIONS OF MARRIED YOMEN


                                 ABSTRACT

     Over the past 30 years, research on married women's labor force

participation has concluded vlrtua!ly without exception that the principal

source of labor force participation rate growth for married women has been

the concurrent growth of women's real wages.     The experience of the 1970's

suggests, however, that real wage growth cannot account for the Increase

In participation rates that occurred during that period.     This paper

argues that an Important determinant of married women's current

participation decisions Is the level of uncertainty associated with

expectations of future wages, and that high levels of uncertainty during

the 1970's may have contributed sUbstantially to the growth in

participation that occurred during that time.     Engle's model of

autoregressive conditional heteroscedastlclty (ARCH) Is appl led to

aggregate time series data covering the years 1956-1986 to measure the

level of uncertainty at each point In time.     Our estimates Indicate

support for the basic hypothesis that the level of uncertainty is an

Important determinant of labor force participation decisions for married

women.
