Two Perspectives on Preferences and Structural Transformation

                                              ABSTRACT

We ask what specification of preferences can account for the changes in the expenditure shares of
broad sectors that are associated with the process of structural transformation in the U.S. since 1947.
Following the tradition of the expenditure systems literature, we first calibrate utility function parameters
using NIPA data on final consumption expenditure. We find that a Stone-Geary specification fits the
data well. While useful, this exercise does not tell the researcher what utility function to use in a model
that posits sectoral production functions in value added form. We therefore develop a method to calculate
the value added components of consumption categories that are consistent with value added production
functions, and use these data to calibrate a utility function over sectoral consumption value added.
We find that a Leontief specification fits the data well. Interestingly, the two specifications display
very different properties: for final consumption expenditure income effects are the dominant force
behind changes in expenditure shares whereas for consumption value added relative price effects are
dominant.

1        Introduction

The reallocation of resources across the broad economic sectors agriculture, manufacturing, and
services is a prominent feature of economic development. Kuznets (1966) referred to this real-
location as the process of structural transformation and included it as one of the main stylized
facts of development. Recent work has argued that modeling structural transformation is impor-
tant for addressing a variety of substantive issues associated with the evolution of economic ag-
gregates.1 Despite the extensive work on structural transformation, empirically identifying the
key economic forces that shape structural transformation remains an open question. One issue
is the role played by preferences. Specifically, while theoretically it is known that households
may reallocate expenditure shares across consumption categories because of either income ef-
fects or relative price effects, the relative empirical importance of these two forces for structural
transformation has not been established.2 Resolving this issue has important implications for
how policies and technological change influence structural transformation.
        In this paper we assess the features of preferences that are quantitatively important in shap-
ing the U.S. structural transformation over the period 1947–2007. Following the tradition of
the consumer expenditure systems literature, we begin by using data on final consumption ex-
penditure from the NIPA to calibrate the utility function parameters that provide the best fit to
the time series for household consumption expenditure shares on agriculture, manufacturing
and services, taking total consumption expenditure and prices as given. We find a strikingly
simple result, namely that a Stone–Geary utility function provides a very good fit to these data.
Moreover, we show that the nonhomotheticities implicit in this specification are key in shaping
the evolution of expenditure shares over the period 1947–2007, implying that income effects
rather than relative price effects are the dominant force behind changes in expenditure shares.
In terms of the recent theoretical literature on structural transformation, this result supports the

      See, for example, Laitner (2000) and Gollin et al. (2002) for an application to early development, Messina
(2006), Rogerson (2008) and Ngai and Pissarides (2008) for the evolutions of hours worked in Europe and the U.S.,
Duarte and Restuccia (2009) for productivity evolutions in the OECD, Caselli and Coleman (2001) and Herrendorf
et al. (2009) for regional convergence, and Bah (2008) for identifying problem sectors in poor countries. Other
contribution to the literature on structural transformation include Echevarria (1997), Kongsamut et al. (2001), Ngai
and Pissarides (2007), Acemoglu and Guerrieri (2008), and Foellmi and Zweimuller (2008).
    2
      For example, Kongsamut et al. (2001), assume that only income effects matter, while Baumol (1967) and Ngai
and Pissarides (2007), assume that it is only relative price effects.

specification assumed by Kongsamut et al. (2001), but not the one assumed by Baumol (1967)
and Ngai and Pissarides (2007).
   While at first pass the above result may appear to imply that a Stone–Geary utility func-
tion is the appropriate choice for applied studies of structural transformation, we argue that
such a conclusion is not warranted because there is an alternative tradition that is also com-
monly used to define commodities in this context. Specifically, for the exercise reported above,
we followed the tradition of the expenditure systems literature and identified the commodities
with categories of final consumption expenditure. For example, spending on food from the
supermarket will be in agriculture, spending on clothing from a department store will be in
manufacturing, and spending on airplane travel will be in services. In contrast, the literature on
sectoral productivity studies follows a different tradition. It starts with value added production
functions at the sectoral level, and then studies the properties of these functions, including such
things as factor input shares and technological change. If technology is specified in this tradi-
tion, then consistency dictates that the commodities in the utility function are the value added
components of consumption, rather than the final expenditure components. For example, the
purchase of a cotton shirt will now be treated as representing consumption from all three cate-
gories: cotton from agriculture, processing from manufacturing, and transport and retail from
services. We term this specification of commodities the consumption value added specification.
If a multi-sector general equilibrium model is specified in this tradition, there is no reason to
believe that the utility function calibrated above is appropriate.
   We next turn our attention to estimating the utility function when commodities are specified
according to consumption value added. It turns out that implementing the estimation is now
relatively difficult because data on consumption value added by sector are not readily available.
To be sure, data on total value added by sector are readily available, but these data are not
sufficient because not all of total value added is consumed. One of the contributions of this
paper is to lay out and implement a procedure for extracting the consumption component of
total value added and to produce an annual time series for U.S. consumption value added by
sector between 1947 and 2007. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to calibrate a
specification of preferences based on these data.


                                                 2
   While the household expenditure shares based on consumption value added display the
same qualitative properties of structural transformation as emphasized by Kuznets, the cali-
brated utility function is now strikingly different from the earlier case. In particular, whereas
with final consumption expenditure we found that the Stone–Geary specification provided an
excellent fit to the data, we now find that nonhomotheticities are relatively unimportant and that
a homothetic specification with no substitution between categories (i.e., a Leontief specifica-
tion) provides a good fit to the data. In other words, contrary to our earlier results, it is now
the preference specification adopted by Baumol (1967) and Ngai and Pissarides (2007), rather
than the one adopted by Kongsamut et al. (2001), that is consistent with the data. With these
preferences, the dominant force behind changes in expenditure shares is relative price effects,
rather than income effects.
   It is important to emphasize that our results should not be interpreted as saying that re-
searchers can freely rationalize very different choices of utility functions. Our two calibrated
utility functions are based not on two different data sets but rather on two different representa-
tions of the same underlying data. The final consumption expenditure data are linked to the con-
sumption value added data through complicated input–output relationships, which implicitly
translate the income effects that dominate with final consumption expenditure into the relative
price effects that dominate with consumption value added, and vice versa. Which specification
of the utility function is appropriate depends on the underlying definition of commodities. In
the discussion section in the body of the paper, we will provide intuition for the qualitative
properties of this translation, and for how it reconciles the seemingly contradictory results of
the two methods.
   The key point to be taken away is that in the context of multi–sector general equilibrium
models, one needs to be careful about how commodities are defined, and in particular about
consistency of measurement on the household and production sides of the economy. Moreover,
one needs to be careful about importing parameter estimates across models that have different
underlying definitions of commodities, even though they may use the same labels. For example,
our results show that it is not appropriate to use the utility function that was calibrated from fi-
nal consumption expenditure together with value added production functions at the sector level.


                                                 3
If one wants to use a utility function that was calibrated from final consumption expenditure,
then one either needs to write down a production structure that captures the complexities of
the input–output relationships at the sector level, or one needs to find a representation of pro-
duction that isolates the contribution of capital and labor to the production of final expenditure
categories. While this can be done, it is much more difficult than working directly with sectoral
value added production functions.3
        An outline of the paper follows. In the next section we describe the model and the method
that we use to calibrate preference parameters. In Section 3 we describe the final consumption
expenditure method and we report the estimation results for this method. In Section 4, we turn
to consumption value added. We explain in some detail how to construct the relevant time series
of variables from existing data and we report the estimation results. Section 5 compares the
results of both methods and provides some intuition for the differences. Moreover, it discuss
the relative merits of the two methods and some additional measurement issues. Section 6
concludes. An appendix contains the details about our data work.



2        Model

As noted in the introduction, our objective is to determine what form of preferences for a stand–
in household defined over the three broad categories agriculture, manufacturing and services
are consistent with U.S. data for expenditure shares over the period since 1947. This section
develops the model that we use to answer this question.
        We consider an infinitely lived household with preferences represented by a utility function
of the form:
                                          ∞
                                          X
                                                βt U(cat , cmt , c st , 1 − ht ),
                                          t=0

where the indices a, m, and s refer to the three broad sectors of agriculture, manufacturing, and
services.4 Hours of work for the household in period t are denoted by ht and, with the total time
    3
     Valentinyi and Herrendorf (2008) showed how to construct sectoral production functions that use only capital
and labor to produce final expenditure by broad category.
   4
     The exact definition of these sectors for each of the two specifications that we consider will be provided later.
We note here that we have followed the convention of using the label “manufacturing” to describe a sector which
consists of manufacturing and some other sectors (e.g., mining and construction). While the label “industry” is


                                                            4
endowment normalized to 1, the term 1 − ht represents leisure in period t. We will assume that
the function U takes one of two forms:


                         U(cat , cmt , c st , 1 − ht ) = u(cat , cmt , c st )v(1 − ht )

                                                            or

                         U(cat , cmt , c st , 1 − ht ) = u(cat , cmt , c st ) + v(1 − ht ).


The key feature of these two forms is that time devoted to work has no effect on relative marginal
utilities of consumption within a given period, so it will not influence the optimal allocation of
expenditures across consumption categories for given prices and total expenditure.
    We further assume that the utility function u(cat , cmt , c st ) is of the form:

                                               h P                 1                 σ−1  σ i1−ρ
                                                      i=a,m,s (ωi ) σ (cit   +   c̄i ) σ σ−1         −1
                      u(cat , cmt , c st ) =                                                              ,
                                                                        1−ρ

where the ωi are non–negative weights that add up to one, ρ > 0 is the intertemporal elasticity
of substitution of consumption, and the c̄i ’s are constants. We restrict c̄m to be zero but allow the
c̄a and c̄ s to take any value. If the c̄i ’s are all zero, then preferences are homothetic and σ > 0 is
the within period elasticity of substitution between consumption goods.
    A few comments on our specification of the utility function are in order. First, it nests the
utility specifications of both Ngai and Pissarides (2007) and Kongsamut et al. (2001). The
preferences used by Ngai and Pissarides are the special case in which σ < 1 and c̄a = c̄ s = 0
whereas the preferences used by Kongsamut et al. are the special case in which σ = 1, c̄a < 0
and c̄ s > 0.5
    Second, we have followed Kongsamut et al. (2001) and restricted c̄m to equal zero. We have
experimented with an unrestricted specification where c̄m could take any value, but found that
the goodness of fit hardly changed.
sometimes used to describe this sector, we will later use the term “industry” to describe a generic production
activity and the index i to denote a generic sector. In view of this, “manufacturing” seemed a better choice.
    5
      The preferences used by Kongsamut et al were originally introduced by Stone (1954) and Geary (1950-1951).
The implied demand model is often called the Linear Expenditure System. Deaton and Muellbauer (1980) is a
subsequent classic contribution to the literature on expenditure systems.



                                                                 5
       Third, the above specification assumes that σ is the same among all three consumption
categories, which may seem somewhat restrictive. Instead, we could have considered more
general utility functions with two levels of CES aggregators, each with (possibly) different
elasticities of substitution.6 We did not pursue this possibility further because we found that
our parsimonious class of utility functions includes specifications that provide a very good fit
to the expenditure shares.
       Lastly, as we show in Appendix A, if all individuals have preferences of the above form and
have total consumption expenditure that exceed a minimum level, then aggregate expenditures
are consistent with those for a stand–in household with preferences of the same form.7 This
property extends to settings in which individuals make consumption/savings decisions if there
are complete markets.
       Consider the stand–in household in a setting in which it maximizes lifetime utility given
a market structure that features markets for each of the three consumptions, a labor market,
and a market for borrowing and lending at each date t.8 Our strategy is to focus solely on
the implications for optimal consumption behavior within each period. The advantage of this
“partial” approach is that we do not have to take a stand on the exact nature of intertemporal
opportunities available to the household (i.e., the appropriate interest rates for borrowing and
lending), or to specify how expectations of the future are formed. With these assumptions, if
Ct is observed total expenditure on consumption in period t and prices are given by pit , then it
follows that the consumption choices in period t must solve the following static optimization
problem:
                                                                    X
                                 max u(cat , cmt , c st )   s.t.             pit cit = Ct .
                               cat ,cmt ,c st
                                                                   i=a,m,s

Assuming interior solutions, the first–order conditions for the above maximization problem
are easily derived.9 Some simple algebra yields the following expression for the expenditure
   6
      See Sato (1975) for a characterization of general CES utility functions.
   7
      The precise condition is (1) in Appendix A.
    8
      More generally, we could assume some uncertainty in the economy and allow for a richer set of assets that can
be traded; see for example Atkeson and Ogaki (1996). What matters for our method is that there are spot markets
at each date t for each of the three consumption categories.
    9
      In general, of course, the nonhomotheticity terms in our class of utility functions can lead to corner solutions.
However, this is not relevant for aggregate consumption in a rich country such as the postwar U.S. Looking ahead,
indeed we will find that the stand–in household chooses quantities that are far away from corners.

         In the empirical worked reported below, we will calibrate the parameters of the utility func-
tion by minimizing the distance between the expenditure shares in the data and those gener-
ated by the model. While we have also calibrated the parameters of the utility function via
maximum likelihood, we nonetheless will only report the results from the minimum–distance
exercise. The reason for this is that, as we will see below, our data series are nonstationary, and
the statistical properties of the maximum likelihood estimator are unknown in this case.10 In
any case, we note that the parameter values generated from the minimum distance exercise and
the maximum likelihood estimation are very similar in almost all cases.



3          Final Consumption Expenditure

The final consumption expenditure method originated in the literature on expenditure systems.
It associates the arguments of the utility function with final expenditure of households over dif-
ferent categories of goods and services. Specifically, this method classifies the expenditures on
individual commodities into the three broad sectors of agriculture, manufacturing, and services.
For example, purchases of food from supermarkets will be included in cat , purchases of clothing
from retail establishments will be included in cmt , and purchases of air–travel services will be
included in c st .


3.1         Implementing the Final Consumption Expenditure Specification

The required data in this case are total consumption expenditure and the expenditure shares and
prices for final consumption expenditure on different commodities. The exact data sources can
be found in Appendix B.1. While expenditure shares do not depend on how one splits total ex-
penditures into their price and quantity components, the series for prices do. That is, given total
    10
         For further discussion on these issues, see the review of Barnett and Serletis (2008).


                                                              7
expenditure, different procedures for inferring the consumption quantities will imply different
relative prices. Consistent with BEA measurement, we measure final consumption quantities
using chain–weighted methods. For the period 1947–2007 and for the available commodi-
ties, we obtain annual data on final consumption expenditure, chain–weighted final consump-
tion quantities, and prices from the BEA. Since quantities calculated with the chain–weighted
method are not additive, we use the so called cyclical expansion procedure to aggregate quanti-
ties that are not available from the BEA.11 We assign each commodity to one of the three broad
sectors agriculture, manufacturing, and services. A detailed description of this assignment can
be found in Appendix B.2. Note that for estimating utility function parameters we do not need to
know whether the commodities purchased by the household are produced in the U.S. economy
or imported. All that matters for our exercise is information on total consumption expenditure,
expenditure shares and prices.
       Figures 1–3 show the resulting evolution of the expenditure shares, prices and quantities,
respectively. A few remarks regarding the figures are in order. Looking at Figure 1, we see
that the data are consistent with the standard (asymptotic) pattern of structural transformation:
The expenditure share for services is increasing, while those for agriculture and manufacturing
are decreasing. Turning next to Figure 2, which shows the evolution of prices (with prices in
1947 normalized to 1), we see that while all three prices have increased, the price of services
has increased relative to both manufacturing and agriculture and the price of agriculture has
increased relative to manufacturing. Figure 3 shows real quantities relative to their 1947 values.
Here we see that while the quantities of all three categories have increased, the quantity of
manufacturing has grown the most, while the quantity of agriculture has grown the least.
       Figures 1–3 already suggest some of the qualitative features of the utility specification that
our estimation will select. First, note that the price of services has increased relative to that
of agriculture, while at the same time the quantity of services has also increased substantially
relative to that of agriculture. This is qualitatively inconsistent with a homothetic utility spec-
ification, which would have relative prices and relative quantities move in opposite directions.
In the context of our class of utility functions, reconciling these observations amounts to having

c̄a < 0 and/or c̄ s > 0. Second, as the price of agriculture relative to manufacturing has increased,
the quantity of agriculture relative to manufacturing has decreased. This is consistent with there
being substitutability between agriculture and manufacturing. While to some extent this could
also be accounted for by having c̄a < 0, in the context of our preference specification, it turns
out that σ will come out close to one.


3.2       Results with Final Consumption Expenditure

We now calibrate the parameters of the utility function by minimizing the unweighted squared
differences between the actual and the predicted expenditure shares, given the data for prices
and total final consumption expenditure.
       Table 1 shows the results for three different specifications. In particular, Column (1) shows
the results when we do not impose any restrictions on the parameters other than c̄m = 0. As
can be seen, the implied value of σ is 0.81. Moreover, the signs of the two unrestricted non-
homothetic terms have the pattern that Kongsamut et al. (2001) suggested, that is, c̄a < 0 and
c̄ s > 0. The nonhomotheticities imply that holding relative prices fixed, as total expenditure
grows over time, the consumption share of agriculture will go down while that of services will
go up.12 Figure 4 shows that the fit of the calibrated model from Column (1) to the data on final
consumption expenditure shares is very good indeed.
       While the specification from Column (1) is similar to the Stone–Geary specification im-
posed by Kongsamut et al. (2001), it is not identical, since they assumed σ = 1. It is therefore
  12
    This result is broadly consistent with what panel studies of household consumption find; see Houthakker and
Taylor (1970) for a classic contribution.

interesting to assess the extent to which the specification of Kongsamut et al. (2001) fits the data.
To examine this, the second column redoes the loss minimization procedure, this time imposing
that σ = 1. The nonhomothetic terms retain the same sign configuration, although the mag-
nitude of c̄ s changes quite substantially. This is intuitive because with a higher σ households
react to the large increase in the relative price of services by substituting away from services.
The higher c̄ s term compensates for this. Figure 5 shows that the specification of Column (2)
fits virtually as well as the specification of Column (1). This is consistent with the fact that the
loss reported in Table 1 hardly increases.
       Several papers estimated the linear expenditure systems that are implied by the Stone–Geary
utility specification. Our results are most closely related to those of a literature that used time
series data for final consumption expenditure per capita. A prominent example is Pollak and
Wales (1969), who used US data 1948-1965 on the four broad categories food, clothing, shelter,
and miscellaneous. Pollak and Wales also found that the linear expenditure system fits the data
very well and that nonhomotheticity terms are important.13
       We conclude that when using data on final consumption expenditure, the data broadly sup-
port the Stone–Geary specification of Kongsamut et al. (2001). Having said that, note that they

                                              pat c̄a + p st c̄ s = 0,

which is required for the existence of a generalized balanced growth path in their model.14 This
condition is rather trivially not consistent with the data we use. The simplest way to see this is
to look at Figure 2, which clearly shows that p st /pat has been steadily increasing since 1947,
whereas, of course, c̄a and c̄ s are constants.


3.3       Income versus Price Effects with Final Consumption Expenditure

It is of interest to look more closely at the importance of income versus relative price effects in
accounting for the observed changes in the shares of final consumption expenditures. To put the
size of the calibrated nonhomotheticity terms of Column (1) into perspective, Table 2 reports
the c̄i ’s relative to final consumption expenditure from the data. Most importantly, rows three
and four show that in 1947 both nonhomotheticity terms were sizeable compared to the actual
consumption quantities of agriculture and services. This suggests that income effects play a
very important role in shaping the shares of final consumption expenditure.
       To explore further the importance of income versus relative price effects, Figure 6 shows the
fit of the expenditure shares implied by the parameters of Column (1) when total expenditure
changes as dictated by the data but relative prices are held constant at their 1947 values. We
can see that although the fit deteriorates somewhat, the model still captures the vast majority of
  14
    Given the nonhomotheticity terms, their model does not have a balanced growth path in the usual sense of
the word. They therefore consider a generalized balanced growth path, which they define as a growth path along
which aggregate variables such as the real interest rate are constant.

the changes in the expenditure shares. The main discrepancies between the data and the model
are that the share of services now increases somewhat more than in the data and the share of
agriculture now decreases somewhat more than in the data. These discrepancies are intuitive
since the price of services increases relative to agriculture during our sample period, and would
therefore work to partially offset the changes associated with the income effects.
   A second way of judging the importance of income versus relative price effects is to ask how
well a homothetic specification can fit the data, since such a specification necessarily implies
that total expenditure has no effect on expenditure shares. Column (3) presents the results
of a specification in which the nonhomothetic terms are restricted to equal zero. We can see
that the calibrated elasticity term σ drops from 0.81 to 0.21. Moreover, the loss more than
triples, suggesting that the fit gets considerably worse. Figure 7 confirms this by showing that
the fit becomes fairly bad for agriculture relative to the previous two specifications. Absent
income effects and given a rising relative price of services, the way in which the homothetic
specification can account for the large rise in the expenditure share for services is by having
very little substitutability. But, as noted earlier, absent income effects, fitting the expenditure
share for agriculture requires some substitutability. Hence, the model without income effects
cannot do a good job of matching all expenditure shares.

                                                                      13
    We conclude that the income effects associated with the nonhomotheticities are the domi-
nant source of the observed structural transformation in the shares of final consumption expen-
diture.



4    Consumption Value Added

Many multi–sector general equilibrium models represent the sectoral production functions in
value added form, in which case the arguments of the utility function necessarily represent
the value added components of final expenditure. Individual industries are then classified into
the three broad sectors agriculture, manufacturing, and services, and a sector is a collection
of industries, with sector value added being the sum of the value added of the industries be-
longing to it. Effectively, this way of proceeding breaks consumption spending into its value
added components. For example, purchases from supermarkets will then be broken down into
the components of cat (food), cmt (processing of the food) and c st (retail services of the su-
permarket). Similarly, purchases of clothing will be broken down into the components of cat
(raw materials, say cotton), cmt (processing of cotton into clothing) and c st (retail services), and
purchases of air–travel services will be broken down into the components of cmt (fuel) and c st
(transportation services).
    Whether one prefers to use final consumption expenditure or consumption value added will
depend on data availability and the specific application. While we will discuss the relative
merits of each method in more detail in subsection 5.2 below, there are two key points that we
want to emphasize at this point. First, there is no reason to believe that the parameters of the
utility function are invariant to the definition of commodities. Looking ahead, the distinction
between the two different specifications will turn out to be very significant, since we will find
that they imply preferences with very different qualitative properties. Second, and related, it
is important to emphasize that the two specifications are two different representations of the
same underlying data. Put differently, the data on final consumption expenditure are linked to
the data on consumption value added through complicated input–output relationships, and vice
versa. Our results should therefore not be interpreted as implying that different data sets provide


                                                 14
different parameter estimates. Rather, they tell us that different transformations of given data
have different properties.


4.1       Implementing the Consumption Value Added Specification

We now describe how to construct the relevant data when one identifies the three consumption
categories with their respective value added components. The exact data sources can be found in
Appendix B.1. Similar to the case of final expenditure shares, there is annual data available from
the BEA on value added by industry, as well as real value added and prices. As we mentioned
above, the consumption value added method assigns industries, instead of commodities, to the
three broad sectors. Appendix B.2 describes the details of this assignment.
       Although readily available, the data on value added and prices are not sufficient for our pur-
poses. The reason is that value added data come from the production side of the national income
and products accounts, and so they contain both consumption and investment. It is therefore
necessary to devise a method to extract the consumption component from the production value
added of each sector. This has not been sufficiently appreciated in the literature, which often
proceeds by assuming that all investment is done in manufacturing.15 While the problem with
this assumption may not have been readily apparent in the past, recent data make it clear that
this assumption is problematic. The reason for this is that in the BEA data, manufacturing pro-
duction value added has been consistently smaller than investment since 1999. We therefore
need to properly extract the consumption component from the production value added in each
sector. One contribution of our paper is to lay out a procedure that achieves this.
       To carry out this extraction one needs to combine the value added data from the income
side of the NIPA with the final expenditure data from the expenditure side of the NIPA. The
complete details of this procedure are fairly involved, and so we relegate its description to
Appendix C. Here we provide just a rough sketch of the procedure. A key difference between
value added data from the income side and final expenditure data from the expenditure side
is that the former are measured in what the BEA calls “producer’s prices” whereas the latter
are measured in “purchaser’s prices”. From a practical perspective, the key difference is that

purchaser’s prices include distribution costs whereas producer’s price do not (distribution costs
are sales taxes and transport, wholesale, and retail services). For example, in the case of a shirt
purchased from a retail outlet, the purchaser’s price is the price paid by the consumer in the
retail outlet whereas the producer’s price is the price of the shirt when it leaves the factory.
       In order to break final consumption expenditure into its value added components the first
step therefore is to convert final consumption expenditure measured in purchaser’s prices into
those measured in producer’s prices. This amounts to removing distribution costs from final
consumption expenditure on goods and moving them into expenditure on services. Appendix
C.1 explains the details of this calculation. Once this is done the second step is to use the
input–output tables to determine the sectoral inputs in terms of value added that are required to
deliver the final consumption expenditure. This involves an object called the total requirement
matrix which is derived from the input–output tables. Appendix C.2 explains the details of this
procedure.
       Two points are worth stressing. First, since we are interested in the time series proper-
ties of consumption value added, and the structure of input–output relationships changes over
time, an important feature of our calculation is that we use all annual input–output tables to-
gether all benchmark tables that are available for the period 1947–2007. Second, when we
break final consumption expenditure into its value added components we follow the BEA and
treat imported goods as if they were produced domestically with the same technology that the
U.S. uses to produce them. Given this assumption, we again do not have to stand on whether
intermediate goods are produced domestically or imported.16
       Having broken final consumption expenditure into its value added components, we obtain
data on consumption value added expenditure shares and chain–weighted prices and quantities,
which are displayed in Figures 8–10. Note that these figures display the same qualitative pattern
for consumption value added shares that we saw in the analogous figure for final consumption
expenditure shares. Hence, both representations are consistent with the stylized facts about
structural transformation. However, although the shares display similar qualitative behavior,
there are some important differences in the behavior of relative prices and quantities. First, Fig-
  16
       Appendix C.2 explains this point in more detail.

ure 9 shows that while the price of services still increased the most, the price of manufacturing
now increased by more than that of agriculture. Second, Figure 10 shows that relative quantities
behave very differently. Whereas Figure 3 indicated substantial changes in relative quantities,
Figure 10 suggests that the relative quantities of manufacturing and services now hardly change
over the entire period, while the relative quantity of agriculture remains fairly constant after
about 1970.
   Given that relative prices changed substantially, the near constancy of relative quantities,
particularly of manufacturing relative to services, suggests a very low degree of substitutability
between the different components of consumption value added. Moreover, the near constancy
of the relative agricultural quantity after 1970 suggests that nonhomotheticities will not play as
important a role as before. We will return to the significance of these observations below when
we present the calibration results.


4.2    Results with Consumption Value Added

We again choose parameters so as to minimize a loss function which is the sum of the squared
difference between actual and predicted expenditure shares. Results are contained in Table 3.
Column (1) reports the parameter estimates when we impose no restrictions. Strikingly, the
value of σ is calibrated to be equal to 0, which in the absence of nonhomotheticities is the
Leontief specification. The nonhomothetic terms have the same signs as before. Figure 11
shows that based on the estimates in Column (1), the fit of the model to the expenditure share
data is again very good.

   As before, it is of interest to ask how important income and relative price effects are in
accounting for the observed changes in the shares of consumption value added. One simple and
revealing comparison about the relative importance of income effects for the two different data
sets is to look at the size of the calibrated c̄i ’s relative to total consumption expenditure from
the data. The first two rows of Table 4 show that these ratios are now considerably smaller than
in the case of final consumption expenditure, suggesting that income effects will be much less
important. However, one needs to be somewhat careful with drawing immediate conclusions
because the third row of the table shows that in 1947 the agricultural consumption value added
from the data is now fairly close to c̄a . Intuitively, this can be understood by going back to
Figure 10 above, which showed that the quantity of agricultural consumption value did not
increase in the first part of our sample. Given that σ = 0, our calibrated utility function delivers
this by having agricultural consumption value added close to c̄a initially.
   To explore more systematically the importance of income versus relative price effects, Fig-
ure 12 shows the fit of the expenditure shares implied by the parameters of Column (1) when
relative prices change as dictated by the data while total consumption expenditures are held con-
stant at their 1947 value. While the fit deteriorates somewhat, it remains reasonably good. This
suggests that relative price effects are the dominant force behind the changes in the expenditure
shares of consumption value added. A second way of establishing this is to evaluate the ability
of a homothetic specification to fit the data. To examine this, Column (2) in Table 3 presents
the results under the restriction c̄a = c̄m = c̄ s = 0. While the loss doubles the relative weights
hardly change compared to Column (1). Figure 13 plots the expenditure share predicted by
the homothetic specification. We can see that compared to the nonhomothetic specification of
Figure 11, the fit remains very good.

                                                     19
   We conclude that the consumption value added data broadly support the homothetic pref-
erence specification used by Ngai and Pissarides, though in the somewhat extreme form of a
Leontief specification, i.e. σ = 0. Since introspection would suggest substantial willingness
to substitute across many commodities, some readers might question the empirical plausibility
of preferences that do not permit any substitution across the consumption value added cate-
gories agriculture, manufacturing, and services. It is therefore important to understand exactly
what the result σ = 0 means. Although having σ = 0 implies that there is no substitutability
across the three categories, it is completely consistent with there being substantial substitution
within each of these categories. In particular, since the categories are quite broad, having σ = 0
does not in any sense imply that there is no substitutability between all the different goods and
services that individuals consume.
   A simple example may be useful. Most readers will agree that there is some substitutability
between the two activities of going to the movies and going to sporting events. When we
represent these activities in consumption value added terms, we see that both of them involve
some consumption of goods (e.g., the use of buildings) and some consumption of services (e.g.,
actors and athletes producing entertainment services). To us it seems reasonable to think that
the key dimensions of substitution are within these two value added categories, i.e., that the
key substitution is between the uses of buildings or the uses of athletes’ and entertainers’ time,
rather than between goods and services per se. While this is not to suggest that one cannot think
of specific examples with some substitution between specific goods and specific services, the
key point we want to make is that there is likely to be considerably more substitutability within
each of the value added categories.
   Our conclusion that a low σ provides the best fit to value added data is related to independent
research by Buera and Kaboski (2009). These authors ask whether there are parameters for
which a canonical model of structural transformation can match the value added shares by
sector between 1870 and 2000. They take as given initial GDP, a time series of overall TFP, and
proxies for the price indices of the three sectors. They do not use information on investment,
total consumption, and output from data, but let their model choose these quantities under
the assumption that all model investment is done in the model sector manufacturing. Their

preferred choice for σ comes out fairly low as well (σ = 0.5), but in contrast to us they conclude
that their model cannot provide a good fit to the data.
         This raises the question why the conclusions of the two studies are different. Upon closer
inspection, there are several potentially important differences. To begin with, Buera–Kaboski
consider data at ten–year intervals from 1870 to 2000, which cover a much larger range of
expenditure shares than our data. Moreover, since our data are not available prior 1947, they
use data for sector expenditure shares and prices that are not necessarily mutually consistent.17
Lastly, Buera–Kaboski do not calibrate the utility function given the expenditure shares of
consumption value added, prices, and total consumption, but they determine it together with
the sector production functions so as to match the shares of production value added.
         To best evaluate what drives the differences between the conclusions of the two studies,
it would be natural to redo our calibration exercise for 1947–2007 using the data of Buera–
Kaboski. Unfortunately, this is not possible, since as noted earlier, investment has exceeded
manufacturing value added since 1999, implying that we cannot extract the consumption part of
production value added following their assumption that all investment is done in manufacturing.
Independently of this, we do note that the series used by Buera–Kaboski to proxy for relative
prices do display very different behavior than the true relative price series for value added over
the period 1947–2007, suggesting that data differences probably play a significant role.



5         Discussion

5.1         Comparing the Results

Both calibration exercises yield utility specifications that provide very good fits to the data.
Somewhat surprisingly, in one case it is the Stone–Geary specification used by Kongsamut et
al. (2001) that provides a very good fit to the data, whereas in the other case it is the homothetic
specification used by Ngai and Pissarides (2007). The importance of relative price and income
effects in accounting for changes in expenditure shares are therefore dramatically different in the
    17
     Buera–Kaboski use the implicit deflator of services in NIPA and the producer price index of finished goods
from the BLS. The former is based on gross sales while the latter is based on final expenditure. In contrast, we use
price indices that are based on value added.


                                                        22
two cases. In the case of final consumption expenditure, income effects are the dominant force
behind changes in the expenditure shares, whereas in the case of consumption value added,
relative price effects are the dominant force.
   Given the very different results for the calibrated utility specifications in the two cases, it
is of interest to ask if there is any intuition that would support the nature of the differences.
In particular, we would like to understand why the final consumption expenditure specification
exhibits a greater degree of substitution and a more important role for nonhomotheticities. The
intuition is sharpest if we focus on two consumption items: food from supermarkets and meals
from restaurants, though it easily extends to a larger set of goods and services.
   The intuition for greater substitutability in the final consumption expenditure specification
comes from the fact that this specification may place items with similar underlying charac-
teristics into different categories. To stay with our example, this method counts food from
supermarkets in agriculture, while meals from restaurants are counted in services. One would
expect there to be substitutability between the two items because they both use the intermediate
input food. In contrast, in the consumption value added specification, all agricultural inputs into
food production are counted in the agriculture sector, removing this source of substitutability.
   The differing importance of nonhomotheticities is also intuitive. In the final consumption
expenditure specification, for example, it is natural to think that food from supermarkets is a
necessity, thereby leading to a negative value for c̄a . Similarly, it is natural to think that many
services such as restaurant meals are more of a luxury, thereby leading to a positive value for c̄ s .
However, this reasoning does not apply to the consumption value added specification, since the
category labeled agriculture now contains the agricultural inputs that went both into the produc-
tion of “necessary” food and “luxury” restaurant meals. It follows that the nonhomotheticities
should be less apparent in the consumption value added specification.
   The above discussion is somewhat reminiscent of the work of Lancaster (1966). He argued
that preferences should be specified over the primitive characteristics that consumers value,
with the idea that individual goods are themselves bundles of characteristics. This is potentially
important if we think that the set of characteristics in a given good may change over time.
For example, processed food is a complex bundle of characteristics, and many of them have


                                                 23
changed over time. If preferences are really over characteristics and the set of characteristics
in various goods are changing over time, this may manifest itself as changes in preferences if
we specify them over goods instead of characteristics. While both of our specifications are at a
very high level of aggregation relative to what Lancaster proposed, one might suspect that the
consumption value added specification would be more stable over longer periods because it has
less bundling than the final consumption expenditure specification.
   Be that as it may, a key message of our calibration results is that the modeler must be very
explicit about how the arguments of the utility function are being defined, since different choices
imply very different parameter values. It follows that researchers must be very careful when
comparing results across studies that implicitly use different definitions of the arguments in the
utility function in the context of studying structural transformation. This in turn has important
implications for the practice of importing parameter estimates across studies. For example, one
cannot use data sets such as the Consumption Expenditure Survey to calibrate utility function
parameters in a model that is defining commodities in terms of value added.
   Although we have focused exclusively on preferences in our analysis, there are some ob-
vious conclusions to be drawn regarding the role of technological factors in the process of
structural transformation. In particular, given that the relative quantities of consumption value
added stayed roughly unchanged while the expenditure shares changed considerably, structural
transformation will require a force that changes relative prices of value added at the sector
level. Examples are technological progress that is uneven at the sector level as suggested by
Ngai and Pissarides (2007) and differences in capital shares at the sector level, as suggested by
Acemoglu and Guerrieri (2008). In future work, we plan to quantify the relative importance of
each of these forces for changes in relative prices.


5.2    Relative Merits of the Two Specifications

Each of the two specifications that we have considered has some relative merits over the al-
ternative. One key issue is data availability. The relative advantage of the final consumption
expenditure specification is that data on final consumption expenditure by category are readily
available, not only from individual country sources but also in commonly used cross-country


                                                24
data sets such as the Penn World Table, which measure final consumption expenditure, as op-
posed to production. In contrast, consumption value added data is not readily available. To be
sure, data on production value added by sector is readily available, but as we argued above, this
is not the same as consumption value added.
       When one thinks about integrating the consumer analysis into a general equilibrium setting
that has a production side, then the relative merits are reversed. If, on the one hand, the argu-
ments of the utility function are consumption value added, then one can include production in
a consistent fashion by assuming value added production functions at the sector level. These,
in turn, are easily connected to data since data on value added by sector are readily available.
If, on the other hand, the arguments of the utility function are final consumption expenditure
across categories of goods and services, then one either needs to write down a production struc-
ture that captures the complexities of the input–output relationships at the sector level, or one
needs to find a representation of production that isolates the contribution of capital and labor to
the production of final expenditure categories. While this can be done, it is more difficult than
working directly with sectoral value added production functions.18
       Additionally, to the extent that one desires utility functions that are consistent with aggrega-
tion, given our estimates, the consumption value added specification is preferable. This is due to
the relative unimportance of nonhomotheticities in this case, implying that the utility specifica-
tion for consumption value added aggregates for a larger set of individual household consump-
tion expenditure than the utility specification for final consumption expenditure.19 Moreover,
the homothetic specification from Column (2) of Table 3 still provided a very good fit in the
case of consumption value added, and in this case aggregation always holds.


5.3       Additional Measurement Issues

In this subsection we note five measurement issues that we have abstracted from, but which we
believe should be mentioned as qualifications to our results.
       The first issue is that government services are often badly measured (e.g., because value

      Valentinyi and Herrendorf (2008) showed how to construct sectoral production functions that use capital and
labor to produce final expenditure by broad category.

added is “approximated” by the corresponding wage bill). One may therefore wonder to what
extent our estimation results are driven by the behavior of badly measured government services.
To address this point, we have redone all of the estimations without government services.20
Naturally, this reduces the quantity of services consumed, and so it lowers the estimates of the
relative weight on services and the nonhomotheticity term c̄ s . But the important question is
what happens to the estimates of the elasticity of substitution and the nonhomotheticity term
for agriculture. Using consumption value added data, we find that these results are literally
unchanged, while using final consumption expenditure data the results are affected only some-
what.21 We conclude from this exercise that our results are not chiefly driven by the behavior
of badly measured government services.
       Second, and related, an important issue when examining time series changes in prices and
quantities is the extent to which the data take proper account of quality improvements. Failure
to do so will bias the decomposition of expenditure into price and quantity components. A key
limitation of the official data that we have used in our analysis is that effectively no corrections
are made to allow for quality improvements in services. While this is a common problem that
we cannot do anything about, we think that it is worth keeping in mind.
  20
      Our initial results implicitly assumed that households were purchasing government services at the price p s . In
contrast, here we remove government services and implicitly assume that whatever utility individuals obtain from
these services does not affect the marginal rate of substitution between categories of private consumption.
   21
      The precise results can be found in Appendix D.


                                                         26
       Third, consumption of durable goods typically does not equal expenditure on durable goods.
For housing, which is by far the most prominent example of durables, the BEA takes account
of this and imputes the rents for owner–occupied houses. For all other durables, the BEA
reports expenditure (or value added) only, which forces us to associate the expenditures on
these durables with current consumption. This implies, for example, that current period utility
from automobiles is derived solely from current period sales (or production) of automobiles,
and so we do not attribute any current period utility flow to the stock of automobiles purchased
in previous periods. Because we are focused on longer term trends in aggregate data, this is not
likely to be as serious as it would be in looking at individual data, or business cycle fluctuations;
but it is an issue worth noting.
       Forth, our model has abstracted from home production. Aguiar and Hurst (2007) and Ramey
and Francis (2009) both documented a sharp drop in time devoted to home production associ-
ated with the dramatic increase in the participation rate of married women. To the extent that
this has led to a substitution away from home produced services toward market produced ser-
vices, our data may reflect an upward bias in the extent of the increase in the expenditure share
of services.
       Fifth, and related, one issue with sectoral data is the possibility that reallocation of resources
across sectors reflects a relabeling of activity due to outsourcing, as opposed to fundamental
shifts of economic activity across sectors. For example, if a car manufacturer changes from
having in–house security guards at its establishments to purchasing security services from an
outside firm, the data will record this as a movement of value added across sectors.22 This phe-
nomenon will bias the measurement of changes in the expenditure shares of consumption value
added. However, this bias is not likely to be a major driving force of structural transformation.
The main reason is that industry classifications are done at the establishment level, implying
that all in–house services provided at a central administrative office (headquarters) or a separate
service–providing unit are always classified as service industries.
       There are two additional ways of establishing that outsourcing is not the major force behind
structural transformation. First, Table 5 decomposes the accumulated increase in the expen-
  22
       Fuchs (1968) suggested that this is one of the driving forces behind the process of structural transformation.



                                                          27
diture share of service consumption value added into the contributions of ten subcategories of
services, where outsourced services are part of the subcategory Professional and Business Ser-
vices. Although this category is the second biggest contributor to the overall increase in the
expenditure share of services, more than half of the increase is accounted for by other cate-
gories. Moreover, it is reasonable to think that a substantial share of the increase in business
and professional services reflects purchases directly made by consumers, in which case they
would not be subject to outsourcing. A second way of establishing that outsourcing is not the
major force behind structural transformation is to look at what happened to final consumption
expenditure, instead of consumption value added, as final consumption expenditure are not af-
fected by outsourcing. To stay with the example of the car manufacturer, all that matters with
final consumption expenditure is how much is spent on purchases of cars. Holding the price and
quantity of security services fixed, it does not matter if the security services that are implicitly
reflected in the price of cars were supplied in–house or outsourced. The fact that the changes in
the shares are very evident in the final consumption expenditure data confirms that the process
of structural transformation is not mainly a process of outsourcing.



6    Conclusion

What utility function should one use in applied work on structural transformation and related is-
sues? This paper sought to provide an answer to this simple question by examining the behavior
of household expenditure shares for the US economy over the period 1947 to 2007. The first
contribution of this paper is to clarify that given common practice in specifying multi-sector
general equilibrium models, this question requires two answers, one each for two different
methods of defining commodities in such models.
    The second contribution of this paper is to supply the two answers. A priori there is little
guidance as to how different (or similar) the two answers might be. It is very noteworthy that
we find the answers to be dramatically different in terms of their basic properties. Interestingly,
each of the answers takes a very simple form. If one adopts the final consumption expenditure
specification, then a Stone-Geary utility function provides a very good fit to the US time se-


                                                28
ries data. If instead one adopts the consumption value added specification, then a homothetic
specification of the Leontief type provides a very good fit to the data.
   A third contribution of the paper, which is a necessary intermediate input into the calibra-
tion of the utility function based on consumption value added, was to develop and execute a
procedure for producing time series data on consumption value added. This requires extracting
the component of total value added by sector that corresponds to consumption value added.
   While the utility functions that we calibrate are specifically relevant for models of structural
transformation, some of the basic messages of the analysis are much more general. Specifi-
cally, researchers must be careful to apply consistent definitions of commodities on both the
household and production sides when connecting models with data in any multi–sector general
equilibrium analysis. Changing the true definition of what is meant, for example, by the label
“services” has implications not only on the household side for what form of utility function is
appropriate, but also on the production side for such things as the measurement of productiv-
ity growth. This has important implications for comparing results across studies and for the
practice of importing parameter values across studies.
   There are several dimensions along which it will be important to extend the analysis car-
ried out here. First, in this paper we have only analyzed the evolution of expenditure shares and
prices in one country – the postwar U.S. It is also of interest to extend this analysis to a larger set
of countries, in particular to situations which feature a larger range of real incomes. This will be
useful in assessing the extent to which one can account for the process of structural transforma-
tion with stable preferences. Second, the work reported here focused solely on the household
side. The next step in uncovering the key forces that underlie structural transformation will be
to integrate this analysis with an analysis of the production side of the economy.

                               "     1                             1                               1                     # σ
                                                       σ−1                            σ−1                             σ−1 σ−1
                max                ωaσ (cna   +   c̄a ) σ    +   ωmσ (cnm    +   c̄m ) σ    +   ω sσ (cns   +   c̄ s ) σ

                               s.t.     pa cna + pm cnm + p s cns ≤ Cn .


Let the parameters and the income distribution be such that for all n ∈ {1, ..., N} household
expenditure exceed a minimum level:

                                                                  X
                                                      Cn >                 pi max{−c̄i , 0}.                                    (1)

Then the solution to each household’s problem is interior and the first–order conditions are

Appendix B: Data Sources and Sector Assignment

B.1: Data Sources

All data are for the U.S. during 1947–2007.
       We calculate a per capita quantity by dividing the total quantity by the population size. We
take the population size from Table 7.1: “Selected Per Capita Product and Income Series in
Current and Chained Dollars”.
       The construction of final consumption expenditure data is based on standard NIPA tables
from the BEA. We use the most recent NIPA data released in August 2009 which incorporates
the last comprehensive revision. In particular, we use data from the following tables:

       • Table 2.4.3: “Real Personal Consumption Expenditures by Type of Product, Quantity
         Indexes”; Table 2.4.5: “Personal Consumption Expenditures by Type of Product”.

       • Table 3.10.3: “Real Government Consumption Expenditures and General Government
         Gross Output, Quantity Indexes”; Table 3.10.5: “Government Consumption Expenditures
         and General Government Gross Output”

       The construction of production value added data by sector is based on the Annual Industry
Accounts, which contain current dollar value added and quantity indices by industry based on
chain weighted methods. The value added by industry data is consistent with the NAICS for
the entire period 1947–2007.23
       The construction of consumption value added (as opposed to production value added) is
based on two main data sources: the annual expenditure data described above and the total
  23
       http://www.bea.gov/industry/gpotables/AllTables.zip

                                                    35
requirement matrices from the IO Tables. In the next subsection, we describe in detail how
these two data sources are combined to obtain consumption value added. Here we just describe
the exact data sources. There are benchmark IO Tables and annual IO Tables. Benchmark
IO Tables are available for 1947, 1958, 1963, 1967, 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997 and
2002.24 Annual IO Tables are available for each year during the period 1998–2007.25 An
important additional data source are the so called “Bridge Tables for Personal Consumption
Expenditure”, which are available for the 1997 and 2002 benchmark IO Tables. Bridge Tables
link IO Tables with the standard expenditure data of the BEA. In particular, they report how
personal consumption expenditure in the IO Tables are related to those in the BEA expenditure
tables. If we don’t have IO Tables for a particular year, then we use linear interpolation between
the years for which IO Tables are available.


B.2: Sector Assignment

When we use final consumption expenditure data, the three sectors contain the following BEA
commodities:


       • Agriculture: “food and beverages purchased for off-premises consumption”

       • Manufacturing: “durable goods”; “nondurable goods” excluding “food and beverages
         purchased for off-premises consumption”

       • Services: “services”; “government consumption expenditure”


       When we use value added data, the three sectors contain the following BEA industries:


       • Agriculture: “farms”; “forestry, fishing, and related activities”

       • Manufacturing: “construction”; “manufacturing”; “mining”

       • Services: all other industries including “government industries”

Appendix C: Calculating Consumption Value Added

C.1: Constructing Final Expenditure in Producer’s Prices

C.1.1: Disaggregation to six sectors

To obtain final consumption expenditure in producer’s prices from the available data on final
consumption expenditure in purchaser’s prices, we need to remove the distribution costs from
the different goods categories and move them to services. For two reasons, this requires further
disaggregation. First, we calculate the distribution costs for retail, wholesale and transportation
services from the expenditure on the sector Trade and Transport. We therefore, need to sepa-
rate Trade and Transport from the rest of services. Second, the expenditure on mining involve
distribution costs whereas those on construction do not, so we need to separate the two from
other manufacturing. We therefore consider the following six sectors: Agriculture, Mining,
Construction, Manufacturing, Trade and Transport, and Services excluding Trade and Trans-
port, which we index by i ∈ {Ag, Mi, Co, Ma, T T, S e}, which aggregate to our model sectors in
the obvious way: a = {Ag}, m = {Mi, Co, Ma}, s = {T T, S e}. Note that while we use the BEA
classification for Agriculture, Mining, Construction, and Manufacturing , the sector Trade and
Transport combines “Wholesale Trade”, “Retail Trade” and “Transportation and Warehousing”.
   We should mention a potential problem that arises from the reclassification of industries
over time. In particular, while the BEA now publishes GDP by industry data based on the
NAICS for the whole period 1947–2007, it still publishes the underlying input–output tables for
the subperiod 1947–1977 based on the different SIC’s. Fortunately, many of the reclassifications
from the SIC’s to the NAICS happened at finer levels of disaggregation than we study here, and
so they do not affect the aggregates of the six sectors we have just introduced. However, there
are some exceptions that we need to reclassify to make the input–output tables consistent with
the GDP by industry data. The most important example is the “Publishing Industries”, which
the SIC has as manufacturing industry and the NAICS has as a service industry.


C.1.2: Removing distribution costs from personal consumption expenditure

We now explain how to remove distribution costs from personal consumption expenditure.

                                                37
      The expenditure side of GDP values personal consumption expenditure at purchaser’s prices
and it disaggregates them into the expenditure on goods, trade and transportation, and services
excluding trade and transportation:


                                  PC Pu = PCGs
                                            Pu
                                               + PCTPuT + PCSPue .


Goods consist of “durable and nondurable goods” excluding “food and beverages purchased
for off-premises consumption”, trade and transportation consists of “public transportation”, and
services consist of “services” excluding “public transportation”.
      We start by removing distribution costs from personal consumption expenditure on goods.
To go from purchaser’s to producer’s prices, we calculate the distribution margins DMPCGs by
using the fact that in the IO Tables personal consumption expenditure on trade and transporta-
tion consists of all transportation expenditure whereas PCTPuT consists only of “public trans-
portation” that households explicitly purchase. Hence, the difference between the two equals
the distribution costs of goods that household purchase indirectly when purchasing goods, and
so:

                                                   (PCTIOT − PCTPuT )
                  DMPCGs =                                                             ,

      We continue by removing distribution costs from personal consumption expenditure on ser-
vices. This is straightforward because the IO Tables suggest that personal consumption expen-
diture on services involve negligible distribution costs. Therefore:


                                             PCSPre = PCSPue .


                                      Pr                                                 Pr
      Given that we have calculated PCGs , we now disaggregate it into the components PC Ag ,
   Pr     Pr        Pr                                IO                           IO

           Pr        Pr                                                                   Pr
between PC Ag and PC Ma . First, we calculate expenditures on food at producer prices, PC Food .

                                                   38
Expenditure on food is “food and beverages purchased for off-premises consumption”. We
remove distribution costs by applying the distribution margin of goods that we calculated above,
   Pr            PC     Pu                    Pr
PC Food = (1 − DMGs )PC Food . Next, since PC Food contains both unprocessed and processed
food, we need to take processed food out to obtain the expenditure on agricultural commodities.
               IO
We use that PC Ag are the expenditure on agricultural goods without processed food. Defining
        IO     Pr
Φ1 ≡ PC Ag /PC Food , we have


                                            Pr         Pr
                                         PC Ag = Φ1 PC Food .


   In sum, the components of personal consumption expenditure in producer’s prices are ob-
tained as follows:

                                PCSPre = PCSPue .


C.1.3: Removing distribution costs from government consumption expenditure

We now explain how to remove distribution costs from final expenditure on government con-
sumption.
   In the IO Tables, the general government appears as a production industry and as a com-
modity. In the expenditure side of GDP, government consumption expenditure at purchaser’s
prices are defined as the gross output of the general government industry minus own account
investment and sales to other sectors.
   The treatment of the gross output of the general government industry changed in 1998.
Before 1998, it was defined as its value added GCVPuA (compensation of general government
employees plus consumption of general government fixed capital). All intermediate inputs


                                                    39
were consequently treated as final government expenditure on these goods. Since 1998, the
gross output of the general government industry has included intermediate goods, that is, it is
defined as the sum of value added GCVPuA , purchased intermediate goods, GCGs
                                                                           Pu
                                                                              , and purchased
intermediate services, GCSPue .
                                                                                      IO
   We start with the period 1947–1997. During this period, the IO Tables show that GC Ag and
   IO                         Pr      Pr
GC Mi are small, so we set GC Ag = GC Mi = 0. The distribution margins of government con-
sumption expenditure in the 1997 IO Tables on average equal 18% of the distribution margins
of personal consumption expenditure, so we set DMGCGs = 0.18 · DMPCGs . Next we calculate
  Pr
GCCo . The raw IO Tables distinguish between government expenditure on “maintenance and
repair construction” and on “new construction”. First, we calculate

                   government expenditure on maintenance and repair construction
            Φ2 ≡                                                                 ,
                              depreciation on government structures

where the depreciation on government structures is taken from Table 7.3: “Current-Cost De-
preciation of Government Fixed Assets” of the BEA Fixed Assets Tables. We then calculate
  Pr
GCCo by multiplying Φ2 with depreciation on government structures.
   In sum, for the period 1947–1997, we calculate the variables of interest as:


              Pr
           GC Ag = 0,                                                                     (2a)
              Pr
           GC Mi = 0,                                                                     (2b)
             Pr
           GCCo = Φ2 Depreciation on government structures,                               (2c)
             Pr                  Pu     Pr
          GC Ma = (1 − DMGCGs )GCGs − GCCo ,                                              (2d)

          GCTPrT = DMGCGs GCGs
                            Pu
                               ,                                                          (2e)

           GCSPre = GCVPuA + GCSPue − Sales to other sectors − Own account investment.     (2f)


The rationale behind the fourth equation is that own account investment typically involves
goods, so it has to be taken out of government intermediate good expenditure. The fifth equa-
tion is just an implication of the fourth equation. The last equation expresses that government
expenditure on services are equal to the value added representing the service flow from gov-


                                               40
ernment capital and employees plus the services purchased as intermediate input net of what is
invested on own account sold to other sectors, which typically are general government services.
The equation reflects that typically services do not have distribution costs, so services evaluated
at producer’s and purchaser’s prices are the same.
   For the period 1998–2007, government consumption expenditure in the IO Tables almost
exclusively consist of expenditure on general government services. Since services have no
distribution costs, we set:


                             Pr      Pr     Pr      Pr
                          GC Ag = GC Mi = GCCo = GC Ma = GCTPrT = 0,

                          GC Pr = GC Pu .



C.2: Linking Consumption Expenditures to Value Added

The total requirement matrix (henceforth TR Matrix) links the income and the expenditure side
of GDP. We now explain how to use the TR Matrix to obtain the value added in producer’s
prices that are generated by the final expenditure on consumption in producer’s prices, which
we have just constructed in the previous subsection. We use the language and the notation
of the BEA to the extent possible. For further explanation see ten Raa (2005) and Bureau of
Economic Analysis (2006).
   The way in which the TR Matrix is calculated changed in 1972. So for years prior to 1972,
the IO Tables assumed that each industry produces one commodity and that each commodity is
produced in exactly one industry. For years after 1972 the IO Tables have taken account of the
fact that industries can produce more than one commodity and that the same commodity can be
produced in different industries.
   We start by explaining the TR Matrix prior to 1972. We denote the number of industries by
n, which before 1972 equals the number of commodities. Domestically produced commodities
are purchased either by domestic industries (intermediate expenditure) or by final users (final
uses or final expenditure). Final uses include both domestic final uses and exports, where
exports can be either intermediate or final foreign uses. Domestic industries produce gross
output and the difference between gross output and intermediate expenditure is industry value

                                                41
added.
       Let A denote the (n × n) transaction matrix.26 Rows are associated with commodities and
columns with industries: entry i j shows the dollar amount of commodity i that industries j
uses per dollar of output it produces. Note that these commodities may have been produced
domestically or imported. Let q denote the (n × 1) output vector of domestically produced
commodities. Element i records the sum of the dollar amounts of commodity i that are delivered
to other domestic industries as intermediate inputs and to final uses. Let g denote the (n × 1)
industry output vector. Element j records the dollar amount of output of industry j. Let e denote
the (n × 1) vector of expenditures on final uses. Element i records the dollar amount of final
uses of the domestically produced commodity i, so component ei reports domestic private and
public consumption, domestic investment, and net exports of commodity i.
       Two identities link these vectors and with the TR Matrix:


                                                   q = Ag + e,                                (3)

                                                   q = g.                                     (4)


The first identity states that the dollar amount of domestically produced output of each com-
modity equals the sum of intermediate uses plus the final uses of that commodity. The second
identity states that total value of output of industry i equals to the total value of commodity i,
which is trivially true here because each industry is assumed to produce one distinct commodity.
We can solve these two equations for g:


                                                 g = (I − A)−1 e,                             (5)


where I is the (n × n) identity matrix (1 in the diagonal and zero elsewhere). R ≡ (I − A)−1
is called the total requirements matrix. Rows are associated with industries and columns with
commodities. Entry ji shows the dollar value of industry j’s production that is required, both
directly and indirectly, to deliver one dollar of the domestically produced commodity i to final
uses including net exports.
  26
       Matrices and vectors are in bold symbol throughout the paper.


                                                        42
   We continue by explaining the TR Matrix after 1972, so now the IO Tables take account
of the fact that an industry may produce more then one commodity and that a commodity may
be produced in different industries. In general, the number of industries n will then differ from
the number of commodities. We call the number of commodities m. This implies that we no
longer have one transaction matrix, but a use and a make matrix. B denotes the (m × n) use
matrix. Entry i j shows the dollar amount of commodity i that industries j uses per dollar of
output it produces. Again note that these commodities may have been produced domestically or
imported. W denotes the (n×m) make matrix. Rows are associated with industries and columns
with commodities: entry ji shows which share of one dollar of the domestically produced
commodity i industry j makes. Two identities link these matrices and vectors:


                                           q = Bg + e,                                         (6a)

                                           g = W q.                                            (6b)


The first identity says that the dollar amount of each domestically produced commodity equals
the sum of the dollar amount of that commodity that the different domestic industries use as
intermediate goods plus the dollar amount of final uses of that commodity. Note again that final
uses are for domestic private and public consumption, domestic investment, and net exports.
The second identity says the dollar output of each industry equals the sum of that industry’s
contribution to the outputs of the different domestically produced commodities.
   To eliminate q from these identities, we substitute (6b) into (6a) to obtain q = BW q + e.
We then solve this for q and substitute the result back into (6b). This gives:


                                       g = W(I − BW)−1 e.                                       (7)


R ≡ W(I − BW)−1 is called the industry–by–commodity total requirements matrix. Rows are
associated with industries and columns with commodities. Entry ji shows the dollar value of
industry j’s production that is required, both directly and indirectly, to deliver one dollar of the
domestically produced commodity i to final uses including net exports.
   Let v denote the (1 × n) vector of industry value added per unit of industry output, which

                                                43
is easily calculated from the IO Tables by dividing industry value added by industry output.
To obtain the value added, va, that is generated by the domestically produced final expenditure
vector, e, we multiply R (as defined either in (5) or in (7)) with e:


                                           va =<v> Re,


where <v> denotes the diagonal matrix with vector v in its diagonal. It is important to real-
ize that this formula works for any domestically produced final expenditure vector, and so in
principle we could use it for the domestically produced final consumption vector. However,
we don’t know this vector because we do not know the share of imports that is consumed. In-
stead, we only know the final consumption vector, ec . Component i of this vector reports the
final consumption of commodity i, which may either be produced domestically or be imported.
Assuming that imported commodities are produced with the same input requirements as in the
U.S., we can use the total requirement matrix together with the vector ec . This gives us the
consumption value added vector we are looking for:


                                           c =<v> Rec .                                       (8)


In words, the vector on the left–hand side reports the value added in the different industries
that is generated by the final consumption expenditure vector ec . Aggregating the components
of this vector into our three broad sectors agriculture, manufacturing, and services gives us the
consumption value added used in the text.
