1 Introduction
A large body of empirical work has accumulated documenting excess stock return predictability.
Among the most popular predictors are the nominal interest rate and the dividend yield.1 The
dividend yield appears to be the most popular stock return predictor used in applied work, but
more recently Lamont (1998) and Campbell and Shiller (1988) argue that the earnings yield,
has independent forecasting power for excess stock returns in addition to the dividend yield.
      The debate on what drives the predictability continues. It may reflect irrational investor be-
havior and hence be exploitable in trading strategies (see Cutler, Poterba and Summers (1989));
it may reflect time-varying risk premiums (Kandel and Stambaugh (1990)), Campbell and
Cochrane (1999), Bekaert and Grenadier (2000)); or it may simply not be present in the data.
This last possibility gains credulity considering the long list of authors criticizing the statistical
methodologies in the predictability literature. The coefficients on the predictor variables are
biased, since these variables are typically persistent, endogenous regressors correlated with re-
turns innovations (Stambaugh (1999)). The standard focus on long-horizon regressions is prob-
lematic from a number of different perspectives. The distributions of the                     (Kirby (1997))
and the t-statistics on the coefficients, (Richardson and Stock (1989), Richardson and Smith
(1991), Hodrick (1992) and Valkanov (2000)) in long-horizon regressions are severely shifted
to the right, leading to over-rejection of the no-predictability null. Researchers often forget
to properly interpret various tests over different horizons by providing joint tests (Richardson
(1993)). Finally, the possibility of decades of data mining clouds any inference regarding pre-
dictability for US stock returns (Lo and MacKinlay (1990), Foster, Smith and Whaley (1997)
and Bossaerts and Hillion (1999)).
      In this paper, we re-examine the case for the predictability of short and long-horizon stock
returns. We start by proposing a simple price earnings model, in which the variation in the
price-earnings ratio and expected returns on equities is driven by three stochastic state variables,
the payout ratio, earnings growth and the short rate. In this model, the earnings yield, the
dividend yield and the short rate jointly capture any potential predictability, motivating a simple
multivariate regression of excess stock returns over various horizons on these three variables as
the main predictability regression. When certain parameter restrictions are met, the model has
a (near) constant expected excess return variant, in which the expected gross return on equity
equals a constant multiple of the short rate.

      For predictability of excess stock returns by the nominal interest rate see, among others, Fama and Schwert
(1977), Campbell (1987), Breen, Glosten and Jagannathan (1989), Shiller and Beltratti (1992), and Lee (1992).
Among those examining the predictive power of the dividend yield on excess stock returns are Fama and French
(1988), Campbell and Shiller (1988, 1989), Goetzmann and Jorion (1993, 1995), Hodrick (1992), Goyal and Welch
(1999) and Valkanov (2000).


                                                        1
       Given the considerable statistical challenges in establishing predictability, we preceed our
analysis of the data with an extensive Monte Carlo analysis under the null of no predictabil-
ity. Our analysis incorporating earnings yields largely corroborates the results of Boudoukh
and Richardson (1993), Hodrick (1992), and Richardson and Smith (1991) who suggested that
the finite sample properties of the long-horizon regression t-statistics improve dramatically by
removing the moving average structure in the error terms, induced by summing returns over
long horizons, in constructing the standard errors. For brevity, we will refer to these alternative
standard errors as Hodrick (1992) standard errors. As Goetzmann and Jorion (1993, 1995) point
out, standard Monte Carlo analysis ignores the fact that yield variables involve the inverse of
price, an endogenous variable, which is also present in the denominator of the return on the
left hand side. They conduct bootstrap exercises that impose this constraint, but their boot-
strap keeps dividends non-stochastic at their data levels and therefore ignores the cointegration
relation between dividends and price levels that characterizes rational pricing. By simulating
the constant expected return variant of our earnings model, we accommodate this endogeneity
constraint in an entirely coherent way.2 It remains true that the Hodrick standard errors are far
superior in conducting inference and have negligible size distortions, whereas Ordinary Least
Squares (OLS) or Hansen-Hodrick (1980) standard errors lead to severe over-rejections of the
no predictability null at long horizons.
       Armed with well-behaved t-statistics, we establish that the predictability evidence for US
returns is surprisingly weak. In fact, the only variable retaining significance is the short rate,
and it is only significant at short horizons. To mitigate data snooping concerns, we investigate
analogous predictability regressions for four other countries, France, Germany, Japan and the
UK. Interestingly, we find that the predictability coefficients are not robust across countries
in sign or magnitude, except for the short rate effect. When we pool the regression across
countries, the short rate remains the only significant predictor of excess stock returns.
       Finally, we also investigate a number of cross-country predictability regressions, examining
whether any predictors have predictive power across countries. Unlike Bekaert and Hodrick
(1992) and Ferson and Harvey (1993), we only find evidence of strong predictability when we
pool across countries. With cross-sectional information from international data we find that US
instruments are strong predictors of foreign equity returns, unlike local instruments. The local
short rate effect is subsumed by the predictive power of the US short rate. We also confirm
and extend Bekaert and Hodrick (1992)’s finding that yield variables have predictive power
for excess returns in the foreign exchange market. We conclude that the current predictability
   2
       Bollerslev and Hodrick (1996) provide a detailed Monte Carlo analysis in the context of a present value model
with constant and time-varying expected return variants which also imposes this constraint, but their solution to
the present value model is only approximately true.

debate focuses on the wrong horizon (long-run instead of short-run), the wrong instruments
(yield variables instead of interest rates) and the wrong setting (US segmented market instead
of a globally integrated market).
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets out the empirical frame-
work, including the present value earnings model and the predictability regressions. Section 3
describes the econometric estimation, the Monte Carlo analysis and describes the data. Section
4 considers the predictability in US returns, whereas Section 5 investigates and compares pre-
dictability in all 5 countries. Section 6 investigates predictability across countries. Section 7
concludes and offers an interpretation of our results.


2 Theoretical and Econometric Framework

2.1     A Simple Present Value Model
Modern predictability regressions consider the predictability of excess stock returns, the return
on equity over and above the return on a nominally risk-free security of the same holding period,
which is known one period in advance. Since there is substantial time-variation in interest rates,
and it is likely that expected stock returns vary with the interest rate, the hypothesis of interest
is the constancy of the conditional equity premium, not the constancy of expected stock returns.
Building present value models that imply constant excess stock returns, but allow time-varying
interest rates is a non-trivial matter. Most of the recent work on present value models with time-
varying discount rates builds on Campbell and Shiller (1989) who, by linearizing returns around
steady state log price dividend ratios, obtain a tractable linear present value model in which it is
straightforward to impose the constancy of expected excess returns while allowing for variation
in interest rates. More recently, the term structure models in the affine class (see Duffie and Kan
(1996)) have been applied to stock pricing to yield tractable pricing equations in many settings
without linearization (see Ang and Liu (2001) and Bekaert and Grenadier (2000)). We deviate
from this literature by presenting a model for price earnings ratios.
    Stock returns from time to                can always be decomposed as:

In this pricing framework, we have decomposed dividend growth into earnings growth and a
payout ratio. From a theoretical perspective, dividend growth should suffice to price stocks, but
our decomposition may yield more accurate pricing formulas in finite samples. First, in finite
samples using dividends may be problematic, since they are often manipulated, smoothed, or
set to zero, making them poor indicators of the true value-relevant cashflows in the future. It
is no surprise that in the real world analysts almost entirely focus on earnings growth. Second,
the decomposition simply increases the information set for prediction, and will include a model
that features only dividend growth as a special case.

      Equation (12) shows two characteristics of the conditional volatility of equity returns. First,
the conditional volatility of equity returns is related to the level of interest rate. Many studies
have empirically documented a strong link between the conditional volatility of equity returns
and interest rates (see for example, Glosten, Jagannathan and Runkle (1993)). However, note
that this effect would disappear if we measure the return as
                                                                                               >% ?&@CB"0EI 37   or in logs. Second,
the conditional variance is positively related to the conditional covariance between the pricing
kernel and dividend growth, and to the conditional variance of dividend growth 0|                                                 N|   7K Y!0|
                                                                                                                                                   
| 7 .
      The model with the restrictions in equation (9) will serve as the data generating process
(DGP) under the null and will also help us interpret our empirical results. If the restrictions
are not imposed, expected returns vary through time, but since the model is homoskedastic, the
time-variation is likely to be modest in magnitude. Note there are no restrictions on L .
      What do the restrictions in equation (9) actually mean? Imposing the restrictions from
equation (9) allows the conditional mean for log earnings growth and log payout ratio to be
written as:

      Normally, when interest rates move away from their unconditional mean the resulting change
in discount rates and prices would induce predictable components in returns. The restriction on
the companion form
                                engineers an opposite cashflow effect that neutralizes the price-decrease
induced by the interest rate change. This effect would also happen in a standard equilibrium
Lucas (1978)-type economy. In an equilibrium setting the constant L£aL                                                 &   would be related

Model. However, they should capture the predictability present under the null of the present
value model, because there is a one-to-one (albeit non-linear) mapping between earnings yield,
dividend yield and the short rate and our three state variables. One reason variables such as
dividend yields may predict future returns more generally is the presence of price in the de-
nominator. On the one hand, the presence of price on both sides of the regression may worsen
small sample biases in the regressions (see Goetzmann and Jorion (1993)). On the other hand,
since price reflects all information about future expected returns and cashflow growth rates, its
presence may capture genuine predictability. If the Present Value Model we present is truth,
price would not be necessary to capture time-variation in expected returns, and all information
should be captured by the three state variables, or transformations of them.
          In a globally integrated world, predictability is likely also to extend across borders. In
Section 6, following Bekaert and Hodrick (1992), we consider cross-country regressions of the
form:

variables. Note that as we use continuously compounded returns µ ´·¶
          The regressions in equations (16) and (17) can be estimated by OLS. We consider three
estimators of the standard errors. First, OLS standard errors are appropriate if there is no serial
correlation of the error term and the error terms are homoskedastic. These are the standard
errors used by Lamont (1998) and we use them as a benchmark even when
                                                                                                                             ¯        , in which
case they will likely underestimate the true sampling error. Second, to account for the over-
lap in the residuals for
                                   ¯¦           and to capture potential heteroskedasticity in returns, we use a

    In our Monte Carlo analysis we run a horse race between these three estimators. We find
    Hodrick standard errors to be far superior, and most of our results will exclusively focus on
    t-statistics computed with the Hodrick standard errors. Readers not interested in the details of
    the Monte Carlo analysis can skip Section 3, although we feel that it contains some important
    results.
          Apart from running univariate regressions, we are mindful of Richardson’s (1993) critique
    of predictability tests testing for only one particular horizon
                                                                                                 ¯   and we provide a number of joint

       When we consider predictability in multiple countries, we also provide joint tests of no
predictability across countries and we estimate pooled coefficients across countries. Such a
pooled estimation mitigates the data mining problem plaguing US data and increases efficiency
and power under the null of no predictability. Here we estimate the system:

across countries. We take b = US, UK, France, Germany, Japan. The econometrics underlying
the pooled estimation is detailed in Appendix F.


2.3         Data Description
Our data set consists of equity total return (price plus dividend) indices from Morgan Stanley
Capital International (MSCI) for the US, Japan, UK, Germany and France. The short-term
interest rates we use are 1 month EURO rates from Datastream. The sample period is from
February 1975 to December 1999 for the US, UK, France and Germany and from January 1978
to December 1999 for Japan. MSCI provide dividend and earnings yields which use dividend
and earnings summed over the past 12 months. Although this is restrictive, monthly earnings
levels are impossible to use because they are dominated by seasonal components, given that
most firms have a December-end calendar year.
       Table (1) reports summary statistics of returns and instruments. The historical log equity
premium is around 7.5% in the Anglo-Saxon countries, 6.9% in France and Germany and only
                                                                  except for the US where
3.6% in Japan. Excess return volatility is over 18% in all countries,                  it
is only 15%. All three instruments - the log dividend yields                                 ¤   , log earnings yield |      and
short rates I are highly persistent.
       As Bekaert and Hodrick (1992) discuss, MSCI report price (capital appreciation) and total
returns (including income). The total return is an estimate constructed from annualized divi-
                                   months). For some countries there is a discrepancy
dends (summed over the previous twelve
between the MSCI dividend yield           ¤    and the implied annualized dividend yield constructed
from the price and total return indices due to a differential tax treatment across the two series.3

       For a discussion on how taxes are treated see MSCI Methodology and Index Policy, 1999. The MSCI dividend
yield   ÑAÒ>Ó-Ô
          series and the implied annualized dividend yield from the price and total return indices are identical for
the US and Japan, but differ for the UK, France and Germany.

We checked our results by re-constructing the total return using the MSCI dividend yield ¤ 
with the price return and found them to be unchanged.


3 Finite Sample Properties of Various Estimators
Our analysis of the small sample properties of the estimators proceeds in two steps. In the
first sub-section, we describe the results of a Monte Carlo analysis on returns, earnings yields,
payout ratios and short rates that suffices to mimic the regressions in Lamont (1998). Since
Lamont (1998) used OLS standard errors to establish strong predictability results, it is important
to ascertain that they survive small sample biases. In the second sub-section, we calibrate
our Present Value Model of the price-earnings ratio and use it as the DGP for a Monte Carlo
analysis. We solely use US data for the Monte Carlo analyses, but the results are so clear-
cut that there is little reason to suspect they would not extend to DGP’s calibrated using other
country’s data. All Monte Carlo experiments use 5,000 replications.


3.1       An Empirical Trivariate Model
Lamont (1998) regresses excess stock returns on dividend yields, earnings yields and payout
ratios, both univariately and bivariately since the three variables are totally linearly dependent.
In some regressions, he adds the Treasury bill rate as a regressor, but does not find it to be
significant. To examine the small sample performance of these regression tests, we investigate
the following DGP:4

       We estimate this model on US MSCI data and use it to generate small samples of the same
length (299) as the data sets used in the empirical work in the other sections. We then run
regressions of the form:

       We also examined a simpler DGP eliminating the short rate equation. The small sample properties of the
various estimates and the OLS biases were similar to what is reported here.

contain the estimation results for the DGP, the simulation results on the coefficients (to examine
finite sample bias) and the simulation results on the t-statistics (to examine size distortions) in
the above regressions to an Appendix, which is available upon request. Here we report the main
results.
    Since our instruments and returns are likely to be negatively correlated, regressions of ex-
cess returns on any of our instruments would suffer from the well-known persistent regressor
bias (see Stambaugh (2000)), which will bias the regression coefficients upward. This is most
obvious for the yield instruments because of the presence of price in their denominator but short
rate innovations and return innovations are also negatively correlated (correlation = -0.1107).
However, in multivariate regressions, it is no longer possible to sign the bias and it may well be
the case that the bias is less severe.
    Our results reveal that the coefficients on all regressors in virtually all regressions are up-
wardly biased. The univariate upward bias is larger for the earnings yield than for the dividend
yield, as the earnings yield is slightly more persistent than the dividend yield, and it varies
between 0.07 and 0.11 depending on horizon. In bivariate regressions, the earnings yield bias
worsens but the dividend yield bias becomes tiny. When the short rate is added, the roles are
reversed with large upward biases for the dividend yield coefficient (between 0.07 and 0.16),
virtually no bias for the earnings yield, and a substantial upward bias for the short rate coeffi-
cient (between 0.09 and 0.17 depending on horizon).
    Second, all three estimators show very small size distortions for
                                                                                       ¯ Ý . Hence, the use of
the heteroskedasticity-correction, unnecessary given the homoskedastic DGP, does not lead to
size distortions. For
                            ¯ Ï f   and
                                           ¯ ßÞ/W   , the OLS estimator, which fails to correct for serial
correlation, not surprisingly performs very poorly. For example, for
                                                                                        ¯ Ü f   , more than 50%
of the simulated samples yield OLS t-statistics higher than the 5% asymptotic critical value,
with that number going up to 78% or more for

3.2          The Present Value Model Empirical Results
The DGP in the previous section ignores the fact that price appears both on the right hand side
and the left hand side of the regression. Allowing for correlation in the innovations is helpful,
but does not fully capture the relation between the left hand and right hand side variables. The
Present Value Model presented in Section 2 under the parameter restrictions that ensure the
absence of predictability (see Corollary 2.1), accomplishes the full endogeneity of price.
         To perform the Monte Carlo analysis we have to estimate the parameters     0xLX  XYeX g 7 . We
                                                                        7
proceed in two steps. First, we estimate the VAR parameters 0xLX XZY . Second, we calibrate g
to fit the observed equity premium in the data. We can do so because g £ g& (See Observation
2.1) and we set the price of interest rate risk to zero, so that g is a scalar. The latter assumption
is motivated by the failure of most term structure studies to reject that prices of risk for interest
rate factors are zero (see the discussion in Ang and Piazzesi (2000)).
         We turn first to the VAR parameter estimation, which is complicated by the fact that our
              earnings and dividends summed
MSCI data uses                              up over the past year (we observe earnings

Equations (23) and (24) show that the relation between monthly growth rates and payout ratios
and their counterparts using earnings and dividends summed over the past year is highly non-
linear. In particular, the use of summing past earnings and dividends over the past twelve months
will potentially induce very high autocorrelation up to 11 lags.
        To estimate the VAR on            J    we use Simulated Method of Moments (SMM) (Duffie and
Singleton (1993)). We use a two-step SMM procedure and impose a restricted companion form

the first 11 lags are affected by the autocorrelation induced by the non-linear filters in equations
(23) and (24). We compute the weighting matrix using the data, so we need not iterate on the
weighting matrix.
        Table (2) reports our results. We report two estimations, an Alternative Model which is
exactly identified, and the Null Model which is estimated subject to the restrictions ensuring
constant expected returns in Corollary 2.1. Focusing first on the Alternative Model, payout
ratios are close to a random walk with no other significant feedback coefficients. Earnings
growth on the other hand shows little persistence with the coefficient on past earnings growth
barely significantly different from zero. However, high current payout ratios predict high future
earnings growth, perhaps because they reflect permanent rather than transitory earnings. High
short rates significantly reduce future expected earnings growth. A 1% increase in interest rates
leads to a 25 basis point decrease in expected earnings growth.
        When we estimate the covariance parameters of the Null Model on the moments of the
Alternative Model, we obtain a singular covariance matrix, as the correlation of                        )    and   9: 
approaches -1. Therefore we hold the covariance matrix Y from the Alternative Model fixed,
                                                 
and estimate L and a restricted companion matrix using the first the and cross-moments of
the Alternative Model estimation. Using a ù( test, we fail to reject the Null Model versus
the Alternative Model with a p-value of 0.9252. The Null Model retains the important feedback
from interest rates to earnings growth but makes the interest rate feedback to payout ratios much
larger than before. The feedback from payout ratios to earnings growth rates remains intact as
well, but the earnings growth rate is no longer persistent.
        The estimation of the covariance matrix Y has two important features. First,
                                                                                  the conditional

in the annual data as well. This might be due to the unusual smoothing that occurs in most
corporate dividend policies. High temporary earnings are not paid out, so they decrease the
payout ratio.
     The constrained VAR ties down most of the parameters, but we still have to determine the
price of risk for dividend growth. Figure (1) calibrates g                                             g £½ g&        to the observed equity
premium in the sample. The log risk premium is produced by simulation using 100,000 obser-
vations, while the simple risk premium is calculated using equation Corollary 2.1 (and checked
by simulation). Setting g                  údüû k Þ/ý/ý      , we match both the log and the simple risk premium. The

(0.1387), which is slightly below the annualized volatility in the sample 0.1477 (0.1472). The
main source of equity return volatility in the model is the volatility of payout ratios and earnings
growth rates, since the risk premium is constant. In fact, the implied estimate of the conditional

respectively.
   In Table (3) we report the mean and standard deviation of the empirical distribution for the
coefficients in the various regressions we consider. First, in the dividend regression, we continue
to find substantial upward bias. Interestingly, the bias is not worse than what we find for the
DGP that does not explicitly consider the endogeneity of price in Section 3.1. Goetzmann
and Jorion (1993) claim that considering price endogeneity explicitly considerably worsens the
bias. However, their comparison is strained since in their DGP with explicit endogeneity, the
dividend yield implicitly follows a random walk and Hodrick (1992) also finds stronger biases
for a DGP in which dividend yields follow a random walk. Our results indicate that modeling
the price endogeneity explicitly does not lead to larger biases.
   Second, in the earnings regression we now find a downward bias, instead of the upward
bias we reported above. Why might this be the case? In our price-earnings model with constant
expected returns, the variation in returns is dominated by variation in earnings growth rates. The
price-earnings ratio is not constant but is completely driven by the payout ratio (see Proposition
2.1 and Corollary 2.1). This implies that the earnings yield, even when summed over 12 periods,
is likely to be primarily negatively correlated with the payout ratio, but in the DGP (see Table
(2)), earnings growth rates and payout ratios are highly negatively correlated, so that returns
and earnings yield innovations end up being positively correlated, reversing the sign of the bias.
This is not true for dividend yields, since the log dividend yield can be written as the sum of
the log payout ratio (negatively correlated with the earnings growth rate and hence with return
innovations) and the log earnings yield, and the first effect dominates. Note that the small
sample coefficient in the dividend yield regression has the same positive sign that the dividend
yield predictability literature finds (Fama and French (1988) and Hodrick (1992)), while the
negative small sample coefficient on the earnings yield is what Lamont (1998) finds.
   Third, in the bivariate regressions, the univariate biases are accentuated, with the bias on
the dividend yield coefficient reaching 0.19 for
                                                                    ¯ ÷ .      The biases decrease slightly with the
horizon. Lamont (1998) finds positive signs on the dividend yield and negative signs on the
earnings yield in a bivariate regression. Our biases are exactly the same sign as his result.
Finally, in the trivariate regression, the biases for the earnings and dividend yield coefficients
become larger still in absolute magnitude (0.24 for the dividend yield coefficient; -0.11 for the
earnings yield coefficient). However, the bias on the short rate coefficient is negligible.
   In Table (4) we examine the size properties of significance tests. We report empirical sizes
for tests of size 10% and of size 5%, but we focus our discussion on the 5% tests. The price
endogeneity also alters the absolute performance of the various test statistics, but not their


                                                               16
relative performance. In particular, at
                                            ¯         , the univariate regressions display negligible
size distortions, but for the bivariate and trivariate regressions, all tests slightly over-reject at
asymptotic critical values and the empirical sizes exceed the nominal sizes. The worst distortion
occurs for the dividend yield coefficient in the trivariate regression, with the nominal size being
8.6% for the OLS estimator, and 8.9% for the robust Hansen-Hodrick and Hodrick estimators
(which coincide for
                      ¯  ). For longer horizons, the performance of the OLS estimator rapidly
deteriorates with the empirical size exceeding 54% for a 5% test in the dividend regression and
exceeding 72% in all other regressions at
                                             ¯  Þ/W   . Accounting for the overlap in the error terms
using Hansen-Hodrick standard errors improves the small sample performance but not enough
to yield a reliable test. The empirical size for a 5% test at
                                                                  ¯ mÞ'W   is at least 39.1% in the case
of the dividend regression.
   Table (4) shows that Hodrick standard errors are far superior to OLS and Hansen-Hodrick
standard errors. For
                       ¯ ÷ f   , there is negligible size distortion for the univariate regressions,
whereas for the bivariate and trivariate regressions, the size distortion is at most 4.9% for the
dividend yield coefficient in the trivariate regression (a 9.9% empirical size). Note that the
Hodrick test now also over-rejects. For
                                            ¯ Þ/W    , the size distortions actually become smaller,
with the worst size distortion occurring again for the dividend yield coefficient in the trivariate
regression (a 7.9% empirical size for the 5% test). For the earnings yield regression, the Hodrick
test is conservative with an empirical size of 3.6%. In sum, the Hodrick standard errors display
overall far superior small sample properties, and using the asymptotic p-values is unlikely to
dramatically affect statistical inference. For that reason, we will report the Hodrick standard
errors for all of our empirical tests.


4 Predictability in US Excess Stock Returns
Table (5) contains our main results regarding the predictability of US excess stock returns.
To allow comparison with Lamont (1998)’s article, we report univariate and bivariate yield
regressions in addition to our main trivariate specification. We report t-statistics in parentheses
based on Hodrick standard errors. For the full sample and looking over three horizons, the yield
regressions produce only one significant coefficient, the dividend yield. This appears to be a
significant predictor of excess stock returns in the bivariate regression, but its sign is negative,
not positive! Lamont on the other hand finds positive coefficients for both yield variables in
univariate regressions, but a positive coefficient on dividend yields and a negative coefficient
on the earnings yield in the bivariate regression. His main point is that the predictive power of
the dividend yield stems from the role of dividends in capturing the permanent component of
prices, whereas the negative coefficient on the earnings yield is due to earnings being a good

                                                  17
measure of business conditions which captures counter-cyclical risk aversion. According to
Lamont there is information in earnings and dividends over and above price. Unfortunately, our
results appear rather inconsistent with this story. Only for
                                                               ¯ #Þ/W   do the regression coefficients
have the sign predicted by Lamont’s analysis, but for long horizons Lamont finds that only
price mattered. In the trivariate regression, the same sign pattern appears for the yield variables:
negative on dividends and positive on earnings which reverses for
                                                                         ¯  Þ/W   .
   Note that accounting for biases would not help recover the Lamont pattern. In the univariate
regressions, the bias-corrected dividend yield coefficient would be even more negative since the
bias is positive, and the negative bias in the earnings yield regression is too small to reverse the
sign of the coefficients. For the bivariate and trivariate regressions, accounting for biases would
make the pattern we observe (and which is opposite to what Lamont finds) even more striking.
   Figure (2) shows the pattern over different horizons more clearly for both the univariate and
bivariate regressions (the inclusion of the interest rate does not change the pattern very much).
In both univariate regressions, the coefficients on the dividend or earnings yield turn increas-
ingly more negative until around the 30 month horizon after which they start to increase without
becoming positive. In the bivariate regression, we clearly see how the “Lamont-pattern” of pos-
itive dividend yield coefficients and negative earnings coefficients requires setting
                                                                                         ¯   equal to 50
months or higher. The right hand side of the three panels shows the corresponding t-statistics
for OLS, Robust Hansen-Hodrick and Hodrick standard errors. Given the general lack of sta-
tistical significance, it is clearly pointless to try and interpret the sign changes. Interestingly, if
we had relied on the OLS or Robust Hansen-Hodrick standard errors, we would have concluded
there was significant predictive power in the dividend yield variable, which again drives home
the importance of the simulation experiments in Section 3.
   Goyal and Welch (1999) point out that the dividend yield predictability is not robust to the
addition of the last decade of high returns coinciding with low dividend yields and is actually
highly unstable in general. Therefore, two additional panels in Table (5) report results for
shorter sub-samples eliminating either the last 5 or the last 8 years in the sample. Whereas
the sign of the coefficients now better corresponds to what Lamont (1998) finds, statistical
significance is still lacking. Lettau and Ludvigson (2001) also find that the Lamont-pattern
does not hold with late 1990’s data with a quarterly sampling frequency.
   The results described so far are pretty bleak if finding predictability were the objective of
this study. However, there is yet another regressor in our fundamental regression, the short
rate. Whatever the sample period we use, the short rate enters significantly at the 99% level
in the
         ¯    regression and its impact on the equity premium is remarkably robust in terms
of magnitude across the various sample periods. A 1% increase in the annualized short rate
decreases the equity premium by about 3.7%. The predictive power of the short rate dissipates


                                                  18
quickly for longer horizons. The coefficient slowly becomes less negative and eventually even
slightly positive.                                                                            

dividend yield and earnings yield are also individually significant at the 5% level.
    Finally, following the lead of Richardson (1993), Table (6) reports tests of predictability
over three horizons,
                       ¯  , 12 and 60, simultaneously. The table also lists results for four other
countries, which will be discussed in the following section. If we now focus on the first column,
the US results, we see that there is only strong evidence for yield predictability, if we consider
the joint predictability of earnings yields and dividend yields in the trivariate specification.
Despite the short-lived nature of the predictable patterns, the short rate still significantly (at the
5% level) predicts excess returns at the one month, 12 month and 5 year horizons.


5 Predictability of Excess Stock Returns in Five Countries
Our previous results suggest that the predictability patterns formerly found in US data appear
not to be robust to the addition of the last few years and that statistical significance only occurs
when the short rate is used as a predictor. It is conceivable that the lack of predictive power
is simply a small sample phenomenon, due to the very special nature of the last decade for the
US stock market. It is equally probable that the previous results of strong predictability and
interesting predictability patterns are a statistical fluke. International evidence should help us
sort out these two interpretations of the data. If we cannot confirm the previous predictability
patterns for any countries, and if yield variables do not appear to predict stock returns in other
counties, it seems likely that data mining and other statistical problems have led researchers in
the US astray regarding the predictive power of the yield variables. We can also increase or de-
crease our confidence in the short rate as a robust predictor of equity returns using international
stock return data. Finally, pooled estimation across countries can lead to powerful evidence on
the robustness and magnitude of predictability patterns across countries.
    We begin by summarizing the patterns in univariate and bivariate yield regressions. Figure
(3) displays the dividend yield coefficients and their t-statistics using Hodrick standard errors
The UK coefficient pattern is strikingly similar to that of the US but, as in the US, not a single
t-statistic reaches higher than 2.00 and it is not surprising that the joint tests for
                                                                                         ¯  , 12 and 60
in Table (6) fail to reject the null of no predictability. The coefficient patterns in the three other
countries are more akin to these prevalent in the US in earlier samples, in that the coefficients

                                                   19
increase with horizon, but in both France and Germany they start out negative. In Japan, the
individual coefficient for ¤       is borderline significant in the univariate regression and the joint
test across horizons in Table (6) rejects at the 10% level.
       In Figure (4), we repeat the same graphs for the earnings yield regression. The earnings yield
predictability coefficients again are similar for the US and the UK, following a reverse J-pattern.
For France and Germany they have a U-shaped pattern, whereas they increase monotonically
with the horizon for Japan. Individual significance again only occurs for certain horizons in
Japan, but nowhere else. Joint tests in Table (6) fail to reject the null of no predictability in
France and Germany but there is a borderline rejection in Japan (at the 5.7% level) and a rejec-
tion at the 5% level in the UK. Inspection of the UK coefficients in Figure (4) reveals that the
¯  , 12, 60 choice very fortunately avoids the lowest spot in the t-statistics curve and might
somewhat overstate the true predictability. We conclude that the univariate yield predictability
patterns are not terribly robust across countries and not very significant statistically.
       Do we observe the Lamont pattern of positive dividend yield and negative earnings yield
coefficients in international data? Figure (5) simply shows the coefficient patterns. Again (not
reported), the individual t-statistics using Hodrick standard errors barely ever reach significance.
Two countries, Japan and France, show a pattern somewhat reminiscent of the Lamont findings,
with negative coefficients for the earnings variable and positive ones for the dividend yield at
short horizons. In France, the coefficients further diverge as the horizon lengthens, whereas
in Japan they converge. The UK pattern of the coefficients is similar to that in France but the
initial earnings yield coefficient is actually slightly positive. In Germany, the sign pattern and its
evolution over horizons matches the one we found for the US, with positive (negative) earnings
yield (dividend yield) coefficients eventually switching sign, but the switch occurs much earlier
than in the US. Joint tests across horizons reveal no significant rejections of the null of no
predictability, except in the case of Japan, where earnings and dividend yields jointly predict
stock returns at the 5% level (see Table (6)). However, this may be due to a multicollinearity
problem in the regression for Japan (see below).
       The coefficient patterns for the yield variables that we observe for the bivariate regressions
qualitatively persist for the trivariate regressions (except for Japan) and hence we do not show
them in a figure. However, the t-statistics are generally somewhat larger, resulting in joint
rejections of the null of no predictive power for the yield variables in three countries, the US, the
UK and Japan at the 1% level. So the yield variables appear to have some predictive power when
considered together and over three horizons simultaneously. However, the pattern in coefficients
we see is very different across countries and differs from what Lamont found, except in Japan.7
   7
   For Japan, we observe a Lamont pattern at short horizons (less than 15 months) but at horizons longer than 15
months the earnings yield coefficients become positive. The dividend yield coefficients are less than the earnings



                                                       20
    Figure (6) displays the coefficient patterns for the annualized short rate and its associated
t-statistics in the trivariate regression. Strikingly, this coefficient pattern is much more robust
across countries and a similar shape for the coefficient patterns appear for univariate regressions
(not reported). For all countries, the one-month coefficient is negative between -3.73 for the US
and -0.97 for Japan. For 4 of the 5 countries, the coefficient increases monotonically with
horizon, leveling off at around 0.55 for the US, France, and Germany and at slightly less than
zero for the UK (-.55). In Japan, the coefficient never reaches zero, but the horizon dependence
is not monotonically increasing. The t-statistics are generally larger in absolute magnitude for
short horizons with the exception again being Japan. At the one-month horizon the short rate
coefficients are statistically significant only for the US and UK. When we pool across horizons
in Table (6), only the US short rate retains significant predictive power at the 5% level, which
is not surprising given the pattern of the coefficients and t-statistics in Figure (6). What is
surprising is the very high p-value for Japan. Inspection of the graph reveals than the joint test
                           ¯                                   ¯
happens to select two ’s out of only a small set of ’s that yield coefficients close to zero.
    We conclude that the international evidence on predictability does not support Lamont’s
findings regarding the predictability of earnings and dividend yields. There is only weak ev-
idence in favor of it in three countries, and the international data do not reveal a consistent,
interpretable data pattern. However, the short rate robustly predicts excess stock returns, but
its effect is limited to the short forecasting horizon (mostly one month). The short rate coef-
ficient is not significantly different from zero for all countries. Table (6) reports joint tests of
predictability for the three coefficients. The null of no predictability is rejected at the 10% level
in Germany, and at the 5% level in the US and UK. It is also rejected at the 1% level in Japan
which is surprising given the lack of significance of the individual coefficients. However, this is
mainly due to multicolinearity in the regressions, and a near-singular covariance matrix of the
regressor coefficients.
    One way to come to more clear-cut conclusions regarding the magnitudes and significance of
the coefficients is to pool the estimation across countries. Under the null of no predictability, the
pooled estimation should enhance efficiency considerably given that the correlation of returns
across countries is not very high. Unfortunately, we have to exclude Japan, because of the
considerable difference in data coverage both in terms of sample size and in terms of variables
(we use levels of earnings yields rather than log earnings yields, because of the presence of
negative earnings in the Japanese series). Table (7) reports pooled predictability coefficients,
t-statistics and joint tests. We also report a test of the over-identifying restrictions, described
yield coefficients between horizons 20 and 40 months. At long horizons (40-60 months) both dividend and earnings
yields are positive, with the dividend yield coefficients greater than the earnings yield coefficients. This figure is
available upon request.

in Appendix F. For all of our specifications, this test fails to reject the restrictions imposed
by equal coefficients across countries. In the Lamont regressions with only the yield variables,
we fail to find statistical significance for the yield variables, both when tested individually and
jointly. The coefficients get closer to significant levels at longer horizons. In terms of sign
at
     ¯ ÿ , the dominant pattern appears to be negative dividend yield coefficients and positive
earnings yield coefficients, a pattern opposite to that found by Lamont (1998).
      In the trivariate system, both the dividend yield and earnings yield coefficients are positive
   ¯
for  , but the earnings yield coefficient turns negative at longer horizons. Consequently, the
Lamont pattern again fails to show. Moreover, none of the coefficients is individually signifi-
cant, although the t-statistics increase with horizon. A joint test on the yield variables also fails
to reject the null of zero coefficients. On the other hand, the short rate coefficient is -1.7334
at the one month horizon and significant at the 5% level. The coefficient increases to -0.34 at
¯ ±Þ/W   but loses statistical significance. Joint tests across the three variables fail to reject the
null of no predictability for all three horizons at the 5% level, but the test would reject at the
10% level for
                ¯ m . We conclude that the only robust and significant predictor of excess stock
returns in 5 countries appears to be the short rate.


6 Cross-Country Predictability
The previous discussion implicitly considered our 5 countries to be segmented markets and did
not allow the possibility of cross-country influences. However, in an integrated market, global
discount rates should price equity returns on all markets, and we may find common components
in the predictable components of returns. To investigate this, we extend our trivariate regression
to a 6 variable regression, looking at pairs of countries. This set-up is an extension of the
regressions run by Bekaert and Hodrick (1992), who regressed equity and foreign exchange
returns on the dividend yields in two countries and the forward premium. Since the forward
premium is the interest differential through Covered Interest Parity, our regression frees up an
implicit constraint on the interest rate coefficients in the Bekaert and Hodrick regressions. Like
Bekaert and Hodrick, we also investigate the predictability of foreign exchange returns. Our
main contribution here is to examine the added role earnings yields may play.
      Table (8) reports the main results for the predictability of equity excess returns by local and
US instruments. A number of striking results emerge. First, there is not a single significant
coefficient for the 12 and 60-month horizons, confirming once again that predictability is not a
long-horizon phenomenon. Second, the only significant coefficients we report are US dividend
yields significantly predicting returns in France at the 5% level and in Germany at the 1% level.
Hence, the strongest predictability pattern is a cross-country effect. The sign of the coefficient

                                                  22
is negative as it is in the other countries. Moreover, the US earnings yield consistently carries
a positive sign but fails to reach statistical significance. The local yield variables mostly have
positive but insignificant coefficients. Third, the local short rate is no longer significant and
increases in value, relative to its value in the domestic trivariate regression we studied before.
For France and Germany, it even becomes positive. However, the US short rate enters with a
negative sign in every regression and the magnitude of the coefficient is large, varying between
-2.00 in Japan to -4.17 in Germany. Although the coefficients are never significant at the 5%
level, the t-statistics are all 1.00 or larger.
    These coefficient patterns suggest that cross-country predictability may be stronger than
domestic predictability. This may be the case in an integrated world where perhaps shocks af-
fecting global discount rates are best reflected in the instruments of the dominant stock market,
the US. To examine this further, Table (9) reports p-values from a series of joint tests of pre-
dictability. The first set, labeled with US as ”Base,” concerns the regressions of Table (8). The
base predictability column contains a test of the null of zero coefficients for the base instrument,
in this case, the US instruments. The local predictability column reports p-values for tests of
predictability using only the local instruments. This column is likely to confirm the results of
the trivariate regressions we reported earlier. The US instruments jointly only significantly pre-
dict German excess returns. In the other sub-panels, we make other countries the base country.
For example, in the second set we look at excess returns in the US, France, Germany and Japan
and our predictor instruments comprise local and UK instruments.
    We find a number of interesting significant predictability patterns in Table (9). First, no
foreign country instruments predict US returns. However, in the presence of foreign instru-
ments which have no predictive power, there is still significant predictive power of US domestic
instruments, in particular the short rate, for US excess returns. Second, we find only two signif-
icant base country predictors: US instruments predict German returns, and German instruments
predict Japanese returns. Finally, the local predictability results confirm the rejections we found
for the US in Table (6), no matter which foreign instruments are included in the regression. For
the UK, we no longer reject, which may reflect a loss of power due to the introduction of three
new regressors. For Japan, we also no longer reject, which simply indicates that the inclusion of
the foreign instruments resolved the singularity problem we faced with the regular estimation.
    The results in Table (9) may be weak because of the inclusion of too many highly corre-
lated regressors. Therefore, Table (10) reports predictability results using only US instruments,
including a pooled estimation. The results are indeed stronger than what we reported in Table
(8). First, long-horizon predictability remains rather weak to non-existent. Second, the yield
variables retain their sign patterns (a reverse Lamont pattern) and are now significant in both
France and Germany. The US short rate consistently has a negative sign and is now significant


                                                  23
in the UK and Germany. Overall, the US instruments predict excess equity returns in these
countries better than the local instruments! When we pool the estimation across countries, we
find very strong results, with all three coefficients being significant at the 1% level.8 A 1%
increase in the US dividend yield reduces the equity premium in other countries by about 50
basis points, an increase in the earnings yield increases international risk premiums by about 65
basis points, whereas an increase in the US short rate of 1% decreases the equity premium by
almost 3.5%. It may be that US factors dominate global discount rates and that this leads to the
observed pattern, but it seems hard to come up with an international asset-pricing model that
would explain these predictability patterns.
      Such an international model would also have to capture predictability patterns in exchange
rate returns. We measure the exchange rate return for a US based investor, using the logarithmic
exchange rate change (in dollars per foreign currency) plus the foreign-US interest rate differen-
tial. This return is the topic of the vast literature on the Unbiasedness Hypothesis in international
finance. If no instruments predict this return, the interest differential or forward premium is an
unbiased predictor of future exchange rate changes. Whereas earlier work finds very strong re-
jections of this hypothesis, recent tests yield weaker results (see Bekaert and Hodrick (2001)).
In Table (11) we report regressions of foreign exchange returns on the US instruments and the
instruments of the currency’s country. Since France and Germany now share a common cur-
rency as of 1 January, 1999, and were included in the EMS during the 1990’s we include only
the US Dollar-Deutsch Mark exchange rate.
      In the Unbiasedness literature it is customary to regress foreign exchange returns or ex-
change rate changes onto the forward premium or interest differential, an exercise which typi-
cally results in strong negative slope coefficients. In our framework, this would correspond to
finding negative coefficients on the US interest rate and positive ones on the foreign interest rate.
This pattern is only valid for the pound; in the other countries the US interest rate enters with
a positive sign and is not statistically significantly different from zero. In the UK both interest
variables are significantly different from zero, whereas the only other significant interest rate
coefficient is the Japanese interest rate for the yen equation. Perhaps surprisingly, some of the
yield variables do seem to have predictive power for foreign exchange returns, but no clear pat-
tern emerges. For example, the US earnings yield is only significant in the pound equation, and
          ¯ ± f , whereas the dividend yield is significant for the Deutsche Mark equation
then only for
       ¯       ¯
at both ÿ and 
                     f . Local instruments are also significant. For example, UK dividend
yields predict pound foreign exchange returns, and German dividend yields predict Mark for-
eign exchange rates. Perhaps such complex patterns are not surprising in a globally integrated
world. An international pricing model will typically require the exchange rate change to be the

      We pool UK, French and German returns and exclude Japan because of its smaller sample size.

difference of the two pricing kernels in the two countries, so that factors driving equity prices
in both countries may affect exchange rates as well.
   To obtain more powerful tests, we also conduct a number of joint tests in the bottom panel
of Table (11) across horizons
                                ¯     , 12 and 60 months. For all of our tests, we find strong
rejections of the null of no predictability for the Japanese foreign exchange returns, but these
are hard to interpret because of the collinearity problems that plague the covariance matrix in
this case. Therefore we focus our discussion on the pound and Mark returns. First, we contrast
the predictive power of local versus US instruments. We fail to find significant rejections of the
null of no predictability in both cases, but local instruments seem to have more predictive power
than US instruments. Second, we contrast the predictive power of the interest rate instruments,
with the predictive power of the yield variables. Surprisingly, the yield variables are significant
at the 5% level in the pound return regression and at the 1% level in the Mark return regression,
but the interest rate variables are not significant. Whereas the literature has typically focused on
interest rate instruments to predict returns, they do not appear strong predictors, relative to yield
variables. Third, joint tests strongly reject the null of no predictability in both regressions. We
conclude that for foreign exchange predictability returns, there is strong predictability by yield
variables but not by interest rates, the instruments used in the standard literature.


7 Conclusions
The predictable components in equity returns uncovered in empirical work over the last 20 years
have had a dramatic effect on finance research. Theoretical research on equilibrium models uses
the predictability evidence as a stylized fact to be matched. The partial equilibrium dynamic as-
set allocation literature investigates the impact of the predictability on hedging demands. Much
of the focus has been on the predictive prowess of the dividend yield, especially at long hori-
zons, but Lamont (1998) shows that earnings yields have independent predictive power. In this
article, we pose the question whether this predictability is real. After carefully accounting for
small sample properties of standard tests, our answer is surprising but important. We show that
the standard predictability patterns are not statistically significant, not robust across countries
or sample periods and fail to conform to the economic interpretation given by Lamont (1998).
Moreover, there is no evidence of long-horizon predictability in any of the 5 countries we ex-
amine. In this sense, the predictability that has been the focus of most recent finance research
is simply not there.
   Nevertheless, we do find that stock returns are predictable, calling for a re-focus of the
predictability debate in three directions. First, our results suggest that predictability is mainly
a short-horizon, not a long-horizon, phenomenon. Second, the strongest predictability comes

                                                 25
from the short rate and not from yield variables with price in the denominator. The result that the
short rate predicts equity returns goes back to at least Fama and Schwert (1977), but somehow
recent research has failed to address what might account for this predictability and has mostly
focused on dividend yield predictability. Third, there are tantalizing cross-country predictability
patterns that appear stronger than domestic predictability patterns. The emergence of a globally
integrated capital market over the last 20 years should refocus research towards determinants of
global discount rates.
   We hope that our results will, in the short run, affect the asset allocation literature, which
often has taken predictability of the dividend yield variable as given, and in the longer run,
will stimulate research on theoretical models that might explain the predictability patterns we
demonstrate, particularly short rate predictability at short horizons and across countries.

   we estimate the equation for 5 on US EURO 1 month   rates.< Second, holding these parameters as
   fixed, we estimate the remaining parameters in B , , and using Simulated Method of Moments.
   We match the first and second moments of MSCI data on log earnings growth and log payout ratio
   which use summed earnings and dividends over the past year in their construction. We also use
   the cross-moment of current (annual) growth and (annual) payout with lagged one-year growth and
                      <
   payout. The Alternative  Model is exactly identified. To estimate the Null Model we hold fixed the
          
   covariance matrix from the Alternative Model. Then using first and cross-moments we estimate
  B and . The Null Model’s VAR is estimated subject to the restrictions:

 The table lists nominal versus empirical size properties of the OLS, Robust Hansen-Hodrick and
 Hodrick t-statistics. We simulate 5000 samples of length 299 from the Constant Expected Return
 Null Model in Table (2), calculate the t-statistics for each method and record the percentage of
 observations greater than the nominal critical values under the null hypothesis of no predictability.

instruments and French instruments. We report  p-value tests for the hypothesis of base country
predictability (“Base Pred”) and local country predictability (“Local Pred”) at a one-month horizon.
P-values less than 5% are asterixed *, those less than 1% are asterixed **. Regressions for Japan
(indicated by ) are run in levels, not logs.
