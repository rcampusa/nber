                                              ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes the early history of corporate shareholding, and its relationship with political change.
 In the late eighteenth century, corporations were extremely rare and were dominated by elites, but
in the early nineteenth century, after American politics became significantly more democratic, corporations
proliferated rapidly. Using newly collected data, this paper compares the wealth and status of New
York City households who owned corporate stock to the general population there both in 1791, when
there were only two corporations in the state, and in 1826, when there were hundreds. The results
indicate that although corporate stock was held principally by the city’s elite merchants in both periods,
share ownership became more widespread over time among less affluent households. In particular,
the corporations created in the 1820s were owned and managed by investors who were less wealthy
than the stockholders of corporations created in earlier, less democratic periods in the state’s history.

1. Introduction


         Over the course of the nineteenth century, the rapid growth and proliferation of business

corporations transformed the organization of the American economy. The corporation became a

familiar part or economic life, and the financial assets issued by these enterprises became popular

investments among ordinary households. The very early history of the American corporation,

however, was quite different. In the years following the ratification of the Constitution, business

corporations were extremely rare, and their ownership was likely dominated by households who

were anything but ordinary.1 The first wave of incorporations in this era, which included the

Bank of North America, the Bank of the United States, the Bank of New York, and the Society

for the Establishment of Useful Manufactures, created businesses that were larger than any the

country had ever known. Critics expressed fears of the power and influence of the new

corporations, and argued that they undermined popular democracy and created an ‘aristocracy’ of

wealthy stockholders endowed with exclusive legal privileges. The Federalist legislators who

granted charters to these enterprises were accused of what John Wallis has termed “systematic

corruption”—the abuse of political power to manipulate the structure of the economy. The

political struggles over the creation of these institutions contributed in no small measure to the

factional divisions that led to the emergence of the Republican Party.2

         Yet over the first decades of the nineteenth century, the American state governments,

under the control of those same Republicans, created more business corporations than the world

had ever known. As the economy grew, and experienced what some historians have termed the

“market revolution,” the corporation was quickly adapted into new industries to capitalize on the

abundant economic opportunities that became available.3 With the vast expansion of markets, the

  A synthesis of the literature on the market revolution is presented in Sellers (1991) and in Larson (2010).
It is important to note that this term should not be interpreted as indicating that the economy previously

earlier dominance of a relatively small number of elite merchants and institutions was diminished.

Hammond (1957: 145) puts it well: “business was becoming democratic. It was no longer a

select and innumerous aristocracy—business opportunities were falling open to everyone.”

Likewise corporations were no longer innumerous, and many new entrants contested the markets

formerly dominated by the established firms, or entered new ones.

        Although state legislatures facilitated enormous numbers of incorporations, petitions for

charters remained contentious, and the familiar tropes of eighteenth-century anti-corporate

rhetoric found continued use. Much of this rhetoric was directed at the owners of these

institutions. Bank stockholders were called “Englishmen and Foreigners,” “Federalists and

tories,” and a “Gentry,” drawn from the “unproductive part of society” or the “wealthy and

aristocratic class,” with the power to “corrupt and subdue republican notions.”4 To a lesser extent

similar arguments were made about all corporations, which were likened to “aristocracies” and

“monopolies,” often controlled by “parcels of speculators.”5 Defenders of corporations argued

that were owned by huge numbers of investors, including ordinary people and “widows and

orphans,” and that stockholding was open to anyone with the resources to purchase a share.6

Some even argued that access to the corporate form could enable those of “small means” to

“come into fair and safe competition with the skillful and wealthy.”7

        Did corporations remain dominated by elites, or were those of the “middle order of

citizens” able to incorporate their enterprises, or at least purchase shares, in the era of Republican

governments? As politics became more democratic, did corporate ownership become more

democratic as well? The answers to these questions are central to our understanding of the

lacked a market orientation. For example, the very early market orientation among agrarian households in
Massachusetts is documented in Rothenberg (1992).

development of American capital markets and businesses organizations. Moreover, historians

have long appreciated the importance of anti-corporate rhetoric in American politics in the

nineteenth century, but it is difficult to evaluate or interpret these sentiments without a clear

understanding of who actually created and owned corporations at the time. Although an

enormous literature has developed around these questions, very little evidence is available on the

extent of corporate ownership, or the wealth and status of stockholders, in the early nineteenth

century.

           Using newly collected data from New York’s corporations in 1791 and in 1826, this

paper analyzes the wealth and status of early stockholders in New York City. Stockholders lists

of both existing corporations in the state in 1791, and nearly half of existing corporations in 1826,

were transcribed and matched to city directories, tax assessment lists, and the census. In addition,

random samples of the population were taken from city directories in both periods, and also

matched to tax lists and the census, in order to compare the stockholders to the general

population. The paper uses these data to investigate the diffusion of shareholding within New

York City, both socially and geographically, and to analyze how the ownership of corporations

evolved over time. Among the many corporations in existence in 1826 there was considerable

variation in the average wealth, status, and neighborhood locations of their shareholders, and we

investigate econometrically the corporate characteristics that were correlated with these different

ownership characteristics. Although New York’s rapid growth in both population and large

financial institutions may have been atypical of other cities, its central role in the development of

the economy and capital markets of the United States makes it an important setting in which to

study corporations and stockholding.

           The results of the analysis indicate that in 1791, only 6% of New York City’s households

owned corporate stock, but in 1826, at least 11% did, and in some parts of the city the rate was as

high as 35%. Although stock was held principally by the city’s elite merchants in both 1791 and

1826, share ownership became more widespread over time among less affluent households. In

                                                   4
particular, the corporations created in the 1820s were owned by investors who were less wealthy

than the stockholders of corporations created in earlier, less democratic periods in the state’s

history. The main result of the paper is that democratization itself paid dividends, as a new

generation of businessmen gained access to corporate charters and sold shares to increasingly

‘ordinary’ households. In a clear reflection of the changes in the politics of the city and state, the

wealthiest stockholders in 1791 were public officials—the very men who controlled access to the

corporate form—but in 1826 public officials were totally unimportant as investors in the state’s

corporations, and most of the prominent figures in state politics and government were not

stockholders at all.

         The results of this paper contribute to several areas of research. A substantial literature

on the financial history of the United States has asserted that corporate stock was quite widely

held throughout Wall Street’s history. For example, Werner and Smith (1991) argue that “the

mainstays of the early American securities market were the more numerous men of moderate

means: tradespeople, merchants, and farmers.”8 There is little evidence available on this topic,

however, and although this view is accepted quite generally, there are dissenters. Pessen’s (1973)

study of wealth and inequality argued that “the bulk of [New York’s] population probably owned

nothing or a miniscule portion of [incorporated] capital.”9 Miller (1962) argues that ordinary

households in early nineteenth-century New York preferred the state’s canal loans, whereas only

wealthier households invested in bank stock (p. 87-88). Other histories point to later events, such

as Jay Cooke’s efforts to retail treasury bonds during the Civil War, as exposing ordinary

households to securities for the first time (see for example, Geisst, 2004: 55).




8
  p. 62. Likewise Davis (1917, II: 298) argues that a “considerable body of small savers” invested in early
corporations, and Angell and Ames (1832: 35) claimed of Boston that “there is scarcely an individual of
respectable character” who is not a stockholder or member in a private corporation.
9
  p. 35. Pessen qualifies this conclusion with the claim that “It is doubtless impossible to track down the
individual owners of corporate wealth. Records, inadequate to begin with, have been lost” (p. 34).


                                                     5
        In addition, several studies have used the records of corporations in specific industries to

analyze the wealth and status of their shareholders or directors. Wright (1999; 2002) analyzed the

stockholder lists of banks from the Mid-Atlantic states and from Maine, and Majewski (2006)

analyzed the lists of subscribers to Pennsylvania bank stock. Bodenhorn (2011b) analysed a large

sample of bank stockholder lists from multiple states. Each of these studies found the shares to be

quite widely held. Lamoreaux and Glaisek’s (1991) study of Rhode Island banks in the

Jacksonian era found that the directors of newer banks there were less wealthy than their

counterparts within long-established banks. Davis (1958) studied the stockholder lists of several

prominent New England textile mills, and found a ‘vertical’ pattern of ownership in which textile

merchants were the most significant owners. Majewski (1996) compared the ownership of

transportation companies in Pennsylvania and Virginia, and documented the importance of urban

capitalists in financing Pennsylvania’s railroads. Finally, Carlos and Neal (2006) document the

distribution of shares of the Bank of England in the 1720s, which serves as an interesting and

valuable comparison case.

        This paper builds on the approach of those studies in several ways. First, it compares the

stockholders of New York’s corporations to random samples of the population, in order to

carefully assess how atypical stockholders were. Second, it analyzes corporate shareholding both

in the earliest phase of the development of the business corporation, in 1791, and then 35 years

later, in 1826, when there were hundreds of corporations in the state, in order to analyze the

evolution of stockholding over time. Finally, the 1826 sample includes a large number of

corporations in a variety of industries, and thus allows for unparalleled investigation across many

economic sectors. Moreover, those 1826 corporations were created over a long time period that

spans enormous political and economic changes. As a result, they varied substantially in their

size, charter provisions, and locations, and the effects of these differences on their ownership can

be investigated.

2. New York’s Corporations in 1791


         In 1791, aristocratic landowners and merchants dominated New York City and State

politics. Members of the families that owned the manorial estates along the Hudson had held

nearly all political offices in the colony of New York, and continued to exert overwhelming

influence in the state’s government in the early national period.10 The state’s conservative 1777

constitution was designed to maintain their position: it imposed significant property qualifications

for voting; created a “Council of Appointment” that selected many important officials such as the

Mayor of New York City; and created a “Council of Revision” within the state government that

checked the power of the elected legislature.11 New York’s elite families also benefited from

cultural norms that held that ordinary people should show respect and deference toward their

betters, not just in social interactions but also in politics.12

         The social status and authority of New York’s aristocratic officeholders entitled them to

pursue private gain while in office. Their interests were the state’s interests, and if they occupied

positions that enabled them to profit personally from their political office, it was not a source of

serious concern, for they were assumed to be “responsible and wise.”13 For example, New York

City’s (appointed) Mayor was not paid a salary, but was instead permitted to personally collect

most of the licenses and fees paid to the city, an extremely lucrative source of income.14 Other

political figures undertook major business investments while in office, and even received the

support of the state in their efforts. New York’s Chancellor, Robert R Livingston, was granted a

twenty year monopoly on the manufacture and operation of steamboats in New York in 1798, a

officeholdings among the major landowning families in the colonial era. Jaher (1982) presents an analysis
of the continued influence of these families in the state’s politics. As Engerman and Sokoloff (2002:14)
note, the system of large manorial farms ultimately failed, but this was not until the mid-nineteenth century.

   For the five years Mayor James Duane held office (1784-1789), his annual income was determined to
have been approximately £800 ($2,000), although of course no formal accounts were kept. During those
years, Duane was also a member of the New York Senate. Pomerantz (1938: 39).

year in which he also ran for Governor of the state.15 In the 1790s, partisan divisions among New

York’s elites became quite pronounced and political factions with different visions of the

appropriate role of government emerged. But each of these factions was led, at least initially, by

members of New York’s traditional elite.

        By 1791, this political system had produced only two business corporations, both located

within New York City: The Bank of New York, and the New York Society for the Establishment

of Manufactures (“New York Manufacturing Society”).16 The two enterprises were typical of

early American business corporations generally, in that they both served quasi-public purposes,

and were typical of other corporations in their industries, in that the bank was successful and the

manufacturing company was not.17

        The Bank of New York opened as an unincorporated company in April 1784, just a few

months after the British ended their occupation of the city, and was immediately profitable.18 The

bank was founded by Federalist merchants and closely associated with Alexander Hamilton, who

drafted its charter. Strong demand for its services from within New York’s merchant community,

coupled with the fact that it faced little competition, contributed to its immediate profitability. But

accusations that the bank favored Federalist borrowers and interfered in elections on behalf of

Federalist candidates stirred virulent opposition to the bank’s efforts to obtain a charter. As one

critic of the bank wrote,


        The present company which compose that body, are a combination of wealthy
        men, odious to the people, and formidable to the State…it is an institution
        formed for private emolument, injurious to the public welfare…and derogatory to
        the dignity of government.19



15
   The monopoly is granted in Laws of New York, 27 March 1798, Ch. 55. The U.S. Supreme Court later
held that this monopoly interfered in interstate commerce and was unconstitutional in its 1824 Gibbons v.
Ogden decision.

   Other unincorporated but corporate-like institutions existed in the city; see the Data Appendix.

At the time when the bank finally received its charter, in 1791, it had $318,250 in paid-in capital,

divided into 636.5 shares of $500 each, a very high sum that was typical of the earliest banks.

(Median assessed wealth in New York City at the time was $570). Its charter granted the bank

the right to expand its capital stock to $900,000, and subsequent revisions increased it to more

than $1 million. Typical of the earliest American banks it played a semi-official role in public

finance in the state, and also typical of the earliest banks it enjoyed great longevity, and in fact

continues to exist today.

         The New York Manufacturing Society, chartered in 1790, was one of the earliest

manufacturing corporations in the United States. Like many early manufacturing corporations, it

was founded with the dual purpose of promoting manufacturing industries, and actually engaging

in manufacturing. Also typical of early manufacturing corporations, it received financial support

from the state government, which subscribed to 100 of its $25 shares, whose low par value was

intended to make the shares affordable to artisans. The Manufacturing Society built a large brick

factory on Vesey Street in New York’s West Ward (see figure 1 below), and produced cotton

textiles using spinning jennies.20 Although the firm did manage to produce cotton textiles for

several years, at one point having 150 employees and more than $11,000 in total assets, it never

achieved profitability and was shut down by 1793.21 Its unsuccessful struggle to achieve

profitability was quite representative of early manufacturing corporations.

         Who owned these firms? The stockholder lists for each were transcribed, and the New

York City stockholders were matched to the Federal Census of 1790, the city directory for 1791,

and the city’s 1789 tax assessment list (additional details on sources and data are presented in the

   The Society hired Samuel Slater when he arrived in New York from England, and hoped that Slater
would help them improve their operations. But Slater found their equipment “not worth using” and also
found the water power sources in the area inadequate and so moved to Rhode Island to work with Almy &
Brown. White (1836: 72). With Almy & Brown, Slater of course established the first successful water-
powered textile mill in the United States.

   The company was required in its charter to submit financial statements to the New York State Treasurer,
and a balance sheet from 1791 survives listing £4,546 in total assets. (Records of the Comptroller’s Office,
New York State Archives, Albany NY.) The operations of the company and the number of employees are
described in Peskin (2003).

Data Appendix). For purposes of comparison, a 15% sample of household heads was taken from

the 1791 New York City directory, and those names were also matched to the census and tax list.

        These comparisons are presented in Table 1. The rows of the table present the broad

occupational categories into which the directory listings were grouped. Not surprisingly, the

occupations of stockholders tended to be quite concentrated within the category with the highest

average level of assessed wealth, “merchants”—the elite of the world of commerce. Stockholders

were also much less likely than the population as a whole to be artisans, service providers (for

example, tavern keepers, hairdressers and cartmen), or fall into the “other” category (mostly

maritime), all occupational groups with low average levels of assessed wealth. For all the

occupational categories except “professionals,” which includes attorneys and doctors, the

stockholders were far wealthier than the population average: there were, for example, artisan

stockholders, but those artisans were clearly much wealthier than their peers. The average

assessed wealth of stockholders was about 2.5 times larger than that of the population.




                                                        10
        Slavery was legal and relatively common in New York City in the 1790s.22 From the

census, the number of slaves in each household was recorded, as an independent measure of

wealth and status. Stockholders were much more likely to own slaves, with about 66% of

stockholding households reporting the presence of at least one slave in their household in the

census, compared to about 22% for all households in the city. The strong correlation between

slaveholding and stockholding was clearly driven by the fact that both occurred principally at

higher levels of wealth, but the connection may have been somewhat deeper. Slaves were an

important investment for New York households, and wills commonly specified that slaves would

take care of the owner’s family (or be rented out and produce an income for the family) if the

owner died. To the extent that the shares of New York’s earliest corporations also represented an

asset that could generate income for future generations, one would expect to see some households

attracted to both investments.

        A striking feature of the data in table 1 is that the wealthiest stockholders by far were the

public officials—their average assessed wealth, $5,828, was more than 50% higher than that of

merchants. Some of these individuals are worth noting. They include Governor George Clinton

(taxed at $2,500; 8 slaves); U.S. Senator Aaron Burr ($7,500; 5 slaves); U.S. Senator Rufus King,

who was also a director of the Bank of New York ($1,500; no slaves); Chief Justice of the U.S.

Supreme Court John Jay ($8,700; 5 slaves); Mayor Richard Varick ($2,425; 1 slave), former

mayor and current U.S. District Court judge James Duane ($8,125, 1 slave), New York State

Senator Isaac Roosevelt, who was President of the Bank of New York ($29,050; no slaves); and

U.S. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton ($3,000; no slaves). 23 That Burr and Hamilton

were both stockholders in the Bank of New York is also worth noting; although the Bank of New

York was strongly associated with the Federalist Party, there were prominent Republicans among

   In 1791, New York City was the capital of both the State of New York and of the United States, although
within that year, the Federal government moved to Philadelphia, and in 1799 the state capital was moved to
Albany.

      The boundaries of the city’s wards, and the location of the two business corporations, are marked on the Map. In
      1791, the city redefined its ward boundaries and gave them new names in the form of numbers; in the figure, the ward
      boundaries are consistent with those used in the 1790 census. The Manufacturing Society’s factory was on Vesey
      Street in the West Ward, and the Bank of New York was located in Hanover Square in the East Ward. The streets

its shareholders. The New York Manufacturing Society had both Republican and Federalist

shareholders as well.

        In 1791, New York City was divided into seven wards. Figure 1 depicts the boundaries

of the city’s wards on map, which also displays the extent of the city’s streets in 1791. The

locations of the city’s two business corporations are also marked on the map. By investigating

wealth, occupations and stockholding rates within New York’s different wards, further insight

into the social context of stock ownership can be obtained.

Note: Mean assessed wealth is the mean value of taxable (real and personal) wealth recorded on assessment lists for household heads
whose primary residence is listed in each ward, and may include real estate located in other wards. Percent of directory entries
indicates the share of total individuals and businesses (usually household heads and partnerships) in each ward. Percent of assessed
wealth is the share of taxable wealth of all sampled households. The percent of households that owned stock is estimated by
apportioning the stockholders that could not be uniquely identified in the directory into wards at the same rate as the stockholding
households listed in the directory; see data appendix for details. Percent slaveholding is calculated from the 1790 Federal census.



                 These comparisons are presented in Table 2.24 The highest average levels of wealth were

       found in New York’s East and Montgomery wards, where a relatively large portion of households

       were headed by merchants, and slaveholding was relatively common. Households in the western

       and northern part of Manhattan, the Out and West wards, had far lower levels of wealth and were

       often headed by artisans. Rates of stock ownership can be calculated from these data; overall it

       was quite low, and reached its maximum in the wealthy East ward, and its minimum in the Out

       ward, although there were at least a few stockholders in every ward. Overall the rate of

       households owning stock was 6%.

                 Taken together, the data in tables 1 and 2 indicate that the city’s stockholders were quite

       atypical of the population. They lived in exclusive neighborhoods; they were quite wealthy, and

       likely to own slaves; and they were unlikely to be artisans or hold other modest occupations.

       They were often elite merchants, with ties to the state’s aristocratic landowning families. The

       city was an extraordinarily unequal and economically segregated place, and the individuals who

        Using his 100% sample from the 1789 tax list, White (1991:xxvii) finds the wealth share of the top 10%
       was 55.6%. In our sample of 15% of households, it is 50.8%.

                                                                 13
invested in stock were drawn from the very top ranks of the wealth distribution. Given the

initially uncertain prospects of these firms, this may have represented an efficient allocation of

risks, and was all but inevitable.

         But the elites who owned these firms also controlled the government of the state and of

the city. A corporation could only be formed by a special act of the state legislature, which meant

that these shareholder-politicians could protect their firms from competition and enrich

themselves by simply refusing to grant potential competitors a corporate charter. And this is

exactly what they did: the next bank to be created in New York, the Bank of the Manhattan

Company, was not incorporated until 1799, and was granted a charter only because its Republican

founders deceived the legislature about their intentions.25 But a process of significant economic

and political change was well underway by the early nineteenth century, which made broader use

of the corporate form inevitable.



3. New York’s Corporations in 1826


         The 35 years that elapsed after 1791 witnessed a transformation of the economy of New

York. Transportation networks expanded and developed, with steamboats traveling the Hudson

river and the Erie Canal opening a waterway to the west; the port of New York City emerged as

the nation’s largest center for trade; successful, large-scale manufacturing enterprises emerged,

and began to replace household production of goods such as textiles; financial markets deepened;

and increasingly specialized producers and distributors transacted in a market that was becoming

far more integrated. The population of New York City grew from 33,131 in 1790 to more than

166,036 in 1825, as it surpassed Philadelphia to become the nation’s largest. Economic

opportunity abounded in the city, and its population became more prosperous.

25
   The charter for the Manhattan Company authorized the creation of a firm to supply Manhattan with
water, but included a clause granting it the power to employ any “surplus capital” in “monied transactions,”
which its founders immediately exploited to open a bank. New York Laws, 1799, ch. 84. Hammond (1957)
tells the story well.

         Over these years, the state government used the law creatively and aggressively to

promote economic development.26 In particular, this meant granting ever greater numbers of

charters to businesses in many industries. In some sectors, particularly banking, incumbent firms

successfully limited access to the corporate form, but enormous numbers of charters were granted

in other industries.27 From 1790 to 1825, 812 corporations were created, and in 1826, there were

approximately 282 corporations in existence in the state, of which about 73 were located in New

York City. Turnpike roads, bridge companies, water companies, gas companies, trading firms,

steamboat lines, insurance companies, and many other types of firms were incorporated. In

manufacturing, the state even enacted a general incorporation act in 1811, facilitating essentially

open access to the corporate form in several manufacturing industries.28 Over time, access to

incorporation expanded significantly, and a broad range of individuals and interests formed new

firms.

         Shareholder lists for 133 of these 282 corporations were located and transcribed. Table 3

presents summary statistics for the ownership of the 133 corporations in the sample. The

corporations were owned overwhelmingly by individuals and partnerships, and it is these owners

who will be the focus of the analysis.29 But a substantial portion of some corporations’ shares

were owned by trusts or estates, and it is important to note that the wealth and status of the

ultimate beneficiaries of those shares cannot be identified, as the stockholder lists normally

provided the names of the trustees or executors, rather than the beneficiaries.

         The average size and ownership structures of the corporations varied widely across

industries. Table 4 presents summary statistics for the industrial categories into which the firms

were grouped. The data in the table indicate that banks were substantially larger than firms in

other industries. In many respects, though, the manufacturing firms were the most unusual: they

had the highest par value for their shares, the lowest number of shareholders by far, and the

largest average value of investment per shareholder (‘Value of Investment’ in the table). The

banks and insurance companies both had very large average numbers of shareholders, reflecting

their greater size, and reasonably low par values, which likely improved the liquidity of the

shares.30 The shares of nearly all of the banks and insurance companies in the sample were traded

on the New York Stock & Exchange Board (NYSE).

         For the 133 corporations in the sample, the addresses and occupations of all stockholders

residing in New York City who could be found in the city directory were recorded. Their names

29
   Partnerships where none of the individual partners were also shareholders were treated as if they were
individuals, with their taxable wealth and industry or occupation recorded in the data. The wealth of
partnerships where the partners also owned stock under their own names was added to the individual
partners’ wealth and eliminated from the sample.
30
   The significance of par values for the liquidity of corporate shares in the nineteenth century is analyzed
in Rousseau (2009).

                                                      16
and addresses were then used to obtain measures of their wealth from the city’s tax assessment

rolls. The assessments list real and personal wealth separately, and exclude corporate wealth,

which under the state’s 1823-28 tax law was assessed on the corporations themselves, which

would then pay the tax on their own real and personal property.31 Although assessors were sworn

to record accurate property values, their assessments likely understated the true values.32 As with

the analysis for 1791, a random sample of households was taken from the 1826 city directory, to

serve as a basis of comparison to the stockholders. This sample was equivalent in size to 10% of

the population of directory entries.

         About 3,000 New York City households owned shares of stock in 1826, a tenfold

increase from 1791.33 Table 5 presents average assessed wealth and occupations of the

population and the stockholders of New York City in the same format as the 1791 data in table 1.

Interestingly, the occupational structure of the population remained quite similar in 1826, with the

only significant changes being a decline in the share engaged in the provision of services, and a

small increase in the share of those listed as merchants. In a sense, the population of 1826 was a

vastly scaled-up version of the 1791 population. But average wealth grew nearly threefold from

1791, a clear sign of rising prosperity in the city, and the rising property values that accompanied

that prosperity.34 The average taxable wealth of stockholders also grew by the same proportion,



31
   The items included in personal property were enumerated in a subsequent law: government bonds, bank
notes, bank deposits, furniture, and loans such as mortgages made to solvent borrowers. Revised Statutes
(1829), Vol. I ch. III. The exclusion of corporate wealth from tax assessments was made in order to
facilitate more effective collection of taxes on corporate stock, since shares in private hands could easily be
concealed from assessors. New York Laws, 1823, ch. 262.
32
   The tax law of 1823 stipulates that “real and personal property shall be valued by the assessors for the
purpose of taxation at the value they would appraise such estate in payment of a bona fide debt due from a
solvent debtor.” New York Laws, 1823, ch. 262. However, contemporary observers and modern scholars
both argue that assessments substantially understated true wealth. For example, Hilt and O’Banion’s
(2009) analysis of New York merchants in the 1850s found assessed values of wealth to be equal to about
36% of estimated net worth as recoded by the R.G. Dun & Company agents. See also Pessen (1973) and
the sources cited therein.
33
   It should be noted that this is almost certainly an undercount, since the stockholder lists of many
corporations could not be found.
34
   All data are presented in nominal terms. According to the David-Solar-based CPI for this period, the
total increase in the price level from 1791 to 1826 was 5.31%.

and the ratio of the stockholders’ wealth to the population’s wealth remained essentially constant

between the two periods, at about 2.5.

         Among the stockholders, the occupational distribution was also similar to the 1791

values, with two important exceptions. First, the share of professionals increased substantially.

This group included many individuals whose livelihoods depended on corporations either directly

(such as bank cashiers) or indirectly (such as attorneys), and the large size of this group

potentially indicates a growing effect of corporations on employment patterns in the city.

Secondly, public officials were no longer important stockholders.35 And although the public

officials who owned stock were quite wealthy, they were no longer the wealthiest category of

stockholders. More importantly, neither the governor, DeWitt Clinton, nor U.S. Senator Martin

Van Buren, the most powerful figure in the state’s Republican Party, were stockholders in any

New York corporation.36 As in 1791, within every occupational category, the stockholders were

   A potential concern is that many 1826 corporations were considerably older than the corporations
observed in 1791. This age difference may account for some of the differences in the occupational
distributions of shareholders, if, say, share were initially allocated to public officials, who then sold the
shares over time. However, the occupations of the shareholders of the newest 1826 corporations—those
created in 1824 and 1825—are also quite different from the 1791 stockholders’ and in fact only 1.5% are
public officials. Data on stockholder wealth by year of incorporation are presented below.

   In New York City politics, however, the picture was different. The Mayor in 1826 was William
Paulding, Jr., a shareholder in two insurance corporations taxed at $18,500.

wealthier than the general population: artisans and retailers did own stock, but they were the

more successful or wealthy members of those groups.

        In 1826, we can once again examine the social context of shareholding in greater depth

by looking at the geographical distribution of the corporations themselves, and their shareholders.

As New York’s population grew and shifted uptown over time, the city’s wards were

reconfigured repeatedly, and by 1826 the ward boundaries had almost no relationship with those

of 1790-91. Figure 2 presents a map of the city with the ward boundaries in place in 1826, and

the location of each operating business corporation marked. The majority of corporations were

located in the First Ward, and nearly all of those were headquartered on Wall Street, which is

clearly evident on the map. Many of these Wall Street firms were banks and insurance

Note: Mean assessed wealth is the mean value of taxable (real and personal) wealth recorded on assessment lists for household heads
whose primary residence is listed in each ward, and may include real estate located in other wards. Percent of directory entries indicates
the share of total individuals and businesses (usually household heads and partnerships) in each ward. Percent of assessed wealth is the
share of taxable wealth held in each ward. Percent of corporate wealth is the total stock owned by households or businesses located in
each ward as a share of total stock owned by all individuals and businesses where an address could be found. The percent of households
that owned stock is estimated by apportioning the stockholders who could not be identified uniquely in the directory into wards at the
same rate as stockholding households listed in the directory; see data appendix for details.


        companies whose shares were traded on the NYSE, but they also included some manufacturing

        and mining firms. Nonetheless, a substantial minority of New York’s corporations were located

        in the city’s upper wards.

                  Table 6 presents data on wealth, occupations and stockholding by ward. The data

        indicate that the proportion of households that owned stock had nearly doubled, from about 6% in

        1791 to 11%, and in the richest (First) ward the rate was 35%. But the data also indicate that

        there was greater inequality across wards in 1826, with households in the First Ward having an

        average level of taxable wealth that was nearly ten-fold higher than that of the poorest ward.

        Following the rows down the table, and thus moving toward the “mechanic” wards uptown, one

        sees the proportion of artisans increase, the average level of wealth decrease, and the rate of stock

        ownership also decreases. But wealth and stockholding were imperfectly correlated, and even in

        some of the wards where average household wealth was relatively low, the rate of stock

        ownership was as high as 10%.

         The data in the table also provide an indication of the degree of inequality of the

distribution of assessed wealth, and corporate wealth, across wards. The overall Gini coefficient

for the distribution of assessed wealth was .65, which was essentially unchanged from its 1791

value of .66. And the First Ward, which accounted for only about 11% of directory entries, held

about 37% of assessed wealth. However, a much greater share of corporate stock, 47%, was held

there, indicating that the ownership of corporate wealth was even more concentrated than that of

taxable wealth.

         Did the composition of stockholders vary by industry? Perhaps the shares of companies

in specific industries were attractive to particular types of investors. One might imagine, for

example, that large publicly traded banks and insurance companies would be attractive to passive

investors from middle-income households, whereas shares in manufacturing companies, which

were highly illiquid, would have been more attractive to individuals with some knowledge of or

connection to the firm, as Davis (1956) has shown of New England’s textile companies.

         Table 7 presents a breakdown of the occupations of shareholders by industry.37 The

occupational distributions of the stockholders across industries were generally similar, with those

  Note that the table presents the percentages of shares owned in each industry, rather than the percentage
of shareholders, as in tables 1 and 5.

of bank and insurance being nearly identical. In manufacturing firms, artisans owned shares at a

substantially higher rate than they did in other industries. It is worth noting that the transportation

companies, which included turnpike roads, bridges, canals, and steamboat companies, were

mostly located outside of New York City, and it was probably wealthy merchants who owned

land in the areas where the companies were located who bought shares in those firms—their local

shareholders may have had a somewhat different occupational distribution.38 In any case, the

investors in transportation companies and companies grouped into the residual “other” category

(which included a water company, a trading company, a gas company, etc.) were highly

concentrated in the elite categories of merchants and professionals, and received very little

investments from almost any other occupational group.



4. Stockholding and Political and Economic Change


         In the 35-year interval between 1791 and 1826, New York’s politics changed

considerably. Popular participation in politics expanded, and the old aristocracy saw its influence

in the state’s politics gradually diminish.39 Progress was made toward the elimination of slavery

through a gradual manumission act in 1799, which was then strengthened in 1817.40 Political

“societies” and voluntary organizations emerged, mobilizing political participation and creating

the foundations for the Second Party System of the Jacksonian Era.41 A relatively new species of

political figure, the professional politician, emerged. Beliefs in “inherent, irradicable differences

among men” which formed the basis of the hierarchical order of society with aristocratic elites at



38
   In general, the breakdowns for the occupations of manufacturing firms’ stockholders are consistent with
the findings of Davis (1956), and those of the banks are roughly consistent with the findings of Majewski
(2006) for Pennsylvania bank stockholders from around 1814, although those banks seemed to attract more
numerous small investments from artisans.

   Laws of New York, 1817, ch. 137. By the 1817 act, all slaves born before July 4, 1799 were to be free on
July 4, 1827, whereas those born after that date were to be free at a certain age, depending on their gender.

the top were rejected.42 To be sure, many aristocratic landowners and merchants remained

important figures in the state’s politics, but individuals of more modest levels of wealth

demanded much greater influence. And in 1821, this process of democratization culminated in a

new constitution that abolished the Councils of Appointment and Revision, and effectively

eliminated property qualifications for voting by adult white males.43

        Did this political transformation expand access to the corporate form, or change the

character of the corporations that were created? Certainly the names chosen by incorporators for

their enterprises began to change. Whereas early New York charters were granted to the Bank of

New York, Merchants Bank (inc. 1805), and New York Insurance (1798), later incorporations

included the Mechanics Bank (1810), Farmers Fire Insurance and Loan (1822), Tradesmen’s

Bank (1823), and Tradesmen’s Insurance (1825), a tradition that would ultimately continue with

institutions such as the Butcher’s and Drover’s Bank (1830) and the Leather Manufacturers’ Bank

(1832). Likewise, petitions and memorials seeking corporate charters claimed that they would

operate in the uptown “mechanic” wards of Manhattan—neighborhoods that had attracted few

investments from “persons owning large quantities of property”—and argued that the profits from

providing services in those neighborhoods should be earned by a company in which “those who

have to pay the money have an interest.”44 But whether these newer corporations were actually

owned or managed by groups previously excluded from access to the corporate form, or whether

these were merely cynical gestures intended to win political support for a charter, is unclear.

        If the process of democratization of the state’s politics actually did allocate corporate

charters to previously excluded groups, or create corporations owned by households that were

less wealthy than their predecessors, then the aggregate statistics for the ownership of all

corporations in 1826 presented in table 5 above likely concealed this pattern of change. In order

to investigate the effects of democratization on incorporations, the ownership of corporations of

different ‘vintages’ in 1826 will be compared. The hypothesis to be investigated is that newer

corporations—those created in more democratic eras—would have been owned by less wealthy

or prominent shareholders. As the New York City stockholders that are the focus of this paper

frequently constituted a small minority of the total shareholders of upstate corporations, the

analysis will focus on to the 53 corporations located within the city for which an ownership list

could be found for 1826.

        Before examining the data, it is worth noting that any initial differences in the ownership

of corporations created in different eras likely dissipated over time. One might expect, for

example, that the ownership of new corporations would be quite concentrated in the hands of the

founders, but would gradually diffuse as the founders sold off their stakes and other investors

purchased the shares.45 Moreover, if newer companies’ prospects were less certain, one would

expect their shares to be held by specialized investors who would be best able to gauge and

perhaps hedge their risks. This would imply that older corporations would tend to have more

diffuse ownership and larger numbers of small investors than they had initially, thus obscuring

any differences between those corporations and their successors created in a more democratic era.

        Figure 4 presents the ownership of New York City’s corporations in 1826, by charter

year. (The corporations are grouped into three-year periods because in some years there were few

incorporations.) Panels (a) and (b) plot the ownership rates of artisans and merchants, both in

terms of the percentage of the stock held, and the percentage of the stockholders. Although the

rate of ownership by artisans generally remained low, newer corporations tended to be owned at a

higher rate by these men, and the rate of ownership of merchants was generally declining over

time. Newer corporations attracted investments from less-elite households at higher rates—and

these households were less elite not only in terms of their occupations, but also in their level of

wealth. Panel (c) plots the mean and median assessed wealth of stockholders, which was

generally decreasing with the year of incorporation. In fact the average wealth of investors of

corporations chartered prior to 1810 was nearly 2.5 times as high as that of the investors in

corporations chartered in 1823 or later—a difference of the same magnitude as that between

stockholders and all households. Panel (d) plots the size of the blocks in which the shares of

corporations were held; this was also generally falling over time, although most of this change

occurred in the earliest periods. Although the ownership of corporate stock was still relatively

uncommon and median household wealth ($1,683) was quite low relative to the cost of a single

share (usually $50), share ownership was clearly becoming more common among less elite

segments of society. Thus despite the tendency of the shares of older firms to become widely

held, persistent differences in the wealth and status of owners among corporations created in

different eras were clearly observable in the stockholder lists of 1826.

         If the stockholders of newer corporations were less wealthy, what about the men who

actually controlled the enterprises, and were best able to profit from their operations? Perhaps the

directors of the newer firms were drawn from the same parts of society as their counterparts in the

older ones, and simply acted to attract investments from more ordinary households. This

possibility is investigated in panel (e) of the figure, which compares the wealth and status of the

directors of corporations of different vintages, for the 44 corporations for which both a list of

directors and a stockholder list could be found. As the panel makes clear, the contrast in the level

of wealth of directors of newer and older corporations was even more dramatic than the contrast

in the level of wealth of the shareholders. Older corporations were managed by much wealthier

directors than new ones. And as panel (f) makes clear, the directors of new corporations were

much less likely to be drawn from the city’s elite merchants.46



46
   Other tabulations, not shown, indicate that the directors of newer corporations were also more likely to
be artisans and less likely to be public officials.

                   Did the charters of the newer corporations contain provisions that made an investment in

their shares more attractive to small investors? Figure 5 plots several firm characteristics by year

of incorporation.                 Panel (a) presents the average par value of the shares of corporations. This

falls dramatically, from about $200 to about $50 by 1814-16, and remains roughly constant

subsequently. Although lower par values would likely have made the shares more liquid, and

thus more attractive to any investor, this effect would probably be greatest for an investor making

a small investment. Thus it probably made the shares more accessible and appealing to investors

                                                                     27
of limited wealth. Larger firms seeking to raise significant amounts of capital from subscribers

might have been forced appeal to small shareholders, and panel (b) plots the average capital per

corporation over the period. This is actually decreasing, with brief increase in the 1811-13 period

when the state chartered several enormous banks in the aftermath of the expiration of the charter

of the First Bank of the United States. Panel (d) plots the location of the corporations, measured

as the percentage (weighted by capital) located in New York’s First Ward. This is gradually

decreasing over time, as newer corporations increasingly located in the city’s upper wards.

Finally, panel (c) plots the percentage of corporations whose charters imposed a “graduated

voting rights” scheme, in which the votes per share to which an investor was entitled was a

decreasing function of the number of shares that investor held (see Hilt, 2008 for a detailed

discussion.) These measures were commonly imposed in early corporations, as a mechanism for

protecting small investors. They became increasingly uncommon over time, however.47

        In sum, in 1826 the investors and directors in the city’s newest corporations were quite

different than those of the city’s older corporations. This could have been due to efforts to

configure newer corporations’ charters in a way that made them appealing to non-elite

stockholders, to efforts market the shares to ordinary households, or simply to the persistence of

elite ownership among the older firms. On the other hand, this may have been due to the subtly

changing industrial composition of the firms over time. Moreover, it is not clear to what extent

the changes were due to changes in the characteristics of the firms, such as the decreases in the

par values, or to other factors such as the political orientation of the government that authorized

the charter.




47
  On the consequences of these measures, see Bodenhorn (2011) for U.S. banks, and Musacchio (2009) for
nineteenth century Brazilian corporations.

4.1 Regression results

         We investigate these issues in greater depth by collapsing the above data down to the

firm level, and performing regressions to analyze the correlates of individual firms’ ownership

structures. In order to understand the extent to which the changing characteristics of firms over

time explains differences in their ownership structure, we include data on firm locations, par

values, board sizes (sometimes used to expand shareholder representation), capital, and indicators

for whether or not the firm’s shares were traded on the NYSE, whether or not its charter specified

graduated voting rights for its shareholders, and industry fixed effects. With a time trend also

included in the regressions, these specifications will enable us to investigate the extent to which

the changing characteristics of firms can account for their changing ownership structures over

time. It is important to note that many of these firm characteristics were endogenously chosen by

incorporators, or as in the case of listing on the NYSE, may even have been influenced by the

ownership structure itself. Therefore, the estimated correlations can not be interpreted as causal.

Nonetheless, they do shed some light on which characteristics of corporations were correlated

with their changing ownership structures.

         Table 8 presents the results of the first of these regressions, for three different measures

of ownership structure: the percentage of the stock held by artisans, the percentage held by

merchants, and the mean assessed wealth of stockholders.48 The results for all three convey

essentially the same result, which is that the owners of later corporations were lower status, and

less wealthy. In each of the specifications, the age variable exerts a powerful and statistically

significant effect, even with the corporate characteristics added into the regression as covariates,

indicating that these characteristics can only partly account for the change in ownership over

time.




48
  Results for specifications based on the percentage of stockholders (rather than stock held) in those
occupations are substantially similar.

        With each ownership variable, the corporation’s location clearly matters. Location in the

First Ward was correlated with an increase in the assessed wealth of owners, and in the

percentage ownership of merchants, equivalent to more than half of a standard deviation in those

variables. This may be an indication that corporations located in upper wards actually attracted

investments from the less wealthy residents of those wards, or that corporations chose to locate in

the First Ward in order to attract investments from the wealthy merchants residing there.

Interestingly, companies whose shares were traded on the NYSE were not owned by artisans or

wealthier individuals at a differential rate that could be estimated precisely, but the rate at which

merchants owned the firms was higher—the effect is about the same as the effect of location in

the first ward. This is likely due to the fact that the shares of firms that traded on the NYSE were

  often held by brokers and speculators, who were classified as merchants. Another interesting

  correlation is that of graduated voting rights, which do not seem to have much of a relationship

  with the occupational distribution of shareholders, but seem to attract wealthier shareholders.

  This effect is also about the same in size as that of location in the First Ward. Finally, across all

  specifications, industry clearly matters; transportation and “other industry” firms had much

  wealthier and higher-status investors, even controlling for age and other firm characteristics.

  Likewise, manufacturing firms seemed to attract merchants at a higher rate.

             These results are explored further in table 9, which presents regressions for alternative

  measures of firm ownership. In the first two columns, regressions analyzing the determinants of

  the percentage of each corporation’s stock held in New York’s upper wards are presented. Once

                                                            31
again, the location of the corporation clearly matters. Corporations in the First Ward had fewer

shareholders from the upper wards, relative to corporations that were actually located in those

wards. This result may be consistent with the behavior of modern investors, who have been

shown to prefer shares in companies that are familiar (see, for example, Huberman 2001). Or it

could simply be that the local customers of these firms were also their investors. But

interestingly, there is no overall time trend in this variable, and firms with higher par values

seemed to attract more investors from the upper wards, something which is difficult to explain,

unless the ownership stakes held in the upper wards were often in single shares or small blocks of

shares, in which case a higher par value of the shares could marginally increase the amount

held.49 The mean value of the stake held in the corporations is analyzed in the next two columns.

This is clearly increasing in the par value per share, which would almost have a mechanical

relationship with this variable. But none of the other corporate characteristics seem to help

explain much of the variation in this variable. Finally, the determinants of the assessed wealth of

the directors are investigated in the final two columns. This is significantly higher for

corporations located in the First Ward and for corporations with graduated voting rights. But

even controlling for the different corporate characteristics, the time trend has a very large effect,

indicating that older corporations had much wealthier directors.

            Taken together, these results indicate that only some of the variation in the ownership

structure of corporations of different ages can be explained by the changing characteristics of the

companies themselves. The corporations of the 1820s were created in a more democratic

economy, by a more democratic government, and their ownership responded in ways that can not

be fully explained by the provisions written into their charters, and the other characteristics of the

corporations included in the regressions. Perhaps other characteristics much more difficult to

measure, such as the efforts to promote the purchase of shares to particular segments of the



49
     This effect is, of course, ambiguous; a larger par value could easily cause a small investor to hold less.

                                                         32
population, or the reputations of the founders, may also have influenced the ownership of the

firms.



4.2 Discussion of the results

         It is important to note that these results do not in fact indicate that as New York became

more democratic, potential incorporators from throughout society were able to obtain corporate

charters as frequently as they wanted, or on the terms they wanted. Powerful incumbent interests

may have dictated the terms under which newer corporate charters were granted, and imposed

conditions on new entrants that prevented them from competing too directly, either for capital or

in markets for goods and services, with existing firms. The decision to operate in uptown wards,

or to make the shares attractive to small investors, may have been imposed on the new firms as a

condition on their existence. Indeed, claims that new corporations would operate in

neighborhoods “remote from the vicinity”50 of Wall Street may have been intended as a pledge

not to compete with the incumbent firms located there; the requirement to adhere to this pledge

was sometimes written into law.51

         But the results clearly do indicate that New York granted access to corporate charters to

increasingly less wealthy and lower-status individuals. In light of these data, what are we to

make of the virulent anti-corporate rhetoric of the 1820s and 1830s, in particular when it was

aimed at stockholders? In a sense, charges of “aristocracy” may have helped produce the broader

ownership of New York’s newer corporations in the 1820s, perhaps by pushing legislators to

grant broader access to charters, or to configure charters in ways intended to appeal to less

wealthy investors. As Maier (1993) has noted, the agenda behind anti-corporate agitators may

have been to influence the design of corporations that got created, rather than to block the

50
  New York Senate Documents, 6 February 1822.
51
  For example, Tradesmen’s Bank, incorporated in 1823, stipulates that “the banking house of the said
incorporation, shall be located in Chatham Square, in the said city, or its immediate vicinity, and not to the
westward of James-street.” (Laws of New York, 20 March 1823, ch. 93.) Chatham Square is at the
intersection of the Fourth and Sixth Wards.

                                                      33
creation of corporations, and the data in this paper has shown that they were at least partially

victorious.

         Other, more conservative critics of corporations witnessed the developments documented

in this paper with alarm. Jurist James Kent referred to New York’s profligate grants of charters

as “improvident” and “evil,” and legislator John King, at New York’s 1821 Constitutional

Convention, argued they had produced “great public mischief.”52 Both fundamentally respected

the vested rights of incumbent corporations, and opposed Republican governments’ openness to

petitions for charters from the ‘less respectable’ orders of society, for fear that the rights of

existing corporations would be eroded. Many of the incorporators criticized by Kent and King

were keenly aware of the erosion of vested privileges created by widespread use of the corporate

form, and thus offered critiques of corporate powers in order to justify granting broader access to

charters.53


5. Conclusion


         The proliferation of business corporations in the early nineteenth century exemplifies the

zeal of early state governments to use the law to promote economic development. Access to the

corporate form was expanded over time, and the corporation became a familiar part of economic

life. But this paper has shown that within the 35 years between 1791 and 1826, the ownership of

corporations changed as well. Whereas in 1791, aristocratic landowners and merchants

controlled both the state government and the corporations it created, by 1826, political figures

were no longer important stockholders, and a much broader segment of society participated in the

creation and ownership of corporations. Charters were granted for business that operated even in

the “mechanic” wards of uptown Manhattan, and ownership of shares of stock spread into those

52
   Kent (1827 II: 219), and New York (1821: 446). Both men were stockholders, and in fact Kent was a
stockholder in one of the very institutions he criticized the legislature for incorporating, Chemical Bank.
53
   Arguing for a bank charter, one incorporator wrote “In proportion as the legislature extends a privilege,
in that proportion the monopoly which grows out of its exclusive enjoyment is diminished.” New York
Senate Documents, 6 February 1822.

                                                     34
neighborhoods as well.     To be sure, the elite merchants who dominated commerce in New York

also held the majority of corporate stock; when measured as a percentage of total capital, the

stockholdings of artisans and those of modest wealth were relatively small. But at least some of

the new enterprises incorporated in the 1820s were created to be owned, and managed, by men

who lacked the pedigree and wealth of the prominent merchants who controlled the older, better-

established corporations in the city. Engerman and Sokoloff (2002) have argued that the rapid

economic growth of the period was associated with an institutional evolution that facilitated

broader access to economic opportunity; the results presented here represent a noteworthy

example of this process.

        The liberal use of the corporate form in the 1820s was not the same as free or open access

to incorporation. Petitions for charters in some industries remained highly contentious, and often

failed, as incumbent firms and their allies worked against the creation of firms that threatened

their interests. In the legislature, intense lobbying, “log-rolling” strategies, and even bribery were

all part of the politics of chartering. The dramatic change marked by the era of broader

participation in politics was that political figures supported by mechanics and tradesmen were

able to successfully compete within this legislative environment, and managed to create

corporations that were quite different from those of earlier generations. There was certainly a fair

measure of cynicism in these efforts, and the creation of the “Tradesmen’s Bank” should not be

confused with an altruistic effort to benefit tradesmen. Nonetheless, the results of this paper have

shown that the corporations created in the 1820s were in fact managed and owned by men of less

wealth and lower status than those created in earlier eras.

Data Appendix

1791 Sources and Data: The names of the shareholders for the two 1791 corporations, the Bank of New
York and the New York Manufacturing Society, have been published. The list of stockholder for the Bank
of New York in 1791 is in Nevins (1934), and the list of stockholders of the New York Manufacturing
Society is printed in the New York Daily Advertiser, 17 March 1789. The Manufacturing Society list
unfortunately does not include the number of shares held by each investor. These names were then matched
to the Federal Census of 1790 to obtain information on slave holdings, and to the city’s 1789 tax
assessment list. The names were also matched to the 1791 New York Directory and Register, which
provided addresses and occupations. In 1791 there were 343 unique shareholders. The Bank of New York
had 190 stockholders and the New York Manufacturing Society had 186; 33 individuals owned both. Of
the 343 shareholders, 300 likely resided in New York City, and of these, 262 could be uniquely identified
in the directory. A random sample of approximately 15% of households was taken from the 1791
directory, by recording all of the entries on every sixth page, which yielded 776 out of 4,752 total entries,
or 16.33%. These were then also matched to the 1790 Federal Census, and to the 1789 tax assessment list.
In order to calculate stockholding rates in individual wards, the 38 New York City stockholders who could
not be uniquely identified in the directory (usually because there was more than one entry with the same
name) were allocated to the different wards at the same rates as the stockholders who could be identified.

In addition to the two corporations, the 1791 New York City directory lists an unincorporated joint-stock
insurance company in operation, the Mutual Assurance Society, which would become incorporated in
1798. No list of investors from this period survives, but eleven of the twelve directors of the Society were
stockholders in one or both of New York’s corporations, and four of the twelve were directors in one of the
corporations. It is quite likely that the ownership of this third enterprise was substantially the same as the
two incorporated firms. Also Davis (1917 II: 260) mentions an unincorporated New York City iron
company that received some corporate privileges from the state in 1786, but probably never went into
operation.

1826 Sources and Data: The stockholder lists for the 1826 corporations are held mostly in the New York
State Archives in various record groups associated with the comptroller's office, including A0833, A0829,
and A0847. These lists were submitted to the comptroller pursuant to the New York State tax of 1823-28,
which exempted individuals’ stock holdings from personal taxation, instead collecting taxes on paid-in
capital from the corporations themselves. Under this tax, corporations were required to submit the name,
place of residence, and number of shares owned by each stockholder to the state comptroller so the
revenues could be distributed to county governments. Of the 242 corporations in operation in New York
State in 1826, these lists survive for 133. This sample includes $26.3 million of the $48 million total paid-in
capital in the state and $19.1 million of the $34.8 million incorporated capital held in New York City. All
available information was transcribed for each shareholder from all these lists.

The 1826 shareholders’ names were matched to entries in Longworth’s American Almanac, New-York
Register, and City Directory (1826) to determine the address and occupation of shareholders who lived in
New York City. The directory includes “the names, occupations, and place of residence of all heads of
families, firms, and those doing business in this City.” Household heads with no occupation listed, which
included many prominent figures such as John Jacob Astor and Nathaniel Prime, were classified as
merchants. We then located the addresses on contemporary maps, particularly W. Hooker’s Plan of the City
of New York (1825) and S. Marks’ A New Map of the City of New York, Comprising all the Late
Improvements (1827), in order to identify the ward within which the stockholder resided. Most
stockholders had only one address listed, but some had two addresses. The tabulations in the paper are
based on primary business addresses.

With the address we were able to look up each shareholder within the city’s tax assessment records, which
survive in the New York Municipal Archives, to determine the assessed value of real and personal wealth,
which were combined to calculate total assessed wealth. Real and personal property assessed at primary
and secondary addresses were recorded, but any real estate holdings not corresponding to a listed address
could not be included: there is no index to the assessment lists. Stockholdings were not included in these


                                                     36
assessments, because the 1823-28 tax law required the corporation, rather than the stockholders, to pay the
tax.

The 133 corporations from 1826 for which stockholder lists survive had a total of 6,534 unique
stockholders, 6,019 of which were individuals or partnerships and 2,999 of those were listed as residing in
New York City, of which 1,743 could be uniquely identified in the city directory.

For 1826, an approximately 10% random sample of households from the city directory was collected. The
sample was taken by entering every tenth page of the directory. The 1826 sample had 2,798 out of 27,500
total entries (or 10.17%).

Charters for all New York City corporations were coded from Laws of New York, 1791-1825. Lists of
directors for New York City corporations were found by searching contemporary newspapers, including the
New York Evening Post, Commercial Advertiser, Enquirer, and American. Finally, corporations were
denoted as NYSE traded if a price could be found for them in any month in 1825 or 1826 in the Sylla,
Wilson and Wright (2005) dataset.
