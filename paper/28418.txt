                                         ABSTRACT

This paper assesses the prospects of a 2021 time bomb in SME failures triggered by the generous
support policies enacted during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis. Policies implemented in 2020, on
their own, do not create a 2021 "time-bomb" for SMEs. Rather, business failures and policy costs
remain modest. By contrast, credit contraction poses significant risk. Such a contraction would
disproportionately impact firms that could survive COVID-19 in 2020 without any fiscal support.
Even in that scenario, most business failures would not arise from excessively generous 2020
policies, but rather from the contraction of credit to the corporate sector.

          This paper assesses the prospects of a 2021 time bomb in SME failures triggered by the
      generous support policies enacted during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis. Policies implemented
      in 2020, on their own, do not create a 2021 "time-bomb" for SMEs. Rather, business failures
      and policy costs remain modest. By contrast, credit contraction poses significant risk. Such
      a contraction would disproportionately impact firms that could survive COVID-19 in 2020
      without any fiscal support. Even in that scenario, most business failures would not arise
      from excessively generous 2020 policies, but rather from the contraction of credit to the
      corporate sector.

   The global COVID-19 shock was unexpected, severe, and complex. The initial policy re-
sponse, hastily cobbled together in the first quarter of 2020, was designed to curb the spread of
the virus, contain financial panic, and limit the economic fallout. Some advanced economies
deployed unprecedented levels of fiscal support, nearing up to 40% of their GDPs, to protect
businesses and jobs.1 Growing evidence suggests that these outsized fiscal packages helped
keep businesses, and markets afloat in 2020. In fact, some early estimates indicate that 2020

corporate failure rates are broadly comparable, and possibly lower, than pre-COVID failure
rates.2
    Support policies on such a massive scale are necessarily loosely targeted and temporary.
As they come to an end, policymakers increasingly worry about a potential "time bomb" of
business failures, especially among small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), which may
hamper a broader economic recovery (G30 Working Group on Corporate Sector Revitalization,
2020). This time bomb could occur for three separate reasons:

    1. Support policies in 2020 were too generous or targeted the "wrong" firms, thus only
       temporarily delaying inevitable bankruptcies;

    2. Support took many forms, with most governments offering cheap government guaran-
       teed loans. The resulting increase in firms' indebtedness could push firms into insol-
       vency in 2021.

    3. Withdrawal of fiscal support in 2021, or a tightening of credit conditions, could trigger
       liquidity problems among surviving and ultimately viable, but fragile, firms.

    This paper assesses the prospects for such a 2021 SME time bomb.3 We build on Pierre-
Olivier Gourinchas, Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan, Veronika Penciakova and Nick Sander (2020) the
impact of COVID-19 on SME failures in 2020. In that paper, we construct a model-based esti-
mate of a firm's cash flow under COVID-19 by solving a short-run cost minimization problem
subject to a rich combination of sectoral and aggregate, supply and demand shocks.4 By com-
bining this estimated cash flow with firm-level data from Bureau van Dijk's Orbis, we can
infer the impact of COVID-19 on SME failures and evaluate the cost and effectiveness of var-
ious government interventions designed to support businesses throughout 2020. The current
paper extends our analysis through the end of 2021.


1     Time Bomb Analysis
Specifically, we consider a baseline scenario in which the COVID-19 crisis requires two lock-
down episodes in 2020. The first lockdown begins in week 9 of 2020 (end of February) and

    2 Real time estimates of 2020 bankruptcies are still scarce due to reporting lags in firm filings and congested
courts with regulatory freezes on proceedings (Federico Díez, Romain Duval, Jiayue Fan, Jose Garrido, Seb-
nem Kalemli-Özcan, Chiara Maggi, Soledad Martinez-Peria and Nicola Pierri (2020)). See Leland D. Crane,
Ryan A. Decker, Aaron Flaaen, Adrian Hamins-Puertolas and Christopher Kruz (2020) for recent information
for the United States.
    3 In the European Union, SMEs, consisting of firms with less than 250 employees, account for a striking 99.8%

of all employer firms, 65% of private sector employment and 54% of private sector gross output.
    4 See David Rezza Baqaee and Emmanuel Farhi (2020) who emphasize the amplification of such shocks

through Input-Output networks, and Veronica Guerrieri, Guido Lorenzoni, Ludwig Straub and Iván Werning
(2020) who show the effect of negative supply shocks on demand shortages.

lasts 8 weeks, while the second lockdown begins in week 44 (end of October), lasts 6 weeks,
and all shocks are two-thirds as intense as during the first lockdown. Throughout 2020 and
2021, aggregate demand evolves according to country-level quarterly GDP growth forecasts
from the IMF's June 2020 WEO. During each lockdown episode, the economy also experi-
ences sectoral labor supply, productivity, and demand shocks.5 Once each lockdown episode
ends, sectoral supply and productivity shocks immediately return to pre-COVID levels, while
sector-specific demand follows an AR(1) with a quarterly autocorrelation of 0.5. We assume
there are no additional lockdown episodes in 2021.
    To evaluate firm failure, we impose a liquidity criterion that is evaluated at a weekly fre-
quency. Focusing on a liquidity criterion, rather than a solvency one, is appropriate for SMEs
whose assets are difficult to value and whose means to raise fresh capital are very limited,
especially during a pandemic. According to this criterion, firms fail when they cannot cover
financial expenses out of current cash balances and (model-based) cash flow. Throughout 2020
we assume that firms can roll-over existing loans, but cannot obtain "fresh" financing to cover
cash short falls.
    We obtain data on 2018 firm revenue, labor and material costs, along with cash balances
and financial expenses from Orbis.6 Our analysis focuses on a subset of 13 countries for which
Orbis, on average, covers nearly 60% of aggregate SME revenue ­ Belgium, Czech Republic,
Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, and
Spain.7
    In the absence of government support, our baseline scenario generates a sharp increase in
the SME failure rate of 9.84 percentage points (pp) relative to a counterfactual non-COVID
year. In reality, policy support in 2020 has been quite generous in the countries we consider,
dampening the impact of COVID-19 on SME failures.
    To capture this reality, we simulate a program of public loan guarantees for SMEs broadly
similar to that implemented in many countries. Under this program, all SMEs receive a zero-
interest, five-year pandemic loan with a government guarantee, along the lines described by
the ECB (Matteo Falagiarda, Algirdas Prapiestis and Elena Rancoita, 2020). The terms are
such that firms receive the maximum of 25% of their average weekly 2018 revenues or twice
their average weekly 2018 wage bill during each week of lockdown. Should a firm find itself
unable to repay its pandemic loan, the government bears 90% of losses, with the remaining
10% accruing to the banking sector. Under this more realistic scenario, the model predicts that

    5 Sectoral  shocks are defined at the 4-digit NACE level. Sectoral labor supply shocks reflect each sector's abil-
ity to shift to remote work (Jonathan Dingle and Brent Neiman, 2020). Sectoral productivity shocks are calibrated
using data from the American Community Survey on the pre-COVID prevalence of remote work by industry
and the assumption that remote work is 20% less productive than on-site work. Sector-specific demand shocks
reflect sectoral reliance on face-to-face customer interaction (O*NET).
     6 2018 is the latest year for which firm-level data are available from Orbis. We assume that the distribution of

firm variables remains unchanged between 2018 and 2019.
     7 The coverage statistics are based on the latest (2017) available official OECD data.

  mass failure (the focus of this paper) were mitigated, firms may still face insolvency risk from debt overhang. See

            Notes: Columns 1­4 report the distribution of pandemic loans based on 2020 (rows) and 2021 (columns) classifications.
            Column 1 shows total funds disbursed in each scenario. Columns 2 to 4 show the distribution based on firms' 2021 outcomes.
            Columns 5 and 6 show the costs to the government and banks of writing off pandemic loans (net of any principal paid prior to
            failing) on firms that fail in 2021. Column 7 shows the share of all pre-pandemic SME loans that become nonperforming, and
            column 8 shows jobs lost as a share of total 2018 employment. Columns 1­6 are scaled by the ratio of country value added to
            total ORBIS value added. Similar scaling was done for column 8 based on the ratio of country employment to total ORBIS
            employment. Aggregated using      GDP weights.

  have failed in 2020 under the non-COVID scenario. This group consists of firms that may have received overly
  generous fiscal support in 2020, and firms that experienced a strong COVID year, for instance because they

mary source of external funding for SMEs ­ tighten access to credit and prevent rollover of
pre-pandemic SME maturing debts, failure rates would spike up, with an increase of 8.44pp
relative to normal times. Moreover, nearly half of the SME failures would now arise from firms
that did not need any support to survive to the end of 2020 (column 4). The analysis clearly
illustrates that the main danger for 2021 resides in impaired access to credit markets.
    Table 2, panel A, columns 1 to 4 report the distribution of pandemic loans outstanding
at the end of 2020, as a percent of 2018 GDP, across firms' 2020 (rows) and 2021 (columns)
outcomes. Columns 5 and 6 report the cost of of realized losses on pandemic loans.12 Column
7 shows the share of pre-existing SME loans that are non-performing (NPLs) due to 2021 firm
failures. Column 8 shows the share of jobs lost due to firm failures, as a percent of total 2018
employment.
    Table 2 illustrates the policy trade-offs policymakers confront in 2021. Total outstanding
pandemic loans at the end of 2020 represent 9.32 percent of GDP. Of this, we estimate that
between 6.80 percent and 7.98 percent of GDP was disbursed to firms strong enough to survive
both 2020 and 2021 on their own. This highlights the very imperfect targeting of 2020 support
policies under COVID.
    Since only 1.88% additional firms fail under our first scenario, the policy cost remains low,
at 0.26% of GDP. NPLs and job losses also increase modestly, by 3.71% of SME loans and 1.16%
of total employment respectively. This leaves little scope or need for additional policy support
in order to save SMEs in 2021.
    The second scenario considers what happens when worried credit markets do not roll over
maturing pre-pandemic debt. In that case, while policy costs increase only modestly (1 percent
of GDP), NPLs (29.97 percent of SME loans) and job losses (4.32 percent of employment) bal-
loon. These estimates confirm that financial risks in 2021 constitute a major concern for SMEs
strength, more so than the repayment of government supported loans. A serious worry is that
public loan guarantees have overburdened SMEs with debt. This might adversely affect their
solvency and future access to private credit. Increased indebtedness could also worsen debt
overhang problems, distorting capital expenditures.
    This could justify additional forms of debt relief in 2021. Such relief should be targeted to
firms that need it, primarily in the "Saved 2021" category. According to Table 2, this would
represent 1.06% of GDP under scenario (1). In addition, we estimate that this debt relief could
help save an additional 0.91% firms in 2021. To the extent that targeting is difficult to imple-
ment, debt relief could be provided against ­for instance­ a temporary higher tax on future
profits. This would help claw-back some of the relief disbursed to firms that don't need it.13



  12 90%   of the losses accrue to the government and 10% to the banks. These costs equal the amounts disbursed
in 2020 to firms that fail in 2021, less any principal repaid in 2021 prior to failure.

2   Conclusion
Our exercise reaches an important conclusion: we do not find that policies implemented in
2020, on their own, create a 2021 "time bomb" for SMEs. Even if pandemic loans come due,
business failures remain modest, and so do policy costs. By contrast, we find significant ex-
posure to the risk of a credit contraction. Such a contraction would disproportionately impact
"strong" firms (i.e. firms that otherwise would not need fiscal support to survive COVID-19 in
2020). Even in that scenario, large business failures would not arise from excessively generous
2020 policies that just delayed the inevitable. Instead, they would be a new blow, coming from
the contraction of credit to the corporate sector.
