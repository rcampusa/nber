                                          ABSTRACT

Millions of tons of hazardous wastes have been produced in the United States in the last 60 years
which have been dispersed into the air, into water, and on and under the ground. Using new
population-level data that follows cohorts of children born in the state of Florida between 1994
and 2002, this paper examines the short and long-term effects of prenatal exposure to
environmental toxicants on children living within two miles of a Superfund site, toxic waste sites
identified by the Environmental Protection Agency as being particularly severe. We compare
siblings living within two miles from a Superfund site at birth where at least one sibling was
conceived before or during cleanup of the site, and the other(s) was conceived after the site
cleanup was completed using a family fixed effects model. Children conceived to mothers living
within 2 miles of a Superfund site before it was cleaned are 7.4 percentage points more likely to
repeat a grade, have 0.06 of a standard deviation lower test scores, and are 6.6 percentage points
more likely to be suspended from school than their siblings who were conceived after the site was
cleaned. Children conceived to mothers living within one mile of a Superfund site before it was
cleaned are 10 percentage points more likely to be diagnosed with a cognitive disability than their
later born siblings as well. These results tend to be larger and are more statistically significant
than the estimated effects of proximity to a Superfund site on birth outcomes. This study suggests
that the cleanup of severe toxic waste sites has significant positive effects on a variety of long-
term cognitive and developmental outcomes for children.

I. Introduction

        There has been considerable recent research on the deleterious effects of environmental

toxicants on children. The sources of such pollution are manifold: millions of tons of hazardous

wastes have been produced in the United States since World War II and have been dispersed into

the air, into water, and on and under the ground. Much of this waste has accumulated in

hazardous waste sites, and these sites are widespread across the nation (Landrigan, Suk, and

Amler, 1999). Indeed, one in four (or 80 million) Americans live within 3 miles of a federal

Superfund 1 site (US EPA, 2012), a location with particularly high levels of environmental

toxicants, and about 11 million Americans, including 3-4 million children, live within one mile

of a Superfund site (Steinzor and Clune, 2006). Given that children born to less educated and

minority women are more likely to be exposed to environmental toxicants in utero (Anderson,

Anderton, and Oakes, 1994; Currie, 2011) because disadvantaged mothers are more likely to live

near sources of pollution, exposure to environmental toxicants is a relatively unexplored

mechanism through which poverty produces negative cognitive and health outcomes over the life

span.

        We connect population-level birth and schooling records in Florida and compare siblings

who gestated before versus after Superfund cleanup to study the effects of exposure to

environmental toxicants on cognitive outcomes. In addition to the effects of toxicant exposure on

known as Superfund, is the largest and most expensive federal program to clean up toxic waste in the United States.

                                                                                                                  2
children’s early health outcomes, which could in turn translate to poorer cognitive outcomes, 2

the prenatal environment can have lasting impacts on various biological systems in the

developing fetus (Almond and Currie, 2011; Kuzawa, 2005) and exposure to environmental

toxicants could affect fetal brain development via epigenetic or other mechanisms (Fox et al,

2012; Lanphear, 2015; Stein et al, 2003) above and beyond the mechanism operating through

early health.

        Several recent papers have addressed the relationship between exposure to environmental

toxicants and later human capital outcomes. Almond, Edlund, and Palme (2009) and Black,

Bütikofer, Devereux, and Salvanes (2013) make use of Scandinavian data and quasi-

experimental designs to study the effects of nuclear accidents or testing during gestation. Sanders

(2012) estimates the relationship between county-level measures air pollution during gestation

(making assumptions about location and timing of birth) in Texas and later test scores.

Bharadwaj, Gibson, Graff Zivin, and Neilson (2014) compare Chilean siblings' differential

exposure to air pollution during gestation during a period of rapid economic development in

Chile, making use of three air quality monitors in Santiago. Aizer, Currie, Simon, and Vivier

(2015) exploit Rhode Island’s rules regarding residential lead abatement to investigate the effects

of lead exposure on children’s test scores. All of these studies find evidence of deleterious effects

of pollution, lead exposure, or nuclear fallout on children's human capital development. That

said, we know very little to date about the effects of substantial industrial toxicants in a highly

developed setting like the United States.

2
  A growing literature has shown that children exposed in utero to pollution exhibit higher infant mortality (Currie
and Neidell, 2005), lower birth weight (Currie, Davis, Greenstone, and Walker, 2015), and a higher incidence of
congenital anomalies (Currie, Greenstone, and Moretti, 2011). Since health at birth is a strong predictor of a wide
range of long-term outcomes, including income, education, and disability (Aizer and Currie, 2014; Black, Devereux,
and Salvanes, 2007; Figlio, Guryan, Karbownik, and Roth, 2014), and early exposure to pollution affects neonatal
and early health (Almond and Currie, 2011; Carneiro and Heckman, 2003; Figlio et al., 2014), it stands to reason
that there would be a health channel connecting in utero exposure to environmental toxicants and later human capital
formation.

                                                                                                                  3
         We apply a new research design that allows us to directly compare siblings who were in

utero at different stages of Superfund site cleanup. Relying on a sibling comparison of children

whose families do not move away from close proximity to Superfund sites allows us to address

concerns about local sorting, avoidance behavior, and other difficult-to-observe and possibly

endogenous time-invariant characteristics of families that could affect child outcomes. We

explore a range of cognitive outcomes, including both high-stakes student test scores as well as

the development of cognitive disabilities and other school-based cognitive and behavioral

outcomes. In addition, this is the first study to investigate the developmental effects of living

near Superfund sites during the prenatal period on both birth and long-term outcomes. Although

Superfund sites often house numerous developmental toxicants and exist in large population

centers, little is known about the hazards to pregnant women living near these sites or the long-

term consequences for children who are born nearby. While the costs of the Superfund program

are substantial, the benefits of cleanup are poorly understood; therefore, this study will hopefully

lend insight into how environmental pollution and policies in the U.S. might affect early brain

development. This work also speaks to how residential and socioeconomic contexts can

contribute to inequality before children are born.

         Using new population-level data that follows cohorts of children born in the state of

Florida between 1994 and 2002 3, we examine the long run impacts of being conceived proximate

to a Superfund site before it is cleaned on children’s performance in school. We match all births

in Florida from 1994 through 2002 to subsequent student records for those children remaining in

the state and attending public school. We then compare siblings living within two miles from a

Superfund site at birth where at least one sibling was conceived before or during cleanup of the

 We can observe siblings for residents of counties representing a substantial majority of Florida’s population.
Additional details about the sibling match capabilities of the data are described in Figlio et al (2014).

                                                                                                                  4
site, and the other(s) was conceived after the site cleanup was completed using a family fixed

effects model. This research design allows us to estimate the effect of prenatal exposure to

pollution (and Superfund cleanup) on (1) birth outcomes, such as birth weight and APGAR

scores, (2) significant school-related behavioral problems, and (3) longer term cognitive

outcomes, including elementary school test scores, likelihood of grade repetition and diagnosis

with cognitive disabilities or autism. It also allows us to estimate some unrecognized long-term

benefits of Superfund cleanup.

       We find large and substantial evidence that exposure to Superfund sites in utero reduces

later cognitive outcomes. Children conceived to mothers living within two miles of a Superfund

site before it was cleaned are 7.4 percentage points more likely to repeat a grade and have 0.06 of

a standard deviation lower test scores than their siblings who were conceived after the site was

cleaned. Children conceived to mothers living within two miles of a Superfund site before it was

cleaned are also 6.6 percentage points more likely to have a behavioral incident in school than

their later born siblings. Children conceived to mothers living within one mile of a Superfund

site before it was cleaned are 10 percentage points more likely to be diagnosed with a cognitive

disability than their later born siblings as well. Using the same identification strategy, we find

comparable effects to birth outcomes to those observed by Currie, Greenstone, and Moretti

(2011). This pattern of results indicates that the effects of environmental toxicants on later

cognitive outcomes far outstrip those implied by looking at birth outcomes alone. In other words,

the effects of environmental toxicants on later human capital are likely much more serious than

the already reasonably large estimates implied through the early health channel.




                                                                                                     5
II. Background

        The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (P.L. 96-

510), which is now known as Superfund, is the largest and most expensive federal program to

clean up toxic waste in the United States. Since 1980, the Environmental Protection Agency

(EPA) has identified more than 15,000 such sites, which are labeled Superfund sites after they

are admitted to the National Priority List (NPL), and usually house multiple toxicants (Landrigan

et al., 1999). Once the sites are cleaned by the EPA, they are deleted from the NPL.

        There is growing evidence that environmental toxicants interact with genetic

susceptibilities to alter developmental trajectories and produce poor academic performance and

cognitive disabilities, such as learning disabilities (Cognitive disabilities), speech and language

impairments, intellectual disability, and autism (Jurewicz et al, 2013; Miodovnik, 2011).

Although cognitive disabilities may have a substantial underlying genetic component, there is

evidence that the development of cognitive disabilities is strongly influenced by the

environment. Some of the most compelling data provided by twin and family studies shows that

the relatives of probands (e.g., children of parents) with cognitive disabilities are at higher risk

for developing cognitive disabilities themselves (Miller and McCardle, 2011). However, overall

genetic factors seem to account for no more than perhaps 30–40 percent of all cases of

neurodevelopmental disorders (Grandjean and Landrigan, 2014; Hallmayer et al., 2011), which

indicates that environmental influences are heavily involved in the development of cognitive

disabilities. Nevertheless, one issue with these sorts of genetic susceptibility studies is that it can

be particularly difficult to control for shared environmental factors that may cause cognitive

disabilities (e.g., parental influence, shared exposures to the same chemicals, etc.). Thus, most

estimates from such studies (e.g. 40 percent) represent a higher bound of estimation, indicating

that environmental factors are mainly involved in causing cognitive disabilities.
                                                                                                       6
       Furthermore, a growing body of recent research points to the ways that genes are

especially susceptible to environmental context, since genes are always stored, transcribed and

translated within an environment that may influence these processes. Early-life epigenetic

changes are also known to affect subsequent gene expression in the brain (Green, 2015;

Kundakovic. 2011; Roth, 2012). Thus, a growing body of evidence points towards non-genetic,

environmental exposures that are involved in causation of cognitive disabilities, in some cases by

interacting with genetically inherited risk factors and epigenetic mechanisms. Thus, many

researchers are beginning to ask: what sorts of toxic exposures might produce low academic

achievement and cognitive disabilities and how are children exposed?

       One plausible answer is that children might be exposed to hazardous waste through living

in locations near hazardous waste sites, like Superfund sites. A recent study by Currie (2011)

utilizing a difference-in-differences analysis on data from five states shows that women living

within 2000 meters of a Superfund or Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) site were more likely to be

low income and African American or Hispanic than women living farther away in the same zip

code (before the site was cleaned up compared to after). This finding indicates that children born

to less educated and minority women are more likely to be exposed to pollution in utero (Currie,

2011). Furthermore, using a difference-in-differences analysis, Currie, Greenstone and Moretti

(2011) find that mothers living within 2000 meters of a Superfund site before it is cleaned up are

20 to 25 percent more likely to give birth to babies with congenital anomalies than mothers

living from 2000-5000 meters from the site (than after a site is cleaned). Congenital anomalies

have been tied to autism (Hultman, Sparén, and Cnattingius, 2002; Larsson et al., 2005), mental

retardation (C. A. Nelson, 2000) and other Cognitive disabilities such as dyslexia (Galaburda,

LoTurco, Ramus, Fitch, and Rosen, 2006).



                                                                                                  7
       Moreover, several classes of compounds can readily cross the placenta to enter fetal

circulation, including compounds with low molecular weight, those that are fat-soluble, and

other specific compounds such as calcium and lead (Bearer, 1995). In one study of ten randomly

chosen babies from among 2004's summer season of live births from mothers in Red Cross's

volunteer, national cord blood collection program, researchers in two labs detected a total of 287

foreign chemicals in umbilical cord blood from the group (Grandjean and Landrigan, 2014;

Houlihan, Kropp, Wiles, Gray, and Campbell, 2005). Of the 287 chemicals detected in umbilical

cord blood, 180 have been reported to cause cancer in humans or animals, 217 are toxic to the

brain and nervous system, and 208 cause birth defects or abnormal development in animal tests.

The chemicals found in the umbilical cord blood include pesticides, consumer product

ingredients such as Bisphenol A, and wastes from burning coal, gasoline, and garbage, including

dozens of widely used brominated flame retardants and their toxic by-products (Houlihan et al.,

2005). However, this study only includes a sample size of ten babies (albeit randomly selected).

Thus, it may be the case that many of these ten babies could have been on the high end of the

distribution of toxic exposures. A larger sample size would give a better approximation of the

distribution of toxicants in umbilical cord blood. In addition, the study says nothing about the

levels of these toxicants, or the total number of toxicants per baby. Nevertheless, it does indicate

the need for more research in this area to see what sorts of chemicals might regularly cross the

placental barrier, and whether children are negatively affected by these combinations of

exposures before they are even born.

       Furthermore, some toxicants may be transferred to the infant through human breastmilk

after birth (Needham et al., 2010). Studies of breast milk have shown the presence of chlorinated

organic contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins (Moya, Bearer, and Etzel,



                                                                                                   8
2004), which are known to cause brain damage (Grandjean and Landrigan, 2006). Breast milk

contains fat in which these chemicals tend to accumulate (Moya, Bearer and Etzel, 2004). In

addition, the blood–brain barrier (BBB) provides only partial protection against the entry of

chemicals into the central nervous system (CNS) during the prenatal through early postnatal

period (Zheng, Aschner, and Ghersi-Egea, 2003). A functionally “leaky” structure of the BBB

and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier accommodates the high demand of blood-borne nutrients

for brain growth (Zheng et al, 2003). This permeability can leave the developing brains of

children highly vulnerable to toxicants.

       Thus, there is increasing evidence that the developing human brain is highly vulnerable to

toxic chemical exposures, particularly during the prenatal, perinatal and early postnatal periods,

as well as in early childhood (Bearer, 1995; Rice and Barone Jr, 2000). During these sensitive

periods, chemicals can cause permanent brain injury at low levels of exposure that would have

little or no harmful effects in an adult (Grandjean and Landrigan, 2014; Bearer, 1995). In a

recent study, Aizer and colleagues (2015) found that a 5 micrograms per deciliter increase in

children’s preschool lead levels reduces elementary school test scores by 43 percent of a standard

deviation. Lead reduction policies explained roughly half of the decline in the Black-White test

score gap in these cohorts.

       There is also reason to believe that the effects of toxicants may differ for children relative

to adults. First, of course, children are much smaller than adults, so the level of exposure that is

toxic to them is lower than it would be for an adult. Second, unlike adults, children’s organs are

undergoing growth and maturation, processes that may be adversely affected by exposure to

harmful chemicals (Bearer, 1995). Third, cells in children are undergoing differentiation and

migration. Importantly, neurons originate in a structure near the center of the brain (the neural



                                                                                                       9
tube) and migrate out to a predestined location (C. Nelson, Shonkoff, and Phillis, 2000). Thus,

for example, prenatal exposure to ethanol via the mother may result in interruption in neural

migration severe enough to cause obvious malformations of the brain leading to mental

retardation (Bearer, 1995; C. A. Nelson, 2000). Furthermore, some in-vitro studies suggest that

neural stem cells are especially sensitive to neurotoxic substances such as methylmercury, which

can reduce neuronal stem cell proliferation and alter the expression of cell cycle regulators and

senescence-associated markers (Bose, Onishchenko, Edoff, Lang, and Ceccatelli, 2012).

Moreover, some research suggests that organophosphate pesticides may inhibit cholinesterase

function in the developing brain (Costa, 2006), which can affect the crucial regulatory role of

acetylcholine as a modulator of gene expression and neuron differentiation before synapse

formation (Augusti-Tocco, Biagioni, and Tata, 2006; Grandjean and Landrigan, 2014). Thus,

there is some evidence that exposure to neurotoxins early in life may affect cellular growth,

maturation, differentiation, and migration pathways, as well as gene expression and synapse

formation, in the developing brain. However, much more research on how specific chemicals and

combinations of chemicals cause different adverse outcomes in the human brain is needed, since

much of this research is done in animals and in vitro cell cultures.

       Although Superfund sites are often contaminated by numerous developmental

neurotoxicants, we know little about the long-term consequences to children living nearby. Some

evidence indicates that early exposure to pollution is associated with lowered test scores

(Bharadwaj et al., 2014; Sanders, 2012) and that low income and minority children are more

likely to live near Superfund sites (Currie, 2011). If this is the case, differential exposure to

pollution due to residential segregation might partially account for some of the achievement gaps

between minority and White children, and between wealthier and poor children. It might also



                                                                                                    10
partially explain why Black children are more likely to be diagnosed with Cognitive disabilities.

Finally, little is known about the potential positive health effects of cleaning up Superfund sites.


III. Identification Strategy

         We evaluate the effects of prenatal exposure to environmental toxicants on children by

comparing siblings who were conceived at different times while living within two miles of a

current or former Superfund site. Since residential sorting can lead to non-random exposure to

pollution, we employ a family fixed effects model to make within family comparisons among

siblings living in the same location who do not move between births. 4 We independently

estimate the effects of being conceived before, during, or after Superfund cleanup by

constructing dummy variables for each category5. The comparison group (omitted category) in

the regressions is for children who are conceived after cleanup. This enables us to examine the

relative effects of exposure to environmental toxicants on siblings conceived before cleanup and

during cleanup, compared to siblings conceived after cleanup. We use the timing of conception

rather than the birth date because previous research has indicated that birth outcomes (such as

premature birth) are endogenously related to pollution exposure (Currie, Davis, Greenstone and

Walker, 2015).

         Our identifying assumption is that the only thing that changed between conceptions of

siblings was that the local Superfund site was cleaned. Because the timing of Superfund cleanup

is plausibly unrelated to the timing of conception, comparing siblings who do not move should

yield an unbiased estimate of the effect of Superfund cleanup. There are numerous potential


4
  Note that we only observe zip code of residence at the time of birth, and not precise street address. As a
consequence, we consider “non-movers” to be people who remained in the same zip code of residence across the
births of their children.
5
  We estimated the timing of conception by subtracting the weeks of gestation from the birth date. We then
constructed three dummy variables for being conceived before cleanup, being conceived during cleanup, or being
conceived after cleanup based on the timeline of cleanup of the closest Superfund site to the child’s home zip code.

                                                                                                                  11
threats to internal validity, and later in the paper we describe a variety of the tests and

specification checks that we undertake in order to determine the degree to which our results are

internally valid.

        Figure 1 presents a schematic of the timetable of cleanup of the Florida Superfund sites

that we study in this analysis. 6 Any Superfund site that either began or completed cleanup

between early 1993 (when the oldest children in the data were conceived) and 2002 (when the

youngest children in the data were born) provides variation that can be used in this analysis.

Table 1 presents information on the number of families who have observed pairs of siblings with

gestations that bookend changes in Superfund status. As can be seen, it is extremely rare to

observe families where one sibling was conceived before a Superfund site began cleanup and

another was conceived after the site was completely cleaned; this is largely due to the fact that

(as is evident from Figure 1) the time it takes to complete cleanup is generally much longer than

the time range in which families have children. As such, there are only 59 families living within

one mile of a Superfund site whose pregnancies completely bookend a Superfund site cleanup,

and 669 families within two miles and 1,353 families within five miles. On the other hand, many

more families have one child gestating before cleanup and another gestating during cleanup, or

one child gestating during cleanup and another child gestating after cleanup: All told, 1,026

families living within one mile of a Superfund site have sibling pairs who span Superfund site

cleanup transitions; the comparable statistics are 4,485 families within two miles and 13,039

families within five miles. In all of our analyses, we use bias-reduced linearization and adjust our

standard errors for clustering at the Superfund site level; results are modestly more statistically




6
 Our data-sharing agreement with the Florida Departments of Education and Health prohibits the identification of
any geographic units, so we cannot reveal the identities of the Superfund sites in our analysis.

                                                                                                               12
significant if we only adjust for clustering, so we report the most conservative standard errors in

the results that follow.

        Our basic family fixed effects estimation is given by:

(1)                        𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽1 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜃𝜃𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

where Yijt is some outcome of a child i born to family j at time t. In our analyses, we concentrate

on families residing within two miles of a Superfund site, though we also present results for

other distances. We determine whether Superfund site cleanup affects (1) birth outcomes, (i.e.,

APGAR scores at 1 and 5 minutes 7, and the likelihood of congenital anomalies, abnormal birth

conditions and low birth weight 8) (2) significant school-related behavioral problems, and (3)

longer term cognitive outcomes, including elementary school test (Florida Comprehensive

Assessment Test) scores, likelihood of grade repetition and diagnosis with a cognitive disability

or autism. 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a dummy variable for whether a child was conceived before a Superfund

site was cleaned. Similarly, 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a dummy variable for whether a child was conceived

during cleanup of the site. The omitted category is a dummy variable for being conceived after

cleanup of a site was completed. 𝜃𝜃𝑗𝑗 is a family fixed effect that is specific to the mother, and Xit

is a vector of child-specific control variables (i.e., gender, birth year, birth month and birth

order). 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an error term. Our results are invariant to whether or not we control for time-

varying maternal characteristics like age and education.

        Our estimates of β1 and β2 would be biased if there were unobserved determinants of

cognitive ability associated with living within two miles of a Superfund site before or during

cleanup. However, our family fixed effects model helps to account for many unobserved

physiologic functioning at birth.

  These were estimated with binary dependent variables that express the likelihood of abnormal conditions,

                                                                                                                     13
determinants of both birth and schooling outcomes and exposure to pollution, such as the home

environment, shared genetics, and shared parents. Nevertheless, the family fixed effects models

cannot account for changing family or neighborhood characteristics that could affect child

outcomes. We address these issues directly in section IV.A below.

        These results could also be biased if environmental toxicants affect children who are

conceived after cleanup. Some research suggests that once exposed, environmental toxicants

remain in a person’s body for a long time, contributing to chemical body burden (CDC, 2009;

Thornton, McCally, and Houlihan, 2002). If environmental toxicants from local Superfund sites

stay in a mother’s body for a long time, they could affect siblings who are conceived even after a

Superfund site has been cleaned. This possibility might downwardly bias the estimates of the

benefits of Superfund cleanup since siblings conceived after cleanup might still be affected by

the pollution. Our results might also be downwardly biased if there exists measurement error in

the recorded timing of cleanup: We use the time when the EPA first finished construction on the

site cleanup, but the site had not yet been deleted from the NPL, so some children whom we treat

as exposed to the Superfund site might not have been meaningfully exposed. On the other hand,

it is also possible that later born children could still have been exposed to some pollution from

the site if the first cleanup attempt was not successful 9. Families can also engage in avoidance

behaviors in order to reduce exposure to pollution, by, for example, selectively moving outdoor

activities to cleaner locations, which would also downwardly bias our estimates.

        One additional potential threat to internal validity is that we can only make use of test

score and other school related data for siblings if all siblings have test scores and other school

data. If one sibling is present in the test score data but not the others, and the reasons for


9
  The EPA typically waits several years and regularly monitors and reviews sites that have been cleaned to ensure
that there are no leaks and the contamination has been removed before deleting sites from the NPL.

                                                                                                                    14
differential inclusion in the data are correlated with exposure to pollution from Superfund sites,

the absence of one sibling’s test score could present a source of bias. However, this is somewhat

mitigated by the fact that there is not a statistically significant or economically meaningful

difference in the likelihood of siblings taking the FCAT, as we discuss below.

        A related concern is that we only observe education records for individuals born in

Florida who remained in Florida, and attended Florida public schools. Various tests reported in

detail in Figlio et al. (2014) suggest that in practice the selection bias resulting from either of

these sources is likely to be minimal. This reduced threat is reinforced by focusing only on

siblings whose families do not move between births. If we included families that moved, one

might worry that moving could be a response to Superfund cleanup or other factors that could

correlate with better child outcomes, such as parents getting better jobs. This response could

upwardly bias estimates of Superfund cleanup. By limiting our sample to families who stay in

the same neighborhood between births, we can compare siblings in a context where the only

thing that changed (on average) between conceptions of siblings was the local Superfund site

being cleaned.

        A final potential limitation of our study design – albeit not a threat to internal validity --

is that we do not know the mechanisms of exposure at each site. We do know that Superfund

sites in Florida contaminated the air, water and soil at the site, and that people often live very

close to such sites where there is uncontrolled contamination. In addition, the same

environmental toxicants found in Superfund sites can contaminate the air, water, or soil of a

place, depending on a large variety of factors. The EPA documented in each case that there was

an uncontrolled level of human exposure when they assessed the site for admission to the NPL

before it was cleaned. Finally, there is a growing literature that documents the ways in which



                                                                                                      15
people living near Superfund sites and other sources of contamination are exposed and

affected 10. More research on the subject is needed in order to understand the degree to which

uncontrolled hazardous waste sites are a problem for children in the United States.


IV. Data Description

A. Description of the Datasets

        The sample in this study includes every child born in the state of Florida between 1994

and 2002, and educated in Florida public schools from 1996 through 2012. Our data follows

these cohorts of children by linking birth certificate data and school records. Overall, 81 percent

of all births in Florida were matched to school records – virtually identical to the rate expected

using American Community Survey data; see Figlio et al. (2014) for details on the validity of the

match. For the purposes of this study, Florida’s education and health agencies matched children

along three dimensions: first and last names, exact date of birth, and Social Security Number,

with a small degree of fuzziness permitted in the match. Common variables excluded from the

match were used as checks of match quality. These checks confirm that the matches are very

clean: in the overall population, the sex recorded on birth records disagreed with the sex recorded

in school records in about one one-thousandth of 1 percent of cases, suggesting that these

differences are due to typos in the birth or school records.

        Because we do not have access to home addresses of the families in our data due to

privacy constraints, the distance to the nearest Superfund site was calculated via the family’s zip

code of residence (from the birth certificate). Having this data reduces bias due to Superfund-

related mobility because we know where the child was living when he or she was born, as well

as where the child went to school. First, populated-weighted zip code centroids were calculated

10
  See, for example, the Harvard School of Public Health’s Superfund Research Program publications:
http://srphsph.harvard.edu/publications/

                                                                                                     16
for each zip code in our data as latitude and longitude coordinates. We then found the bird’s eye

distance (in miles) between the latitude and longitude coordinates of each population-weighted

zip code centroid and each Superfund site. Next, we calculated the shortest distance between

each zip code of residence and each Superfund site.

       About one quarter of all children born in Florida move out of state, leaving about 1.6

million children who remain in the state of Florida and attend public schools. We can identify

siblings in 70 percent of Florida children. Of these children, about 40,519 children were born to

families living within one mile of a Superfund site, and 163,453 children were born to families

living within two miles of a Superfund site. As observed in Table 1, 4,485 families living within

two miles of a Superfund site and not moving have children conceived in different Superfund

cleanup regimes; the comparable figure is 1,026 families within one mile and 13,039 families

within five miles.

       We gathered data on the timing of Superfund cleanup and the locations of Superfund sites

from the EPA. Superfund sites are located in most major cities in Florida, including often the

most population-dense areas of these cities. As seen in Figure 2, which presents the cumulative

density of the distance to a Superfund site, 9.7 percent of children in Florida live within two

miles of a Superfund site and 33 percent of children live within five miles. More than half (57.3

percent) of children in Florida live within ten miles of a site. For families with multiple children

observed in the Florida linked data, the figures are moderately higher – 12.4 percent of siblings

in our data live within two miles of a Superfund site; this is because the sibling linkage takes

place in a set of relatively urban counties, rather than because families who live closer to

Superfund sites have higher degrees of fertility. Therefore, it is clear that a considerable number

of children might be affected by the toxic waste associated with a Superfund site.



                                                                                                   17
B. Comparisons of the Children living around Superfund Sites to the Overall Population

          Table 2 shows the attributes of the population of non-moving children living within two

miles of a Superfund site along a number of dimensions: maternal race and ethnicity, maternal

education, age, and marital status at the time of the child’s birth, maternal immigrant status, child

birth outcome averages, and child schooling outcome averages. We also measure a indicator of

permanent family income based on the frequency with which we observe a child receiving free

or reduced-price lunch in school, and categorize families as always low income, sometimes low

income, and never low income. We concentrate on the population of children for whom we

observe siblings, as this is the set of children we analyze in our study.

          As can be seen in the table, there is a considerable difference in family advantage

between non-moving families living within two miles of a Superfund site and the full set of

Florida families. Children born within two miles of a Superfund site are almost twice as likely to

be always low income in their schooling history (47.4 percent) than average for Florida (24.3

percent). Their mothers are more likely to have low education and less likely to be married at the

time of birth. In addition, mothers of children born within two miles of a Superfund site are more

likely to be foreign-born and Hispanic than the average for Florida. Mothers living near

Superfund sites are also twice as likely (45.8 percent) to be Black compared with the average for

Florida (22.4 percent). Children born within two miles of a Superfund site have lower test scores

on average and are more likely to repeat a grade by fifth grade or have a behavioral incident in

school.

          Families who consistently live within two miles of a Superfund site are, along numerous

dimensions, even more disadvantaged than all families who live within two miles of a Superfund

site at the time of any of their children’s births. These families are more likely to be low income

and have low education. In addition, they are significantly more likely to be Black than all
                                                                                                   18
children born near a Superfund site. However, families with siblings who move away from

Superfund sites are quite similar along a number of dimensions to those who stay 11.

        These descriptive statistics make clear that children who live proximate to toxic waste

sites tend to be substantially more disadvantaged than the general population of children. These

statistics highlight the value of conducting sibling comparisons, since proximity to a Superfund

site is so tied to disadvantage. They also suggest that our results are likely to be particularly

relevant for the population of relatively disadvantaged children – the types of families who are

most likely to live near Superfund sites.


V. Main Results on Birth and Schooling Outcomes

A. Birth Outcomes

        We now turn to the main regression results for the OLS family fixed effects regressions,

which control for gender, birth year, birth month, and birth order. Table 3 shows the birth

outcomes using different specifications in each panel, and different outcomes in each column.

We consider a set of birth outcomes -- APGAR scores, measured on a ten-point scale, at one and

five minutes; and the likelihood of abnormal conditions, congenital anomalies, or low birth

weight. We limit our analysis to the families who do not move between births. Panel A compares

siblings who consistently live within two miles of a Superfund site, and panel B compares those

who consistently live within one mile of a Superfund site. We adjust all standard errors for

clustering at the Superfund site level, and since the number of Superfund sites in our analysis is

modest – 37 – we calculate standard errors using bias-reduced linearization. Here and elsewhere

in the paper, we opt for the bias-reduced linearization approach because the reported standard



11
  See the third and fourth columns of Table 2. On some metrics, families who move away are more disadvantaged
than those who stay (e.g. the mother being married at the time of birth, never having low income, etc.)

                                                                                                            19
errors are particularly conservative; were we to report Superfund site-clustered standard errors,

the standard errors would be somewhat smaller.

       We find mixed evidence on birth outcomes: We find evidence that children living very

close (within one mile) to a Superfund site are more likely to have low birthweight and to have

lower APGAR scores before cleanup than after cleanup. Slightly farther away, however, the

results regarding birth outcomes disappear or even change signs. While our results differ

somewhat from Currie, Greenstone, and Moretti’s (2011) findings using a difference-in-

difference strategy surrounding Superfund cleanups – notably, we do not find much evidence of

changes in congenital anomalies following cleanup, while they did – the fact that we find

evidence that birth outcomes appear to improve following cleanup for children living very close

but not for those slightly farther away is consistent with the general theme of Currie,

Greenshone, and Moretti’s findings on birth outcomes. The fact that the general thrust of our

birth outcome findings using a sibling fixed effect design is roughly consistent with Currie,

Greenstone, and Moretti’s general finding using a difference-in-difference design makes us

reasonably confident that there exist modest neonatal health benefits associated with Superfund

cleanup for those living very nearby a Superfund site.

B. Cognitive Outcomes

       The point of this paper, however, is to focus on longer-term cognitive outcomes, which

we present in Table 4. As with the birth outcomes, we control for gender, birth year, birth month,

and birth order in our family fixed effects models. We consider several outcomes – pooled

standardized reading and math test scores, as well as the likelihood of repeating a grade, having a

behavioral incident in school, having a cognitive disability or being a child with autism. As with




                                                                                                    20
the birth outcomes, we present results for those families consistently living within two miles of a

Superfund site and for those families consistently living within one mile of a Superfund site.

         As can be seen in Table 4, we find substantial evidence to suggest that Superfund site

cleanup improves children’s longer-term cognitive outcomes. Children conceived to mothers

living within two miles of a Superfund site before it was cleaned are 7.4 percentage points more

likely to repeat a grade by fifth grade than their siblings who were conceived after cleanup.

Compared against the fact that, on average, 18.5 percent of children who were conceived after

cleanup repeat a grade, a 7.4 percentage point increase in grade repetition represents a 40 percent

increase in the likelihood that a child will repeat a grade. Children conceived before cleanup are

also 6.6 percentage points more likely to have a behavioral incident at school than their later

born siblings. On average, 14.3 percent of children conceived after a neighborhood was cleaned

have a behavioral incident. Thus, this represents a 46 percent increase in the chance that a child

will have a behavioral incident in school, compared to the average for children born in cleaned

neighborhoods. In most cases, behavioral incidents result in suspension from school, so these

children are also more likely to be suspended. In addition, children conceived to mothers living

within two miles of a Superfund site before or during cleanup have 0.062 of a standard deviation

lower test (FCAT) scores on average than their siblings who were conceived after the site was

cleaned. Given that the Black-White test score gap is about half of a standard deviation

(Clotfelter, Ladd, and Vigdor, 2009), this represents between a tenth and a fifth of the Black-

White test score gap 12. These results are statistically significant at the p<0.01 level 13.

         The school-based results for being conceived during cleanup, relative to after cleanup, are

similar, but smaller in magnitude. The results are stronger for siblings who were conceived

12
   Representing these results as a share of the Black-White test score gap is just for the sake of comparison. It is
unclear whether cleaning all Superfund sites would lower the Black-White test score gap by this amount.
13
   These results are the same when also controlling for maternal age, marital status and education level.

                                                                                                                       21
before cleanup than for siblings conceived during cleanup. If Superfund cleanup is effective, one

would expect the results for being conceived during cleanup to be downwardly biased, since

children conceived on the tail end of cleanup would have very little pollution exposure. This

suggests that Superfund cleanup is effective at limiting children’s exposure to environmental

toxicants.

       The effects of exposure to environmental toxicants might be more pronounced when

children are gestating very close to a Superfund site; indeed, Currie, Davis, Greenstone, and

Walker (2015) find that toxic air emissions affect air quality only within one mile of a plant.

Therefore, children living within one mile of a Superfund site might be more likely to be

exposed to pollution from Superfund sites than children living farther away. Only a relatively

small number of families consistently live within one mile of a Superfund site that provides

variation, but nonetheless there is good reason to further tighten the radius surrounding the

Superfund sites to gauge the effects of cleanup, even if doing so comes at the expense of

statistical power.

       Indeed, we find that, in general, the results are even stronger at for children conceived

before cleanup who were born within one mile of a Superfund site. As shown in Panel B of

Table 4, children conceived before or during cleanup within one mile of a Superfund site are 6.5

percentage points more likely to be diagnosed with a cognitive disability than their siblings who

were conceived after the site was cleaned. Children conceived before cleanup were 10

percentage points more likely to be diagnosed with a cognitive disability than their siblings

conceived after the site was cleaned. In addition, there is a small suggestive increase in the

likelihood of being diagnosed with autism within one mile of a Superfund site for the siblings




                                                                                                   22
who were conceived before or during cleanup, relative to their siblings conceived after cleanup 14.

The estimates of the likelihood of repeating a grade, having lower test scores, or having a

behavioral incident are also somewhat stronger than the estimates for the two mile radius.

However, an important caveat is that the likelihood of having a behavioral incident and autism

results are sensitive to the type of specification and distance used to estimate them.

         We also investigated which kinds of disabilities were affected by being conceived within

one mile of a local Superfund site in Table 5 15. We observe evidence suggesting that being

within one mile of a Superfund site before a site is cleaned increases the likelihood of specific

learning disabilities, speech and language impairments, intellectual disability and autism.

However, Superfund sites apparently did not affect the likelihood of most physical disabilities

that we observed, with the exception of being visually impaired 16. Children conceived before

cleanup within one mile of a Superfund site were also 0.3 percentage points more likely to be

visually impaired than siblings conceived after cleanup.

         Figure 3 presents results disaggregated by distance from the Superfund site, in which we

interact an indicator for conception before/during cleanup with distance bins (e.g. conceived

before/during cleanup x <1 mile, conceived before/during cleanup x 1-2 miles, etc.). While we

do not have large numbers of families in each of these distance bins, and perhaps as a result the

results are not monotonic, the general pattern of results is clear: In general, the farther away from

a Superfund site that a pregnant mother lives, the smaller the relative long-term cognitive


14
   This finding was highly sensitive to the type of specification used to estimate the results, likely because there are
so few cases of autism in the general population (<0.5 percent).
15
   We concentrate on the one mile definition for specific disabilities because we had found that the one mile radius
appears to be particularly important for predicting the likelihood of disabilities.
16
   It makes sense that proximity to pollution would not affect conditions such as the likelihood of emotional
disabilities or traumatic brain injury, and this is exactly what we find. There are null results for physical disabilities
one would not expect to be affected by pollution. It could be that the increased likelihood of (severe) visual
impairment is related to the increased likelihood of congenital anomalies around Superfund sites since individuals
are often born with such impairments.

                                                                                                                        23
outcomes are for siblings born to those mothers become smaller in magnitude and lose statistical

significance. Interestingly, the likelihood of repeating a grade even reverses with distance away

from the pollution.

       As large as our estimated effects of Superfund exposure are, there is reason to believe

that these results are underestimates of the effects of exposure to the environmental toxicants

found in Superfund sites. A large body of research has shown that once a person is exposed to

pollution, toxicants often stay in his or her body for long periods, contributing to chemical body

burden (CDC, 2009; Thornton, McCally, and Houlihan, 2002). In addition, most participants in

studies measuring the amounts of these chemicals in blood, tissue and urine test positive for

multiple chemicals. Thus, if a mother is exposed to pollution during her first pregnancy, she may

still have a strong chemical body burden during her next pregnancies. If this is the case, then the

comparison sibling conceived after Superfund cleanup would still have been affected by the

mother’s previous exposure to environmental toxicants, and we would have only identified the

effects of levels of toxic exposure, rather than the presence versus absence of toxic exposure. As

such, the true effects of toxicant exposure is likely even larger than that which we report.

       While the comparison of siblings in non-moving families is our preferred model

specification, we have also estimated the effects of Superfund exposure using several alternative

approaches. One approach, reported in Panel A of Appendix Table A1, pools both non-movers

and those families who move between births. While we prefer to identify the effects of

Superfund site exposure based on families who do not change location, given that active moving

may be endogenous, we carry out these exercises so that we can vary the birth order of the more-

versus-less-exposed siblings in ways that would be impossible with the non-movers analysis,




                                                                                                  24
where the less-exposed sibling is always younger. 17 In the set of moving families, one child was

born within two miles of a Superfund site that had not yet begun cleanup or that was in the

process of cleanup, and another child was born at least five miles away from any Superfund site.

This specification therefore makes use of two different ways in which siblings could differ in

their in-utero exposure 18. Panel B of Table A1 also shows the results just for siblings whose

families move into or out of neighborhoods with a nearby Superfund site. In this specification we

compare children who were conceived within 2 miles of a site before or during cleanup to their

sibling who was conceived more than 5 miles away from a Superfund site. These results again

indicate that those exposed to environmental toxicants associated with Superfund sites have

worse cognitive outcomes, along a number of dimensions, than do those less exposed to

Superfund toxicants, either because they were born more than five miles away from a Superfund

site or because the Superfund site was cleaned up. 19 Another alternative approach, reported in

Appendix Table A2, involves a difference-in-difference strategy, in which we compare those

conceived before or during cleanup versus after cleanup for families living within two miles of a

Superfund site to the same contrast for families living eight to ten miles away from a Superfund

site. Again, the pattern of results suggests that Superfund cleanup has positive effects on

children’s cognitive outcomes.




17
   We have also carried out birth order comparisons in cases in which both siblings were born before Superfund site
cleanup and where both siblings were conceived after Superfund site cleanup. In both cases, we consistently find the
typical birth order relationships seen in the literature. And, of course, the post-cleanup siblings are necessarily
younger – and typically would have worse outcomes based on birth order– than did their older, toxicant-exposed
siblings, but we find the opposite pattern of results. For these reasons and others, we are convinced that our findings
are not driven by birth order differences in outcomes.
18
   Of course, it is possible that the child born far away from a Superfund site still gestated nearby a Superfund site.
This is one reason that we prefer the models in which we compare non-movers and identify solely off of Superfund
cleanup timing.
19
   We also estimated a model including both family fixed effects and Superfund site fixed effects, allowing us to
identify off of movers across proximity to different Superfund sites. The results are comparable, but somewhat
stronger when we include both sets of fixed effects.

                                                                                                                    25
         In addition, some of the school-based results might be driven by the fact that the older

sibling (who is more likely to have been conceived before Superfund cleanup) might have had

more time in school to accumulate grade repetitions, FCAT scores and behavioral incidents than

her younger siblings who were not exposed to the pollution. Thus, the first two columns of

Appendix Table A3 show the likelihood of repeating a grade or having a behavioral incident in

school by third grade for children who were conceived before or during cleanup (relative to their

siblings conceived after cleanup), conditional on all siblings attending third grade. Column three

also shows the difference in third grade FCAT scores for siblings conceived before cleanup or

during cleanup, compared to siblings conceived after cleanup. The results in Appendix Table A3

are roughly similar in magnitude to those in our main specification, indicating that age is not

driving the results. Column 4 also indicates that siblings conceived before or during cleanup are

also not more or less likely to take the FCAT in third grade, conditional on being observed in

third grade, than their siblings conceived after cleanup 20.

         We have also conducted exercises in which we drop one Superfund site at a time to see

whether any given site is driving our results; as seen in Appendix Figure A1, in which we present

confidence intervals in which we drop each site in turn from the analysis, there is no evidence

that our results are being substantially driven by any single Superfund site.

C. Heterogeneity of Estimated Effects

         Having population-level data for a state as large and diverse as Florida allows us to

investigate heterogeneity in the effects of pollution exposure in ways that have not been possible

in other related work prior to this point. Table 6 presents results broken down by student gender,


20
  In less than one percent of cases, Florida permits severely disabled children to take the Florida Alternative
Assessment (FAA) rather than the FCAT (Florida Alternate Assessment Technical Report, 2009-2010).
Unfortunately, we do not have data from the FAA. Taking the FCAT at all signals that a child is socially and
intellectually competent enough to sit for a normal standardized test and is evidence of mainstreaming.

                                                                                                                  26
race/ethnicity, and our proxy for family income. For the purposes of space parsimony, we

concentrate on the two mile radius definition of Superfund exposure, though patterns are similar

for the one mile radius definition as well. All specifications maintain the family fixed effects

model, and look only at non-movers. The results for repeating a grade or having a behavioral

incident at school are slightly stronger for boys than girls, while the test score results are similar

for boys and girls. The results are also similar across different racial and ethnic groups.

        However, the results differ by income groups, and tend to be stronger for children of low

income families. Children who always received free and reduced price lunch during their years

in public school have the strongest results, followed by children who are sometimes listed as low

income. Children who have never received free and reduced price lunch have the weakest results.

It may be the case that higher income families practice more avoidance behaviors to reduce

children’s exposure to pollution, creating less of a disparity between siblings; that said, while not

statistically distinct from zero, we find the largest point estimates for cognitive disabilities for the

most affluent families.

D. Additional Threats to Internal Validity

        One alternative explanation for our findings is that family income or a mother’s

education may have increased between siblings so that children born after Superfund cleanup

experienced mothers with higher education than siblings born before cleanup. While we do not

have data on all factors that may have changed within families, we are able to compare years of

maternal education, reported at birth, between siblings who were conceived before or during

cleanup, relative to siblings who were conceived after cleanup. We also compare whether there

was any difference in free and reduced price lunch status in school between siblings who were




                                                                                                     27
conceived before or during cleanup, compared to after 21. The results, presented in the first two

columns of Table 7, are small and not statistically significant at the p<0.1 level. On average,

mothers living within two miles of a Superfund sites did not significantly increase their

education between children, and our family income measure did not differ significantly between

siblings 22.

         However, the estimates in Columns 3 through 6 of Table 7 show that there were some

small differences between siblings in preschool attendance, marital status and prenatal care. We

will address these in turn. Another alternative explanation for why siblings in the same family

may have differed is if one sibling attended preschool, but the other(s) did not. In order to

investigate this possibility, we compare whether there was any difference in preschool

attendance between siblings who were conceived before or during cleanup, compared to siblings

conceived after cleanup. The results in column 3 of Table 7 show that siblings conceived before

or during cleanup are, on average, 4 percentage points more likely to attend preschool than their

siblings conceived after cleanup was completed 23. These results further suggest that our

estimates of the impact of pollution from Superfund sites are not driven by differential preschool

attendance between siblings, since the children who were fully exposed to the pollution were

more likely to attend preschool than their later-born siblings who were conceived after cleanup.




21
   Free and reduced price lunch status is our only direct measure of family income.
22
   We have also investigated other specifications that test for potentially omitted variables related to the time
between births and birth order. For instance, we have limited the analysis to those Superfund sites cleaned within
five years; and we have restricted our analysis to families where we observe the first two children only. The results
are fundamentally the same as those presented herein. These results are available on request.
23
   This estimate is consistent with Gerner and Lillard (2006), who find that second born children are approximately
three percentage points less likely to attend preschool than first born children. Gerner and Lillard (2006) find that
children born later in the birth order were even less likely to attend preschool, relative to first born siblings, because
parents invest more in earlier born children, with smaller investments in later children. However, it is also possible
that siblings conceived before or during cleanup were more likely to attend preschool because parents were
compensating for their poor health or performance. If preschool attendance increased school performance for these
children, this would downwardly bias our results.

                                                                                                                        28
         In addition, one might worry that mothers were less likely to be married for older

siblings, which might hurt their school performance. The results in Column 4 of Table 7 show

that children conceived before or during cleanup were 1.3 percentage points less likely to have

mothers who were married at the time of their birth 24. Because most of the sample includes

mothers who eventually marry the father, the father is usually present for the birth, and the

marital status differs in only 1 percent of cases, this is unlikely to affect the results strongly.

Indeed, when we control for maternal marriage status, the main results are identical 25. We also

control for whether the fathers of the siblings are the same or different, and controlling for

fathers does not affect the results 26.

         We also investigated whether differential access to prenatal care may have differentially

affected sibling outcomes. While it is largely unknown how prenatal care affects school

outcomes, low access to prenatal care could negatively affect birth outcomes. The results

presented in Columns 5 and 6 of Table 7 indicate that mothers had later initiation of prenatal care

and fewer prenatal care visits for children conceived before or during cleanup, relative to their

siblings conceived after cleanup. Columns 5 and 6 present results where the dependent variables

24
   Although only 54 percent of mothers of were married at the time of birth in the sample, 76.6 percent of the
children had the same father listed on the birth certificate for all births in the same family (with the same mother).
Of the 23.4 percent of children (6,126) who had different fathers listed on the birth certificate, the mother was
married to (different) fathers at the time of birth in 25 percent of cases. This leaves 17.7 percent of the sample (4,614
children) where the mother was unmarried for at least one of the births and the fathers were different (or not listed
on the birth certificate). Of these 4,614 children where the mother was unmarried at the time of birth and the fathers
differed, the father was present at the time of birth in 2,740 of these cases. This leaves about 7 percent of the sample
in which the mother was unmarried and the father was not present at the time of birth.
25
   We also estimated a model in which we control for the gap between births, as well as the interaction between
being conceived before or during cleanup and the gap between births, to see if there having a large gap between
births might account for the results through an interaction effect. When we control for the gap between births and an
interaction between the gap and being conceived before/during cleanup, the results get stronger. Controlling for the
birth order interactions produces results in which children conceived before or during cleanup (within 2 miles) have
-0.077 of a standard deviation lower test scores, and are 4.4 percentage points more likely to repeat a grade, 7.4
percentage points more likely to have a behavioral incident, and 3.4 percentage points more likely to have a
cognitive disability than their siblings conceived after. These results are all statistically significant at the p<0.05
level.
26
   We also have estimated an additional specification where we only compare children who have the same mother
and father who are conceived before or during cleanup, compared to after. Our results are slightly stronger when
both parents are the same.

                                                                                                                     29
are separate dimensions of the Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization (Kotelchuck) Index, which

is on a scale score from 1 to 4, where lower scores indicate better prenatal care. When we control

for these dimensions of prenatal care in our main results, the test score results become slightly

stronger and all other results remain the same.

         One might also be concerned that the cleanup of a Superfund site might make a

neighborhood more attractive to live in rather than affecting development. For example, if a

Superfund site’s cleanup causes more educated and affluent people to enter a neighborhood, later

born children might do better in school than their earlier born siblings because the composition

of students in the schools changed, leading to positive peer effects. The schools themselves

might also improve over this period if Superfund cleanup attracts wealthier residents who value

school quality and invest in local schools. Thus, the improved schooling outcomes for later born

children could be the result of peer effects or school quality improving over time.

         In order to investigate this possibility, we utilize date from the Florida School Indicators

Report (FSIR) from the same time period to identify whether school quality or composition

changed over time between siblings. The FSIR has data on the percent free and reduced price

lunch 27, average teacher years of experience 28, average class size 29 and school stability by

school 30. We also use the Florida matched birth and schooling data to estimate the average




27
   Data on the percent free/reduced price lunch (FRL) by school are available in the FSIR from 1997-2008.
28
   Data on the average teacher years of experience per school are available in the FSIR from 1997-2008.
29
   Class size data are available in the FSIR from 1997-2002.
30
   School stability data are available in the FSIR from 2001-2008. We appended all years of FSIR data together and
merged this with our matched birth and school records data from Florida by school and year for each child. We then
took an average of each school quality variable over the years and schools each child actually attended so that there
was one average for each variable for each child reflecting the average percent FRL, class size, etc. that child
experienced over her time in school.

                                                                                                                  30
maternal education by school, the percent of children with single mothers, and the percent of

Black students by school from 1992 through 2012 31.

         The first four columns of Table 8 show family fixed effects regression results in which

we investigate whether the peers in the schools the siblings attended differ on average by average

maternal education, percentage of children on free and reduced priced lunch, percentage of

children who are Black, and percentage of children with single mothers. In other words, we

estimate family fixed effects regressions where we determine whether being conceived before or

during cleanup is associated with differences in school quality between siblings. We find that

there are no differences in the composition of schools in the three indicators we investigated

between siblings conceived before/during cleanup compared to siblings conceived after cleanup.

In other words, a child being conceived before or during cleanup did not predict attending a

school that had children with lower average maternal education, on free and reduced price lunch,

with more single mothers, or who were Black, compared to her siblings conceived after cleanup.

         Unfortunately, many of the school quality indicators in the FSIR data could have been

affected by the local Superfund sites. For instance, if Superfund cleanup affects test scores and

behavior, measures such as school grades, test scores and disability rates are potentially

endogenous measures for determining whether the schooling environments change between

siblings. Thus, we examined three school quality indicators from the FSIR that are less likely to

have been affected by local Superfund sites: average teacher years of experience, average class

size, and school stability. We find that there was no statistically significant change in the average

years of experience teachers had or the average class size between earlier and later born siblings.

31
   Similarly, using the population level matched birth and school records data, we created an average of the maternal
education, the percent of single mothers, and the percent Black at each school in Florida from 1992-2012. We then
took an average of each of these variables over the schools in the years each child actually experienced them. In the
end there was one average for each variable for each child reflecting the average percent Black and maternal
education in the schools each child experienced over her time in school.

                                                                                                                  31
However children conceived before or during cleanup experience schools that have 0.6 percent

less school stability than their siblings who were conceived after cleanup. Although statistically

significant, the point estimate of the change in school stability is sufficiently small that it is quite

unlikely to account for our results 32.

         In addition, we also investigate whether the neighborhood compositions might have

changed over this time period for children living within 2 miles of a Superfund site. Using data

from the 1990 and 2000 Censuses, we compare median home values, median income, percent of

dwellings that are rented, the percent Black and percent Hispanic 33 at the zip code level for

children conceived before cleanup or children conceived during cleanup, relative to their siblings

conceived after cleanup in the same neighborhood. We find that on the whole, there are no

statistically significant or economically meaningful differences in neighborhood characteristics

between the neighborhoods siblings experienced 34. As an alternative, we use information from

the Internal Revenue Service’s Statistics of Income tax statistics data, to observe whether family

income in the zip codes in which children live changed meaningfully following Superfund

cleanup; while there are slight increases in average family income, again the differences are far

from statistical significance. 35 We also investigated whether the local Superfund site was located

in the same zip code in which the children lived. The local Superfund site was in the same zip

code 59.6 percent of the time. Controlling for whether or not the Superfund site was in the same

neighborhood does not affect the main results.

32
   We also investigated whether siblings attended the same schools at different times and find that siblings attended
the same schools in the same year at least once in 90.46 percent of cases, which furthers the idea that the schools
siblings attended were not likely to be substantially different.
33
   We linearly interpolate these values for missing years of data.
34
   There is one minor exception to this: siblings conceived before cleanup lived in neighborhoods where the percent
of people renting was one percent higher than the same neighborhood after cleanup. This might reflect the fact that
more people bought homes in neighborhoods after cleanup.
35
   The IRS Statistics of Income tax statistics data are reported for 1998, 2001, 2002, and annually from 2004
forward. We conduct our analysis of zip code income in the year the child turned six in order to maximize the
number of observations available for this exercise.

                                                                                                                   32
VI. Cumulative Exposure

           Given that earlier born children in our study still live in the same location when their

siblings are born, the sibling comparison necessarily combines both in utero exposure and at

least some degree of postnatal exposure. This section takes an exploratory step toward

understanding whether the results are principally driven by in utero exposure, or by a

combination of in utero and postnatal exposure. The potentially long duration of exposure could

explain why children exhibit negative cognitive outcomes even in the absence of negative birth

outcomes. In order to investigate this possibility, we compare the effects of cleanup for children

who were living within two miles of a Superfund site whose cleanup was completed by their first

birthday 36, and children who lived near a site whose cleanup was completed after the first

birthday. In each case, children are compared to their siblings who were conceived after cleanup

was completed. If cleanup was completed by a child’s first birthday, this implies that most of the

exposure to environmental toxicants a child might have had was in utero. If cleanup of a site was

completed after a child’s first birthday, this implies that the child may have been exposed both in

utero and for a longer period after birth. Thus we estimate:

(2)         𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽1 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜃𝜃𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

           Yijt is some outcome of a child i born to family j at time t. 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a

dummy variable for whether cleanup of a Superfund site was completed by a child’s first

birthday. 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a dummy variable for cleanup being completed after a child’s

first birthday. The omitted category is a dummy variable for being conceived after cleanup of a

site was completed. 𝜃𝜃𝑗𝑗 is a family fixed effect that is specific to the mother, and Xit is a vector of

child-specific control variables (i.e.., gender, birth year, birth month and birth order).


36
     For this group, cleanup of a nearby Superfund site was completed between conception and age 1.

                                                                                                                                            33
        This regression is likely to underestimate the effects of in utero exposure since some

children who live near a site that is cleaned during their gestation will only be partially exposed

in utero. In addition, sites near the end of cleanup are likely to be mostly clean. In other words,

children conceived on the tail end of cleanup would have very little pollution exposure. Thus,

this is a strong test for whether in utero exposure matters, and a weak test for whether cumulative

exposure drives these results.

        Table 9 shows the results for children living within two miles of a Superfund site whose

cleanup was completed by, or after, their first birthday, compared to their siblings who were

conceived after cleanup. The results for children living near Superfund sites that were cleaned by

their first birthday are quite similar to the results for children where the sites were cleaned after

the first birthday (who had more exposure). While there is a 3 percentage point increase in the

probability of having a behavioral incident at school for children living near sites that were

cleaned after their first birthday, relative to children living near sites that were cleaned in the first

year of life, this is the only outcome that appears affected. In some cases the results are stronger

for children with in utero and early infancy exposure, so the results are somewhat ambiguous.

Thus, there does not seem to be strong support for the idea that postnatal exposure leads to worse

outcomes in this analytical design. Future research should further explore in greater detail

whether cumulative exposure matters for children living near toxic waste.


VII. Conclusion

        This is the first large-scale study of the effects of living near Superfund sites on the

development of cognitive disabilities and other school-based cognitive, developmental and

behavioral outcomes to our knowledge. Notably, we investigate the developmental effects of

exposure to environmental toxicants during the prenatal period on both birth outcomes and long-


                                                                                                      34
term cognitive and behavioral outcomes over time. Population-level data suggests that Superfund

cleanup has apparently significant positive effects on a variety of long-term cognitive and

developmental outcomes for children. Children exposed to pollution from Superfund sites

showed lower test scores, increases in externalizing behaviors (as measured by behavioral

incidents at school), higher likelihood of repeating a grade, and an increased likelihood of having

a cognitive disability compared to their siblings conceived after cleanup. The results support the

notion that early life exposure to pollution contributes substantially to long-term cognitive and

developmental outcomes, and that pollution has much higher costs than have previously been

estimated. In addition, Superfund cleanup substantially benefits children’s cognitive

development.

       This pattern persists despite the fact that there exist strong birth order effects (see, e.g.,

Black, Devereux, and Salvanes, 2005; Booth and Kee, 2009; Conley and Glauber, 2006; Price,

2008), and the likelihood that pollution accumulates in the bodies of mothers over time

downward-biases the magnitude of sibling contrasts in this application. In addition, this pattern

persists despite the avoidance behaviors parents might perform in order to reduce their and

children’s exposure to pollution. This finding is in keeping with the literature that has shown that

early life exposure to pollution is associated with lower birth weight and test scores.

       There are several limitations of this study. First, our sample of siblings who do not move

away from a Superfund site is quite disadvantaged along a number of measures (e.g., race and

socioeconomic status) compared to the average for children in Florida, which means that our

findings might not pertain to an advantaged population less likely to live near environmental

toxicants. This finding is in line with Currie (2011), who finds that mothers living near

Superfund sites are more likely to be less educated and non-White. However, the fact that our



                                                                                                        35
results were similar for children of different racial and ethnic backgrounds suggests that children

from all backgrounds are harmed by proximity to Superfund sites before and during cleanup,

and, of course, .since disadvantaged families are those most likely to be exposed to

environmental toxicants, this population is most affected by Superfund cleanup. In addition, our

findings may be showing the effects of cumulative exposure to environmental toxicants, since

earlier born children may live near a Superfund site for a long time before it is cleaned.

         Nevertheless, our findings point toward the notion that inequality exists before birth,

since children born to mothers living near sources of pollution will have their cognitive

development affected negatively. The fact that poor and minority children are more likely to be

exposed to environmental toxicants has profound implications for environmental justice and

residential segregation. If Black children are more likely to live near Superfund sites, and these

sites affect their cognitive development, pollution exposure could partially explain the Black-

White test score gap – our estimates suggest that pollution accounts for between a tenth and a

fifth of the Black-White test score gap. Furthermore, if Superfund sites negatively affect housing

values (Currie et al., 2015) and poor children are more likely to live nearby, environmental

toxicant exposure might also partially explain the widening socioeconomic test score gap

(Reardon, 2011). Pollution exposure could also be partially responsible for low-income children

having a higher incidence of cognitive disabilities than higher income children (Bloom, Jones,

and Freeman, 2013) 37.

         While funding the cost of cleaning up Superfund sites has long been contentious, this

study adds an important piece of information about the benefits of Superfund cleanup. According

our back-of-the-envelope calculation, the Superfund program would pay for itself in 38 years in


37
   In families with an income of less than $35,000, the percentage of children with a learning disability (11 percent)
is almost twice that of children in families with an income of $100,000 or more (6 percent) (CDC, 2013).

                                                                                                                    36
terms of reduced special education costs for specific learning disabilities alone 38. In addition, this

study reveals the importance of cleaning up Superfund sites quickly, since children’s outcomes

suffer even during cleanup. Further research is needed to determine whether specific site

remediation is cost effective in improving both cognitive and health outcomes. Of course, our

research does not speak to the question of whether Superfund site cleanup could be made still

more efficient, or if there are alternatives to Superfund cleanup that could remove people from

harm’s way. But given that children exposed to pollution from Superfund sites are more likely to

have externalizing behaviors, cognitive disabilities and lower test scores, as well as health

problems, the Superfund program may be quite cost effective.

         However, our results do not speak to specific toxicants to which individuals were

exposed, since we do not have measures for exposure to different compounds and agents. Thus,

further research is needed about which environmental toxicants present in Superfund sites are

most likely to contribute to negative cognitive and behavioral outcomes for children. Further

research is also needed to address how the benefits of Superfund cleanup may vary across sites,

as well as what schools and other programs can do to support children with early toxic

exposures.

         This study provides some insights into how environmental pollution and policies affect

early brain development. In addition, this work also speaks to how residential and socioeconomic

contexts contribute to children’s unequal life chances even before conception.


38
   We use a $3 million cost per year over 9 years ($27,000,000) to clean up the average site with 4 million children
living near 1,269 sites nationwide. Chambers, Shkolnik, and Perez (2003) estimate that the SLD spending ratio is
1.6 relative to the average "regular education" student. 0.6 (the increment) x $8572 (NCES) x 8 (the average number
of years a kid with SLD receives SLD services over the course of his schooling) = $40,000 in reduced lifetime
special education costs per child with a learning disability. For every child born within one mile of the site, cleanup
reduces every child born's SLD education costs (forgetting about any other disabilities, or any labor market/human
capital implications) by about $4,000 (given a 10 percent reduction in Cognitive disabilities). $4000 x 175 kids per
site on average = $700,000 saved per birth cohort. $27,000,000 cleanup cost / $700,000 savings per birth cohort =
38 years to pay off Superfund cleanup for the average site just in terms of conservative special education savings.

Notes: Columns 1-5 present the results for different birth outcome variables. Only children from families living
consistently within two miles (one mile) of a Superfund site and not changing zip codes between births are included
in the analysis. Standard errors are adjusted for clustering at the site level and make use of bias-reduced
linearization. In addition to family fixed effects, regressions control for birth month and year, birth order, and
gender. Coefficients labeled as ***, **, and * are statistically significant at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels,
respectively.

Notes: Each column represents a different disability category. Only children from families living consistently within
two miles of a Superfund site and not changing zip codes between births are included in the analysis. Standard errors
are adjusted for clustering at the site level and make use of bias-reduced linearization. In addition to family fixed
effects, regressions control for birth month and year, birth order, and gender. Coefficients labeled as ***, **, and * are
statistically significant at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels, respectively.

Notes: Each column represents a different cognitive/schooling outcome. Panel A pools families consistently living within two miles of a Superfund site with
families where one sibling was born within two miles of a Superfund site and the other was born five or more miles away from a Superfund site; Panel B focuses
only on the moving families. Standard errors are adjusted for clustering at the site level. In addition to family fixed effects, regressions control for birth month and
year, birth order, and gender. Coefficients labeled as ***, **, and * are statistically significant at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels, respectively.

Notes: Columns 1-4 present the results for different schooling/cognitive outcome variables. Only children from families living consistently within two miles (one
mile) of a Superfund site and not changing zip codes between births are included in the analysis. Standard errors are adjusted for clustering at the site level and
make use of bias-reduced linearization. In addition to family fixed effects, regressions control for birth month and year, birth order, and gender. Coefficients
labeled as ***, **, and * are statistically significant at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels, respectively.

FIGURE A1: FAMILY FIXED EFFECTS POINT ESTIMATES WITH CONFIDENCE INTERVALS FOR
THE LIKELIHOOD OF REPEATING A GRADE IF A CHILD WAS CONCEIVED BEFORE OR DURING

Notes: Each line represents a different 95 percent confidence interval for the likelihood of repeating a grade for
those conceived before/during versus after Superfund cleanup, in which a different Superfund site is dropped in turn.
For ease of presentation, we order the confidence intervals from smallest to largest point estimates. Only children
from families living consistently within two miles (one mile) of a Superfund site and not changing zip codes
between births are included in the analysis. Standard errors are adjusted for clustering at the site level and make use
of bias-reduced linearization. In addition to family fixed effects, regressions control for birth month and year, birth
order, and gender.
