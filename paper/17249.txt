China and India as Suppliers of Affordable Medicines to Developing Countries

NBER Working Paper No. 17249

JEL No. I10,O10,O34

                                             ABSTRACT

As countries reform their patent laws to be in compliance with the Trade Related Intellectual Property
Rights Agreement, an important question is how increased patent protection will affect drug prices
in low-income countries. Using pharmaceutical trade data from 1996 to 2005, we examine the role
of China and India as suppliers of medicines to other middle- and low-income countries and evaluate
the competitive effect of medicine imports from these countries on the price of medicines from high-
income countries. We find that imports of antibiotics and unspecified medicaments from India and
China significantly depress the average price of these commodities imported from high-income trading
partners, suggesting that India and China are not only important sources of inexpensive medicines
but also have an indirect effect by lowering prices through competition. As India is the leading supplier
of medicines in Sub-Saharan Africa, this region will likely be affected most adversely.

Introduction

        The World Health Organization (WHO) cites high medicine prices and the underuse of

generics as a major inefficiency in national health systems (WHO, 2010). High prices can be

particularly burdensome to the poor in developing countries, many of who live on less than 1 USD

per day and pay for medicines and health services out-of-pocket. Approximately one third of the

global population lacks reliable access to medicines because they cannot afford to purchase them

(WHO, 2004). A recent study has shown that purchasing selected medicines out-of-pocket has the

potential to push a significant proportion of the population into poverty (Niëns et al., 2010). High

medicine prices are also a burden on government budgets, with medicines accounting for about 25%

of national health care budgets in developing countries as a whole (WHO, 2003).

        Generic medicines have proven to be a cost-saving alternative to more expensive branded

equivalents (Lexchin, 2004). Developing countries, such as Brazil and India, have developed drug

manufacturing capacity and have emerged in the last decade as important sources of inexpensive

generic medicines for their domestic and regional consumers. India, for example, is often cited as

the lead source of inexpensive antiretroviral medicines that have helped to revolutionize HIV/AIDS

treatment in Sub-Saharan Africa. Given the anecdotal evidence regarding the importance of some of

these countries as suppliers of cheaper medicines, this paper attempts a systematic evaluation of the

importance of middle-income countries as suppliers of affordable medicines to other developing

countries.

        The issue of access to affordable medicines is particularly salient given the implementation

of the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights Agreement (TRIPS), which requires all members of

the World Trade Organization to guarantee intellectual property rights protection for

pharmaceuticals. Prior to the ratification of the TRIPS, many developing countries allowed very

little, if any, intellectual property rights protection for pharmaceutical products (Barton, 2004).



                                                                                                        3
Many countries have since reformed their patent laws to be in compliance with the TRIPS and now

grant patents for new medicines (Arvind, 2004; Scherer & Watal, 2002). One possible implication of

this change in patent policy is that developing countries with an active generic drug industry will be

unable to continue copying innovative drugs from the developed world. This may decrease the

availability of affordable drugs for poor consumers in developing countries. However, in order to

fully assess the impact of such policy changes, we need to know the extent to which these countries

matter as a source of medicines for developing countries.

       The purpose of this paper is two-fold: it explores the role of middle-income countries,

particularly China and India, as suppliers of medicines to other middle- and low-income countries;

and it examines the competitive effect of drug imports from these countries on the price of

medicines imported from high-income trading partners. Using the assumption that firms in

developing countries are primarily involved in imitative drug production, we exploit the variation in

trade with developing countries across time and pharmaceutical commodity classes to determine the

price impact of pharmaceutical products exported by China and India.



The Global Pharmaceutical Market

       Developing countries tend to run a trade deficit on pharmaceuticals because most countries

lack manufacturing and innovative capability. They therefore depend on imports for their domestic

supply of medicines. Local pharmaceutical industries in developing countries, when they exist, tend

to be small and focused on the production of traditional medicines or generic medicines for

domestic consumption. Some middle-income countries are an exception to that trend. Argentina,

Brazil, China, Cuba, India, Mexico and South Africa, for example, have domestic pharmaceutical

industries with varying levels of innovative capability (Balance, 1992). India and China are important

suppliers of medicines, particularly in products such as antibiotics and ARVs that treat diseases



                                                                                                         4
prevalent in developing countries. India produces both active ingredients and final products and is

among the leading suppliers of antiretrovirals to developing countries. The government

Pharmaceutical Organization in Thailand, for example, sources 90% of its materials for ARV

production from India and produces ARVs that are up to 25 times cheaper than their branded

equivalent. The Thai Public Health Ministry acknowledges that these savings would have been

impossible without the Indian supply (Grace, 2004). China is also a major supplier of ingredients for

antibiotics and has been ranked as the leading producer of penicillin, doxycyclin hydrochloride,

cephalosporin and teramycin, producing more than 50% of the global supply (Grace, 2004). Brazil

is regarded as a leader in its successful response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic which was partially

facilitated by domestic production of generic antiretrovirals (Flynn, 2008). Pharmaceutical

production capabilities in Africa are far less developed but the situation is likely to improve with

recent initiatives by the African Union and the United Nations Industrial Development

Organization (UNIDO) to strengthen local production (Berger et al., 2010). South Africa is the only

country with the ability to manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients and account for 70% of

the estimated $1 billion in annual pharmaceutical production in Sub-Sahara Africa. Ghana, Nigeria

and Kenya are also regional players but to a lesser extent.

        The ability of these countries to develop their generic industry has been facilitated by their

patent laws that, prior to TRIPS, did not allow patent protection for pharmaceuticals. India’s weak

intellectual property protection, for example, helped to facilitate the development of its local

pharmaceutical industry (Grace, 2004; Lanjouw, 1998; Kettler & Modi, 2001; Watal, 2000). After

India’s 1970 patent law reforms, the government allowed patents for the manufacturing process but

not the final product. This allowed companies to legally reverse engineer patented products

developed in high-income countries and provide cheaper generic copies produced using a different

process.



                                                                                                         5
        TRIPS, which was signed at the Uruguay Round of the World Trade Organization (WTO)

negotiations in 1995, establishes the framework for the protection of intellectual property

protection. Article 27 requires that all WTO members guarantee at least 20 years of market

exclusivity for patented medicines. Brazil amended its patent laws to become TRIPS-compliant in

1996. China and India took similar steps in 1999 and 2005 respectively. The public health

implications of TRIPS have been extensively discussed in the literature (see for example: Barton,

2004; Commission on Intellectual Property Rights Innovation and Public Health, 2006; Shadlen,

2007; Smith, Correa, & Oh, 2009; Trouiller et al., 2002). The issue of access to affordable medicines

has gained particular attention with the primary concern being TRIPS-compliance will eliminate the

supply of affordable generic medicines, in particular copies of drugs still on patent, for poor

consumers in low- and middle-income countries. It is also likely that enhanced intellectual property

protection will incentivize domestic firms to invest in R&D, as preliminary evidence in India

suggests (Lanjouw & Cockburn, 2001). However, it is not clear whether these firms are likely to

invest in products that target the health problems of the developing world or those of high-income

countries. Emerging evidence suggests that TRIPS compliance has changed the incentives for Indian

firms who are shifting their focus to R&D and high-income markets (Chaudhuri et al., 2010;

Shadlen, 2007). The emergence of TRIPS-plus, which tends to have even more stringent

requirements for intellectual property rights protection embedded in bilateral free-trade agreements,

has made the potential effects of TRIPS on access to medicines even more unclear and contentious

(Smith, Correa, & Oh, 2009). As such, a systematic evaluation of the role of middle-income

countries as medicine suppliers is a necessary precursor in studying the impact of TRIPS on access

to medicines.




                                                                                                     6
Patents, Generic Competition and Medicine Prices

        For most commodities, one of the most important determinants of price is the marginal cost

of production. In the case of pharmaceuticals, however, variations in marginal costs are unlikely to

affect the prices of drugs, particularly patent-protected branded drugs (Scherer, 2004). There are

very high fixed costs associated with the discovery and development of new a new drug but the

marginal costs of production are very low. The high fixed costs, which need to be recovered, dictate

the price of the drug more so than the marginal costs. Danzon (1998), for example, estimated that

fixed costs comprised 70% of pharmaceutical costs while manufacturing and short-run costs

accounted for the remaining 30%. The fixed costs for generic drug production are much lower than

those for innovative drugs because the high fixed costs associated with R&D are reduced as the

innovation has already been achieved. Marginal costs are also reduced because of lower production

costs for generic firms in developing countries. Generics are therefore expected to be cheaper than

branded drugs, but the price for any given drug will be more strongly determined by fixed costs

instead of marginal costs.

        International reference pricing, a practice in which the price of a ‘basket’ of pharmaceutical

products in one or more countries is used to set a benchmark price for the same product in a given

country, is often a key determinant of medicine prices (Epsin et al., 2011). However, the method for

calculating prices varies across countries depending on regulatory capabilities, the reference

countries chosen and the basket of goods chosen for comparison. So even with this price

benchmarking, price differentials exist both across countries and across different groups of

consumers in a given country. Further, firms usually engage in price discrimination, an important

factor that affects the price differences. Drug firms face two markets, one (typically in low-income

countries) where consumers are price sensitive and seek the lowest cost possible, and another

(typically in high-income countries) where consumers are fairly price insensitive and are willing to



                                                                                                         7
pay more. While the firm may choose setting a high, uniform price to target the price insensitive

consumers, more commonly, firms choose to price discriminate to capture as much of each market

as possible (Ridley, 2005). Therefore prices of pharmaceuticals are expected to vary with the ability

to pay across countries. There is evidence of this in the preferential pricing practices among

multinational pharmaceutical firms (Lichtenberg, 2010). The least developed countries are usually

sold medicines at lower prices compared to richer countries.

        Intellectual property rights protection is a major incentive for innovation in the

pharmaceutical industry and is a key determinant in medicine pricing. Innovative medicines with

patent protection are granted limited market exclusivity within the jurisdiction of the patent, which

limits the legal competition to therapeutic equivalents in a different brand. For products with no

therapeutic equivalent and that are protected by a patent, the manufacturer can price the drug as

high as the market will bear. Upon patent expiration, these medicines usually face competition from

generic versions, which are therapeutically equivalent.

        Copies of on-patented innovative drugs may also be marketed before patent expiration but

the legality of these generics will vary depending on patent jurisdiction. Prior to the ratification of

the TRIPS, many developing countries allowed very little, if any, intellectual property rights

protection for pharmaceutical products (Barton, 2004). Many countries have since reformed their

patent laws to be in compliance with the TRIPS and now grant patents for new medicines (Arvind,

2004; Scherer & Watal, 2002). Least developed countries have until 2016 to implement these

changes. Given this gradual reform of the patent laws across countries, it is expected that the same

drug may face different competition from generics depending on whether or not patents are allowed

in a given jurisdiction. This competition is limited to the extent that the given country has local

manufacturing capability and/or allows importation of generics from other countries with such

capability. The local industry, where it exists, can respond to local and regional health needs to the



                                                                                                          8
extent that the trade and patent laws allow the legal copying of innovative drugs. In Brazil, for

example, local generic manufacturers have decreased the cost of anti-retroviral drugs by more than

70% (Samb, 2003).

        The entry of generics will follow one of two price trajectories (Scherer, Anthony, &

Newhouse, 2000). Initial generic entry will lead to the price of generics being slightly less than

average of the brand name drugs. As more generic brands enter the market, competition develops

from just generics versus branded drugs to include competition among generic brands, which may

cause the average price of generics to decrease more substantially. In a developed country where

consumers can afford to pay or rely on insurance coverage, the branded drug firm may find it more

profitable to serve the market preferring the branded drug and maintain their high prices instead of

decreasing prices to compete with generics. In the developing world, however, where there is such a

high inability to pay, the branded drug firm may find it more profitable to decrease prices to

compete with the generics (Danzon & Towse, 2003; Ridley, 2005).

        In developing countries, concerns over TRIPS are often with drugs that are still on patent,

meaning that western generic versions for those drugs are unavailable. The generic version of

branded on-patent drugs are therefore likely to only be sourced from middle-income countries like

India and Brazil, which up until recently did not grant patents for pharmaceutical products. The

presence of generic drugs competition from these middle-income countries is therefore likely to be a

chief determinant of pharmaceutical prices in developing countries. Thus, in addition to evaluating

the importance of select middle-income countries as sources of medicines, another primary objective

of this paper is to investigate the effect of the share of pharmaceutical imports from these countries

on the price of pharmaceutical imports from high-income trading partners. A key assumption here is

that the drugs marketed by developed countries are either patented branded drugs or generic copies

of drugs that have gone off patent (WHO, 2004). Developing countries on the other hand may



                                                                                                       9
market generics of two kinds: those that are copies of drugs that are still on patent and generics that

are copies of branded drugs that have gone off patent.

        On average, it is expected that generics of off-patent drugs are likely to be the same in terms

of price whether the drug is being marketed by firms from developed or developing countries.

Ideally, the focus should be on the other type of generics, those that are copies of drugs that are still

on patent, as they will present the biggest cost differential between generics and branded versions.

Further, it is for this group of generics that trade from developing countries with manufacturing

capability are expected to be different and most relevant to the implication of TRIPS on the

affordability of medicines. Unfortunately, the available data do not allow for differentiation between

these two types of generics.1 We therefore assume that, on average, drugs marketed by developing

country firms are generic copies of branded drugs while drugs offered by firms from developed

countries are innovator brands. If this is the case, it is expected that the importation of generics

from Brazil, China and India will depress the prices of drugs sold by firms from high-income

countries.2



Data

        Three different types of data were used in this study: patent, trade, and economic

development indicators. Patent data were obtained from Delphion, a fee-based patent search service,

and the free-access database of the European Patent Office. The patent data were used for two

purposes: to identify the innovative developing countries to be used in the regressions for evaluating

the effect of trade; and to examine the patenting trends of innovators from high-income countries in

developing countries for which data are available.3 The International Patent Classification (IPC)

provides a hierarchical system in which technologies are divided into various groups. There are two

major subclasses of patents that classify pharmaceuticals, A61K and A61P. Subclass A61K classifies



                                                                                                       10
pharmaceutical compounds based on their chemical structure while A61P classifies compounds

according to their therapeutic activity. Patent data were downloaded with the search restricted to

subclass A61K excluding the patent groups that relate to veterinary medicine, cosmetics and

dentistry (A61K 5/00, 6/00, 7/00, 8/00).4 These data were used to generate patent counts based on

the inventor’s country. Inventors need to file patent applications in each jurisdiction where they

desire patent protection. We examine the patenting activity of pharmaceutical innovators,

particularly from high-income countries.

       The data on trade in pharmaceuticals are from the United Nations Statistical Division

Commodity Trade database (ComTrade) and the analysis is limited to the years 1995 to 2005. They

were used to examine trends in pharmaceutical trade. These trade data were also used along with

variables derived from the World Bank’s Development Indicators (WDI) in the regression analyses.

The ComTrade database uses the Harmonized Systems (HS), which is a six-digit internationally

standardized nomenclature used for classifying traded commodities. The trade values of exports and

imports between participating countries are recorded for different commodities in US dollars and

various quantity measures. Chapter 30, which deals specifically with pharmaceuticals, has six

headings at the 4-digit level. Only subheadings (six-digit level) under headings 3002, 3003 and 3004

are considered for the purposes of this research as they classify medicinal preparations for

prophylactic or therapeutic uses. This results in 15 different commodity classes that codify active

ingredients and finished products at the 6-digit level. We combined these 15 classes into 7

commodity groups for analysis as shown in Table 1.



[Table 1 about here]




                                                                                                      11
       For each trade event, both the exporter and the importer provide a report of the trade. We

used the importer-reported values because we use trade value and quantity to calculate price per

kilogram as a proxy for base market price in the importing country. The importer-reported trade is

therefore more suitable. The importer-reported value includes the transaction value of the goods,

the quantity of goods in kilograms, the value of services performed to deliver the goods to the

border of the exporting country and to the border of the importing country.5 The data do not allow

us to identify specific manufacturer brands, nor do they allow us to identify specific medicines and

their therapeutic classes. Second, the reported trade values do not represent the final purchase price

of the drug for a consumer. Additional taxes, local distribution costs and other retail markups also

help to determine the final purchase price. However, it is reasonable to treat the import value as an

indicator of aggregate base price before additional markups. The mean price per kilogram for a

pharmaceutical commodity from a given country can therefore be assessed based on the recorded

trade value and quantity. A primary advantage of using the trade data is that they allow us to

associate an approximated cost of pharmaceutical commodities with their country of production.




Trends in Patents and Trade

      The trends in the patent data show that innovative capacity for pharmaceuticals has increased

tremendously since the 1990s for some developing countries (Fig. 1). While there is no clear

threshold indicating the point where the industry becomes innovative, it is clear from Figure 1 that

there is an increasing trend among these countries in the number of US-granted pharmaceutical

patents.6 There are two apparent groups of countries with India and China as the clear leaders. Both

India and China show a similar trend of explosive growth after 1993 with India surpassing China

and leading in total patent count in 1997 and thereafter (Fig. 1). The second group includes South




                                                                                                       12
Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Cuba which showed an increase in patent applications starting

in 1994 and which has remained constant on average but higher than their respective counts in the

1980s. These trends are consistent with the typology described by Ballance and colleagues (1992),

which cites these developing countries among those that have a pharmaceutical industry with some

level of innovative and reproductive capability.



[Figure 1 about here]



      Of the seven countries included in Figure 1, we only have a close to full panel of data for

patents granted domestically in Brazil and India.7 As Figure 2 shows, pharmaceutical patents

granted in Brazil increased exponentially starting in 1997. This increase coincides with the

introduction of Brazil’s new TRIPS-compliant patent law, which allows patenting of pharmaceutical

products. Note that inventors need to file separate patent applications in each patent jurisdiction

where they need intellectual property protection. The increases in granted patents in Brazil are not

surprising but note that patents to US inventors increased exponentially relative to the other leading

innovators. The introduction of the new law changed patenting behavior among the leading

inventors and allowed innovators from countries like the US to strengthen the intellectual property

protection of their products in Brazil.


[Figure 2 about here]


        The trends in India are different from those observed for Brazil. Unlike Brazil, India did not

make its patent laws TRIPS-compliant until 2005. As Figure 3 shows, pharmaceutical patent grants

started to increase in India in 1992. Domestic patents account for much of the increase and the

number of patents granted to the leading pharmaceutical innovating countries remain fairly constant



                                                                                                       13
for much of the period. While there was a slight increase in the patent counts for the US, its counts

remained relatively low and stable compared to that of the domestic patents granted in India. So

while producers from the innovative high-income countries account for much of the increase in

granted patents in Brazil, much of the increase in granted patents in India were to local producers.

Note that this increase in patents in India started before TRIPS-compliance and therefore likely

indicates the growth of the local generic industry.


[Figure 3 about here]



        Much of the trade activity in pharmaceuticals is attributable to just two commodity groups,

antibiotics and unspecified medicaments. Unspecified medicaments account for 85% of exports

from high-income countries, antibiotics account for 6% and vitamins account for 5%. On average

unspecified medicaments account for 75% and antibiotics account for 15% of exports from

Argentina, Brazil, China, India and Mexico. This is not surprising as these two groups include the

broadest classes of medicines for both chronic and infectious diseases. They also include

antiinfectives such as antibiotics and antiretrovirals, which are particularly relevant in some

developing country markets.

        The polarization of the global pharmaceutical market is reflected in Figure 4, which shows

that high-income countries tend to trade among themselves with 77% of pharmaceutical export

volume for the period 1996 to 2005 going to other high-income countries. Europe and Central Asia

represented only 9% of the trade volume for that same period with the remaining volume almost

equally divided between the other regions. This pattern aligns with income-level and is consistent

with what is known about the global pharmaceutical market. High-income countries have a higher

purchasing power and pharmaceutical consumption rates and therefore account for the bulk of the

global pharmaceutical market.

                                                                                                       14
[Figure 4 about here]



        There is also some notable variation in the destination of the pharmaceutical exports from

Argentina, Brazil, China, India and Mexico. The majority of the exports from Argentina and

Brazil—95% and 96% respectively—were traded with other countries in the Latin American region

(Fig. 4). Thirty nine percent of the exports from Mexico are traded with high-income countries,

primarily the US, but the majority of its export is also traded within the region. The export trends

for the Latin American countries are in contrast to those of India and China, which have more

diverse regional markets (Fig. 5 & 6). What is most notable about the case of China is that exports to

high-income countries remained relatively stable between 1996 and 2005 while exports to both Sub-

Saharan Africa and Asia Pacific increased during that period from 3 to 15 and 10 to 18 million

kilograms respectively (Fig. 5). India also had increases in its exports to all regions during that period

but particularly to Sub-Saharan Africa and high-income trading partners (Fig. 6). Much of the

increase began in 1999 with exports to Sub-Saharan Africa increasing from approximately 20 to 50

million kilograms between 1999 and 2006. On average, only 26% of India’s pharmaceutical exports

were traded with high-income countries, 35% was traded with Sub-Saharan African countries, 16%

with Asia and Pacific countries and 14% with Eastern and Central Europe (Fig. 4). Since 2000,

India’s share of exports to Sub-Saharan Africa has exceeded the amount traded with all other

regions.

        We also examined the import trends across the different regions to see whether there is

variation in the reliance on Argentina, Brazil, China, India and Mexico as sources of pharmaceutical

products. Figure 7 shows the patterns in regional imports. With the exception of the Sub-Saharan

Africa region, high-income countries are the major source of pharmaceutical imports for developing



                                                                                                       15
countries between 1996 and 2005. This is particularly evident in the Middle East and North Africa

Region which received an average of 88% of its imports from high-income countries for the entire

period. The lowest averages were in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa where imports from

high-income countries represented only an average share of 53% and 33% respectively for the

period 1996 to 2005 (Fig. 7). The group of five countries is a major source of imports for Sub-

Saharan Africa providing more than 50% of import volume for that period. Much of that trend is

driven by India, which on average supplies 40% of the region’s imports each year.

        If we consider the percentage of imports based on trade value, the findings are similar.

However, while high-income countries on average account for 43% of import volume, they account

for almost 80% of imports in terms of trade value. Interestingly, for Latin America and the

Caribbean, and Sub-Saharan Africa regions the percent of import value coming from high income

countries is almost 8 times the percentage of imports coming from the group of five countries or

other developing countries. This is despite the import quantity being almost the same. This is

consistent with the expectation that imports from high-income countries are more expensive than

those from developing countries.



[Figure 7 about here]



        These trade trends provide evidence that China and India have become increasingly more

important as sources of pharmaceutical imports for other low- and middle-income countries. While

Argentina, Brazil and Mexico also demonstrate a relatively high level of trade activity, they tend to

be active only in their regional market. There are two preliminary conclusions we can draw from

these trade trends. If middle-income countries do have a competitive effect on trade from high

income countries, we would expect the greatest effect in Sub-Saharan Africa given that India is the



                                                                                                        16
largest supplier of pharmaceuticals on average. Second, of the five innovative developing countries

India is likely to have the most pronounced effect because it is the only country with a leading

market share relative to high-income countries as a trading block. We will therefore do a regression

analysis focusing on the effect of imports from India and China on the average price of imports

from high-income trading partners in the Sub-Saharan Africa region. We discuss our analysis in the

proceeding sections.



Model Estimation

           Given that Argentina, Brazil and Mexico export, on average, 1% or less of their

pharmaceutical commodities to Sub-Saharan Africa, and trade the majority of their commodities

within the regions, we have chosen to focus on India and China. Specifically, the regression analysis

focuses on the effect of the share of pharmaceutical imports from China and India on the price of

pharmaceutical imports from high-income trading partners. We employ the following model to

estimate the effect:

                          Pitc = β +δCIitc + γXit + Ψi + Ωc +Τt + ξitc

Pitc is the average price per kilogram of commodity c imported from high-income trading partners by

developing country i in year t, with t ranging from 1996-2005. CIitc is the percent of drug imports

from China and India by developing country i in year t; Xit is a vector of country-level controls; Ψi

represents country fixed effects; Ωc represents commodity fixed effects and Τt represents year fixed

effects.

           The dependent variable, Pitc is the mean annual price per kilogram of a given commodity

imported by country i from high-income countries as a group. Appendix I provides a list of the



                                                                                                      17
country groups based on economy and region. The dependent variable is constructed by aggregating

the trade value (2000 US$) and trade quantity as reported by the importing country across related

commodity classes:


        Pitc =
                 ! value
                       j   ijtc
                                   , where j is each high-income exporter.
                 ! volume
                   j        ijtc




       Table 1 shows the grouping for the commodities and Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics

for the variables used in the regression models. Note that the commodity groups are very general

and do not allow us to compare medicines that fall into specific therapeutic classes. As such each

group contains a mix of both innovative, and hence expensive, drugs along with older and less

expensive medicines. For example, the ‘other medicaments’ group will contain aspirin, a relatively

non-expensive and ubiquitous commodity, as well as more innovative medicines such as cancer and

HIV/AIDS therapeutics.

       We need to address an endogeniety issue that is inherent in the model. The same variables

that help to determine the price of pharmaceutical imports from high-income countries may also

influence the share of imports from China and India, CI, so that CI may be correlated with ξitc. We

instrument for the share of imports from China and India to address this endogeneity issue. A

reasonable instrument will be correlated with CI but not with the mean price of pharmaceutical

imports from high-income countries. In order to identify a suitable instrument we note that there

are two factors that help to determine CI: (i) the existence of pharmaceuticals produced by China

and India on the global market; (ii) and the existence of a trade relationship between these two

countries and the importing country. The availability of medicines produced by China or India in a

given country is conditional on the production of that medicine and its availability on the global

market. A reasonable instrument for the supply of medicines from China or India is therefore the


                                                                                                     18
percentage of medical imports worldwide from these countries to all countries excluding the country

of interest. We construct such a variable called PerGenElse. Existence of a trade relationship between

two countries will also determine the extent to which they trade a particular commodity. We

therefore lag CI as CIt-1 and CIt-2 and include them as an instrument. The reasoning is that CIt-1

and CIt-2 are measures of an existing relationship between the trading partners. We therefore expect

the lagged variable to be correlated with CI but not directly correlated with the dependent variable

in year t.8 So the first stage model was estimated using the following equation:

                      CIitc = γ0 + γ1PerGenElseitc + γ2CIic(t-1) + γ3CIic(t-2) + vicrt

       One other variable related to the commodities is bulk, which represents the percent of

imports for a particular commodity group that is imported in bulk form. There are two types of

pharmaceutical products, finished products which are packaged in dosage formulation and coded

under the 3004 heading. The second type is active ingredients which are intended to be used in the

manufacture of a pharmaceutical product and as such packaged in bulk and not for retail sale and

coded under the 3003 heading. Vaccines are not differentiated between finished and active

ingredient formulation as shown in Table 1. Vitamins are also coded only under the 3004 heading.

It is expected that bulk products will be cheaper than the finished product which has gone through

full production and dosage formulation. It is therefore important to account for the amount of the

imported commodity group that is imported as active ingredient. We accomplish this by including

bulk, which represents the percent of imports for a particular commodity group as active ingredient

(or traded under the 3003 heading).

       The model also includes a vector of control variables that attempt to account for the other

factors that affect the prices of medicines. National GDP per capita is included as a measure of

ability to pay. GDP is often used as a criterion in preferential pricing schemes in which countries



                                                                                                      19
with a lower GDP are usually offered lower prices. Life expectancy (life), tuberculosis incidence (tb),

infant mortality (infmort) and physicians-population ratio (physi) are included as indicators of the

national disease profile and the demand for medicines. The model also includes country dummies to

account for time-invariant country specific effects. These variables control for other factors such as

tariffs and procurement practices, which will affect the price of imports but are unlikely to vary over

time. Year dummies are included to account for year-specific effects such as the licensing dispute in

South Africa in 2001, which may have impacted medicine pricing negotiations and pharmaceutical

procurement decisions across developing countries.


Results and Discussion

        Column 1 of Table 3 presents the estimates for the effect of percentage imports from China

and India (CI) on the average price of antibiotics and unspecified medicaments imported from high-

income trading partners. Columns 2 and 3 show the same regression with the sample restricted to

countries from the Asia and Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Sub-Saharan Africa

regions. All the pharmaceutical commodities are included in column 3. As shown in columns 1 and

2, the effect of the percentage imports from China and India is statistically significant and in the

expected direction. This effect is no longer significant when we include the full sample of

pharmaceutical commodities (Table 3, Column 3). This is not surprising because we know from

examining the trends in the trade data that antibiotics and other medicaments account for

approximately 90% of the pharmaceutical export volume for India and China.

        In terms of magnitude, the effect of the CI variable is strongest when the model is applied to

the full sample of countries (Table 3, Column 1). On average, a one unit increase in the percent of

imports from India and China will result in a 87-cents decrease in the average price of a

pharmaceutical commodity imported from the high-income trading partners. While this may not

seem like a substantial effect, it is important to put these numbers in context. Since the average price

                                                                                                       20
of antibiotics and unspecified medicaments from high income countries is around $40 (Table 2), on

average prices fall by over 2 percent for each one percentage point increase in imports from China

and India. Emphasizing the importance of such savings, Niëns and colleagues (2010) have

estimated the impoverishing effects of purchasing medicines out-of-pocket across 16 low- and

middle-income countries. In Uganda, for example, where 73% of the population subsists on less

than US$2 per day, purchasing generic amoxicillin (a common antibiotic) has the potential to

increase the proportion of the population below the poverty line (US$2 per day) to 74% compared

to 86% if the originator brand is purchased (Niëns et al., 2010).


[Table 3 about here]


        In terms of country characteristics, GDP and TB incidence are generally insignificant. This is

not surprising given that both GDP and TB incidence do not show much variation from year to

year. The effect of life expectancy is positive and significant in all three models (Table 3).9 This

suggests that countries with higher life expectancy tend to pay higher prices for their medicines. It is

also possible that there is some collinearity between life expectancy and GDP in our model

specification. Countries with higher life expectancy also have a higher ability to pay because of

higher incomes. Further, income levels are one of the criteria used in preferential pricing to set lower

prices for the least developed countries. Countries with lower income levels, and hence lower life

expectancy, may therefore pay lower prices for their pharmaceutical imports.

        We also tested the effect of the percentage of imports from all five innovative middle-

income countries as an alternate key independent variable. The results for this model are presented

in Table 4, columns 1 and 2. While the sign on the coefficient is in the expected direction, the

variable is insignificant and the magnitude smaller whether for the full panel of commodities

(Column 1) or just antibiotics and medicaments (Column 2). The dummy variables for commodity



                                                                                                       21
type are also strongly significant with unspecified medicaments being cheaper than antibiotics, and

antisera, vaccines and insulin being the most expensive commodity groups. However, note that our

instruments do not perform as well in the full panel (column 1), as the p-value for Hansen’s J test is

small, suggesting our instruments are not exogenous. Given that Argentina, Brazil and Mexico trade

the majority of their pharmaceutical commodities within the region and that antibiotics and

medicaments account for the bulk of export volume for all five countries, our instruments appear to

be picking up endogenous links between countries and commodities, rather than exogenous shifts in

supply.10 This is not a concern in column 2, however, where we once again limit the sample to those

commodities most likely to be traded. Here, the p-value for Hansen’s J test is greater than 0.1, and

the F-statistic testing for weak instruments is large.

        We also tested the effect of imports from Argentina, Brazil and Mexico on the average prices

of pharmaceutical imports from high-income trading partners in Latin American countries only. The

results are shown in Table 4, columns 3 and 4. Again we fail to observe a significant effect of

import share.11 Another possible explanation for the lack of significance is that the US dominated as

the leading source of imports for much of the period under study and accounted for as much as

60% of the import volume in 2002 before its annual market share started to decrease. The

dominance of the market by one high-income producer suggests that the middle-income country

producers are likely to have little effect at the regional level especially if the focus is on their

domestic market. The patenting trends in Brazil, particularly if similar to those in other countries like

Argentina, may also explain the lack of significance observed for all three alternate key independent

variables for Latin America. As shown in Figure 2, all the high-income producers increased

patenting after Brazil introduced its new patent laws in 1997. However, the US, which dominated as

a source of regional imports, had a disproportionate amount of patents granted relative to the other

innovators. This suggests that much of the regional trade is for generics of drugs off-patent or



                                                                                                       22
branded medicines produced by multinational subsidiaries or licensees, who can legally produce

patented medicines. Therefore, the group of medicines for which we would expect the biggest cost

differences, generics of patented medicines, do not comprise a substantial portion of the market.

       The observations for the Latin American exporters are in contrast to the significant effect of

imports from China and India in the Sub-Saharan Africa region (Table 3). Again, both the patent

and trade trends are consistent with this finding. When we consider the regional imports, note that

India is the lead source of imports for Sub-Saharan, albeit not to the levels that the US was for Latin

America and Caribbean region. So India has a greater potential to compete with high-income

producers. It is also clear from the patent counts (Fig. 3) that domestic patents dominate the

increasing trend in patents granted in India. Note that India did not become TRIPS-compliant until

2005, so pharmaceutical patents on products were not allowed until 2005. The increase in patent

counts for India is therefore most likely from process patents. This suggests that India

pharmaceutical manufacturers could therefore legally produce generics for both off- and on-patent

medicines for much of the period being studied. This may therefore help to explain the significant

effect we observe for imports from India and China. Indian manufacturers are able to trade in both

on- and off-patent medicines therefore providing larger cost savings for consumers in that region.

       The regression results suggest that only pharmaceutical imports from China and India—and

not all five innovative middle-income countries—have a significant effect on the average cost of

pharmaceutical imports from high-income trading partners in developing countries. However, this

effect is only observed for the antibiotics and unspecified medicaments and not the other

commodity groups. This is not surprising as antibiotics and unspecified medicaments together

account for 90% of the exports from China and India for the study period 1996 to 2005 and the

bulk of overall pharmaceutical trade. The findings are also consistent with the trade data that show

that China and India are the leading suppliers of medicines among the innovative middle-income



                                                                                                     23
countries, with Argentina, Brazil, Mexico only playing a regional role. It is likely therefore, that only

China and India have a big enough market share to compete with high-income producers of

medicines.



Conclusions

        The study provides evidence to support existing anecdotal evidence for the importance of

China and India as suppliers of inexpensive medicines to other developing countries. While Latin

America depends heavily on intraregional trade and imports from the U.S., Sub-Saharan Africa relies

on India for 45% of its imports. As such, the enforcement of TRIPS is likely to have differing

implications for the two regions. In Latin America where countries rely on domestic production and

regional trade, they are likely to more easily invoke compulsory licenses and negotiate cheaper

medicine prices as they can use their innovative capability as a bargaining tool. However, this will be

countered by the effect of more stringent intellectual property protection, which may limit the

export market for pharmaceutical products from these countries and reduce potential cost savings

regionally.

        The effect in the Sub-Saharan Africa region is likely to be more adverse. Most countries have

until 2016 to become TRIPS-compliant but that is unlikely to have a direct effect on medicine prices

as most countries in the region lack the innovative capability to reverse engineer innovative

medicines for their domestic market. However, given the importance of India as a supplier of

inexpensive medicines, TRIPS is likely to negatively affect the availability of affordable medicines

not only from India but also high-income trading partners through reduced competition from some

generics.

1 There are existing studies that use private datasets but they tend to focus on prices in industrialized countries (Danzon

& Furukawa, 2008; Danzon & Kim, 1998). There is also the Health Action International drug price survey in
collaboration with the WHO but they do not take the source of imports into account and focus on another important
aspect of the issue, the differences at the point-of-purchase across select countries (Cameron, Ewen, Ross-Degnan, Ball,
& Laing, 2009; WHO & HAI, 2003).
2 As, of course, not all medicines imported from developing countries are generic copies of patented drugs, and not all

imports from developed countries are branded drugs, our estimates provide a lower bound of the effect of generics on
branded drugs.
3 The term innovative developing countries refers to those countries that have the capability to reverse engineer innovative

drugs. We hope to draw a distinction between such countries and others that merely manufacture or repackage bulk
formulations through local subsidiaries.
4 A61P would allow us to find patents that are related to specific diseases. For example, A61P 31/06 for drugs that treat

tuberculosis or A61P 33/06 for drugs that treat malaria. Unfortunately, this subclass was introduced in the 7th and 8th
(January 1, 2006) version of IPC and is therefore unavailable for earlier patents. We therefore use only subclass A61K to
generate the patent counts, which does not allow for distinction between innovations for different illnesses without
reading the bibliography of each patent.
5 This is because the importer-reported trade values are recorded as cost, insurance and freight (CIF-type) value—

includes the transaction value of the goods, the value of services performed to deliver the goods to the border of the
exporting country and top the border of the importing country. The exporter-reported values on the other hand, are
free-on-board (FOB-type) and only include the value of services performed to deliver the goods to the border of the
exporting country (United Nations, 2004).
6 We focus on patents granted in the US here because patent data from many individual developing country patent

offices is incomplete. Using the US data gives us complete coverage and focuses on patents applied for under a
common set of patent laws.
7 Unfortunately there are several noticeable gaps in the patent data, some of which have been documented by Inpadoc.

Argentina for example, granted 35 patents in 1992 but none thereafter or in the preceding 1985-1991 period.
8 Note that we also ran models based on imports from different combinations of the six middle-income countries. In

such cases we reconstruct our instruments using the correct combination of countries.
9 For all the regressions presented in Tables 3 and 4, both infant mortality and physicians per capita were included

together or separately as a measure of demand in other regressions (not shown). However, their inclusion did not
substantively change the estimates observed with life expectancy as a measure of demand. We therefore chose to use life
expectancy for which we had a more complete panel of countries and years.
10 In particular, pergenelse, which is intended to identify supply shifts, has almost no explanatory power in this model, with

a t-statistic of just 0.08.
11 Note that in column 4, where we only focus on antibiotics and medicaments, our instruments again perform poorly.

We thus have less confidence in this result, but are comforted by the fact that import share is also insignificant in the full
sample under column 3, where the instruments are valid.
