                                           ABSTRACT

We study the relation between gender and job performance among brokerage firm equity analysts.
Women's representation in analyst positions drops from 16% in 1995 to 13% in 2005. We find women
cover roughly 9 stocks on average compared to 10 for men. Women's earnings estimates tend to be
less accurate. After controlling for forecast characteristics, the difference in accuracy is roughly
equivalent to four years of experience. Despite reduced coverage and lower forecast accuracy, we
find women are significantly more likely to be designated as All-Stars, which suggests they outperform
at other aspects of the job such as client service.

Despite the dramatic reduction in the gender income gap in recent decades, women

remain underrepresented in many high-profile careers. Explanations for this phenomenon

fall into two broad categories. One line of research emphasizes occupational self-

selection due to preferences or differences in abilities (e.g. Polachek, 1981 and Pitts,

2003). Other researchers focus on discrimination in the workplace. Evidence of gender-

based discrimination has been documented in certain fields (e.g. Neumark, 1996 and

Goldin and Rouse, 2000), yet employers’ attempts to offset bias through focused hiring

strategies also raises concerns of reverse discrimination. Does the low representation of

women in many high paying jobs reflect a lower “natural rate” due to preferences, or is it

indicative of discrimination? Because of an emphasis on affirmative action, do employers

reverse discriminate in order to attract more women for the job?

        This study examines the gender composition of sell-side stock analysts in

investment banks and brokerages, and investigates whether employers either

systematically discriminate based on gender, or generally attempt to promote gender

balance through affirmative action. Sell-side analyst positions are well paying jobs where

the average annual salary in 2005 was about $168,000,1 which is well above the per

capita income in the U.S. As with many jobs on Wall Street, a vast majority of analysts

are males, and it is often alleged that women face gender discrimination in such high

profile, well paying jobs. For instance, a 1996 class action law suit against Merrill Lynch

contained over 900 complaints, representing roughly one third of the female brokers who

worked at the company during the previous five years.2 Concerns about potential

discrimination have led many investment banks and other employers to institute hiring

programs to promote diversity. For example, a 2001 survey of investment banks reports

that roughly one third of large investment banks tie their reward systems to diversity

initiatives. An even greater proportion of these banks also specify numerical objectives

for affirmative action recruiting.3

        Although issues of gender discrimination and affirmative action have attracted

considerable attention, we find that the proportion of female stock analysts has

progressively declined over time. For instance, the proportion of female analysts declined

from roughly 16% in 1995 to 13% in 2005. It is important to determine whether this

decline indicates growing discrimination or whether it reflects a shift in women’s career

preferences. It is also important to understand whether employers’ attempts to achieve

gender balance in the workforce compromise the effectiveness of their workforce.

        The essence of gender discrimination is that when faced with a choice between

equally qualified men and women, employers prefer to hire men. As a result, gender

discrimination leads to a higher hurdle being set for women, and hence women who are

able to cross the hurdle would do a better job on average than their male counterparts. On

the other hand, if affirmative action is an important factor in hiring decisions, then

employers may set a lower hurdle for women to promote gender balance. If affirmative

action based hiring is prevalent, women would on average perform worse than men.

        Investment banks are traditionally known for their competitive locker room

mentality and 90-hour work weeks, which women may find less attractive in a general



also faced sex discrimination class action lawsuits in recent years that were backed by the U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.

sense but also for pragmatic family considerations. For example, Niederle and Vesterlund

(2006) find experimental evidence that women dislike competitive environments whereas

men tend to embrace them. If female equity analysts are relatively rare because women

generally do not find that the job matches well with their preferences, then there would be

no difference between the performance of women who do self-select into Wall Street

careers and their male counterparts.

        We analyze the relation between gender and job performance to investigate

whether discrimination and affirmative action are prevalently practiced. Previous

research on gender and job performance is limited to manufacturing workers or relies on

survey data.4 Our study is innovative in that we are able to able to quantify job

performance for thousands of highly paid professionals. Sell side security analysts are

unique in that a key aspect of their job performance can be objectively measured and

evaluated. Analysts’ earnings forecasts are an important component of their research

reports that are emphasized by investors and form the basis for recognition in the media

and among clients. Our analysis examines the role of gender on research output, forecast

accuracy, and professional reputation as measured by the coveted All-American Research

Team designation in Institutional Investor Magazine.

        There are a number of behavioral characteristics that may lead to gender

differences in forecast accuracy. Research from cognitive psychology shows that people

in general are overconfident about their abilities and that men tend to be more

overconfident than women (e.g. Barber and Odean, 2001). As a result, men may be more

willing to deviate from the consensus with their predictions which could lead to less

                                                  3
accurate forecasts on average. On the other hand, Gneezy, Niederle, and Rustichini

(2003) find evidence that competition increases the performance of men but hinders the

performance of women, which could provide men with an advantage in the competitive

arena of investment banking. Moreover, Brown and Josephs (1999) show in experiments

that the “mere suggestion of between-group differences can lead to a self-fulfilling

prophecy in which the threat of failure promotes poor performance among the

stigmatized.” The net effect of these behavioral influences on forecast accuracy is

unclear.

       Our analysis of over 7900 investment bank security analysts reveals several

striking findings. Women account for just 15.6% of analyst positions during our sample

period, with a surprising downward trend from 16.1% in 1995 to 13.9% in 2005. Large

brokerages are noticeably better at attracting women analysts. Women comprise 16.7% of

analyst positions at the top decile of brokerages versus 13.7% at others. At the industry

level, women’s representation is highest among analysts who follow companies in

consumer staples industry (22.5%) and lowest among analysts who cover material

companies (12.2%). Differences in employment longevity across gender are relatively

small. Women are 3.3% more likely to leave their positions within two years, and for

analysts who begin work during 1995-2005, women hold their jobs on average one month

less than men.

       Women cover roughly one less company than men on average, nine stocks

compared with ten covered by men. At the stock level, women and men analysts issue

earnings forecasts with equal frequency. Previous research (e.g. Richardson, Teoh, and

Wysocki 2003) shows that analysts initially make optimistic earnings forecasts and then




                                           4
gradually decrease their estimates to a level the firm can beat by the end of the fiscal

period. We find this pattern holds for both women and men, yet women exhibit

consistently smaller optimism bias than men throughout the forecast period. The

difference in optimism across gender could indicate less overconfidence among women

or a greater desire among men to please the management of the firms they cover.

       Women’s earnings forecasts tend to be less accurate than men’s forecasts. After

controlling for analysts’ and stock characteristics and forecast timing, the magnitude of

the difference in accuracy between men and women is roughly equivalent to the effect of

four years of experience. Despite covering fewer firms and lower forecast accuracy, we

find women are significantly more likely to be designated as All-Stars by Institutional

Investor magazine. Membership on II’s All-American Research Team is based on

thousands of institutional investor surveys and influences analysts’ compensation at many

investment banks. The fact that women cover fewer stocks and are less accurate at

earnings forecasts but are more likely to be designated as All-Stars suggests they may

perform better at non-quantifiable aspects of the job such as client service.

       Taken together, our analysis of job performance supports the view that the low

representation of women on Wall Street reflects differences in preferences or family

considerations rather than discrimination by investment banks. While we do find

significant differences in coverage, accuracy, and professional recognition across gender,

the effects tend to be offsetting, which suggests neither gender-based discrimination nor

affirmative action have a material impact on the quality of women analysts employed by

brokerage firms.

        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 1 describes the data and

provides summary statistics. Section 2 provides evidence on the role of gender on job

performance. Section 3 describes professional recognition across gender, and Section 4

concludes.

1. Data and Descriptive Statistics

        We compile the data from several sources. We obtain data on brokerage firm

analysts’ earnings forecasts for the period from 1995 to 2005 from I/B/E/S. The I/B/E/S

detail files provide data on the security identity, the analyst’s identity, the brokerage

house the analyst belongs to, forecast period information, and the earnings forecast and

forecast date. We focus on quarterly earnings forecasts. The name of the analyst in

I/B/E/S Broker Translation File is listed by last name and first initial. We match the

analyst's information from I/B/E/S with data from the corresponding annual edition (plus

or minus one year) of Nelson’s Directory of Investment Research which contains

analysts' full name and contact information.

        We determine gender using the database on baby names from the Social Security

Administration.5 Of the 10,996 unique analyst names in I/B/E/S during the 1995-2005

sample period, we are able to match 9,096 analysts with information from Nelson's

Directory. We lose 247 observations due to duplicate last name and first initial (e.g. J.

Smith in I/B/E/S could match with either Jennifer Smith or John Smith in Nelson's). We

lose an additional 130 observations due to gender ambiguous first names such as Tracy.


5
  http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/babynames. We examine the top 1000 baby names by gender each
decade beginning in 1880 which results in 4,775 unique names. In order to increase the number of
international names, we augment this list by adding additional data from www.behindthename.com,
www.babynameindex.com, and www.wikipedia.org. With these additional sources, the number of unique
names increase to 21,204.



                                               6
Finally, for 773 observations we match names but are unable to determine gender

because the names do not match the first names from any of our data sources.

        Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for our resulting sample of 7,946 brokerage

firm analysts. Analysts enter the sample in a given year if they make at least one

quarterly earnings forecast in that year. The matching procedure is able to assign gender

to over 70% of the full I/B/E/S sample. When data on first name is available from

Nelson’s, our success at assigning gender is over 90%.

        In the full sample, women account for 15.6% of analyst positions, with an almost

monotonic decrease from 16.1% in 1995 to 13.9% in 2005 as evident in Figure 1.6 The

downward trend is surprising since the general perception is that discrimination is on the

decline and that employers now actively promote gender balance in their hiring policies.

Perhaps representation was lower prior to 1995, but the finding suggests women's

representation among sell side analysts has at best reached a plateau.

        Table 1 also presents the gender composition of analysts in large and small

brokerages. We rank brokerages based on the number of analysts affiliated with that

brokerage in the I/B/E/S database each year and categorize the top 10% of the brokerages

as “large” and the rest as “small.” We find that women comprise 16.7% of analyst

positions at large brokerages compared with 13.7% at other brokerages. Higher

representation of women at large investment banks may reflect a greater emphasis on

diversity as well as well as better working conditions. As noted earlier, large investment



6
  For the full sample we average the percentages for each year. Without controlling for year, women’s
representation in the full sample is 17.2%. This number is higher than the ratio in nine out of ten years,
however, and it overstates women’s representation at any particular point in time because women leave the
analysts’ position more often than men. To illustrate, in a balanced sample with two jobs if women work
one year and men work two years, across two years there will be twice as many women as men in the
sample.

banks are more likely to tie their reward systems to diversity initiatives. They may also be

more likely to provide programs designed to address the needs of women. For example,

Working Mother magazine currently lists several large investment banks on their list of

best companies.7 Evidence on job performance at top firms will help determine if the

higher representation of women is due to their providing better working conditions or

simply a result of quota based hiring.

        Table 1 also presents the proportion of women among analysts covering different

sectors. We use the Global Industry Classification Standards (GICS) to classify firms into

ten sectors. At the industry level, women’s representation is highest among analysts who

follow companies in consumer staples (22.5%) and consumer discretionary (18.3%)

industries. High representation in consumer oriented industries may be natural if these

companies emphasize sales to women. Women analysts are least likely to cover

companies in the materials (12.05%) and energy (12.1%) industries, which cater more to

the industrial market than the consumer market.

2. Gender and Job Performance among Sell-Side Analysts

        This section investigates whether on the job performance of sell-side analysts

differs across gender. Sell-side analysts’ job involves providing research and customer

service to clients. We measure the performance of on the research side by examining the

number of stocks that analysts follow, how frequently they revise their earnings forecasts

and the accuracy of earnings forecasts for up to four quarters ahead. The number of

stocks that analysts follow represents the workload that they carry. The frequency of

                                                 8
forecast revisions provides a measure of how closely analysts follow the stocks that they

cover.

         Other aspects of customer service, such as keeping clients abreast of industry and

firm-specific developments and arranging for meetings between investors and company

management are highly valued by clients, but are hard to quantify. We capture theses

aspects of performance using Institutional Investor’s All-American Research rankings.

Institutional Investor conducts a comprehensive survey of thousands of portfolio

managers, who are the most important brokerage customers, about the quality of service

provided by analysts, and publishes an annual list of All-Star analysts. We use the All-

Star designation as a measure of analysts’ performance of the non-quantifiable aspects of

the job.

2.1 Analyst coverage and employment longevity

         We begin with a look at number of stocks that each analyst covers. We calculate

the number of stocks for which an analyst provides at least one one- to four-quarter ahead

forecast in a particular calendar year as the workload carried by that analyst. Table 2

presents the average number of stocks that analysts cover each calendar year, categorized

by gender. Women cover fewer stocks in each year in the sample, covering 9.1 stocks on

average compared to 10.5 for men. Looking across years, the career average for women

is 12.7 stocks for women versus 16.2 for men. Thus, women appear less likely to take on

coverage of new stocks than men.

         Table 2 shows that analysts at large brokerages tend to cover fewer stocks than

analysts in smaller brokerages. In both large and small brokerages, women cover fewer

stocks than men on average. Therefore, although women are more likely to work in larger



                                             9
brokerages, the differences in stock coverage across gender are not explained by

differences in the size of the employer.

       The finding that men cover more stocks indicates that men analysts carry a larger

workload than women, which may reflect greater demands on women’s time away from

work. Traditionally women have carried a bigger share of family responsibilities and a

reduction in number of firms covered may be a natural way for women to accommodate

greater demands on their time away from work (e.g. Becker, 1985).

       Table 2 also reports frequency of forecast revisions for one-quarter ahead

forecasts within a fiscal quarter. Here the differences across gender are negligible. Each

quarter for each stock, women issue 1.41 one-quarter ahead earnings forecasts on average

whereas men issue 1.40 forecasts. Thus, at the stock level we observe no noticeable

difference in forecast activity across gender.

       We also examine the timing of forecasts. Analysts use a variety of information to

update their earnings estimates. Ivkovic and Jegadeesh (2004) note that forecast revisions

that are made immediately following earnings announcements tend to reflect analysts’

interpretation of the firms’ earnings and other financial information firms release, while

forecasts revisions at other points in time reflect information about the company that

analysts independently gather. The empirical evidence in Ivkovic and Jegadeesh suggests

that the information analysts independently gather is more informative for financial

market participants than analysts’ interpretation of public information releases.

       Figure 2 presents the distribution of forecasts revisions around earnings

announcement dates. Consistent with the evidence in Stickel (1996) and Ivkovic and

Jegadeesh (2004), we find forecasts revisions by both men and women are concentrated




                                             10
within the week after earnings announcements. However, figure 2 shows women are

slightly more likely to issue forecasts in the weeks leading up to the announcement,

which suggests women are more likely to rely on their independent research to revise

their forecasts.

         Another important aspect of job performance is employment longevity.

Investment banks expend considerable effort to develop and support equity analysts and

would prefer to amortize these costs over longer horizons. Table 3 presents measures of

employment longevity for new analysts who begin forecasting in a given calendar year.

The table reports likelihood of leaving their job (i.e. stop forecasting), within one, two,

and three years. The differences in longevity are relatively small. Women are 1.5% more

likely to leave work within one year, 3.3% more likely to leave within two years, and

2.8% more likely to leave within three years. Turning to average tenure, new women

analysts hold their positions roughly one month less than men on average. We truncate

the employment horizon to five years due to the relatively short sample period, which

could underestimate differences in average tenure.8

2.2 Forecast accuracy

         Forecast accuracy is an important measure of equity analysts’ job performance.

Earnings forecast is a key component of analyst research that is emphasized by investors

and forecast accuracy forms an important basis for recognition in the media. Previous

research (e.g. Richardson, Teoh, and Wysocki 2003) documents initially optimistic



8
  Hong and Kubik (2003) measure longevity differently and report that roughly 10% of analysts leave the
sample within one year. They include all analysts in the I/B/E/S database and examine the number of years
they remain in the database. We focus on analysts who newly enter the I/B/E/S data base in a given year
and report the proportion of them who leave within a year. Our measure excludes analysts employed before
1995, and it results in higher exit rates since experienced analysts are less likely to leave their jobs than
new hires. Focusing on new hires is more appropriate for the purposes of this paper.


                                                    11
earnings forecasts that are gradually “walked down” throughout the fiscal period to a

level that the firm can beat. One possible explanation for the initial optimism bias is that

analysts tend to be overconfident about the stocks that they follow and overestimate

future earnings. Another explanation is analysts deliberately produce optimistic forecasts

in order to generate interest in the stock which stimulates trading and leads to brokerage

commissions.

       Analysts tend to gradually reduce their optimistic forecasts as the earnings date

approaches, resulting in mildly pessimistic forecasts on the date of the announcement.

Previous research argues the phenomenon of beatable earnings targets is a result of

guidance from firm management. Skinner and Sloan (2002) report that the stock price

response to disappointing earnings is greater than the response to a similar positive

surprise. They argue that this asymmetric stock price reaction gives managers an

incentive to walk down their earnings guidance during the quarter and analysts follow

managers’ guidance. Cotter, Tuna, and Wysocki (2006) find empirical support that

analysts follow management's earning guidance, and Hutton (2005) documents that

analyst forecasts that are guided by management are more accurate but tend to be more

frequently pessimistic.

       We examine whether the optimism/pessimism bias are different across gender.

We measure forecast error as      ( Forecast i , j ,t − EPS j ) / EPS j   where Forecast i , j ,t is the

forecast from analyst i for stock j on day t, and EPS j is the realized quarterly earnings

per share. A positive forecast error indicates the forecast was optimistic and negative bias

implies a pessimistic forecast. We exclude from the analysis observations where absolute

value of EPS is less than 5 cents and Winsorize forecast errors at plus or minus 100%.



                                               12
       Table 4 presents the results for forecasts at different points in time around

earnings announcements. The table shows that women’s forecasts are significantly less

optimistic than men’s forecasts. Excluding forecasts following earnings announcements,

when revisions may reflect a routine response to news, mean forecast errors are 0.9% for

women compared with 1.7% for men. Both women and men exhibit optimism bias but

women’s forecasts contain significantly smaller optimism bias.

       Partitioning the forecast sample by firm size using the NYSE median reveals that

optimism bias is greater among small firms (2.2% for women versus 3.0% for men). For

large firms the sign of the average bias differs across gender. Excluding announcement

dates, women's forecasts for large firms are pessimistic on average (-0.34%) whereas

men's forecasts tent to be optimistic (0.32%). Figure 3 plots the average forecast errors in

event time around earnings announcements. The chart shows women’s forecasts contain

smaller optimism bias throughout the fiscal quarter. The difference in optimism bias

across gender could indicate less overconfidence among women or a greater desire

among men to please the management of the firms they cover.

       The next set of tests examines the absolute forecast accuracy of women and men.

Forecast accuracy depends on a number of stock specific factors as well as the timing of

the forecast relative to earnings announcement date. For example, forecasts are typically

less accurate for small firms because less information is available to the market. Also,

firms with greater earnings volatility tend to be harder to forecast, and thus forecast

accuracy is negatively related to volatility. Forecasts also become more accurate when

they are made closer to earnings announcements (e.g. Clement, 1999). When we evaluate

the relative forecast accuracy across analysts, we need to control for these factors that are




                                             13
exogenous to the analyst. Our first test of relative forecast accuracy controls for these

factors by examining a matched sample where women and men issue earnings forecasts

for the same stock on the same day.

       Table 5 presents a comparison of the characteristics of the matched sample and

the full sample. We include one- to four-quarter ahead earnings forecasts in the sample.

The matched sample contains all observations where at least one male and one female

analyst issued a forecast for the same stock and fiscal quarter, on the same day. The

matched sample contains 147,458 forecasts made by 1,084 women, and 345,687 forecasts

made by 4,454 men. The matched sample represents about 70% of the analysts and 17%

of the earnings forecasts from the full sample.

       Table 5 also presents the average size decile rank of the firms in the matched

sample and the full sample. We assign a size decile ranks based on the size distribution of

stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). We assign a rank of 1 to firms in

the smallest size decile, 2 to the next size decile and so on. The mean NYSE size decile is

4.98 for the matched sample versus 3.45 for the full sample. Since the matched sample

requires forecasts from two analysts on the same day, stocks in this sample tend to be

larger than the stocks in the full sample.

       We measure relative forecast error as:

                       1              Forecast f , j ,t − EPS j       1              Forecast m , j ,t − EPS j
                           ∑                                              ∑
                               F                                              M
          RFE j ,t =           f =1
                                                                  −           m =1
                                                                                                                 (1)
                       F                       EPS j                  M                       EPS j

where Forecast f , j ,t is the quarterly earnings forecast made by female analyst f for stock j

on day t, and EPS j is the realized earnings per share for the stock. F is the number of

forecasts by female analysts on day t and M is the number of forecasts by male analysts



                                                          14
on day t. When there are forecasts made by either multiple female analysts or multiple

male analysts, we consider each forecast as a separate observation. A positive relative

forecast error indicates than women’s earnings estimates are less accurate.

        Table 6 reports average relative forecast errors for the matched sample.9 Across

forecasts horizons the relative error is 0.11%. As we discussed earlier, forecasts that

analysts issue immediately after earnings announcement tend to present analysts’

interpretation of financial data released by the company, while earnings forecasts made

on other days tend to use information that analysts’ privately gather. Table 6 also

separately reports the relative accuracy of forecasts made on the earnings announcement

day and the following day, and the accuracy of forecasts made on other days. The

forecasts made immediately after earnings announcement are about equally accurate

equal across gender, but women’s forecasts on other days are about 0.19% less accurate.

When partitioning the sample by forecast horizon, the results are only statistically

significant for two and three quarters ahead forecasts.

        Differences in forecast accuracy may be explained by differences in experience or

other analyst characteristics. We examine the relation between gender and forecast

accuracy while controlling for forecast characteristics using the regression approach

similar to Clement (1999). We compute standardized proportional errors as:

                                                    AFEi , j ,t − AFE j ,t
                                  PMAFEi , j ,t =                                                    (2)
                                                          AFE j ,t

where AFEi , j ,t is the absolute forecast error for analyst i’s forecast of firm j for quarter t,

and AFE j ,t is the mean absolute forecast error for firm j for period t across all analysts.

 Table 6 reports fewer observations than Table 5. Table 6 analyzes forecast days averaged across analysts
whereas Table 5 reports the number of individual forecasts.


                                                    15
PMAFE represents analyst i’s proportional forecast error relative to the average of the

analysts absolute forecast errors for firm j in quarter t. Positive values of PMAFE reflect

worse than average performance and negative values reflect better than average

performance. We Winsorize PMAFE at 100%.

       PMAFE controls for firm and quarter effects by adjusting errors by their related

firm-quarter means. Firm-quarter effects allow for the difficulty of predicting earnings to

vary over time, which may occur due to corporate events such as mergers or acquisitions

or more simply due to changes in managements’ earning guidance.

       We then regress the proportional forecast errors on analyst characteristics

according to the following specification:

         PMAFEi , j ,t = b0 + b1 AGEi , j ,t + b2GEXPi ,t + b3 FEXPi , j ,t + b4 NCOSi ,t + ...
                                                                                                  (3)
                        b5 NGICi ,t + b6TOP10i ,t + b7 ALLSTARi ,t + b8GENDERi + ei , j ,t .

AGEi , j ,t is the number of days between the forecast date and the earnings announcement

date, and it measures forecast staleness. GEXPi ,t measures the general experience of the

analyst, and it equals the number of years analyst i has supplied at least one forecast on

I/B/E/S up to quarter t. FEXPi , j ,t is a firm-specific measure of the analyst's experience

and it equals the number of years analyst i has made at least one forecast for firm j up to

quarter t. NCOSi ,t and NGICi ,t are the number of companies and industries (measured by

two-digit GIC code) followed by the analyst, and they reflect the complexity of the

analyst’s portfolio. TOP10i ,t is 1 if the analyst is employed by a Top decile brokerage

firm (by number of analysts employed) and it captures differences access to brokerage

firm resources. ALLSTARi ,t is 1 if the analyst is a member of Institutional Investor’s All-

American Research Team in year t-1. Finally, GENDERi is 1 if the analyst is female and

0 if male. Similar to PMAFE, we adjust the independent variables by subtracting firm-

                                                                            (           )
quarter means. The resulting model takes the form yi , j ,t − y j ,t = xi , j ,t − x j ,t b .10

         Table 7 reports the regression results. Across horizons, women produce

proportional forecast errors that are 0.49% higher than men. Controlling for analyst

characteristics produces larger differences in accuracy across gender than the univariate

results in Table 6. For example, women are more likely to cover fewer stocks and work at

top brokerage firms. These characteristics typically lead to more accurate forecasts and

thus in the regression framework women are held to a higher standard.

         The regression framework also provides a means to interpret the economic

significance of the result. For example, the difference in accuracy across gender is on par

with the incremental accuracy exhibited by All Star analysts (-0.41%) and is roughly

equivalent to the effects of four years of firm specific experience (-0.52). The results are

generally consistent when the sample is broken down by forecast quarter, and are

stronger when examining the matched sample.

         Taken together, the findings in this section indicate that women tend to produce

less optimistic forecasts than men, and their forecasts tend to be less accurate than the

forecasts of male analysts. The difference in accuracy is not large, but is similar in

magnitude to the effects of other analyst characteristics examined in the literature such as

experience and All-Star status.

3. Gender and Professional Recognition among Sell-Side Analysts



10
  The approach is similar to using firm-year dummies to control for firm-year effects. See Clement (1999)
for more details.


                                                    17
       The previous section documents differences across gender in stock coverage,

employment longevity, and forecast accuracy. In this section we present an additional

measure of job performance that captures non-quantifiable aspects of performance.

       It is difficult to objectively measure qualitative aspects of job performance across

employees from a number of different organizations. Fortunately, for brokerage firm

analysts, Institutional Investor magazine (II) surveys roughly 2000 institutional investors

each summer for their opinions on sell-side analysts. Based on the survey, II publishes a

list of analysts that it designates as members of the All-American Research Team (All-

Stars) each year in its October issue.

       Institutional investors are the most important customers of sell-side analysts.

Money management firms typically allocate their soft dollar commissions based on their

internal surveys about the research services of various brokerages. The II survey

represents the collective opinions of these brokerage clients, and in fact Stickel (1992)

reports that brokerage houses base analysts’ compensation on their All-Star status.

Therefore, we use II All-Star designation by brokerages as our measure of analysts’

overall job performance.

       We examine whether the likelihood of All-Star status varies by gender, after

controlling for other factors. We utilize a logistic regression to examine the determinants

of All-Star status. In addition to the analyst characteristics in Equation (3), we include a

measure of relative forecast accuracy similar to Hong and Kubik (2003). Each quarter for

each stock analysts are ranked according to their absolute forecast errors using the

following accuracy score:




                                            18
                                           ⎡      Rank j ,t − 1          ⎤
                     Scorei , j ,t = 100 − ⎢                             ⎥ × 100,       (4)
                                           ⎣ Number of Analysts j ,t − 1 ⎦

where Rank equals 1 (2) for the analyst who produces the best (second best) quarterly

forecast for firm j in quarter t, etc., and Number of Analystsj,t is the number of analysts

who cover the firm in quarter t. An analyst with a rank of 1 receives a score of 100; the

least accurate analyst receives a score of 0. We assign scores only when at least two

analysts make earnings forecast for a particular fiscal quarter. Measuring accuracy in this

way controls for differences in difficulty in forecasting earnings across firms. We average

quarterly accuracy scores across stocks over the last three years as of March each year,

and use this as our measure of accuracy ACCURACYi ,t for analyst i in year t. The

resulting logistic regression specification is:

                 ALLSTARi ,t = b0 + b1GEXPi ,t + b2 NCOSi ,t + b3 NGICi ,t + ...
                                                                                        (5)
                               +b4TOP10i ,t + b5 ACCURACYi ,t + b7GENDERi .

In addition to a measure of forecast accuracy, we include the analyst characteristics from

Equation (3). The link between employer status as a top decile brokerage firm and all-

star membership is ambiguous. Analysts who work at large brokerage firms tend to be

more visible which could help make them all-stars. On the other hand, large firms tend to

attract better analysts in which case they could naturally become all-stars. Thus, Table 8

presents the results with and without TOP10.

        Unconditionally, the likelihood of being an All-Star for women is 8.78% versus

7.99% for men. The logistic results in Table 8 confirm this disparity. After controlling for

experience and accuracy, being a women analyst raises the marginal likelihood of All-

Star status by 2.36%. Further controlling for employer status reduces the incremental



                                                 19
probability to 1.04%. Expressed in terms of the unconditional likelihood, being a woman

raises the chances of being designated as an All-Star by Institutional Investor magazine

by more than 10 percent.

       The fact that women cover fewer stocks and are less accurate at earnings forecasts

but are more likely to be designated as All-Stars suggests they perform better at non-

quantifiable aspects of performance such as client service. In addition to research reports,

analyst attributes surveyed as important by institutional investors include industry

knowledge, integrity, responsiveness, management access, communication skills, and

management of conflicts of interest (see Johnson, 2005). Some criticize the rankings as

having a popularity contest element to them (e.g. Emery and Li, 2005), and to the extent

that women are relatively rare it may improve their visibility among clients. However,

greater visibility among market participants may have real effects on job performance

such as better access to firm management.

4. Conclusions

       Women have historically been underrepresented in many high profile and

lucrative careers. The reasons for such under representation range from differences in

preferences and abilities to gender discrimination. Many employers have instituted

affirmative action programs to encourage gender balance in hiring decisions.

       This paper examines the gender composition and job performance of sell-side

analysts. Our study investigates the relative abilities across gender on various aspects of a

sell-side analysts’ job and sheds light on whether gender discrimination or affirmative

action are evident in on the job performance.




                                             20
       We find women cover roughly one less stock than men, and tend to forecast less

accurately on average than their male counterparts. On the other hand, after controlling

for experience and accuracy, we find women significantly are more likely to be

designated by Institutional Investor magazine as members of the All-American Research

Team which indicates women may be better at non-quantifiable aspects of job

performance such as client service.

       Taken together, our analysis supports the view that the low representation of

women on Wall Street reflects differences in preferences rather than discrimination by

investment banks. While we do find significant differences in performance across gender,

the effects tend to be offsetting which indicates neither gender-based discrimination nor

affirmative action have a material impact on the quality of women analysts employed by

brokerage firms.

       While critics often argue that affirmative action programs set lower standard for

preferred groups, our findings do not support this view. However, we also find that any

affirmative action programs for analysts that are currently in place are not effective in

promoting gender balance since the proportion of female analysts have gradually

declined over time. To the extent that lower female representation reflects greater

demands on their time due to family obligation, improvements in working conditions,

such as greater flexibility in work loads and enhanced childcare options, will open the

door to greater participation by women. Also, greater emphasis on the qualitative factors

of job performance emphasized in the All-Star surveys would enhance gender balance.

The table reports a measure of forecast optimism in the earnings forecasts of brokerage firm analysts. Forecast bias is measured as (Forecast – EPS)/EPS, where
Forecast is the one-quarter ahead quarterly earnings forecast and EPS is the realized earnings per share. p-values reflect t-tests for difference in means and are
rounded to two digits. Stocks are partitioned using the median size among NYSE stocks. The analyst data is from I/B/E/S and Nelson’s Directory of Investment
Research.

Absolute forecast errors, measured as |(Forecast – EPS)/EPS|, are regressed on forecast characteristics. In the Matched Sample forecasts are matched across
gender by stock and day. AGE is a measure of staleness for the forecast, GEXP and FEXP is the number of years the analyst has issued forecasts (forecasts for
the stock in question), NCOS and NGICS are the number of companies and industries followed by the analyst. TOP-BRK is 1 if the analyst works at a top decile
brokerage firm by number of analysts, and ALL-STAR is 1 if the analyst is designated as an All-Star by Institutional Investor magazine, and GENDER is 1 if the
