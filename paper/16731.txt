If Drug Treatment Works So Well, Why Are So Many Drug Users in Prison?

                                             ABSTRACT

This paper examines the effectiveness of drug courts to reduce the size of the incarcerated drug-offending
population using data from the Survey of Inmates in State Correctional Facilities and the Survey of
Inmates in Local Jails. We find that very few of those entering state prison in 2004 or jail in 2002 would
have been eligible for drug diversion through state drug courts. The policy implication is that drug
courts and other diversion programs require substantial redesign if they are to contribute to a reduction
in the incarcerated population.

       Drug use, and drug sales, play central roles in the history of American crime. One cannot

discuss crime in America in the 1970s without reference to the heroin epidemic nor in the 1980s

and early 1990s without reference to powder and crack cocaine. The highly punitive regime in

place now for drug offenders is largely a response to the association of these epidemics with

crime waves.

       Yet these drug epidemics unfolded a long time ago, with apparently low rates of initiation

into drug dependence in recent years. From the vantage point of 2011, one might think that that

these drugs no longer matter much, and that dependent drug use plays a smaller role in crime and

criminal justice policy than it did ten or twenty years ago. In fact, however, data from many

sources (some described below) indicate that those arrested or incarcerated within the American

criminal justice system remain heavily involved in the consumption of illicit drugs.

       There is abundant evidence that inducing criminal offenders to halt or reduce their

substance use would reduce crime. Policymakers, researchers, and advocates have long argued

that broader provision of substance abuse treatment could reduce the number of Americans

behind bars.

       In fact, however, a major component of the relentless growth in the U.S. incarcerated

population over the last 35 years has been the rising number of people imprisoned for drug

offenses, (Blumstein et al. 1999) a figure that rose from 42,000 in 1980 to 481,000 in 2002

(Caulkins and Chandler 2006). Most of this incarceration burden falls on people who were

involved in supplying drugs, albeit sometimes in minor roles (Sevigny and Caulkins 2004). In

addition, a large number of those incarcerated for both drug and nondrug offenses appear to

satisfy screening criteria for drug use disorders. Many are dependent on cocaine, heroin, or
methamphetamine; there is reasonable evidence that their drug use has a causal role in their

criminality (MacCoun et al. 2003).

       Substance abuse treatment provides a highly imperfect response to these problems.

During any given treatment episode, the typical client is likely to continue some level of

substance use. Relapse is the norm rather than the exception as a treatment outcome. Even so, at

the individual level, there is compelling evidence that treatment markedly reduces both drug use

and related criminal offending. Imperfect treatment works. This is just as well, since it describes

the treatment we have.

       An array of programs have developed over the last twenty years based on this evidence

base, and more broadly on the well-documented premise that reducing drug use leads to large

reductions in the individual offender’s crime rate. The list of programs includes drug courts,

other forms of diversion from the criminal justice system into treatment (e.g., Prop 36 in

California), intensive supervision probation, and in-prison treatment. All these aim to reduce the

extent of criminality among those who have already developed drug abuse or dependency by

encouraging/coercing offenders into treatment. A substantial research literature shows that

treatment does reduce both drug use and associated criminal activity. In addition to such

programs, there is growing recent interest in “coerced abstinence” or “mandated desistance”

interventions, whereby drug-involved offenders under criminal justice supervision in

noncustodial settings (parole, probation, and pre-trial supervision) are subject to short,

immediate, and graduated penalties for detected drug use (Kleiman 2009).

       Despite this array of efforts, there has been no decline in the incarceration of drug users

for either drug offenses or for other criminal activities. The number incarcerated for drug

offenses has increased every year since 1980 (Caulkins and Chandler 2006). We show later in
this paper that the number of state prisoners with drug problems also increased substantially

from 1986 to 2004, extending analyses of CASA (2002) and Mumola and Karberg (2006),

(Mumola and Karberg 2006; Belenko et al. 2002). We find strikingly similar patterns within the

increasingly important population incarcerated in local jails.

        Both of these findings are rather surprising, since the number of individuals with

expensive illegal drug habits who are not incarcerated was estimated to have declined in the

period 1988-2000, the most recent year for which a published estimate is available, (Office of

National Drug Control Policy 2001) and there are some indicators that the decline may have

continued. This would suggest that there are fewer sellers as well as fewer users to lock up.

        Why has the U.S. achieved such limited success in getting criminal offenders to curtail

their drug use? Put slightly differently, why is it so difficult to replicate at the population level

the substantial reductions in drug use and criminal offending that treatment appears capable of

achieving for individual offenders. Why aren't more offenders in treatment? And why have

diversion programs such as California's Proposition 36 and drug courts proved relatively

disappointing in achieving their stated goals?

        We hypothesize that there are two main reasons for the continued large numbers of drug

users flowing into, and remaining within, the correctional system:

        First, eligibility criteria for diversion programs, particularly for drug courts, are

restrictive. Although the various programs are effective and even cost-effective in serving the

specific clients they recruit, they make only a small contribution at the population level. The

diverted offenders are at low risk of going to prison or even jail (following sentencing, as

opposed to pre-trial) in the absence of the drug court intervention. Given limited capacity and the
relatively low-risk populations actually served, the currently-deployed model of drug courts is

unlikely to notably reduce prison populations.

       A second, related pattern also hinders the effectiveness of these interventions. There is a

systematic mismatch between sentencing practices and actual criminal careers among drug-

involved offenders. As individual criminally-active drug users get older, the system treats them

increasingly harshly for each successive offense. They have longer criminal histories, longer

records of unsuccessful treatment, and worse employment histories. Thus, not only are they less

eligible for diversion programs, these offenders also receive longer sentences, increasing the

share of the incarcerated population with drug problems.

       The empirical contribution of this paper primarily concerns the first of these conjectures.

In particular, we examine what share of those currently incarcerated would have been eligible for

drug courts with the least restrictive entry criteria. We have not been able to find data that allows

testing of the effect of the potentially lengthening criminal careers of dependent drug users.

       To test the hypothesis about the ineffectiveness of drug courts to reduce the size of the

incarcerated drug-offending population, we make use of the Survey of Inmates in State

Correctional Facilities (SISCF) and the Survey of Inmates in Local Jails (SILJ), two Bureau of

Justice Statistics (BJS) occasional surveys. Both provide self-reports on, inter alia, criminal

activity and substance use from nationally representative samples of inmates; the Prison survey

has been conducted six times between 1974 and 2004 (with federal inmates surveyed only in the

1997 and 2004 studies), while the Jail survey has been conducted six times between 1972 and

2002. We find that, indeed, very few of those entering state prison in 2004 or jail in 2002 would

have been eligible for diversion through state courts. That this is true for local jails is much more
surprising than the prison finding. This pattern provides a reminder that, even late in the

incarceration boom, it is not so easy to get incarcerated, conditional on arrest.

       There are two reasons for the findings about drug courts. First, many entering prison and

jail (whether drug users or not) were on supervised release (parole or probation) at the time of

their latest arrest, which automatically made them ineligible for most drug court interventions.

Second, and more interestingly, most of those who were arrested do novo and who had drug use

patterns making them potential clients for drug court, had long, relatively serious criminal

records that would have made them ineligible under current conditions. Drug use itself may lead

to more intense or longer criminal careers. Moreover, many of those dependent on expensive

drugs (cocaine, crack, heroin and methamphetamine) became drug users a long time ago. These

populations are aging, which is not true of nondrug-using criminal offenders. In effect, what we

are seeing is two distinct trends in the incarcerated population, separated by drug use.

       We also present three other policy-relevant descriptive findings:

       First, it is useful to compare the number of dependent drug users entering treatment with

the number entering prison. Both in 1986 and 2004, these figures are approximately comparable;

the U.S. is locking up about as many drug addicts as it is treating, a troubling observation about

the nation’s drug policies.

       Second there are indications that drug dependence is less prevalent among younger

offenders than in cohorts that are twenty years older. Absent a new drug epidemic or a newly

invigorated drug war, there is a predictable end in sight to the growth of drug-related prisoners.

       Third, for drug using prisoners, the probability of a violent offense declines sharply with

age after 35.
       This last observation leads us to our principal policy suggestion, which needs further

investigation. Diversion programs of all kinds require substantial redesign if they are to

contribute to a reduction in the incarcerated population. Experienced drug users, who account for

an increasing share of drug-related crime, are not attractive (or eligible) candidates for many

current efforts. However if one is willing to take a very long-term social welfare perspective, it

may be worth introducing courts specifically designed for the long-term user. Our finding that

aging drug users commit relatively few violent crimes is helpful here. The risks associated with

treatment-oriented community supervision of older offenders are therefore less than one likely

encounters in younger drug-using cohorts.

       The paper begins with three review sections. Section 1 describes the changing patterns of

drug misuse in the U.S. over the last forty years, which is necessary to understand the challenge

now facing the criminal justice system. Section 2 follows with a review of what is known about

the effectiveness of drug treatment in reducing crime at the individual level. Section 3 briefly

discusses interventions aimed at diverting drug-involved offenders from incarceration, such as

drug courts, Prop 36 (the largest diversion program in operation, even though it is restricted to

California alone), and coerced abstinence/mandated desistence in Hawaii. Section 4 presents our

empirical analysis of the surveys of jail and state prison inmates, showing the limited potential

impact of drug courts under current eligibility rules. Section 5 presents our conclusions.



1. Background: The Changing Demography of Drug Misuse

       The dynamics of drug-related incarceration in the U.S. should be examined in light of

broader societal trends in drug use and dependence over the last forty years. The characteristics
of the drug using population, particularly those dependent on expensive drugs, has changed in

ways that complicate the task of keeping criminally active drug users out of prison.



Drug Epidemics

       The nation has experienced four major drug-specific epidemics in that period; heroin (ca.

1968-73), cocaine powder (ca. 1975-1985), crack cocaine (ca. 1982-1988), and

methamphetamine (ca. 1990-2000). In an epidemic process, rates of initiation rise sharply as new

and socially contagious users of a drug initiate friends and peers, a model first well developed by

Hunt and Chambers (1976).

       In the case of heroin, there is much evidence of a sudden elevation of initiation rates

during the late 1960s and early 1970s, followed by a rapid incidence decline over the 1970s and

1980s (Kozel and Adams 1986; Rocheleau and Boyum 1994). A study of an early 1990s sample

of street heroin users also found evidence of sharply peaked initiation rates in the late 1960s and

early 1970s. For cocaine powder the rise was similarly rapid but decline was not so pronounced

as with heroin (Everingham 1994). For crack cocaine the epidemic was still later, starting

between about 1982 and 1986, depending on the city (Cork 1999). Caulkins et al. (2004)

reported estimates of annual cocaine initiation using the NHSDA and a variety of methods; all

show a peak in 1980 followed by a decline of two thirds in the next five years.

       A new class of epidemiologic models has been developed by Caulkins and collaborators,

(Caulkins et al. 2004; Caulkins 2007) which use diverse data to document the long trajectory of

drug epidemics. After the peak, the initiation rate does not return to its original zero level but

falls to a rate well below the peak. Under reasonable assumptions, the result is a flow of new

users who do not fully replace those lost through desistance, death, or incarceration. Thus, the
number of active users declines gradually over time. Moreover, the drug-using population ages

with corresponding changes in the health, employment, and crime consequences of substance

use.

       Some evidence for this characterization can be seen in the changing characteristics of

drug users in TEDS (the Treatment Episode Data System) which includes data on admissions to

treatment programs that receive federal funds. We do not report changes in the National

Household Survey on Drug Abuse/National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NHSDA/NSDUH)

because these include so few dependent users.1

       For TEDS we are able to compare the admission cohort of 1992 with that of 2006; these

two years are the earliest and latest for which detailed data are available. By 1992 all but the

methamphetamine epidemics had run their course but the cocaine and crack epidemics were

relatively recent, so many of the users showing up for treatment were still young adults. Figure 1,

computed using 1992 and 2006 TEDS data, displays changes in the age distribution of adult

clients admitted into substance abuse treatment who reported cocaine-related disorders.

                                        Insert Figure 1 here

       In the 1992 data, 40% of clients were under the age of 30. By 2006, that figure had

dropped to 26%. The fraction of clients over the age of 40 rose from 15% to 47% over the same

period. This was not the consequence of an epidemic of new use among older individuals; rather

it represented the aging of those who were caught in the earlier epidemics.

       We observed a more complex pattern within the population of admitted heroin users. As

shown in Figure 2, the over-45 population displayed a similar pattern to that found in the

population of cocaine users. Yet there was also a substantial population of admitted heroin users

below the age of 30.
                                       Insert Figure 2 here

       The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) shows similar patterns of the aging of

cocaine and heroin users appearing in emergency departments or as overdoses examined by

medical examiners, through 2002.

       The result of this epidemiology is that the demography of drug misuse changed

substantially between the early 1990s and the 2000s. The average age of drug users increased

markedly, with a more diverse set of primary drugs of abuse.

       These data suggest that current service utilization reflects the long-term reverberation of

specific epidemics of cocaine and heroin use in the United States. They also matter for the

criminal justice system.

       The only published estimates, distributed by the Office of National Drug Control Policy

in 2001, of the numbers of dependent cocaine and heroin users cover the period 1988-2000

(Office of National Drug Control Policy 2001). Figure 3 presents these figures, which rely

heavily on ADAM, showing a substantial decline, about one-third for each drug, over these 12

years. Both the data and the estimation methodology are weak, as indicated by the frequent

adjustment in single year estimates in successive series published by the same research group

over the period 1995-2000. For example, ONDCP’s immediate preceding version of the

estimates had shown an increase in heroin use in the early 1990s, followed by a rapid decline

(Office of National Drug Control Policy 2000).

                                       Insert Figure 3 here

       Some of the decline in these estimates may represent the consequence of increased

incarceration, since those in prison are not eligible for the ADAM sampling frame. Assume for

the purposes of a rough calculation that the share of state prison inmates who would be classified
as cocaine- or heroin-dependent prior to entering prison rose from 40% of the 557,000 in 1988 to

50% of the 1,182,000 in 20002. That would have removed roughly 300,000 dependent cocaine

and heroin users from the pool on which these estimates are based. Other trends may also

account for some of the observed decline. For example, almost 200,000 injection drug users have

died of HIV/AIDS.

       Although these trends are important for many reasons, they account for less than one-

third of the total decline (from 5.2 million in 1988 to 3.3 million in 2000). The best interpretation

of the available data is that the number of individuals dependent on or abusing expensive drugs

has been declining for a long period for a variety of reasons. The population of such users has

aged, presumably reducing their involvement in violent crime.



2. Drug Treatment

       Though the research has been critiqued by the National Research Council, (Manski et al.

2001), a substantial body of evidence indicates that substance abuse treatment is associated with

large reductions in drug use and crime, especially during the period in which the individual drug

user is in treatment. U.S. and British observational cohort studies document the strong

association between treatment receipt and increased employment, improved health outcomes,

and reduced criminal offending.

       For example, Godfrey, Stewart, and Gossop (2004) reported two-year outcome data for

549 drug users enrolled in the British National Treatment Outcome Research Study (NTORS)

(Godfrey et al. 2004). Expenditures on substance abuse treatment for these individuals totaled

7.3 million British pounds. Economic valuation of treatment-associated crime reduction totaled

27.4 million pounds for the same group. A 4-5 year follow-up indicated reductions in the
frequency of heroin, street methadone, and benzodiazepines (Gossop et al. 2003). Crack cocaine

and alcohol use were not significantly different after 4-5 years from the corresponding values at

intake. Analyzing the same data, Gossop, Trakada, Stewart, and Witton (2005) found substantial

reductions in acquisitive, drug selling, and violent crimes. Crime reductions were associated with

reduced regular heroin use, simple aging, and living in stable housing.

       Similar results were observed with U.S. data collected by the Drug Abuse Treatment

Outcome Study (DATOS). Hubbard et al. (1997) reported that clients able to remain in long-term

residential treatment for at least six months exhibited a 50% reduction in illegal activity and a

10% increase in full-time employment. Koenig et al. (2005) and Ettner et al. (2006) observed

similar patterns among treatment clients in Cuyahoga County, Ohio and California, respectively.

Both of the latter papers reported strongly positive net benefits from treatment, with reductions

in criminal offending accounting for the majority of the observed economic benefit associated

with treatment intervention.

       Prendergast and colleagues provide one widely-cited meta-analysis of these effects

(Predergast et al. 2002). These authors examined results from 78 studies completed between

1965 and 1996. Twenty-five of these analyses also examined crime outcomes; 46 featured

randomized study designs. These authors found that treatment was associated with reduced drug

use (effect size = 0.30) and reduced crime (effect size = 0.13).

       In examining the impact of treatment on crime, reduced substance use appeared to be the

critical mediating variable, with reduced substance use inducing lower rates of acquisitive crime.

The average age of participating drug users was the only significant predictor of effect size, with

treatment having a larger absolute impact in reducing crime among young adults (who are the

most criminally active) than among older drug users.
       Some of the strongest findings for outpatient treatment arise in the arena of methadone

maintenance therapy. For example, Amato et al. (2005) found that methadone maintenance

therapy reduces criminality by as much as 60%. The findings from a long-term cohort study of

heroin users by Hser and colleagues finds similar results for a particularly recalcitrant heroin-

using population (Hser et al. 2001).

       Retention and treatment outcomes among opiate users appear sensitive to specific quality

measures (D’Aunno and Pollack 2002). For example, methadone maintenance clients were

markedly more likely to remain in treatment (AOR = 1.72) when methadone doses exceeded 60

mg/day (Bao et al. 2009).

       Many studies of opiate substitution therapy (OST) indicate a strong negative correlation

between treatment engagement and retention on the one hand and criminal offending on the

other. Campbell et al. (2007) examined arrest rates among Washington State opiate users. These

authors found significantly reduced probability of arrest among treatment participants. Burdon et

al. (2004) found quite similar results among California offenders participating in prison aftercare.

       Given these strong relationships, both state and federal prisons sought to increase

treatment provision to drug-involved offenders (Grella et al. 2007; Taxman et al. 2007). Most

such services are low-intensity education and counseling services, which probably have a limited

impact on criminal offending or drug use. More intensive residential modalities have also been

implemented in prison, with greater evidence that treatment participants achieved better

outcomes than comparison group members (Prendergast et al. 2004). However, because

motivated individuals are more likely to enter and remain in treatment, many of the observed

differences between treatment and comparison groups probably reflect favorable selection into

treatment.
       Given the possibility—indeed the reality—of strong selection effects, randomized trials

are especially important in evaluating the causal impact of treatment interventions. In one recent

Australian study, Dolan et al. (2005) compared reincarceration, treatment mortality, and hepatitis

C infection rates among opiate-dependent prison inmates randomly assigned to methadone

maintenance and to a control group. Members of the treatment group displayed lower incidence

of hepatitis C. Yet assignment to the treatment group appeared to provide little benefit in terms

of long-term treatment retention.

       In several recent papers, Gordon et al. (2008) and Kinlock and colleagues examined drug

and crime outcomes of 211 heroin-dependent Baltimore prisoners who were randomly assigned

to methadone maintenance or a control-group counseling intervention (Gordon et al. 2008;

Kinlock et al. 2007; Kinlock et al. 2008; Kinlock et al. 2009). Offenders offered methadone

maintenance shortly after release were significantly less likely to use heroin/cocaine or engage in

criminal activity compared to those assigned to the control group.

       A randomized trial by McMillan et al. (2008) yielded less favorable findings. Offering

opiate-dependent inmates methadone maintenance within the jail setting appeared to confer little

benefit absent an effective post-release intervention.

       Outside the arena of opiate substitution therapy, the strongest evaluation results arise in

establishing the benefits of therapeutic communities. For example, McCollister et al. (2005)

conducted a five-year follow-up study examining the Amity in-prison therapeutic community

and an accompanying Vista aftercare program for criminal offenders in southern California

(McCollister et al. 2004).

       The average cost of addiction treatment over the baseline and five-year follow-up period

was $7,041 for the intervention group and $1,731 for the control group. However, the treatment
group experienced 81 fewer incarceration days than was observed within the control group. This

13 percent reduction in incarceration more than offset the additional costs of the relatively

intensive intervention.3

       Evaluations of outpatient drug-free interventions yield more mixed results. In the case of

cocaine, a meta-analysis of research on interventions aimed at dependent users of a variety of

drugs, few of whom were in methadone maintenance, found that those in treatment were about

20% more likely to have positive outcomes with respect to criminality than those who did not

enter treatment (Prendergast and Burdon 2002). Even though most who enter treatment will

relapse to drug use and/or fail to complete their treatment, it is still true that treatment can make

a large difference in the lifetime drug use and criminality of a dependent user.

       These large differences in criminal offending lead to correspondingly large impacts in

cost-benefit analyses of substance abuse treatment. Substance abuse treatment is associated with

many economic benefits. Yet crime reduction is consistently the largest single component of the

economic benefit of treatment (Dismuke et al. 2004; Sindelar et al. 2004; French et al. 2002;

McCollister and French 2003). Indeed the economic benefits of treatment-associated crime

reductions are often larger than all other estimated benefits, combined.

       The economic valuation of treatment-related crime reduction frequently exceeds, by

itself, the entire cost of providing substance abuse treatment. In one prominent analysis of

cocaine-dependent clients, Flynn et al. (1999) examined treatment clients’ self-reported crime

before and after treatment, finding that the economic value of an associated reduction in crime

far exceeded the associated treatment costs.

       Such findings are doubly striking because most studies in the empirical treatment

literature understate the true social benefits associated with reduced crime. Most studies consider
the tangible costs of crime—its direct costs to victims and to the health care and the criminal

justice systems. The tangible cost approach provides a valuable lower bound to the benefits of

crime reduction. However, such costs are a small fraction of the overall social costs of crime

(Rajkumar and French 1997). Flynn et al. (1999) cite tangible costs of $1,304 per burglary. By

contrast, Cohen et al. (2004) obtain a per burglary cost estimate of $31,000 using contingent

valuation methodologies that capture a broader range of crime consequences and societal

preferences (Cohen et al. 2004).

       Basu et al. (2008) perform a (non-experimental) pre-post analysis of U.S. treatment data

from the National Treatment Improvement and Evaluation Study (NTIES) that illustrates the

importance of these valuation measures. Using conservative econometric specifications that were

biased against a finding of treatment effectiveness, these authors show that the monetized value

of treatment-related reductions in armed robbery more than offset the cost of the entire treatment

intervention. This finding is especially striking when one considers that less than 7% of NTIES

respondents reported committing an armed robbery in the year before treatment admission.

Moreover, only 32% of these robbery offenders reported ever being arrested for using a weapon

or force to steal from a victim.

       In terms of absolute numbers, substance abuse treatment providers serve a large and

diverse population of substance users. As shown in Table 1, the number of individuals in drug

treatment for cocaine or heroin abuse has risen slightly since 1997; e.g. TEDS data indicate

admissions of 235,000 in 1997 for heroin, compared to 246,000 in 2005. Given that the

estimated size of the population of dependent users has if anything shrunk, this indicates that the

treatment fraction has increased. The figure for methamphetamine admissions almost tripled

during the same period.

3. Drug Use and Crime

       The criminally active population continues to show high rates of drug misuse, another

indication that treatment has, at the population level, failed to reduce the connection between

crime and drug use.

       For this population, ADAM provides the major source for insights into the connection

between crime and drug use. ADAM includes data on drug use, both through interview and

urinalysis, from a sample of arrestees in a number of counties around the country. Prior to 1998

we must rely on DUF (the Drug Use Forecasting) system, a statistically more primitive version

of ADAM but one which turns out to provide data of comparable quality. When ADAM was

operating most broadly, from 1998 to 2003, the data were collected in 35 counties. Data were not

collected from 2003 to 2006, and since 2007 have been collected in only 10 counties (Office of

National Drug Control Policy 2009). Thus ADAM provides an incomplete depiction of drug use

among the arrested population nationally, particularly since 2003; city-level comparisons are

more appropriate for comparing trends over time.

       The most recent ADAM results (for 2008) show that use of cocaine, heroin, and

methamphetamine continues to be common among arrestees in most cities. The percentage

testing positive for cocaine varied between a high of 44% and a low of 17%. Figures for heroin

were lower, but were still as high as 29% for Chicago, twice as much as the next highest city.

       For our purposes the more relevant comparisons are between 1986 and 2004, the era

covered by the two inmate surveys we analyzed. DUF started collecting data in 1987 in just 21

cities (Wish and Gropper 1991). More complete and consistent data are available from
Washington, DC, which has collected urinalysis on all adult arrestees since 1984 and on all

juvenile arrestees since 1988. The adult data (Figure 4) show that the percentage of all arrestees

testing positive for any drug excluding marijuana declined from 73% in 1987 to 49% in 1991,4

with a stable trend over the following 15 years.

                                        Insert Figure 4 here

       For juvenile arrestees (Figure 5) what is striking is how few have tested positive for any

drug other than marijuana and PCP since the early 1990s; whereas in 1987 23% tested positive

for cocaine, that figure has hovered around 7% since 1993.

Getting Offenders into Treatment

       As already noted, the insight that drug treatment could reduce both crime and the

demands on the criminal justice system has animated policy for a long time, not just in the

United States but in other countries. For example, the United Kingdom saw a near doubling of

the population in treatment between 1998 and 2006, largely as a consequence of a large variety

of criminal justice diversion programs (Reuter and Stevens 2007). We identify here just the

major interventions.

       Drug courts aim to use the coercive power of the criminal justice system, particularly the

authority of a judge, to persuade drug-involved offenders to cease their drug use rather than face

penalties for violating the terms of their release. Drug court clients are encouraged to seek

treatment, and continued participation in treatment may be a condition for staying out of jail. The

evaluation literature, though not technically strong, has generally found positive effects on

recidivism, the usual outcome measure (Belenko and Peugh 2005; Wilson et al. 2006).
       Even though the drug court movement is almost 20 years old and over 2,300 separate

programs have been created, (BJA Drug Court Clearinghouse Project 2009), a 2008 study

estimated that only 55,000 drug involved defendants were processed in such courts in the middle

of this decade; the same study estimated that over one million such defendants entered the

criminal justice system each year (Bhati et al. 2008). Despite the rapid expansion of drug courts,

the number of defendants who pass through such programs remain relatively low.

       This small number of enrollees arises from several factors. Many jurisdictions lack

administrative capacity to implement drug courts at-scale. Fifty-two percent of adult drug courts

responding to one survey reported they cannot accept some eligible clients due to capacity

constraints (Bhati et al. 2008). Bhati and colleagues estimate the current number of drug court

"slots" at approximately 55,000. Given this constraint, there are strong administrative and

political incentives for drug courts to cream-skim by serving relatively low-risk populations most

likely to achieve successful outcomes rather than high-risk populations that would experience the

greatest net reduction in criminal offending from drug court interventions.

       Even if such administrative capacity were available, enrollment would remain sharply

constrained by current eligibility restrictions. Despite the pervasiveness of the drug treatment

court model, drug courts routinely exclude most of the drug-using offenders. A 2005 survey of

adult drug courts found that “only 12% of drug courts accept clients with any prior violent

convictions. Individuals facing a drug charge, even if the seller is drug-dependent, are excluded

in 70% of courts for felony sales and 53% of courts for misdemeanor sales. Other charges that

routinely lead to exclusion include property crimes commonly associated with drug use (theft,

fraud, prostitution), and current domestic violence cases (only 20% accept domestic violence

cases) (Rossman et al. 2008). An earlier study conducted by the Government Accountability
Office (1997) found that only 6% of drug courts accept offenders whose current conviction

included a violent offense.

        A study of drug courts in six Washington state counties found substantial variation in

eligibility requirements (Cox et al. 2001). In King County, for example, only defendants facing

drug possession charges were eligible; whereas in Pierce County a long list of property crimes

were also eligible. Similarly, Florida’s Dade County accepts offenders with mainly possession or

purchase of a controlled substance charges. Marion County stipulates that eligible offenders must

be charged with nonviolent drug offenses, with some drug sale and domestic violence cases

considered (Florida Supreme Court Task Force on Treatment-Based Drug Courts 2004). Among

the seven drug courts in New York City, three accept offenders facing drug sales charges; four

do not. Only one court of the seven accepts defendants with nondrug felony charges.

        Drug courts originally targeted first-time offenders who were arrested for possession or

selling to support their habit. Some programs, however, are expanding to include repeat

offenders and a few are accepting violent offenders (Porter 2001). Nevertheless, programs with

flexible eligibility criteria are rare. Table 2 presents eligibility criteria for four drug courts in

major jurisdictions.

                                          Insert Table 2 here

        More difficult to determine are the eligibility rules with respect to substance abuse. Bhati

et al. (2008) report that “eligibility based on drug use severity is applied inconsistently—16% of

drug courts exclude those with a drug problem that is deemed too serious, while 48% reject

arrestees whose problems are not severe enough. Almost 69% exclude those with co-occurring

disorders. Even among eligible participants, more than half of drug courts (52%) report they
cannot accept some clients who are eligible for participation due to capacity constraints” (p.8)

(Bhati et al. 2008).

       These eligibility rules seem likely to exclude most experienced users of cocaine, heroin,

and methamphetamine. The few cohort studies of cocaine and heroin users (e.g. by Hser and

colleagues) show that long-term users have accumulated long histories of convictions for

property and violent crimes and that many—perhaps most—have co-occurring disorders or are

polydrug users (Hser et al. 2001; Hser 2007; Hser et al. 2007).

       Estimating the potential effect of relaxing eligibility requirements is a major research

challenge. Existing effectiveness findings reflect these tight eligibility requirements. Drug courts

choose certain clients, and exclude more serious offenders, in the belief that defendants with

longer and more serious criminal histories are more likely to have poor outcomes in drug courts.

They may be correct; without evaluations of the effects with these other client groups, the

research strategies for making projections are inherently speculative. We take this up in more

detail in the paper’s conclusion.

       California’s Proposition 36 provides the largest instance of diversion from the criminal

justice system. Under Prop 36 (formally the Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act

(SACPA)), first- or second-time drug possession arrestees with no record of violent offenses are

subject to a drug abuse assessment to determine appropriate referral to a drug treatment program.

Parolees or probationers who violate the drug conditions of their release or are arrested for drug

possession are also eligible for Prop 36 sentencing to treatment or counseling. Participation in

Prop 36 is contingent on pleading guilty to the possession charge. The majority of those arrested

for simple possession of marijuana had more attractive legal options, which did not involve

pleading guilty and thus did not enter Prop 36. Passed in 2000 by popular referendum, in its fifth
year of operation (July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2006) it processed 52,000 individuals, (Urada et al.

2008) almost as many as the national drug court movement.

       Given that Prop 36 is focused on individuals early in their criminal careers, it would

appear to have little prospect of reducing prison populations. Yet it appears to have had a sizable

effect. For example, Ehlers and Ziedenberg (2006) argue that Prop 36 accounted for a decline in

the projected California prison population. Whereas the population had been projected increase

from 162,000 to 180,000 between 2000 and 2005, the actual figure ended at only 164,000.

Moreover, the rate of prison commitments for drug possession offenses in California fell from 80

per 100,000 on June 1, 2001 (date of implementation) to 57 per 100,000 four years later.

       The state has funded a series of detailed evaluations of the effects of Prop 36 (Urada et al.

2008; University of California, Los Angeles Integrated Substance Abuse Programs 2007). A 42-

month follow-up of the first wave of Prop 36 arrestees found that the measure substantially

reduced the levels of jail and prison incarceration of eligible Prop 36 offenders. The comparison

was made between those deemed eligible for Prop 36 in the year before enactment and those who

were eligible under Prop 36 in its first year. For state prisons, it appears that offenders who

would have been eligible for sentencing under Prop 36 prior to its passage spent 100 days in state

prison, whereas those who were sentenced under Prop 36 terms spent only about 60 days in

prison.5 For county jails, the figures were similar; the average length of time in jail over 42

months fell from approximately 95 days to 65 days.6 The evaluations do not provide information

on how much of that difference was accounted for by the initial incarceration spell, and how

much was due to subsequences differences in reincarceration.

       Almost three quarters of those who were processed under SACPA entered treatment.

Substantial fractions drop out at various points in the process. The end result is that only one-
third (one quarter of the initial intake) were discharged as having completed treatment. That

figure is consistent with other studies of outcomes of treatment episodes resulting from criminal

justice referrals. Given that Prop 36 clients are under much less threat of reincarceration than

those entering through drug court referrals, for example, this is a surprising and encouraging

finding, though it underscores the challenge of retaining criminally active populations in

treatment interventions.

       The Prop 36 population has some unexpected characteristics. For example, though this

option is only available for first or second convictions on drug possession charges, it is a

relatively old population with an average age of 34.8 years. Half have never entered treatment

before. A substantial percentage have lengthy criminal records, even though this cannot include

conviction for a violent offense.

       Perhaps the inclusion of parolees among Prop 36 eligibles is an important source of the

reduction in the prison and jail populations. However, only 13% of the clients in the most recent

year of the evaluation entered from parole, and that figure had been as low as 8% in the first year

of the program.

       Over half of those sentenced under Prop 36 were charged with possession of

methamphetamine, a drug associated with high levels of criminality. However, ADAM data

show a low prevalence of methamphetamine in most U.S. cities (Office of National Drug Control

Policy 2009); so the California reductions in incarceration may not generalize to other states.

       On their face, the Proposition 36 findings are more encouraging than drug courts as a

method for reducing drug-related incarceration at the population level. The California

assessments consistently suggest that the use of noncriminal penalties has not produced increases

in crime rates, either as a result of higher recidivism or of reduced deterrence. Though high-risk
arrestees, primarily those with many prior arrests, fare less well than others, treatment oriented

diversion aimed at non-marijuana possession arrestees may generate a meaningful reduction in

total incarceration. There are however some concerns that the state sponsored evaluation, which

is complex and not always clear, does not capture all the problems of implementation. For

example, Hawken presents an analysis which finds that at the 30 month mark, arrests for all

groups of Prop 36 arrestees (treatment completers, treatment drop-outs and treatment refusers)

are higher than for the control group (Hawken 2009).

       Coerced abstinence/mandatory desistence, a twenty year crusade by UCLA’s Mark

Kleiman, (Kleiman 2009; Kleiman 1997; Kleiman and Hawken 2008) is a program that takes

advantage of simple findings from behavioral economics, psychology, and public policy. A large

number of offenders are under community supervision at any one time, whether it be pretrial

release, probation, or parole. Because they have been arrested or convicted, the government can

subject these individuals to random drug tests and indeed does from time to time.

       Coerced abstinence involves making sanctions certain, immediate, and relatively mild

rather than (as is normally the case) random, delayed, and severe. Such interventions have not

received widespread evaluation. The small number of existing studies have found that such

programs have the predicted effects on recidivism (Harrell et al. 1998). So far, there have been

no efforts to implement them on a large scale.

       Recently, Hawaii's Opportunity Probation with Enforcement (HOPE) program has

implemented the approach for the entire probation population. The results of a random

assignment evaluation (Kleiman and Hawken 2008; Hawken and Kleiman 2009 have been very

promising. Very few of those enrolled in the program fail more than twice and the recidivism

rates have been dramatically lower than for the probation population previously. For example,
only 21% of HOPE subjects were rearrested in the 12 month evaluation window, compared to

46% amongst those on routine probation conditions (Hawken and Kleiman 2009).

       These results and a clear articulation of the theory underlying the model by Mark

Kleiman and others have given this intervention a great deal of political and professional

prominence. HOPE-like experiments are being launched in a number of states. It offers the

prospect of a large scale intervention that could be implemented relatively rapidly and without

requiring the development of a new expertise in the probation community.

       However, for those interested in promoting drug treatment as a major intervention to

reduce the incarcerated population, it is striking that coerced abstinence does not necessarily

involve treatment. Probation officers want their clients to desist from drug use, and this program

gives them the tools to motivate and monitor abstinence. Many drug-involved offenders do not

satisfy screening criteria for actual dependence. It is unclear that many of the successful clients

entered drug treatment programs or that these individuals needed such services. The adverse

consequences of a failed urine test have been enough to generate abstinence. Whether abstinence

will continue post-supervision is an open question but in making a judgment about the utility of

coerced abstinence, it is important to note that relapse is the common experience post-treatment.

       The HOPE evaluation involved experienced offenders at risk of jail or prison.

Probationers assigned to HOPE were significantly less likely to produce positive drug tests or to

be arrested over a 12-month study period. These offenders spent about one-half as many days in

prison on revocations or new convictions. (See Table 3 below, reproduced from Hawken and

Kleiman (2009)).

                                        Insert Table 3 here

       If HOPE were implemented on a wide scale, it might cut prison time substantially.
4. Incarceration and Drug Courts

       This section presents a new analysis of data on the incarcerated population, including

both state prisons and local jails. First, we show that offenders with drug use problems continue

to be a large share of those in jail and prison, and that recent entering cohorts of drug-using

inmates are considerably older on average than late-1980s cohorts. Second we assess whether

under the usual eligibility rules, an expansion of drug courts could substantially reduce the

numbers of drug users locked up.



Data and Analytic Framework

       We analyzed two waves of data each from the Survey of Inmates in State Correctional

Facilities (SISCF) and the Survey of Inmates in Local Jails (SILJ), comparing changes in the

standing local jail and state prison populations from the latter part of the 1980s to the early part

of the 2000s. Specifically, the prison data are drawn from the 1986 and 2004 waves of the

SISCF, and the jail data are drawn from the 1989 and 2002 waves of the SILJ. For the prison

population, our analyses focus only on state inmates since the federal inmate survey was only

added in 1997. Moreover, federal prisons account for fewer than 10% of all those incarcerated on

any given day.

       In both surveys, all data, including key indicators on prior offenses and on substance use,

are based on inmate self-report. There is a substantial literature on such self-reporting in

correctional settings both for criminal involvement (Horney and Marshall 1992) and substance

use (Farabee and Fredlund 1996); this research suggests that the self-report methodology is a

valuable data collection approach that provides an acceptable level of accuracy for both domains.
       The nationally representative inmate surveys employ a stratified two-stage sampling

design, first selecting facilities and then inmates within the selected facilities. Total response

rates across the four surveys ranged between 84% and 92%. As shown in Table 4, the late 1980s

prison and jail surveys completed interviews with more than 19,000 inmates, generalizing to a

standing incarcerated population of roughly 846,000. In comparison, the early 2000s prison and

jail surveys completed interviews with more than 21,000 inmates, generalizing to a standing

incarcerated population of about 1.86 million.

                                         Insert Table 4 here

       For purposes of our analyses, we focus on the past-year admission cohort of convicted

inmates. Prior cross-period analyses of the inmate surveys (Mumola and Karberg 2006; Belenko

et al. 2002) have made comparisons for the entire incarcerated populations. Since many inmates

at each survey were incarcerated long before the survey itself, indeed were potential participants

in an earlier wave, comparisons of the total stock population do not describe well the changing

dynamics of incarceration. Thus we identify in each case an admission cohort of newly

incarcerated offenders consisting of those inmates who entered prison or jail in the twelve

months preceding the date of their interview.7 The resulting sample sizes and reference

populations used for the present study are also presented in Table 4. All analyses were performed

using Stata 11.0, with reported estimates weighted to account for the complex survey design.



Measuring Drug Misuse

       We examined changes among inmate populations in the problematic use of heroin,

cocaine, and methamphetamine. For each substance, we operationalized drug abuse as self-

reported daily or near-daily use in the month prior to arrest. We also defined “cocaine” to
include both powder and crack cocaine, and “methamphetamine” to include the more general

class of amphetamines.8 Other possible indicators were less valid measures of drug abuse (e.g.,

any drug use in the month prior to arrest, intoxication at the time of the offense) or were entirely

incommensurate across survey years (e.g., substance abuse and/or dependence).



Results

Drug Misuse among the Newly Incarcerated

       Our first finding is that frequent drug use continues to be prevalent among recent entering

inmate cohorts. Indeed, the percentage of newly incarcerated prison and jail inmates who

reported daily or near-daily use of any of the three drugs increased by one-quarter and one-fifth,

respectively, between the 1980s and the 2000s. In absolute numbers, this amounts to an overall

increase of roughly 129,000 convicted, drug-using offenders entering prison or jail. Of note, this

increase appears to be exclusively driven by the rise in methamphetamine use, as the share of

heroin and cocaine users declined slightly to moderately across the two periods.

                                        Insert Table 5 here



The Changing Age-by-Drug Distributions of the Newly Incarcerated

       To capture the changing age profiles of drug-involved offenders, we compared the age

distributions of newly-incarcerated drug-using inmates for the 1986 and 2004 prison surveys and

the 1989 and 2002 jail surveys. Again, by newly incarcerated, we mean admitted to prison within

the past year; and by drug abuse, we mean daily or near-daily use in the month prior to arrest.

Figures 6-8 compare the age group distributions (in five-year increments) for cocaine, heroin,

and methamphetamine, respectively.
       As shown in Figure 6, the cocaine-using cohorts aged considerably between the 1980s

and 2000s. Reflecting a seven-year increase in the median age from 27 to 34, just 12.1% of

newly-incarcerated cocaine-abusing prison inmates were 35 or older in 1986 compared to 47.3%

in 2004. Among entering jail inmates, similar increases in the median age (27 to 36) and

proportion of those 35 or older (17.0% to 56.4%) were found between 1989 and 2002.

                                        Insert Figure 6 here

       As shown in Figure 7, we found sizable but relatively smaller increases in population

aging across the heroin-using cohorts, with equivalent four-year increases in the median ages of

both newly-incarcerated prison (30 to 34) and jail (32 to 36) inmates. Examining the age

distributions, we found that the percentage of newly-incarcerated heroin-abusing prison inmates

who were 35 or older increased from roughly one-quarter to one-half (25.6% to 48.7%) between

1986 and 2004. A comparable percentage point increase (from 38.6% to 57.2%) in those 35 or

older occurred among the heroin-abusing jail cohort. Of note, however, there was considerable

parity across all survey years in the proportion of young (i.e., under 25) heroin abusers.

                                        Insert Figure 7 here

       For methamphetamine abusers, the median age rose from 26 to 30 among entering prison

inmates and from 28 to 31 among entering jail inmates. In the late 1980s, just 8.0% and 11.0% of

newly-incarcerated methamphetamine-abusing prison and jail inmates, respectively, were 35 or

older (see Figure 8). By the 2000s, one-third or more of incoming methamphetamine-abusing

prison (32.9%) and jail (36.0%) inmates exceeded this age.

                                        Insert Figure 8 here

       The remainder of the inmate cohorts—i.e. new entrants who did not report daily or near-

daily use of any of the three expensive drugs in the month before arrest—showed much smaller
aging patterns across survey years (see Figure 9). Median ages for entering cohorts of prison and

jail inmates rose 3 and 2 years, respectively. In addition, unlike the drug-abusing inmates, the

age distributions of the two non drug-abusing cohorts were virtually similar across time.

                                        Insert Figure 9 here

       The shifting age distribution of drug-involved offenders is especially important given the

declining age profile of violent offenses in this population. The probability that offenders will

satisfy criteria that disqualify them from diversion programs increases with age, even as the

probability of violent offending declines.

       The implications of these age patterns are shown below in Figure 10. Roughly one in four

entering inmates below the age of 25 were sentenced for a violent offense, a percentage that

steadily declined with age. Yet older offenders were markedly more likely to be labeled habitual

offenders or to face sentencing enhancements that would exclude them from typical drug

diversion programs.9

Drug Court Calculations

       In addition to examining age distributions, we examined the proportion of incoming

prisoners with problematic drug use who would be eligible for drug court diversion.

       We classified inmates—first with the entering cohort and then with the entire

incarcerated population—by characteristics that affect eligibility for drug courts. In Table 6,

those characteristics that frequently disqualify the individual for drug court are italicized; those

that make individuals likely candidates are in plain text.

                                     Insert Tables 6 and 7 here
       As shown in Table 6, virtually all newly-incarcerated inmates are likely to be deemed

ineligible for drug court intervention. Results are even sharper within the entire (not just the

newly-incarcerated) population of drug-involved state prison inmates, as shown in Table 7.

Authors’ calculations indicate that more than 85% have current or past sentences for a serious

felony or a gun violation. Non-incident inmates are twice as likely as incident inmates to be

serving current sentences for violent offenses.

       This pattern illustrates a point that arises in many contexts from unemployment to

welfare reform. The stock population of incarcerated offenders are a “length-biased” sample.

Compared with new entrants to prison in a given year, incarcerated offenders are more likely to

be long-term offenders in the midst of long incarceration spells, and are more likely to satisfy

other criteria of serious offending. As in the case of welfare cash assistance (Ellwood 1989), new

entrants to prison/TANF are a distinct population from those who are long term

prisoners/welfare recipients. Thus, programs that significantly affect the flow of new prison

entrants may have a much more modest impact on the stock of incarcerated prisoners. We return

to this point in the Conclusions section.

       The patterns in Table 7 illustrate the central challenge in reducing the prison population

through drug courts and other diversion programs. Problematic drug use was common among

state prison inmates. The 2004 prison sample included almost 300,000 convicted prison inmates

who had used cocaine, heroin, or amphetamine in the month prior to their admission to prison.

More than 90% of these drug-involved inmates satisfied screening criteria for abuse or

dependence. For the 2002 jail inmates, about 94,000 (of the 448,000 convicted inmates) used

heroin, cocaine, or methamphetamine in the month prior to their admission. Similarly, more than

90% met criteria for substance abuse or dependence in the year prior to arrest. Thus a rough
estimate is that in 2004 (projecting no change in the jail figure between 2002 and 2004) the

number of drug dependent individuals entering jail and prison as convicted offenders was

approximately 400,000.

       To put these numbers into perspective, we compared our descriptive statistics with the

2005 Treatment Episode Data System (TEDS), an administrative data set that captures at least

80% of all known treatment admissions in the United States in 2004. TEDS data yield 680,775

treatment admissions for which cocaine, amphetamine, or heroin was the primary substance of

misuse. The incarcerated drug-dependent populations in prisons and jails rival the substance

abuse treatment system in the size of the drug-using population receiving services on any given

day.

       Yet only a small minority of inmates are likely to be eligible for drug courts or similar

interventions. Among newly-incarcerated inmates, approximately one-fifth were under a current

sentence for minor (that is, non-trafficking) drug offenses—the archetypal offense promoted as

suitable for drug court intervention. An even smaller fraction were incarcerated for such crimes

and had no current or prior record for disqualifying offenses. Minor drug offenders account for

an even smaller fraction of the overall state prison population.

       If one broadens the universe from minor drug crimes to include other offenses, diversion

programs would have a slightly larger population to draw from. Approximately one-fifth of

inmates reported no history or current sentences for serious felonies.10

       Perhaps our most surprising descriptive findings concerned inmates in local jails. Based

on our 2002 data, a very small fraction of sentenced jail inmates would be eligible for drug

courts based on the eligibility criteria cited above.
       Prior criminal history factors exclude the largest share of offenders with current drug

problems from drug court eligibility. More than 70 percent of heroin, cocaine, and

methamphetamine users would be drug court-ineligible on the basis of being under criminal

justice supervision at the time of arrest or of being a habitual offender. Virtually none of these

inmates would be eligible for drug courts that applied every common exclusionary criterion.

Setting aside important considerations of program capacity, this suggests that relaxing eligibility

criteria, especially for offenders with active or long criminal histories, would expand the pool of

criminal offenders eligible for drug court and related interventions.



5. Conclusions

       We began this paper by noting that diverting drug-involved offenders from the criminal

justice system, in particular getting them into treatment rather than jail or prison, has long been a

major concern of the criminal justice system. The drug court movement has been a prominent

and important innovation, almost universally praised by policy makers at every level of the

criminal justice system. Other innovations, such as Proposition 36 in California and intensive

supervision probation in various jurisdictions have pursued the same goal.

       Notwithstanding that, we have documented that the numbers of drug-involved individuals

in the U.S. state prison and local jail systems have risen substantially in the last twenty years,

both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of the total. When we confine comparisons to those

entering the prison system or jails de novo (our incident cohort) during the 1980s and after the

year 2000, we see evidence that the entering drug-involved inmates are aging for the three drugs

(cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine) in contrast to a much slighter increase in the age of

those not involved with drugs.
       Prior studies, in particularly Bhati et al. (2008), have shown that drug courts have made

little difference to the criminal justice system because they handle such small numbers of

criminal defendants. Our paper adds to these findings with the observation that drug courts, as

currently structured, have little potential to make a difference to incarceration totals because so

few of those entering jail or prison would meet the eligibility requirements of the current courts.

       This importantly reflects the observed aging of the populations involved with the three

drugs we examined. A large share of drug-involved offenders entering correctional facilities

have accumulated long criminal careers that make them unattractive clients for the drug court

movement. It is especially discouraging that this statement applies to inmates in local jails, as

well as state prisons.

       Ironically, the aging of the drug using offenders has another consequence. They are now

much less likely to be convicted of a new violent offense, the principal public concern about

criminal offenders under community supervision. There has been growing interest in the time to

“redemption” for those with a criminal history, i.e. the number of years after an arrest or

conviction at which an individual is no longer much more likely to commit a new offense than

someone who has never been arrested/convicted (Blumstein and Nakamura 2009). The policy

question for drug courts is whether it is possible that a more careful analysis of the criminal

careers of long-term drug users will allow the selection of some candidates for diversion

programs with acceptable risks of committing a serious crime while under the supervision of a

drug court or intensive probation.

       Our results suggest other potential insights for policy. Reducing prison populations by

diverting drug-involved offenders before incarceration seems more difficult than one might

suspect. If diversion is unexpectedly difficult at the front end, other strategies may prove more
effective. Greater attention and focus on the drug problems of recently-released offenders,

parolees, and probationers seems especially fruitful.

       The results of Proposition 36 are intriguing. Though it is a well known innovation, we are

unaware of any study that has examined its potential to reduce prison and jail populations if

taken up nationally.

       Mandated desistence programs such as the Hawaii HOPE program yield impressive early

results. These seem especially promising for individuals who abuse alcohol or illicit substances,

but who may not be dependent or who use substances for which available substance abuse

treatment appears relatively ineffective.

       For opiate-dependent offenders, strengthening the immediate linkages into post-release

opioid maintenance treatment also appears promising. Similar linkages of drug-involved

offenders into long-term residential treatment and therapeutic communities also appear to be

associated with reduced rates of subsequent reoffending.

       Finally, more effective treatment interventions for young drug users who are not under

criminal justice supervision appears especially promising. Young men receiving substance abuse

treatment services display strikingly higher rates of criminal offending, particularly violent

offending, than do others involved in the treatment system. Some of these young men present to

the treatment system under implicit or explicit pressure from the criminal justice system. Others

seek services for other reasons.

       Although young adults are often more difficult treatment clients and may display poor

outcomes by traditional clinical criteria, focusing resources on this key population is likely to

yield high dividends for crime control and prevention policy.

1
    For example, in 2000, self-reported prevalences among NHSDA respondents imply that 1.2 million

individuals had used cocaine in the previous month. By comparison, more broad-based estimates that

included ADAM estimated a total of approximately 2 million that met the more stringent requirement of

having used the drug more than 8 times in the 30 days prior to the interview. The differential for heroin

was similar (Boyum and Reuter, 2005; p.18).
2
    The calculation is done only for state prisoners because (a) jail inmates serve short terms on average and

are eligible within the year for rearrest and ADAM inclusion, and (b) federal inmates include a large

fraction of nonresident offenders.
3
    Analysis that accounted for the social benefits of averted crime would likely find even more striking

benefits of substance abuse treatment.
4
    Most of the late 1980s decline was the result of an abrupt reduction in the percentage testing positive for

PCP, a drug that has been much more prevalent in Washington than any other city, even after the decline.
5
    This is based on dividing the estimated state prison costs provided in the report by the reported daily

cost of a prison stay.
6
    The report does not offer a figure for the cost of a day in jail; these calculations assume that it is $62.50,

a figure cited by Ehlers and Zeidenberg (2006). Ehlers and Ziedenberg estimate the number of jail days

saved per client per year to be approximately 12, which is roughly consistent with the 30 days estimated

in the above calculation.
7
    Because the SILJ does not ask unconvicted jail detainees pertinent questions on offender substance use

and other key indicators, our analyses are by necessity restricted to convicted inmates.
8
    We note, however, that the 1986 SISCF and 1989 SILJ collected data only on the use of

“amphetamine,” whereas the 2004 SISCF and 2002 SILJ asked separate questions about “amphetamine”

and “methamphetamine.” Similarly, the 1986 SISCF employed a single measure of “cocaine,” the 1989

SILJ a single measure of “cocaine or crack,” and the 2004 SISCF and 2002 SILJ separate measures of
“crack” and “cocaine other than crack.” Accordingly, the earlier surveys likely provide more conservative

estimates of cocaine and methamphetamine use as we have defined it.
9
    Current violent offense measures any current conviction offense, not just a controlling violent offense.

Habitual offender enhancement is defined as receiving a sentence enhancement for a second- or third-

strike offense.
