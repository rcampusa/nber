An Historical Perspective on the Crisis of 2007-2008




The current international financial crisis is part of a perennial pattern. Today’s events

have echoes in earlier big international financial crises which were triggered by events in

the U.S. financial system. Examples include the crises of 1857,1893, 1907 and 1929-

1933. This crisis has many similarities to those of the past but also some important

modern twists.

The crisis started in the U.S.. with the collapse of the subprime mortgage market in early

2007 and the end of a major housing boom. It occurred following two years of rising

policy interest rates. Its causes include major changes in regulation, lax oversight,

relaxation of normal standards of prudent lending and a prolonged period of abnormally

low interest rates. Defaults on mortgages spread to investment banks and commercial

banks in the U.S. and across the world via an elaborate network of derivatives. It has

recently spilled over into the real economy through a virulent credit crunch and

collapsing equities market which will likely produce a significant recession. The Fed and

other central banks have responded in a classical way by flooding the financial markets

with liquidity and the fiscal authorities are also dealing with the decline in solvency in the

banking system following the template of earlier bailouts like the Reconstruction Finance

Corporation in the 1930s, Sweden in 1992 and Japan in the late 1990s.

This paper provides an historical perspective on the current crisis, contrasts the old with

the modern and offers some lessons for policy. Section 1 describes the crisis in a bit more

detail. Section 2 provides some descriptive empirical evidence putting the crisis in long-




                                                                                              2
run perspective. Section 3 presents some modern parallels and modern twists of the crisis.

Section 4 discusses some of the issues in historical perspective for the emerging market

economies. Finally, section 5 concludes with a discussion of some of the historical lessons

for policy.



               1. The Crisis



The crisis occurred following two years of rising policy interest rates. Its causes include :

major changes in regulation, lax regulatory oversight, a relaxation of normal standards of

prudent lending and a period of abnormally low interest rates . The default on a

significant fraction of subprime mortgages produced spillover effects around the world

via the securitized mortgage derivatives into which these mortgages were bundled, to the

balance sheets of investment banks, hedge funds and conduits( which are bank-owned but

off their balance sheets) which intermediate between mortgage and other asset backed

commercial paper and long-term securities. The uncertainty about the value of the

securities collateralized by these mortgages spread uncertainty about the soundness of

loans for leveraged buyouts. All of this led to the freezing of the interbank lending market

in August 2007 and substantial liquidity injections subsequently by the Federal Reserve

and other central banks.

Since then the Fed both extended and expanded its discount window facilities and cut the

funds rate by 300 basis points. The crisis worsened in March 2008 with the rescue of the

Investment bank, Bear Stearns, by JP Morgan backstopped by funds from the Federal




                                                                                            3
Reserve. The rescue was justified on the grounds that Bear Stearns exposure to

counterparties was so extensive that a worse crisis would follow if it were not bailed out.

The March crisis also led to the creation of a number of new discount window facilities

whereby investment banks could access the window and which broadened the collateral

acceptable for discounting. The next major event was a Federal Reserve Treasury bailout

and partial nationalization of the insolvent GSEs, Fannie and Freddie Mac in July on the

grounds that they were crucial to the functioning of the mortgage market.

Events took a turn for the worse in September when the Treasury and Fed allowed the

investment bank Lehman Brothers to fail to discourage the belief that all insolvent

institutions would be saved in an attempt to prevent moral hazard . It was argued that

Lehman was both in worse shape and less exposed to counterparty risk than Bear Stearns.

The next day the authorities bailed out and nationalized the insurance giant AIG fearing

the systemic consequences for collateralized -default swaps ( insurance contracts on

securities) if it were allowed to fail. The fallout from the Lehman bankruptcy then turned

the liquidity crisis into a full fledged global credit crunch and stock market crash (as well

described in Kindleberger’s Manias, Panics and Crashes) as interbank lending effectively

seized up on the fear that no banks were safe.

In the ensuing atmosphere of panic, along with Fed liquidity assistance to the

commercial paper market and the extension of the safety net to money market mutual

funds, the US Treasury sponsored its Troubled Asset Relief Plan ( TARP) whereby $700

billion could be devoted to the purchase of heavily discounted mortgage backed and other

securities to remove them from the banks’ balance sheets and restore bank lending. The




                                                                                            4
bill was initially rejected by the Congress but then after the Senate added on to it many

politically popular and expensive items was finally passed a week later in the midst of

continued financial turmoil.

In early October the crisis spread to Europe and to the emerging countries as the global

interbank market ceased functioning . The UK authorities responded by pumping equity

into British banks, guaranteeing all interbank deposits and providing massive liquidity.

The EU countries responded in kind. And on October 13 the US Treasury followed suit

with a plan to inject $250 billion into the US banks,to provide insurance of senior

interbank debt and unlimited deposit insurance coverage for non interest bearing deposits.

Time will tell whether these plans, which are similar to earlier, mainly successful, rescue

packages like the RFC in the US in the 1930s and the Swedish and Japanese rescues in

the 1990s, may solve the solvency crisis.



               2. Some Descriptive Historical Evidence



Today’s turmoil must be viewed in historical perspective. Figure 1 provides some

background evidence for the U.S. over the past century. The upper panel from 1953 to

September 2008 , shows the monthly spreads between the Baa corporate bond rate and

the ten-year Treasury constant maturity bond rate. The spread, inter alia, represents a

measure of the financial market’s assessment of credit risk and also a measure of

financial instability reflecting asymmetric information ( Mishkin 1991). Figure 2 takes a

longer view and shows the Baa corporate bond rate and the Ten year Treasury Composite




                                                                                            5
bond rate from 1921 to September 2008. Also displayed in both figures are National

Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER) recession dates and major financial market

events including stock market crashes, financial crises, and some major political events

that affected financial markets. The lower panels of Figures 1 and 2 show policy interest

rates –the federal funds rate since 1953 and the discount rate for the longer 20th century.

As can be seen , the peaks in the credit cycle ( proxied by the spreads) are often lined up

with the upper turning points in the NBER reference cycles. Also many of the events,

especially the stock market crashes and the banking crises of the 1930s, occur close to the

peaks. Moreover , the lower panel often shows the policy rate peaking very close to or

before the peaks of the credit cycle. Its movements roughly reflect the tightening of

policy before the bust and loosening in reaction to the oncoming recession afterwards. As

can be seen in the recent crisis, by September 2008 the Baa ten year TCM spread reached

levels comparable to that reached in the last recession 2001-2002 and above that of the

credit crunch of 1990-91. The Baa Ten year Composite spread was just below the spreads

in the early 1980s recession after the Volcker shock and President Carter’s credit restraint

program. All of these events were associated with significant recessions.



       3. Historical Parallels and Modern Twists



Many of the financial institutions and instruments caught up in the crisis are part of the

centuries old phenomenon of financial innovation. The new instruments often devised to




                                                                                              6
avoid regulation, are then proved to be successful or not by the test of financial stress

such as we have been recently encountering.

The rise and fall of financial institutions and instruments occurs as part of a long standing

pattern of booms and busts in the markets for equities, land , commodities, foreign

exchange and other assets. The cycle is financed by credit. Lending booms and busts and

the credit cycle are also intimately connected to the business cycle.

A well known tradition in monetary economics which goes back to the nineteenth century

and in the twentieth century was fostered by Wesley Mitchell ( 1913), Irving Fisher

( 1933), Hyman Minsky( 1977) ,Charles Kindleberger and others. It tells the tale of a

business cycle upswing driven by what Fisher called a displacement ( an exogenous event

that provides new profitable opportunities for investment) leading to an investment boom

financed by bank money( and accommodative monetary policy) and by new credit

instruments –financial innovation. The boom leads to a state of euphoria where investors

have difficulty distinguishing sound from unsound prospects and where fraud can be

rampant. It can also lead to a bubble characterized by asset prices rising independently

from their fundamentals. The boom inevitably leads to a state of overindebtedness, when

agents have insufficient cash flow to service their liabilities. In such a situation a crisis

can be triggered by errors in judgement by debtors and creditors in an environment

changing from monetary ease to monetary tightening. The crisis can lead to fire sales of

assets, declining net worths, bankruptcies, bank failures and an ensuing recession.

A key dynamic in the crisis stressed by Mishkin(1997) is information asymmetry,

manifest in the spread between risky and safe securities, the consequences of




                                                                                                7
which(adverse selection and moral hazard) are ignored in the boom and come into play

with a vengeance in the bust.

Banks played a key role in the traditional story because bank credit in large part financed

the boom, and the bust was often accompanied by bank failures and banking panics—

events which eventually made the downturn worse. This led to the traditional case for the

monetary authority to act as a lender of last resort and provide liquidity at penalty rates to

the money market and or discount window lending to solvent but liquid banks.

Countercyclical monetary policy is also an integral part of the boom-bust credit cycle.

Bordo and Wheelock( 2007a, 2007b) using data for the US and 9 other countries for the

past century show that stock market booms occur in environments of low inflation, rising

real GDP growth and low policy real interest rates. As the boom progresses and

inflationary pressure builds up, central banks( before World War II, driven by the gold

convertibility constraint) inevitably tighten their policy rates helping to trigger the

ensuing crash. The story is similar for housing booms and busts but they follow a

different cycle because of long gestation lags in construction and in the adjustment

of prices to a collapse in demand ( Leamer 2007).

Stock market crashes can be serious events leading to a decline in wealth and in

consumption and also a scramble for liquidity in turn contributing to incipient banking

crises. Housing busts also have serious consequences for the banking system via defaults

on mortgages, and on the real economy via declining wealth on consumption expenditure,

the collapse of residential investment and a financial accelerator effect as net worths

decline. The recent housing boom in the US was largely triggered by a long period of

abnormally low interest rates, attributed to loose monetary policy from 2001 to 2004 in




                                                                                             8
reaction to earlier financial turbulence and then fear of deflation and to a global savings

glut ( Bernanke 2007). The bust was likely induced by a rise in rates in reaction to the

inevitable inflationary pressure.



The Non Bank Financial Sector, Financial Innovation and Financial Crises



The traditional financial crisis story depicts a shock to a major financial or non financial

firm leading to a banking panic as depositors attempt to convert their deposits into

currency. More recently, especially since the advent of deposit insurance, the source of

the pressure has come from the asset side, rather than the liability side of a bank’s

balance sheet. Examples include the Penn Central episode in 1970 when the collapse of

the railroad led to a panic in the commercial paper market which led, like today to

concern by the Fed that it would spill over into the banking system. This led the New

York Fed to open the discount window to the money center banks to freely discount non

financial firms based on the collateral of sound commercial paper; the Latin American

debt default of 1982 when many money center banks became close to insolvent until a

massive rescue was orchestrated between the Fed and the IMF; and the collapse of the

hedge fund LTCM in 1998 which also was perceived to be a threat to the banking system.

LTCM was rescued by a lifeboat operation by the New York banks orchestrated by the

New York Fed .An historical precedent was a crisis in the market for bills of exchange

that spread from Amsterdam to Hamburg and which like LTCM led to the failure of the

principal player and many others ( Schnabel and Shinn 2001).In each case the crisis




                                                                                               9
broke in the non bank financial sector but spilled over or threatened to spill over onto the

banks who were the ultimate creditors.

Many of the financial crises of the past involved financial innovation which increased

leverage. The 1763 crisis was centered on the market for bills of exchange, Penn Central

on the newly revived ( in the 1960s) commercial paper market, the savings and loan crisis

on the junk bond market, LTCM on derivatives and hedge funds.



Modern Twists



Although there are many historical parallels to the current crisis there are several unique

differences. In the most recent episode, the financial innovation derived from the

securitization of subprime mortgages and other loans has shifted risk away from the

originating banks into mortgage and other asset backed securities which bundle the risk

of less stellar borrowers with more credit worthy ones and which were certified by the

credit rating agencies as prime. These were absorbed by hedge funds in the US and

abroad and in the asset backed commercial paper of the commercial and investment

banks. As Rajan ( 2005) presciently argued, shifting the risk away from banks who used

to have the incentives to monitor their borrowers to hedge funds and other institutions

which do not, rather than reducing overall systemic risk increased it by raising the risk of

a much more widespread meltdown in the event of a tail event as we have recently

witnessed.

A key modern twist was the growth of the non bank financial sector ( shadow banking

system) which was not regulated by the central bank nor covered by the financial safety




                                                                                          10
net. According to Eichengreen (2008) its rapid growth was a consequence of the repeal in

1999 of the Depression era Glass Steagall Act which separated commercial from

Investment banking. These institutions held much lower capital ratios than the traditional

commercial banks and hence were considerably more prone to risk. When the crisis hit

they were forced to engage in major deleveraging involving the fire sale of assets into a

falling market which in turn lowered the value of their assets and those of other financial

firms. A similar negative feedback loop occurred during the Great Depression ( Friedman

and Schwartz 1963).




               4. Prospects for the Emerging Markets



Financial crises have always had an international dimension as

Morgenstern( 1959),Kindleberger( 1978) and Bordo( 1986) have shown. Contagion

spreads quickly through asset markets, through international banking and through the

monetary standard. Stock market crashes and banking panics often have occurred in

many countries within a few months of the original shock. A classic example is the

Baring crisis of 1890 which started in Argentina and affected the rest of Latin America

and other emerging countries of the time. It was triggered by central bank tightening in

England, France and Germany. This led to a series of sudden stops and current account

reversals ( Bordo 2006) in the emerging countries and a number of banking crises and

debt defaults. These events were echoed in the late 1990s ( see Calvo and Talvi 2005).




                                                                                           11
The current crisis was initially contained to the advanced countries among which

contagion was spread by the holding of opaque subprime mortgage derivatives in diverse

banks in Europe and elsewhere, and by the seizing up of the asset ( mortgage ) backed

commercial paper market. In recent weeks pressure has spilled over to the emerging

markets , especially those who are highly indebted to the advanced countries ,with high

current account deficits and with significant exposure to the advanced countries boom

such as Iceland, Hungary and Ukraine( IMF WEO chapter 1 September 2008). IMF and

ECB rescues have been initiated. However many of the Asian countries (and some Latin

American countries) have so far avoided the crisis, likely because of the precautionary

measures many have taken in reaction to their meltdowns in the Asian crisis of 1997( eg

the build up of large foreign exchange reserves and reduced exposure to foreign

borrowing.). As the credit crunch continues and the burgeoning recession in the US and

Europe plays out, then the emergers that are exposed to foreign capital will be affected

as well as countries relying for their growth on exports to the US and Europe.




                       5. Policy Lessons from History



The crisis has implications for monetary policy on the key issues of liquidity, solvency

and the stability of the real economy. With respect to liquidity the central banks reacted

quickly in the Bagehot manner to deal with the freezing of the interbank markets in

August 2007. The ECB flooded the European money market with liquidity as did the Fed

which lowered the discount rate by 50 basis points . This suggests they heeded the first




                                                                                           12
part of Bagehot’s lesson to lend freely but not quite on the second part of lending at a

penalty rate. The Bank of England until mid 2007 followed a strict interpretation of

Bagehot by keeping its discount window open to all comers but at a penalty rate. The

subsequent run on Northern Rock on September 14 led to a large infusion of central bank

liquidity and the announcement of a temporary complete guarantee of all UK bank

deposits. The run on Northern Rock very likely reflected not the failure of the Bank’s

lender of last resort policy but inadequacies in the UK’s provision of deposit insurance,

the ill thought out separation of financial supervision and regulation from the central

bank and political pressure( Milne and Wood 2008).

Since then the pressure on the interbank market and liquidity in general increased during

the winter of 07-08 and in March with the Bear Stearns crisis , the Fed developed a series

of new programs for access to the discount window lending including the term auction

facility(TAF), The Term security Lending Facility( TSLF) and the Primary Dealer Credit

Facility( PDCP).Since March the Fed has also expanded its liquidity provision to the

commercial paper market.

These facilities reflected a change in Fed tactics. The change involved provision of credit

directly to financial firms that the Fed deemed most in need of liquidity in contrast to

delivering liquidity directly to the market by open market purchases of Treasury

securities and leaving the distribution of liquidity to individual firms to the market. The

choice of targeted lending instead of imperial liquidity provision by the market exposed

the Fed to the temptation to politicize its selection of recipients of its credit. In addition

one question that arose is why this complicated method of providing liquidity was

introduced when the uncomplicated system of open market operations is available? A




                                                                                                 13
second question is why did the Fed reduce its holdings of government securities. How

would the Fed be able to tighten monetary policy when it finally decides to combat a rise

in the inflation rate? The only way to tighten is to sell government securities. The

mortgage backed securities on the Fed’s balance sheet may not be easily marketable.

With respect to solvency, the Fed and the other US monetary authorities have engaged in

a series of bailouts of incipient insolvent firms deemed too systemically connected to fail.

These include Bear Stearns in March 2008, the GSEs in July and AIG in September. The

investment bank Lehman Brothers had been allowed to fail in September on the grounds

that it was basically insolvent and not as systemically important as the others. One

wonders if Bear Stearns had been allowed to fail if the severe crisis in September/October

2008 could have been avoided. Had Bear Stearns simply been closed and liquidated it is

unlikely that more demand for Fed credit would have come forward than that actually

occurred. The fact that general creditors and derivative counterparties of Bear Stearns

were fully protected by the merger of the firm with JP Morgan Chase had greater

spillover effects on the financial services industry than would have been the case had the

Fed appointed a receiver and frozen old accounts and payments as of the date of the

appointment. Fewer public funds would have been subjected to risk. When Drexel

Burnham Lambert was shut down in 1990, there were no spillover effects.

Furthermore assume, as the Fed argued at the time, that there would have been a crisis in

March like the one that followed Lehman’s failure in September. Would it have been as

bad as the latter event? Assume that the moral hazard implications of bailing out Bear

Stearns led the remaining investment banks and other market players to follow riskier

strategies than otherwise on the assumption that they also would be bailed out. This




                                                                                          14
surely made the financial system more fragile than otherwise. So that when the monetary

authorities decided to let Lehman fail the shock that ensued and the damage to confidence

was much worse.

Since the September 2008 crisis it has finally been realized that the deepest problem

facing the financial system is solvency. The problem stems from the difficulty of pricing

securities backed by a pool of assets, whether mortgage loans, student loans, commercial

paper issues, or credit card receivables. Pricing securities based on a pool of assets is

difficult because the quality of individual components of the pool varies and unless each

component is individually examined and evaluated, no accurate price of the security can

be determined.

As a result, the credit market, confronted by financial firms whose portfolios are filled

with securities of uncertain value, derivatives that are so complex the art of pricing them

has not been mastered, is plagued by the inability to determine which firms are solvent

and which are not. Lenders are unwilling to extend loans when they cannot be sure that a

borrower is creditworthy. This is a serious shortcoming of the securitization process that

is responsible for the paralysis of the credit market.

The Fed was slow to recognize the solvency problem. It emphasized providing liquidity

to the market when that is not the answer to the problem of the market’s uncertainty

about the solvency of individual or sectoral financial firms. No financial market can

function normally when basic information about the solvency of market participants is

lacking. The securities that are the product of securitization are the root of the turmoil in

financial markets that began long before the housing market burst.




                                                                                            15
The Treasury’s plan of October 13, 2008 , based on the UK plan to inject capital into the

banking system was designed to help solve this problem. However an issue that was not

clear is whether funds would be injected into insolvent banks or into solvent banks which

are temporarily short of capital. If funds were to go to insolvent banks this could prolong

the credit crunch.

There is ample historical precedent for the Treasury plan including the Reconstruction

Finance Corporation established by the Hoover administration in 1932. Under Roosevelt

it injected $ 1.3 billion to 6000 banks which is equivalent to $ 200 billion in equity today

( Sylla 2008). In 1932 the Reconstruction Finance Corporation ( RFC)’s efforts were

hampered by the publication of the list of banks raising capital. This led to runs on these

banks and unwillingness by others to participate. It also has precedent in the Swedish

bank bailout of 1992 and in Japan’s long delayed bailout in the late 1990s.

With respect to the real economy, the Fed with its dual mandate of price stability and

high growth ( full employment) focused on growth and cut the Funds rate vigorously.

Considerable empirical and historical evidence suggests that credit crunches exacerbate

recessions ( see figures 1 and 2 and IMF WEO chapter 4 September 2008). Given the

Fed’s dual mandate, the risk of recession consequent upon the credit crunch seemed to

have been a reasonable rationale for a temporary easing of monetary policy. This action

leaves open the possibility that the Fed could return to its emphasis on price stability once

the recovery is in sight.

Another lesson concerns whether the Fed should continue to follow the reactive policy to

asset booms that it has been following or follow a preemptive policy. The traditional

view of monetary policy argues that central banks should act reactively and deal with the




                                                                                          16
consequences for the financial system of an asset price boom after it has burst (Bernanke

and Gertler 2001). An alternative view argues that if an asset bubble ( eg housing) is on

the horizon, then the Fed should act pre-emptively to defuse it ( Cecchetti et al 2000).

Bordo and Jeanne ( 2002) consider a circumstance in which the use of preemptive policy

against the occurrence of a low probability event, which can have catastrophic

consequences, such as a national housing bust, can be welfare improving. The recent

events may spark further debate.

An additional lesson speculates on the genesis of the crisis. The recent financial crisis

likely could have been avoided if the Fed had not provided as much liquidity as it did

from 2001 to 2004. After Y2K when no financial crisis occurred , it promptly withdrew

the massive infusion of liquidity it had provided. By contrast thereafter, it foresaw a

series of shocks to the economy that might lead to financial crisis , eg the tech bust of

2001 and 9/11. In each case it injected liquidity, but when no financial crisis occurred , it

permitted the additional funds it had provided to remain in the money market. In addition

it overreacted to the threat of deflation in 2003-2004 which may have been of the

good( productivity driven)variety rather than of the bad ( recessionary) variety ( Bordo

and Filardo 2005). If consequent upon these events the market had not been infused with

liquidity as much as they were and for so long, then interest rates would not have been as

low in recent years as they were and the housing boom which had just bust may not have

expanded as much as it did . Evidence for this perspective by Taylor ( 2007) suggests

that interest rates in this period were on average considerably lower than would be the

case based on his famous rule.

               Some Less Gloomy Lessons from the Crisis




                                                                                            17
Finally, there are some less gloomy lessons from the crisis. First is the compressed

consolidation of the U.S. banking industry. Since the 1990s the U.S. banking system has

been slowly consolidating to take advantage of the removal of barriers to interstate

banking and branch banking. Canada and most European countries went through this

consolidation by mergers and acquisition in the late nineteenth and early twentieth

centuries. Evidence suggests that the U.S. banking system historically was both less

stable and less efficient than its Canadian counterpart( Bordo, Redish and Rockoff 1996).

The recent crisis by forcing mergers and exit facilitates the move to a banking system

with features closer to those of the other advanced countries with a few very large banks.

However because of its legacy of community banking with significant local social capital

many smaller banks will likely survive.

Second, the crisis is resolving issues raised by the Glass Steagall act of 1933 which

separated commercial from investment banking. The act was repealed in 1999 and since

then the more lightly regulated investment banks with an advantage of lower capital

requirements competed successfully with the commercial banks , in turn inducing them to

increase leverage and move liabilities off their balance sheets. The resultant increase in

risk contributed to the crisis. The demise of Bear Stearns and Lehman has forced the

other investment banks to merge with major commercial banks, to come under the

umbrella of the Fed and FDIC safety nets. The creation of such universal banks has

returned the US to the system it had before Glass Steagall and moves it closer to that of

the banks in some European countries. Such universal banks have had a long history of

stability and efficiency ( Fohlin 2007).




                                                                                             18
Third the extension of the lender of last resort function to include most types of collateral

and most financial institutions seems to be following some strictures from Bagehot’s

Lombard Street(1873) on what the central bank should do in a panic. Bagehot quotes

what a Bank of England director said about its actions in the crisis of 1825:

“” we lent it by every possible means and in modes we never adopted before; we took in

stock on security, we purchased Exchequer bills, we not only discounted outright, but we

made advances on the deposits of bills of exchange to an immense amount, in short by

every means consistent with the safety of the Bank, and we were not on some occasions

over-nice. Seeing the dreadful state in which the public were, we rendered every

assistance in our power” ( page 52).

Fourth and finally is the speed of response by the monetary authorities in the US and

Europe in resolving both the liquidity and solvency aspects of the crisis. This is in

contrast to the Great Depression when the Fed did virtually nothing and it was up to FDR

by devaluing the dollar in 1933 and the Treasury through its gold purchases thereafter,

to jump start the economy . It is also in contrast to the slow response by the Japanese

authorities in the aftermath of the collapse of Japan’s stock market and real estate bubbles.
