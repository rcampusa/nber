                            ABSTRACT

     Empirical work on exchange-reLe behavior under a target-zone

regime has used data produced by the European Nonetary System
(ENS) and has found that the data contradict important

predictions made by the standard target-zone model. We argue
that rhe contradictions reflect a misinterpretation of policies

pursued by the ENS countries. They intervened intramarginally,
to keep exrhsnge rates well within the target zone, rather then

intervening at the edges of the zone to prevent rates from

crossing them. In the Besle-Nyborg Agreement of 1987, however,
the ENS rountries agreed to make fuller use of the band, and the

effects of the agreement show up strongly in the data. Exchange
rates behave differently after the agreement than they did

before. The effect appears clearly in the behavior of the French
franc and less decisively in the behavior of the Italian lira.

The paper concludes by examining and rejecting alternative
explanations for the observed differences in exohange-rate

behavior.

                                  Introduction

      Governments adhering to the exchange—rate roles of the European Monetary

System (EMS) are required to keep the spot exchange rates for their currencies

inside hard and narrow bands. These are defined with reference to predetermined

central rates for the bilateral exchange rates connecting the EMS currencies.

During the period studied in this paper, the band for the French franc via—a—via

the Deotschemark M) had a width of 4.5 per cent (2.25 percent on each side of

the central rate), and the band for the Italian lira had a width of 12 percent.

Sot Figures 1A and lB show that the actual rate for the franc remained in a

narrower range during most of the period, while the actual rate for the lira was

always within a narrower range. Why was this so? Mhy does it matter?

      This paper argues that the behavior of those rates reflected a deliberate

decision by the governments concerned to keep them well within their bands. This

strategy was implemented by official intervention in the foreign—exchange market

and, at times, by using interest—rate policies. The development of the strategy

is described by Ungerer et al. (1986, p. 5):


            Over the years, a marked shift in views has taken place regarding
      the relative merits of exchange rate flexibility and stability within the
      margins vis—i—vis other participating currencies. On the one hand, the
      flexibility provided by the fluctuation margins was regarded as a cushion
      to absorb or dampen some external shocks without the need for immediate
      changes in basic policies or central rates. Full use of the fluctuation
      margins would also help to limit exchange market intervention and thus
      avoid some of its potentially undesirable consequences. On the other hand,
      there are arguments in favor of keeping the exchange rate stable against
      other, particularly strong correncies in the system, if need be by inter-
      vening and by shifting interest rate differentials. By doing so, the
      authorities hope to influence market sentiments and exchange rate expecta-
      tions by showing determination and by preventing the building up of a
      momentum for exchange rate movements. A related argument is that domestic
      monetary stability, in terms of actual developments and expectations, may
      be better served by exchange rate stability against key participating
      currencies.
            Over time, the latter view has gained favor, and a number uf EMS
      central banks have adupted a strategy nf keeping their exchange ratee well
      within the band nf the EMS and minimizing mnvemente against key currencies
      cf the EMS. At times, this has required substantial intervention in the
      foreign exchange market and the maintenance of higher interest rates than
      might have been desirable from the point of view of domestic policy.


Mhen central banks intervened intramarginally, however, they could not draw on

the credit facilities of the EMS but had to use their own reserves. Furthermore,

they had frequently to act unilaterally, because the Bundesbank did nut intervene

intramarginally to support the franc or lira against the 1DM.1

      In 1987, however, agreement was reached on the limited use of EMS credit

facilities for financing intramarginal intervention and, as a quid pro quo, on

making fuller use of the exchange—rate band. Under the Sasle—Nyborg Agreement of

September 12, 1987, EMS members undertook 'tn lay emphasis on the use of interest

rate differentials to defend the stability of the EMS parity grid, to use the

permitted fluctuation margins flexibly in order to deter speculation and to avoid

prolonged bouts of intramarginal intervention" (Communiqué quoted in Ungerer, et

al., 1990, p. 88).

      This paper sets cut to show that governments sometimes mean what they say.

We demonstrate that the Basle—Nyborg Agreement was taken seriously, by showing

that actual exchange—rate behavior was significantly different after that agree-

ment than it was before, particularly in the case of the franc. From this result,

mnrenver, we infer that the earlier behavior of exchange rates reflected the

effects of extensive intramarginal intervention aimed at achieving the objective

described in the passage previously quoted.

      Why should anyone care? There are two reasons. First, it is important to

know that governments can mean what they say. Second, it is important to know

that the behavior of EMS exchange rates reflected the effects of intervention,
because those exchange rates have been studied clossly in recent empirical work

on the so—called target—zone model.

       We begin with a brief presentation of the target—zone model itself and of

previous empirical work on the behavior of EMS rates. Thereafter, we examine that

behavior closely and show that there was a regime change in the wake of the

Sasle—Nyborg Agreement. Finally, we defend our interpretation of the change in

exchange—rate behavior against a different interpretation——that markets, not

governments, were responsible for the observable change in behavior.


                              The Target—zone Model

       The rapidly growing literature on exchange—rate behavior in a target zone

originated with Krugman (1987). It was formalized and refined by Froot and

Obstfeid (1989), Flood and Garber (1989), and Krugman (1991). The model uses a

minimalist log—linear equation to link the log of the exchange rate, e, with a

univariate representation of the fundamentals determining the rate,     and with

the expected rate of change of the rate, dEe/dt:


 (1)    e = - + cz-1_Etet.
Krugman identified the fundamentals with those that we typically associate with

the monetary model of exchange—rate determination——the domestic money supply and

shocks to velocity. Other authors have been less precise; they say merely that

   is a linear function of variables that influence money—market equilibrium.2

If the fundamentals are identified with those that appear in the monetary model,

e can be interpreted as the semi—elasticity of money demand with respect to the

interest rate. More generally, o measures the sensitivity of the exchange rate

to its own expected change.

       For analytic convenience, the fundamentals are assumed to follow Brownian
motion with drift;

 (2)      df, =   ILdt       +   odw,

where p is the drift rate, c ie a positive constant, and w is a Wiener process.

Few would argue that the fundamentals——whatever they may be——are represented

adequately by a random process. The assumption, however, allows the analysis to

focus on the exchange—rate dynamics produced by the target zone, rather than

those produced by predictable changes in the fundamentals.

        The solution for eq. (1), given eq. )2), is obtained by first invoking

Ito's Lemma to solve for the expected rate of change of the exchange rate;


 (3)                   =     ig')f)     +


where   e=    g) f)        and the function g is assumed to be continuous and twice
differentiable. Substituting eq. (3) into eq. (1),

 ))      g)f) =              + "'))         +



The general solution for eq. (4), a second—order differential equation, is

 (5)     g(f) =       if +         + A,exp)A,f) * A,exp)12f)

where

          A1 =                   + /2 +252/5 >0, and               -       -   + 2a2/u   <0.

                                                                       2
The integration constants A1 and A2 are determined by the specific form of the

intervention rule adopted by the monetary authorities. If they never intervene

or, equally, the market pays no attention to their operations, then A1 = A2 =                  0.
If they always intervene whenever the exchange rate hits the top or bottom of the



                                                       4
target—zone band, but not intramarginally, and the market fully expects them to

do so, then A1 < 0 and A2 >   0.   These latter conditions on the constants are

required for "smooth pasting" at the top and bottom of the band, which prevents

the exchange rate from changing in response to anticipated (infinitesimal)

intervention at the edges of the band. Without smooth pasting, the instantaneous

rate of profit would be infinite at the intervention point.

      If the intervention rule is not completely credible, the constants are

unconstrained. That is what happens in the model developed by Bertola and

caballero (1990), where the authorities may invoke either of two policy rules

when the exchange rate hits the edge of the band. They may intervene to defend

the current band or realign the band itself. Under these conditions, the signs

of the constants determine whether the market's expectation of a realignment

dominates its expectation of intervention to defend the current band. If the

expectation of a realignment dominates, A1 > 0 and A2 <   0; if the expectation of
intervention dominates, the signs of the constants are reversed to satisfy the

smooth—pasting requirement.


           Empirical Implications of the Standard Target—Zone )4odel

      In the target—zone model described above, with a fully credible commitment

to intervention at the edges of the band, an S—shaped curve connects the exchange

rate, e, with the fundamentals,       as shown in Figure 2. The curve is flat at

the edges of the band, e and e so that a range of possible values for          map

into the same value for e. More generally, if the unconditional distribution of

the f; is uniform within the bands, then the unconditional distribution of the

e1 will be hi—modal, with a high frequency of observations at each edge of the

band. The S—shaped relationship between e and f also implies that the variance

of the exchange rate should fall as it approaches the edges of the band. This can
be explained intuitively: the flatter the relatiunship between the exchange rate

and the fundamentals, the smaller the response of the exchange rate to a given

change in the fundamentals. This intuitive explanation likewise says that the

variance of the fundamentals should be larger than the variance of the exchange

rate within the band.

      The EMS provides a natural proving ground for the target—zone model. There

have been several realignments since the EMS was inaugurated in lg79, but the

bands themselves are narrow and have been defended firmly between realignments.3

Yet the two empirical implications of the model are violated by the EMS data.

There is little evidence that the variance of EMS exchange rates is reduced as

the rates approach the edges of the band (i.e., that an S—shaped relationship

connects e and       Furthermore, Figures 3A and 3B show clearly that the franc—
DM and lira—OM exchange rates are more often clustered in the middle of the band

than at the edges.

      Although these observations suggest that the standard target—zone model is

not an appropriate representation of EMS arrangements, a number of empirical

studies have nevertheless set out to test the validity of the target—zone model

by using EMS data. Broadly speaking, these studies fall into two groups.

      Studies in the first group, including those by Bodnar and Leahy (1990) and

Flood, Rose, and Mathieson (1990), take the standard target—zone model guite

literally. They employ the general solution given by eq. (5) to obtain a measure

of the unobserved fundamentals that drive the model. This can be done using

actual spot exchange rates and estimated values for the parameters p, o, o, A1,

and A2. They then use their measure of       to teat directly for the nonlinearity

(S—shape) of the relationship between the actual e and the estimated           Not

surprisingly, these studies find little support for the target—zone model in the


                                         6
EMS data.4

      Studies in the second group, including those by Edison and Kaminsky (1990),

Klein and Lewis (1990), Bertola and Caballero (1990), and Bertola and Svensson

(1990), test modified versions of the target—zone model, paying close attention

to the representation of official intsrvention. In the original formulation by

Krugman (1987, 1991), the authoritiss sought to keep the exchange rate within the

band by committing themselves to intsrvene at the edges of the band. This simple

specification was sufficient for Krugman's main purpose——to show that a credible

band would induce stabilizing speculation that could keep the exchange rate

within the band without any official action (i.e., that stabilizing speculation

would substitute for official intervention). In reality, however, the authorities

intervene non—infinitesimally at the edges of the bands, and they also intervene

intramarginally. Furthermore, they realign the bands, which means that their

commitment to defend them cannot be perfectly credible. Therefore, the studies

listed above use intervention rules suggested by actual KMS experience to test

whether the stabilizing properties of the target-zone model survive when the

authorities adopt more complicated strategies.

      Edison and Kaminsky (1990), for example, introduce implicit bands within

the official bands to represent the influence of intramarginal interventions.5

Bertola and Caballero (1990) and Bertola and Svensson (1990) allow for the

possibility of realignments and thus devaluation risk when the exchange rate

reaches the edge of the band.6 These studies are far from decisive, however,

providing only weak empirical support for use of the target—zone model, even when

modified, to account for actual exchange—rate behavior in the EMS.

                       Another Look at the EMS Experience

      For much of the period under study, the French and Italian authorities seem

to have followed the strategy described by lingerer et al. (1986) in the passage

guoted earlier. An account of that strategy was given by the Bank of France in

a paper quoted by Edison and lcaminsky (1990, p. 7):


      Within the framework of the European exchange rate mechanism full use of
      the 2.25 percent fluctuation margin may, if the intervsntion points ars
      reached, lead earket participants to think that a realignment is imminent.
      It is therefore not surprising that most interventions are intramarginal.
      Action of this kind does not entail any exchange rate objective, within a
      fluctuation margin which is in any case narrow. In certain circumstances,
      however, it may be desirable not to go beyond, at least temporarily, the
      exchange rate considered by the market to be a psychological threshold. On
      other occasions, and particularly at times of acute crisis, it may, on the
      other hand, be useful to move swiftly to the exchange rate level at which
      the speculation in the market on a realignment would no longer be prof it—
      able.


This strategy was not adopted right away. Returning to Figure 1A, note that the

franc was at or near the lower limit of its band for many weeks in 1980 and in

the first quarter of 1981 and at or near the upper limit for many weeks in 1981

and 1982. Thereafter, however, it stayed well within the limits until the fourth

quarter of 1987, apart from brief periods just before the realignments of March

1983, April 1986, and January 1987, and in the weeks following the first two of

those realignments. After the Basle—Byborg Agreement, however, the franc began

to fluctuate more freely, and it came close to the upper limit of the band

several times in 1988 and 1989, although there was no realignment.

      The exchange rate for the lira, shown in Figure 1B, has been allowed to

touch both limits of its band, but not very often. Fewer than 0.4 percent of the

exchange—rate quotations were less than 2 percentage points from the upper limit,

and fewer than 5.1 percent were as close to the lower limit. (Both countries'

monetary authorities appear to have been more tolerant of large strong—currency
deviations than large weak—currency deviations. In the case of the franc, some

9.1 percent of the quotations were less than 0.75 percentage points from the

upper, weak—currency limit, but 15.1 percent were as close to the lower, strong—

currency limit.) In 1988 and 1989, however, the exchange rate for the lira seems

to have spent more time than before in the upper portion of its band.

      Are the apparent changes in exchange—rate behavior shown by Figures 1A and

18 sufficiently large and significant to represent regime changes? Did the Basle—

Nyborg Agreement make a difference? To answer these questions, we look first at

exchange—rate behavior in the several subperiods marked off by exchange—rate

realignments, then at exchange—rate behavior before and after the Basle—Nyborg

Agreement.

      There were five realignments affecting the franc—OH exchange rate and seven

realignments affecting the lira—DH rate. Distributions of daily exchange—rate

quotations for the periods between those realignments are shown in Tables l.A and

    The data exclude quotations for the weeks adjacent to the realignments,

because the Bank of France, by its own testimony, shifted temporarily to a

different strategy on the eve of a realignment and appears to have pursued a

different strategy right after a realignment.8 )For the franc, the omitted

quotations account for 7.4 percent of all quotations closer than 0.75 percentage

points to the upper limit of the band and for 5 percent of all quotations closer

than 0.75 percentage points to the lower limit. For the lira, they account for

67 percent of all quotations closer than 2 percentage points to the upper limit

but for less than 4 percent of all quotations closer than 2 percentage points to

the lower limit.)

      There are visible differences among the distributions in Tables lA and 18,

but are they significant? First, we ask whether they have different means.
Second, we use the Kolmogorov—Smirnov criterion for maximum differences which

furnishes a test for differences between distributions when those distributions

cannot be parameterized. Suppose we have samples from two populations and use

H(t) and J(t) to denote the (unspecified) cumulative density functions for those

populations. We can estimate the functions H and J from the empirical

distribution functicns Hm(t) and J(t), where m and n are the numbers of

observations in the samples.

Tests based on the Kolmogorov—Smirnov Statistic are sensitive to all types of

departures from the null hypothesis H =           2   and are therefore not sensitive to the

particular type of difference between H and

      Tables 2A and 2B show the two sets of test results. In Table 2A, for the

franc—OH rate, there are several significant differences between pairs of means,


                                                 11
and most of the Kolmogorov—Smirnov statistics exceed their critical values. But

the third, fourth, and fifth distributions differ less among themselves than from

the first, second, and sixth. In Table 28, for the lira—DM rate, all but two

differences between pairs of means are statistically significant, and all of the

Kolmogorov—Smirnov statistics are significant. But the differences between the

fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh distributions are typically smaller than the

differences between them and the eighth, measured by the size and significance

of the test statistics.

      We are therefore encooraged to eet up a second set of tests. We set aside

the first two subperiods for the franc and the first three for the lira (those

ending with the realignment of June 1982). The distributions for these subperiods

differ appreciably from all of the others (apart from the ones for the first and

eighth in the case of the lira), and they may perhaps be deemed to represent a


                                        13
learning period, early in the history of the EMS.10 Next, we regroup the rest

of the exchange—rate quotations into the distributions shown in Table 3, for the

period before the Baele-Nyborg Agreement of September 1987 and the period after

it. (The same distributions are depicted in Figures 4A and 4B and Figures 5A and

58.) Because of indications noted earlier, moreover, that the French and Italian

authorities were less tolerant of positive than negative deviations, we also show

the distributions of the positive, weak—currency deviations before and after the

agreement.

      The results of significance tests for these distributions are shown in

Table 4. The differenoes between the means are highly significant, and the z—

statistics are much larger than those in Tables 2A and 23 for the differences

between the final and previous subperiods (save for one involving the lira). The

differences between the means of the positive (weak—currency) deviations are

likewise very large. Furthermore, the Kolmorogov—Smirnov criterion rejects

decisively the null hypothesis that there was no significant change in exchange—

rate behavior after the Basle-Nyborg Agreement.11

                                   Who Done   It?
       We conclude by examining two objections to our main result, concerning the

 effects of the Baale-Nyborg Agreement. The first has to do with the effectiveness

 of intervention. If intervention is ineffective, especially when sterilized,

 differences between the distributions of exchange rates cannot possibly reflect

 a change in the strategy governing intervention. The second objection is more

general. The wider fluctuations of EMS exchange rates after the Basle—Nyborg

Agreement may reflect the influence of market forces rather than the influence

of intervention.

       It is not hard to defend the basic target-zone model against the first

objection. Because it relies on a monetary model of exchange—rate determination,

in which governments can influence exchange rates only by acting on the

fundamentals, it avoids the debate about the effectiveness of intervention. If

the fundamentals affect the exchange rate, then governments can affect it too,

by using nonsterilized intervention to alter the fundamentals. But intervention

in the EMS has not always acted on the fundamentals identified by the monetary

model, because some of it has been sterilized (see, e.g., Mastropasqua, Micossi,

and Rinaldi, 1988).

      The monetary model itself, however, depends on assumptions that have been

called into quemtion by empirical work. For a recent survey, see Boughton (1988).

Even if that were not so, moreover, there would be reason to believe that

intervention, even when sterilized, can influence exchange—rate behavior in the

short run. First, it can influence some of the fundamentals. Second, it can

influence expectations, including, but not exclusively, expectations about the

fundamentals. For evidence concerning both possibilities, see Dominguez (1990),

Dominguez and Frankel (1990), and the survey of earlier work in Kenen (1987).


                                       16
       The second objection is harder to answer. We have no way to prove that the

 large and frequent weak—currency deviations shown by the French franc in the

years after the Basle—Nyborg Agreement were not due to market forces——that the

 franc was not weaker intrinsically in those years than it was before. On that

hypothesis, however, one would expect less evidence of large—scale intervention

in the years before the Basle—Nyborg Agreement than in the years following.

       What can one say, then, about the amounts of intervention before and after

the Basle—Nyborg Agreement? Reserve statistics do not tell us very much, because

reserves can change for other reasons and may not always change when intervention

does take place. The problem is illustrated vividly by Mastropasqua, Micossi, and

Rinaldi (1988), who report changes in reserves (net of valuation changes) and

amounts of intervention by France, Germany, and Italy in 1983—1985 (figures in

billions of US dollars):

                                       Cumulative      Increase in
         Country                      Intervention       Reserves

         France                               2.?           9.6
         Germany                            —19.3           1.6
         Italy                               —3.1           0.8


      But Edison and lcaminsky (1990) have gathered data on the frequency of

French intervention during the subperiods studied in this paper, and we reproduce

them in Table 5. These data do not say anything about the volume of intervention

(and do not segregate instances of intervention related to conditions in the EMS

from instances related to other objectives, such as the aims of the Plaza and

Louvre Agreements). Nevertheless, they are suggestive. Intervention was far less

freguent in Period VI (which includes but does not coincide precisely with the

period after the Basle—Nyborg Agreement examined in Tables 3 and 4) than it was

in Periods III through IV, before the Basle-Nyborg Agreement.12 Thus, the data


                                       1?
indicate compliance with both objectives of the Baale—Nyborg Agreement——the

avoidance of prolonged bouts of intervention as well as making full use of the

band. The franc was allowed to display more weakness than it had before, by way

of the change in regime.

1.  This may help to explain why the French authorities abandoned their narrow—
band policy at times when the franc was very weak. By allowing the exchange rate
to move to the edge of the band, they forced the Bundesbank to intervene (and
could use the credit facilities of the EMS to finance their uwn interventions).

2. In light of the way in which eq. (1) is used below, however,        has to be
associated with the exogenous variables identified by the monetary model. This
is because the target—zone model represents official intervention as a change in
f1 rather than a change in e given        In other words, the target—zone model
ascribes the influence of intervention to its effect on the money supply. It
would perhaps be more realistic to regard     as a slowly moving repreeentation
of the domestic inflation rate, given the foreign rate, and to model two policy
responses: sterilized intervention in the foreign—exchange market to modify the
behavior of e, given the path of       and the adjustment of monetary policy to
modify gradually the path of f . This approach might also permit one to model
realignments realistically, rather than treat them as purely stochastic events,
as in Bertola and Svennson (1990). A realignment would occur when it was not
possible to keep et within the target zone by the use of intervention without
running out of reserves, but too costly to modify    in a way that would keep et
within the zone without the use of intervention.

3.   Exchange rates for the franc and lira have crossed the edges of their
bands on a few occasions. Some of these instances reflect the fact that our
data come from the Mew York market, not from European markets, and EMS central
banks are not required to intervene outside Europe to carry out their
obligations. In at least one instance, however, the Bank of France withdrew
from European exchange markets on the eve of a realignment, letting the franc
float, rather than use its reserves to defend a band that was about to change
(see, e.g., Ungerer, et al. 1990, p. 51). Finally, the Bank of France has not
always intervened on the scale required to force the franc into its new band
immediately after a realignment; had it driven the franc all the way into the
new band, it would have increased the profits of market participants who had
sold francs befure the realignment. This was a way to honor informally a well—
known rule, thst the new and old bands should overlap, when the actual size of
the realignment kept this from happening formally (see, e.g., Kenen 1988, ch.
3). Because the band for the lira was much wider than that for the franc, the
Italian authorities have been able to honor the rule formally; the new and old
bands have overlapped.

4. Svensson )1990a, 1990b) examines the implications of the target—zone model
for interest—rate differentials and goes on to show that Swedish data for
19B5—B9 provide some support for the model. Bertols and Caballero (1990),
however, find that Franco—German and Itslo—German interest—rate differentials
do not support a version of the model involving a credible commitment to
defend the bands; the interest—rate differentials tend to predict a further
depreciation of the franc and lira when the exchange rates approach the upper
edges of their bands.

5.  Klein and Lewis (1990) use 0M—dollar and yen—dollar data for the period
around the Louvre Accord of 1987 to identify market participants perceptions
regarding the width and position of the implicit target zone adopted for the
dollar. They find that the zone perceived by the market fluctuated
significantly through time and suggest that this may explain why EMS data do
not yield a time—invariant non—linear relationship. Published accounts
suggest, however, that the implicit zones for the 0M—dollar and yen—dollar
exchange rates varied in width as well as position and were less rigidly
defended than the EMS zones (see, e.g., Funabaehi, 1988, and Dobeon, 1991).
They were what Frenkel and Goldstein (1986) call 'soft" target zones and what
Pesenti (1990) calls "permeable" target zones.

6.   Bodnar and Leahy (1990) find evidence of an inverted half—s—shaped
relation between et and f consistent with the Bertola—Caballero hypothesis
concerning expectations aLout realignments. They also find, however, that
future realign— ments are discounted at a much higher rate than theory would
predict.

7. The realignments affecting the franc took effect on October 5, 1961, June
14, 1982, March 21, 1983, April 7, 1986, and January 12, 1987, which are the
starting dates for Periods II through VI in Table lA. The realignments
affecting the lira took effect on those same dates and on March 23, 1961 and
July 22, 1985, which are the starting dates for Periods II through VIII in
Table 13. The first period for each currency begins with the exchange—rate
quotation for January 2, 1980, although the previous realignment affecting the
franc and lira took effect on September 24, 1979. The last period for each
currency ends with the exchange—rate quotation for December 29, 1989.

8.   See note 3 above, which explained why the franc was allowed to remain
below its band right after somo realignments; the same strategy explains why
the Bank of France allowed the rate to remain at or near the lower (strong—
currency) edge of the band for several days or weeks after a realignment.

9.   For a fuller account, see Pratt and Gibbons (1981, ch. 17). It should be
noted that the test described above assumes that the data are independently
distributed. That is not true of the exchange—rate data studied here; they are
serially correlated.

10. Recall the point made by Ungerer et al. (1986), that central banks did
not begin immediately to keep their exchange rates well within the band but
adopted that strategy only when they came to believe that it might prevent
speculation from building up and might promote monetary stability.

11.   It should perhaps be noted that all of the results reported above cast
doubt on the validity of the procedure commonly used in testing the target—
zone model with EMS exchange—rate data. They warn that those data should not
be deemed to come from a single distribution. The differences between pairs of
means, however, lend some support to the approach adopted by Pesenti (1990),
who suggests that the EMS countries have been defending target rates
(different from the central rates), rather than defending target zones.
(Unfortunately, his hypothesis cannot be tested merely by comparing the mean
deviations from the central rates for the various subperiods; inspection of
the data in Figures lA and lB suggests that the target rates, if they existed,
changed within subperiods between realignments.)

12.    These data, however, may understate the relative frequency of
intervention in recent years, insofar as there has been a shift to the use of
EMS currencies rather than the U.S. dollar.
