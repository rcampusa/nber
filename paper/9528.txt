Knife Edge of Plateau: When Do Market Models Tip?

                                                 ABSTRACT

This paper studies whether agents must agglomerate at a single location in a class of models of two-sided
interaction. In these models there is an increasing returns effect that favors agglomeration, but also a crowding
or market-impact effect that makes agents prefer to be in a market with fewer agents of their own type. We
show that such models do not tip in the way the term is commonly used. Instead, they have a broad plateau
of equilibria with two active markets, and tipping occurs only when one market is below a critical size
threshold. Our assumptions are fairly weak, and are satisfied in Krugman’s [1991b] model of labor market
pooling, a heterogeneous-agent version of Pagano’s [1989] asset market model, and Ellison, Fudenberg and
Möbius’s [2002] model of competing auctions.

1. Introduction
       Many economic activities are agglomerated: people are crowded into a small
fraction of the Earth's land mass; individual industries are geographically concentrated;
trading is concentrated in a few marketplaces. The standard way to account for
concentration (and the arbitrariness of where activity concentrates) has been to propose
"tipping models" with three equilibria: one with most activity at location A; one with
most activity at B; and an unstable "knife-edge" equilibrium with exactly half of the
activity in each market. At the core of most models of agglomeration is some type of
increasing returns or "scale effect" that favors the emergence of a single dominant site.
In some of these models, all agents are ex-ante identical, and they all prefer to be part of
the larger market. In such cases, it is clear that an equilibrium where all markets are
exactly the same size is an unstable knife-edge; every agent would rather be in a market
with 51% of the agents than a market with 49%, so any departure from exactly equal
sizes leads to "tipping" to a single site. In other models, there are differences between the
agents, and while all agents prefer larger markets, they also prefer markets where the
other agents are less like themselves. For example, firms like markets with an excess of
workers, upstream firms like markets with many downstream firms, sellers of financial
assets like markets with many buyers, and men prefer a dating site that has many women.
In this two-sided case, there is a potential "market impact" or "competitive" effect that
may discourage agents from switching markets. We find that this can turn the "knife-
edge" of exactly equal shares into a "plateau" of many stable equilibria with unequal
market sizes, thus generalizing an observation that we made in the context of a model of
competing auctions in Ellison, Fudenberg, and Möbius [2002].
       For example, in Krugman's [1991b] labor pooling model, a firm that switches into
a market raises the average wage and so lowers the utility of all firms. Because of this
market impact effect, the equal-sizes configuration is not only an equilibrium, but a strict
equilibrium: If a buyer or seller were to switch to the other market he or she would find
that there were now more participants on his or her side of the market and no more on the
other, which would make it strictly less attractive. It is true that in Krugman's model, as
in many others, the market impact effect vanishes as the market becomes large. However,



                                              1
the scale effect that favors large markets also vanishes as the market becomes large, so it
is misleading to retain one of these effects and ignore the other unless one knows more
about the rates at which the two effects vanish.
       To investigate the importance of these effects, we study a model with two kinds
of agents, who we will call "buyers" and "sellers." At the start of the period, buyers and
sellers simultaneously choose between two possible locations or markets; their payoffs
are determined by the numbers of each type of agent who chose the same location. Our
assumptions are consistent with models where trade is voluntary and a market with only
one agent provides no opportunity for trade; and indeed this is a property of the examples
we study; in such cases there are always equilibria in which all agents concentrate in
either location. When the numbers of buyers and sellers are even, there is also an
equilibrium where the two markets are exactly the same size.
       Our main point is that the equal-sizes configuration need not be a knife-edge. We
provide sufficient conditions for there to be a wide range (a "plateau") of size ratios for
the two markets at which all of the incentive constraints for equilibrium are satisfied.
Roughly speaking, these conditions are that as the number of agents increases, the payoff
functions converge to well-defined limits that are continuous and differentiable, that the
derivatives of these limit payoff functions with respect to the ratio of various types of
agents be non-zero, and that the convergence to the limit occurs at rate at least 1/ N ,
where N is the total number of participants.
       Throughout the paper, we simplify by ignoring the restriction that the numbers of
each type of agent in each market should be integers. Anderson, Ellison, and Fudenberg
[2003] studies the additional complications caused by the restriction to integer values.
They show that for "typical" economies the conditions of this paper suffice for a plateau
of equilibria, but that there are examples where the integer restriction is inconsistent with
any split-market equilibrium at all.


       Section II of the paper states and discusses our general conditions, and gives our
theorem on the lower bound on the width of the plateau. We then show that the
conditions are satisfied in a series of examples. Specifically, Section III analyzes the
Krugman labor-pooling model mentioned above, Section IV analyzes a two-population



                                               2
version of Pagano [1989]'s model of competing financial markets. Section V gives
examples of how the assumptions can fail.
         We are agnostic as to whether the models we use as examples account for actual
agglomeration, but we do believe that models with an equilibrium plateau are needed to
account for some of the stylized facts. Consider, for example, patterns of industry
agglomeration. Even in the most concentrated industries one rarely finds that most
activity has tipped to one rather than to several locations. The upholstered furniture
industry, for example, is famous for its concentration in North Carolina, but only 74 of
the industry's 219 large plants are located there. Another 52 are in Mississippi and 27 are
in California.1 It does not seem reasonable to claim the 52 furniture plants in Mississippi
are consistent with a tipping model by arguing that they are serving local demand; nor
can one reasonably argue that tipping toward North Carolina has reached an upper bound
due to congestion, etc. – the upholstered furniture industry employs less than 1% of North
Carolina's workforce and the density of large furniture plants is about one per 658 square
miles of land.2 While "tipping" does not seem to be occurring between industry centers,
there do appear to be threshold effects at the bottom end: Nineteen states have exactly
zero large plants making upholstered furniture.3 A model with an equilibrium plateau
could account for the coexistence of multiple centers and for many locations having
tipped to having almost no activity.
         The reader should note that, under our assumptions, per-capita utility is about the
same in the "split markets" equilibria as when the economy has tipped to a single market.
Nevertheless, the aggregate welfare loss need not be negligible, and it is this aggregate
which influences the rents that might be earned by consolidating the markets. Moreover,
our focus is not on welfare per se, but rather on understanding the positive question of
whether we should expect agglomeration economies to lead to tipping.

1
  By "large plant" we mean a plant with at least 100 employees. The plant counts are taken from County
Business Patterns for 2000. The upholstered furniture industry is approximately at the 90th percentile in
Ellison and Glaeser's [1997] tabulation of industry agglomeration.
2
  It would also be difficult to argue that the secondary industry centers are a disequilibrium feature of a
market that is in the process of tipping. Dumais, Ellison, and Glaeser [2002] find that in the typical
agglomerated industry, there is mean reversion in the state-industry employment shares.
3
  Similar threshold effects appear in many less concentrated industries. For example, the pharmaceutical
manufacturing industry has about the mean level of agglomeration in Ellison and Glaeser's [1997]

2. The Model and Result
        We examine a simple two-stage model of location choice. In the first stage S
sellers and B buyers simultaneously choose whether to attend market 1 or market 2. In the
second stage, they play some game with the other players who have chosen to attend the
same market, e.g. they may trade at prices set by competing market makers or play some
wage-setting game. Rather than specifying the market game, we simply assume that if Si

sellers and Bi buyers attend market i, then the market game gives the sellers in market i

an expected payoff of us ( Si , Bi ) and the buyers an expected payoff of ub ( Si , Bi ) . We

treat the utility functions us ( S , B ) and ub ( S , B) as the primitives of our analysis.4

        A pure strategy Nash equilibrium of this model is a profile of location choices
such that each of the buyers and sellers receives at least as high a payoff in the market
they attend as they would if they had deviated and instead gone to the other market.
There will be two types of pure-strategy equilibria: equilibria where the market has
tipped and all buyers and sellers attend a single market, and equilibria in which both
markets are active. The goal of this section is to characterize the range of market sizes
that are possible in equilibria with two active markets. Our first result is immediate.


PROPOSITION 1: Let S1 , S 2 , B1 , and B2 be positive integers with S1 + S 2 = S and

       B1 + B2 = B . There is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium with Si sellers and Bi

      buyers choosing market i if and only if the following four constraints hold.
      (B1) ub ( S1 , B1 ) ≥ub ( S2 , B2 + 1)

      (B2) ub ( S 2 , B2 ) ≥ub ( S1 , B1 + 1)

      (S1) us ( S1 , B1 ) ≥us ( S2 + 1, B2 )

      (S2) us ( S2 , B2 ) ≥us ( S1 + 1, B1 )




tabulation with 37 of the 231 large plants in New Jersey, 31 in New York, 21 in California, 17 in North
Carolina, etc. Still, twenty-two states have one or fewer large plant.
4
  Assuming that these are well defined implicitly means either that the market game has a unique
equilibrium or that we have chosen a fixed equilibrium selection.


                                                     4
        As we remarked earlier, we will usually ignore the requirement that
S1 , S 2 , B1 , and B2 be integers. We will say that S1 , S 2 , B1 , and B2 are a quasi-equilibrium for

the model with S sellers and B buyers if S1 + S 2 = S , B1 + B2 = B , and the four constraints
above are satisfied.
        Our first step in analyzing the implications of these constraints is to note that they
can be rewritten as:


(B1′)   ub ( S2 , B2 ) −ub ( S2 , B2 + 1) ≥ ub ( S2 , B2 ) −ub ( S1 , B1 )

(S1′)   us ( S 2 , B2 ) −us ( S 2 + 1, B2 ) ≥ us ( S2 , B2 ) −us ( S1 , B1 )

(B2′)   ub ( S1 , B1 ) −ub ( S1 , B1 + 1) ≥ ub ( S1 , B1 ) −ub ( S2 , B2 )

(S2′)   us ( S1 , B1 ) −us ( S1 + 1, B1 ) ≥ us ( S1 , B1 ) −us ( S 2 , B2 )


        The left-hand sides of the two "stay-in-market-1" conditions (B1′) and (S1′)
measure the detrimental "market impact" that the agents have when they move to market
2. In most applications one would expect that the expressions will be positive, e.g. adding
one extra firm to a labor market raises the equilibrium wage and thereby reduces profits
or adding another seller to a financial market reduces the price that all sellers receive. The
right-hand sides measure the degree to which market 2 is more attractive given the
current division of buyers and sellers. Agglomeration models typically employ
assumptions that make larger markets are more efficient. As a result, one or both of the
right-hand sides of (B1') and (S1') will usually be positive when market 2 is larger than
market 1, but this is not necessary for our results. The rewritten equilibrium conditions
show that whether a particular split of buyers and sellers is an equilibrium depends on
whether the market impact effect is sufficiently large so as to outweigh the current
differences between the utilities in the two markets.
        The main assumption of our general theorem concerns the behavior of the market
as the number of agents increases holding the seller-buyer ratio γ ≡ S / B fixed. One can
think of it as imposing three restrictions. The first is that the sellers’ and buyers’ utility
functions in the large finite economies converge to well-defined limits as the number of
agents increases. The requirement that payoffs converge rules out some potential


                                                             5
applications. In Krugman’s [1991a] model of agglomeration due to increasing returns in
product variety, for example, each worker’s payoff increase without bound as the number
of agents grows.5 The second restriction is that in the continuum-of-players limit, each
buyer’s utility is strictly increasing in the proportion of agents who are sellers and vice
versa. While we view this requirement as not being very demanding, there are several
ways in which it can fail. Section V gives examples where strict monotonicity fails in all
finite markets, and an example where the monotonicity condition is satisfied in each
finite economy but fails in the limit. The third restriction is that the utility functions must
converge to the large population limit at a rate of at least 1/ B ; faster rates like 1/ B 2 are

allowed but slower rates such as 1/ B are not. This third restriction holds for all of the
models we have analyzed.


ASSUMPTION A1: There is a non-empty interval Γ = [ γ, γ ] ⊂ (0, ∞) and twice

       continuously differentiable functions Fs , Fb ,Gs , and Gb on Γ with dFs / d γ < 0 and
       dFb / dγ > 0 such that the approximations
               us (γ B, B) = Fs (γ ) − Gs (γ ) / B + o(1/ B)

       and
               ub (γ B, B ) = Fb (γ ) − Gb (γ ) / B + o(1/ B)

       hold uniformly in γ when B is large.6


          One might expect Gs and Gb to be positive, at least for large B, so that larger
markets provide higher payoffs, but even if larger markers are more efficient this need


5
  In the equilibrium of Krugman’s model, the number of "varieties" of manufactured goods that are
produced increases linearly with the number of workers. The workers’ utility is assumed to be a CES
aggregate of their consumption of each variety. It increases without bound as workers are able to divide
their consumption into smaller and smaller portions of a larger and larger number of goods. One could, of
course, write down many other reasonable specifications of a preference for product variety in which utility
would remain bounded even as the number of varieties produced grew without bound. For example, this
would happen in a model where each consumer has an ideal point in a fixed product space and varieties just
fill up the product space as their number becomes large.
6
  More formally, the assumption on the seller’s utility function is that there exists a function ms ( B ) with
lim ms ( B ) = 0 such that | B (u s (γ B , B ) − Fs (γ )) − Gs ( B ) |< ms ( B ) for all γ ∈ Γ and all integers B.
B →∞

not be true, as the size of the market can influence the division of the gains from trade.7
For this reason, we should emphasize that our results do not require any restrictions on
the signs of Gs and Gb .8 In particular, in cases where convergence to the limit is at rate
faster than 1/ B , the functions Gs and Gb will both be identically equal to 0.
        Our next proposition explores the implications of Assumption A1 at
configurations where the buyer-seller ratio is the same in both markets. In this case the
market-impact effects, which are the left-hand sides of the inequalities in part (a) of the
proposition, are proportional to 1/ B for large B. The scale effect is the difference in
utility in two markets of different sizes but the same seller-buyer ratios; Part (b) of the
proposition shows that the size of this effect declines at rate 1/ B as the population size
increases, and also goes to zero as the fraction α of agents in market 1 approaches 1/2.


PROPOSITION 2: Assume A1. Let α be any positive constant. Suppose that
γ ∈ Γ and that α1 , α 2 ∈ [α ,1 − α ] with α1 + α 2 = 1 . Let B1 = α1 B , B2 = α 2 B , S1 = γ B1 ,

      and S2 = γ B2 . Then,

      (a) The market impact effects can be approximated uniformly in γ , α1 , and α 2 by
                 us (Si , Bi ) − us (Si + 1, Bi ) = −Fs '(γ )/ αi B + o(1/ B )

      and
                 ub (Si , Bi ) − ub (Si , Bi + 1) = γFb '(γ )/ αi B + o(1/ B ) .
      (b) The scale effects can be approximated uniformly in γ , α1 , and α 2 by

                                                        (α2 − α1 ) 1
             us (γB2, B2 ) − us (γB1, B1 ) = Gs (γ )                 + o(1/ B )
                                                          α1α2 B

      and
                                                        (α2 − α1 ) 1
             ub (γB2, B2 ) − ub (γB1, B1 ) = Gb (γ )                 + o(1/ B )
                                                          α1α2 B

  For example, Schwartz and Ungo (2002) generalize an example in Ellison, Fudenberg and Möbius (2002)
to show that when the sellers in a market conduct an S+1st price auction and buyers values are
independently drawn from a distribution F with the monotone hazard rate property, then buyers in at least
one market are made worse off by the combination of two formerly separate markets.




                                                    7
Proof : The first approximation in part (a) follows immediately from
us (γ Bi, Bi ) − us (γ Bi + 1, Bi ) = us (γBi, Bi ) − us ((γ + 1/ Bi )Bi , Bi )
                                  = −Fs (γ + 1/ Bi ) + Fs (γ ) − (Gs (γ ) − Gs (γ + 1/ Bi ))(1/ Bi ) + o(1/ Bi )
                                  = −Fs '(γ )(1/ αi B ) + o(1/ B ).


The second follows from
           ub (γBi , Bi ) − ub (γ Bi , Bi + 1) = ub (γ Bi , Bi ) − ub (γ Bi (Bi + 1)−1(Bi + 1), Bi + 1)
           = γ Fb '(γ )(Bi + 1)−1 − Gb (γ )((Bi + 1)−1 − Bi −1 ) + Gb '(γ )γ(Bi + 1)−2 + o(1/ Bi )
           = γ Fb '(γ )/ αi B + o(1/ B ).


The argument for the first approximation in part (b) is
           us (γB2, B2 ) − us (γB1, B1 ) = −Gs (γ )[1/ B2 − 1/ B1 ] + o(1/ B )
           = (B2 − B1 )(B1B2 )−1Gs (γ ) + o(1/ B ) = Gs (γ )(α2 − α1 )/ α1α2B + o(1/ B ).
The argument for the second is the identical but with different subscripts. QED


          One way of analyzing agglomeration in a model like this is to ignore the market
impact effect and define a split-market equilibrium as an allocation of buyers and sellers
that makes them exactly indifferent between the two markets. With this definition, any
symmetric model will have an equilibrium where exactly half of the agents are in each
market, but this will typically be the only split-market equilibrium, and one can argue that
the model would tip away from this unstable knife-edge. This sort of argument implicitly
supposes that the market impact effect is small enough to be ignored, at least when the
number of agents is large. Part (a) of Proposition 2 shows that the market impact effect is
small in the sense of being order 1/ B , but part (b) of the proposition shows that it cannot
be ignored since it is no smaller than the scale effect.
          Our main theorem is a demonstration that the 50-50 equilibrium is not a “knife-
edge.” Instead, a model satisfying A1 has a "plateau" of quasi-equilibria where all of the
incentive constraints are satisfied, and the size of this plateau (as a fraction of the space

    Note that when both Gs and Gb are negative, larger markets are less efficient, which tends to favor

of possible market divisions) does not go to zero as the number of agents goes to infinity.
For example, it may be that no matter how large B is there is always a quasi-equilibrium
with one-third of the buyers in market 1 and two-thirds of the buyers in market 2.


THEOREM 1: Assume A1. Then for any ε > 0 there exists a B such that for any integer
       B > B and any integer S with S / B ∈ Γ the model with B buyers and S sellers has
      a quasi-equilibrium with B1 buyers in market 1 for every B1 with

                                                                                   1   1
       B1 / B ∈ [α * ( S / B) + ε ,1 − α * ( S / B) − ε ] , where α * (γ ) = max{0, − * } for
                                                                                   2 2r (γ )

Proof: We want to show that there exists a B such that for any integer B > B and
any γ ∈ Γ , the four constraints (S1′), (S2′), (B1') and (B2') are satisfied at the allocation

Bi = α i B and Si = α iγ B for every α1 ∈ [α * (γ ) + ε ,1 − α * (γ ) − ε ] . By symmetry it suffices

to show this for all α1 ∈ [α * (γ ) + ε ,1/ 2] .
         Our first step is to note that it suffices to show that four simpler constraints
obtained by applying first-order approximations to both sides of (S1′), (S2′), (B1'), and
(B2') are satisfied for all α1 , α 2 , and γ with γ ∈ Γ and α1 ∈ [α * (γ ) + ε ,1/ 2] . The four
simpler constraints are:
(AS1)              −Fs '(γ ) > Gs (γ )(α2 − α1 )/ α1
(AS2)             −Fs '(γ ) > Gs (γ )(α1 − α2 )/ α2
(AB1)             γFb '(γ ) > Gb (γ )(α2 − α1 )/ α1
(AB2)             γFb '(γ ) > Gb (γ )(α1 − α2 )/ α2
         The sufficiency of these four constraints is a straightforward consequence of
Proposition 2 and our various continuity and differentiability assumptions; Since the
arguments for each of the constraints are similar we show this only for (AS1) . Suppose

          We now show that the four constraints (AS1), (AS2), (AB1) and (AB2) are
satisfied for all γ ∈ Γ and all α1 ∈ [α * (γ ) + ε ,1/ 2] . We begin with the seller constraints,
showing they are satisfied by considering three cases.
          Case 1: Suppose Gs (γ ) ≥ 0 . Since Assumption A1 implies that −Fs' (γ ) is

positive, (AS2) is satisfied for all α1 ∈ [α * (γ ) + ε ,1/ 2] . (AS1) is equivalent to

 Gs (γ )    α1                      G (γ )          G (γ )
         <        . Defining rs = 2 s        +1 = 2 s        + 1 , this is equivalent
−Fs '(γ ) α2 − α1                  −Fs '(γ )       −Fs '(γ )

              α1                 1           1 1
to rs < 2              +1 =           or α1 > −    . We have chosen r * (γ ) so that r * (γ ) ≥ rs ,
            α 2 − α1          1 − 2α1        2 2rs
                              1 1
so α1 is bigger than           −    and (AS1) is satisfied whenever α1 ∈ [α * (γ ) + ε ,1 / 2] .

          Case 2: Suppose Fs '(γ ) < Gs (γ ) < 0 . In this case (AS1) is obviously satisfied.
                                           Gs (γ )                α2
Moreover, since −Fs '(γ ) > −Gs (γ ) ,              < 1 , while         > 1 all
                                           Fs '(γ )             α2 − α1

α1 ∈ [α * (γ ) + ε ,1/ 2] . Hence, (AS2) is satisfied.
          Case 3: Finally, suppose Gs (γ ) ≤ Fs '(γ ) < 0 . As in the second case, (AS1) is
                                                 Gs (γ )    α2
obviously satisfied. (AS2) is equivalent to              <        . In this case,
                                                 Fs '(γ ) α2 − α1

           Gs (γ )        G (γ )                                    α2            1
rs = 2              +1 = 2 s       − 1 , so (AS2) becomes rs < 2          −1 =         . As in
          −Fs '(γ )       Fs '(γ )                               α 2 − α1      1 − 2α1

                                             1 1
the first case, this is equivalent to α1 >    −    and we have chosen r * (γ ) so that this is
                                             2 2rs

true for α1 ∈ [α * (γ ) + ε ,1/ 2] .
          A nearly identical argument shows that (AB1) and (AB2) are satisfied if

      1     1               G (γ )

Remarks:
1. The size of the quasi-equilibrium plateau identified in theorem 1 is decreasing in the
ratios −2Gs (γ ) / Fs' (γ )+1 and 2Gb (γ ) / γ Fb' (γ )+1 . (More precisely, it is decreasing in

whichever of the two is the binding constraint provided that the equilibrium plateau is not
the entire space.) Intuitively, the scale effect, which is proportional to G, favors tipping,
while the market impact effect is proportional to the derivative of F and makes the
plateau larger. Inspection of the formula in the theorem reveals that the quasi-
equilibrium plateau converges to the full interval as Gs (γ ) / Fs' (γ ) → 0 and




                                                 11
    Gb (γ ) / Fb' (γ ) → 0 ; here the scale effect is absent. The equilibrium plateau shrinks to

zero in the limit as either ratio goes to infinity.
2. The theorem provides sufficient but not necessary conditions for the existence of
quasi-equilibria, and the proof considers only allocations with the same seller/buyer ratio
in each market. We can establish a partial converse: If α ∉ [α * (γ ),1 − α * (γ )] then for B
large the model with B buyers and S sellers does not have an equilibrium with exactly
equal seller/buyer ratios in the two markets.9 In general, though, only one of the four
constraints is binding at α * (γ ) , and the range of splits for which there is a quasi-
equilibrium is somewhat larger when the seller/buyer ratios in the two markets are
allowed to differ. In Ellison, Fudenberg, and Möbius [2002] we give an exact
characterization for the quasi-equilibrium set for the case of competing auctions when
buyers' valuations have the uniform distribution. We show that the actual lower bound on
the size of the smaller market is strictly smaller than the lower bound established here,
but that the two lower bounds converge as the seller-to-buyer ratio increases towards 1.

3. The theorem applies to quasi-equilibria as opposed to equilibria because it ignores the
constraint that the numbers of sellers in each market be integer-valued. One might expect
that this integer constraint is not very demanding in large economies, but its implications
turn out to be fairly complex. Ellison, Fudenberg and Möbius (2002) show that in the
case of competing auctions, when the number of buyers is large and S = γ B , then for any
point in the quasi-equilibrium set there is a γ ' close to γ for which the model with B
buyers and γ ' B sellers has an equilibrium that is close to the given point. This, however,
leaves open the possibility that there might not be equilibria for many or even most
values of B and S. Anderson, Ellison, and Fudenberg [2003] show that there is indeed a
broad plateau of equilibria for B sufficiently large whenever B / S approaches almost any
value of γ , but that there are nongeneric sequences (S n , B n ) for which the models with
S n sellers and B n buyers have no equilibria with two active markets. We conclude that
the results we derive in this paper about the sizes of the quasi-equilibrium plateaus do
reflect what would we would find in a full equilibrium analysis in generic economies.

    To see this, observe that when α (γ ) > 0 , at any allocation with the same seller-buyer ratio in both

markets, at least one of the buyer or seller constraints is violated for sufficiently large B when α < α (γ ) .

3. Krugman’s Labor Market Pooling Model
        Our first example is Krugman’s [1991b] labor market pooling model of industry
agglomeration. In this model, the advantage of industry agglomeration is that each firm
can better adjust its employment level in response to idiosyncratic productivity shocks.10
        We treat the model as a two-stage game. In the first stage, F firms and L workers
choose between two possible locations. In the second stage each firm i receives an
independent productivity shock, ε i , which is assumed to have mean zero and variance

σ 2 . Firms observe these shocks and then hire workers from the pool at their location. If
firm i hires Li workers at a wage of w , then its profits are

π i = α + ( β + ε i ) Li − (δ / 2) L2i − wLi .11 Workers are risk-neutral and supply one unit of
labor inelastically; their utility is their money wage.
        Suppose that F firms and L workers are in a given market. Following Krugman,
we suppose that firms are price takers in the labor market. Each firm’s labor demand is
easily derived from the first-order condition for profit maximization, yielding

L*i ( w) = ( β + ε i − w) / δ .12 The market-clearing wage is w* = β − δ ( L / F ) + ∑ j =1 ε j / F .
                                                                                              F



        At the start of the second stage, before the productivity shocks are revealed, we
see that a worker’s expected utility is
                                    uw ( L, F ) = E ( w* ) = β − δ ( L / F )

Firm i’s labor demand at the market-clearing wage is

           (                                )
L*i ( w* ) = ε i + δ ( L / F ) − ∑ j =1 ε j / F / δ . Substituting this into firm i’s profit function and
                                F




taking expectations we find after some algebra that




10
   Krugman cites Marshall’s [1920] discussion (which notes both that larger markets may provide workers
with insurance and that firms may benefit from access to skilled labor) as the inspiration for his model.
11
   Our notation departs slightly from Krugman’s. We write δ for the parameter he called γ so that we can
use γ for the ratio L / F .
12
   Note that some firms may employ a negative number of workers; we follow Krugman in not worrying
about this and thereby keeping the model tractable. Note also that the labor demands need not be integers;
this can be interpreted as workers splitting their time between several jobs.


                                                      13

        Writing γ for L / F (which is analogous to the seller-buyer ratio in the labor
market), these utility functions have the form
                                      uw ( L, F ) = Fw (γ ) − Gw (γ ) / F
                                      u f ( L, F ) = Ff (γ ) − G f (γ ) / F

                                                        σ2 δ 2                 σ2
for Fw (γ ) = β − δγ , Gw (γ ) = 0, Ff (γ ) = α +         + γ , and G f (γ ) =    . Note that
                                                        2δ 2                   2δ
Fw '(γ ) = −δ < 0 and Ff '(γ ) = δγ > 0. Hence, Assumption 1 is satisfied for any γ .14

        Now we analyze the choice of location in the first stage. As in our general model,
we suppose that agents take their market impact into account when choosing a location;
this contrasts with Krugman's analysis, which directly defines equilibrium to mean that
expected profits and wages are equal in the two markets.15 Although our solution concept
does not require that wages be equalized, expected wages are the same in both markets in
the equilibria we analyze.16
        Theorem 1 now implies that this model has a plateau of equilibria with two active
markets, and gives a characterization of how unequal in size the two markets can be.

   This formula corrects an error in Krugman’s equation (C.10).
14
   The example satisfies Assumption A1 even though the firm profit function need not be monotone in F.
15
   This is equivalent to assuming that both firms and workers ignore their market impact. An alternate way
to justify Krugman's solution would be to consider a game where firms choose locations first, workers then
choose locations, and there is a continuum of workers so each worker has no market impact. A problematic
aspect of this justification is the contrast between assuming that workers migrate instantly across the two
markets to arbitrage away any expected wage differences due to unexpected plant location choices, but are
immobile when productivity shocks are realized and wages become different. Our analysis corresponds to
the case where workers are stuck in the locations they choose and can neither relocate in response to
expected wage differences if they are surprised by firms' location decisions, nor in response to realized
wage differences; our qualitative findings should carry over to models with anything less than perfect
mobility.
16
   Wages are equal in equilibrium, but not following a deviation from the equilibrium.

       F1 / F ∈ [α * + ε ,1 − α * − ε ] .

Proof: Since Gw (γ ) = 0, and G f (γ ) > 0 , the width of the plateau is determined by the

firms’ incentive constraint, and we find that r * (γ ) = 2G f (γ ) / Ff' (γ )γ + 1 = σ 2 / δ 2γ 2 + 1 ,

                                                        σ2
and α * = σ 2 / 2δ 2γ 2 / (1 + σ 2 / δ 2γ 2 ) =                    .

Remarks:
1. The equilibrium plateau can cover almost the whole space, that is, a market with a tiny
fraction of the firms can coexist with a large one. This occurs when productivity shocks
are very small ( σ 2 ≈ 0 ), when there are strong decreasing returns at the firm-level
( δ → ∞ ), or when the worker-firm ratio is large ( γ → ∞ ). When the parameters are at
the opposite extremes, the equilibrium plateau shrinks down to a point. Intuition for each
result can be obtained by comparing the market impact of a firm that moves to the larger
market, thus bidding up wages, to the advantage of larger markets, namely that a firm
has a smaller wage impact when raising or lowering labor demand in response to its
productivity shock. For example, when there are strong decreasing returns ( δ large),
there is little advantage to being in a large market because a firm won’t want to increase
or decrease its labor demand very much in response to a productivity shock, and a firm
would bid up wages substantially if it moved to the larger market because the other firms’
labor demands are inelastic.
2. Although we would be hesitant to put much stock in any calibration of this model, one
way to try to do so would be to note that the ratio of parameters that determines the size
of the equilibrium plateau also determines the variability of firm-level employment.
Specifically, Var ( L*i / E ( L*i ) ) = (( F − 1) / F ) 2 σ 2 / δ 2γ 2 . If one assumed that Var ( L*i / E ( L*i ) )

was 1 when F = 10 , then α * ≈ 0.28 ; this says that the smaller market needs to be about
three-eighths of the size of the larger market to be viable ( 0.28 / 0.72 ≈ 0.38 ).
3. Corollary 1 does not include an assumption that the number of firms be sufficiently
large. Theorem 1 required an assumption about the number of buyers being large only



                                                        15
because we assumed just that the utility functions were approximately equal to
F (γ ) − G (γ ) / B when B was large. In this application, the expressions for the utility
functions are exact, and hence the formula for the bounds on the equilibrium plateau
holds for all F.17
4. In the quasi-equilibria described in Corollary 1 the workers receive exactly equal
utility in both markets. Thus, they would still be quasi-equilibria if workers did not
consider their market impact. This would be the appropriate assumption if one modeled
the workers as a continuum of agents of mass L.
5. In the Krugman model with a continuum of workers of mass L, only the number of
firms in each market must be an integer, and hence all of the quasi-equilibria described in
the corollary are equilibria. An alternate way to state the corollary would be to say that
the model with F firms and a mass L of workers has an equilibrium with F1 workers in

market 1 for any integer F1 with F1 / F ∈ [α * + ε ,1 − α * − ε ] .
6. The generalization of the result to a model with N locations (and a continuum of
workers) would be that there exists an equilibrium with F1 firms in market 1, F2 firms in

market 2, …, and FN firms in market N provided that every market has either zero firms

or at least α * /(1 − α * ) times as many firms as the largest market.


4. Pagano's Security Market Model with Heterogeneous Traders
         Our next example is a two-population version of Pagano's [1989] model of
competing securities markets. In Pagano’s model markets serve to diversify endowment
risk. Specifically, he considered a two-stage game. In the first stage, N agents
simultaneously choose which of two markets to attend. In the second stage, each agent i
receives a random endowment K 0i = K 0 + ei of a single risky asset, where the ei are

i.i.d. draws from a symmetric distribution with mean 0 and variance σe2 . Agents then
trade by simultaneously submitting demand curves to a market maker who executes
trades at the market-clearing price. The asset pays a random dividend d, so an agent who

17
  The bounds are exact bounds for the existence of an equilibrium with equal worker-firm ratios in the two
markets. There are equilibria with unequal worker-firm ratios (with a higher ratio in the smaller market) for
smaller values of α .

keeps K i shares has random final wealth wi = dK i + Rp(K 0i − K i ) , where p is the

market price of the asset and R is the risk-free rate of return. Both p and asset demands
are allowed to be negative, and there is not free disposal.
            We modify Pagano’s model by replacing the assumption that K 0 is the same for

all N agents with the assumption that S "sellers" have K 0 = 1 and B "buyers" have

K 0 = −1 ; this sort of ex-ante asymmetry in expected purchases seems reasonable for

some applications. (As will be clear shortly, the names "buyer" and "seller" are only
suggestive, as a "seller" with a negative endowment shock may end up purchasing shares,
and a "buyer" may sell them.) To simplify the algebra, we will specialize to the case
where the dividend has a symmetric distribution with mean 0 and variance σ 2 .18 This
means that the asset is a "bad," but preserves the key aspect of the model, which is that
larger markets are more efficient because there is less undiversifiable social risk;
allowing for a positive dividend would only complicate the algebra without altering the
nature of our conclusions.
            As in Pagano, we suppose that agents’ preferences over distributions of wealth are
described by a mean-variance utility function defined directly on the space of wealth
distributions V (wi ) = E (wi ) − (b / 2)Var (wi ) . Further following the original, we look for
a symmetric equilibrium in which the agents simultaneously submit linear demand
functions Di (p) .19 In the equilibrium we find firm i submits the demand curve

Di (p) = K 0i /(N − 1) − R(N − 2)p /(N − 1)bσ 2 . 20 Equilibrium asset holdings are
                                                                                             N

      Di ( p ) is the agent’s desired asset holding, e.g. if Di ( p ) = K 0i then agent i makes no trades. Note that
Di ( p ) will depend on K 0i . To replicate Pagano’s results we assume that agents maximize their mean-
variance utility in the first stage, but not in the second. In the second stage, they instead maximize the
expectation over all possible realizations of the vector of endowment shocks of their expected utility
conditional on the shocks. This would be equivalent to expected utility maximization if mean-variance
preferences were an expectation of a utility function defined on realized wealth, but they are not.
20
   The details of this and subsequent calculations are in the Appendix. The calculations show that this is the
unique equilibrium in which agents’ demand curves are linear and downward sloping. We do not know if
there are other equilibria. Klemperer and Meyer [1989] discuss conditions sufficient for equilibrium
uniqueness in a loosely related game where agents submit supply functions.

net supply of the asset. Thus, equilibrium allocations are better diversified when N is
larger; agents offset their endowment shocks more completely because the sum of the
other N − 1 agents' demand curves is steeper and the aggregate endowment risk they
share is also smaller. This is the source of the larger market’s efficiency advantage.
To simplify notation, let q(γ ) = (γ − 1)/(γ + 1) . A series of calculations shows that the

         Thus, both the seller’s and buyer's utility functions have the form
F (γ ) − G (γ )/ B + o(1/ B ) assumed in assumption A1. Specifically,

Fs (γ ) = bσ 2 q(γ )2 / 2 − q(γ ) , Fb (γ ) = bσ 2 q(γ )2 / 2 + q (γ ) ,

Gs (γ ) = bσ 2 σe2 + 4q(γ )2b 2σ 2σe2 + b 2σ 2 (σe2 + σe4 ) − 2q(γ ) / 2(γ + 1) ,

and
Gb (γ ) = bσ 2 σe2 + 4q(γ )2b 2σ 2σe2 + b 2σ 2 (σe2 + σe4 ) + 2q(γ ) / 2(γ + 1) .

Thus Fs '(γ ) = −4bσ 2 (γ + 1)−3 < 0 , and Fb '(γ ) = 4γbσ 2 (γ + 1)−3 > 0 , so assumption
A1 is satisfied for any γ . The seller's market impact effect reflects that sellers expect to
sell shares, and that adding a seller to a market lowers the expected price. Note that as B
goes to infinity, the total expected welfare in the population (summing over buyers and
sellers) converges to −bσ 2q(γ )2 / 2 , which is the utility of holding the average
endowment.
         We can now immediately apply Theorem 1 to show that our two-sided version of
Pagano’s model has a plateau of equilibria in which different-sized markets coexist. The
algebra is simplest if there are equal numbers of buyers and sellers (i.e. γ = 1 ). We then

have Gs (γ ) / − Fs '(γ ) = Gb (γ ) / γ Fb '(γ ) = (σ e2 + b 2σ 2 (σ e2 + σ e4 ) ) / 2 . This gives




                                                         18
COROLLARY 2. Consider our Pagano model with equal numbers of buyers and sellers.
      Let r * = 1 + σ e2 + b 2σ 2 (σ e2 + σ e4 ) , and let α * = 1/ 2 − 1/ 2r * . Then, for any ε > 0 there

      exists an N such that for all N > N the equilibrium set of the model with N sellers
      and N buyers includes the splits with N1 buyers and sellers in market 1 for every

       N1 with N1 / N ∈ [α * + ε ,1 − α * − ε ] .
Remarks:
1. The size of the equilibrium plateau is inversely related to the size of the endowment
shocks. When the endowment shocks are trivial ( σ e2 ≈ 0 ), efficiency differences are
unimportant and a market need only have a tiny fraction of the traders to be viable. When
endowment shocks become extremely large ( σ e2 → ∞ ), or dividend shocks become

extremely large ( σ 2 → ∞ ) or agents become extremely risk-averse ( b → ∞ ) markets can
coexist only if they are almost equal in size. To interpret the scale of the variances, note
that we have assumed that the mean endowment of a seller is 1 and the mean endowment
of buyer is –1. If σ e2 = 1 and b 2σ 2 = 0.1 then the interval in the corollary is
approximately (0.27, 0.73), so a market would need to have about one-quarter of the
traders to be viable.21
2. The second remark after Theorem 1 implies that these bounds are tight. If α is strictly
outside the specified interval, then for sufficiently large B there will not be an equilibrium
with α B buyers in market 1.


5. Some Models that Don’t Fit the Assumptions
         In this section we discuss a few models of agglomeration that don’t fit into our
framework, explain why they don’t fit, and suggest ways in which they might be
modified so that an analysis like ours would apply.


A. A Matching Model


21
  Calibrating a mean-variance utility function can be problematic. For example, even with b = 0.1 a
decision-maker would prefer getting 0 for sure to getting a lottery ticket that pays 0 with probability 1 − p
and 100 with probability p for any p < 0.8 .


                                                      19
           Consider a matching model with two types of agents, men (type m) and women
(type w). Each participant has exogenous probability q > 0 of becoming unable to
participate, and these chances are independent across agents. To simplify the algebra, we
suppose that each type of agent gets utility 1/(1 − q ) if matched with an agent of the
other type, and utility 0 otherwise. Thus in the continuum limit, an agent who is sure to
be matched if he participates has expected payoff of (1 − q )/(1 − q ) = 1 , and in general,
if there are M agents of type m and W agents of type w, the utilities of the men and
women are min(1,1/ γ ) and min(1, γ ) , respectively, where γ = M /W .
           In the finite markets, let M ' and W ' be the realized numbers of agents of each
type who are able to participate, and let x = M '−W ' be the realized excess supply of
                                                           W '          
men. Then the payoffs are um (γ ) = Pr(x ≤ 0) + Pr(x > 0)E       | x > 0 and
                                                            M '        
                                 M '         
uw (γ ) = Pr(x ≥ 0) + Pr(x < 0)E      | x < 0 . The excess supply is the difference of
                                 W '        
two binomials with the same success probability but different sample sizes, so holding
the ratio γ to be fixed and greater than 1, and sending M and W to infinity,
limM →∞ Pr(x ≤ 0) = o(1/ M ) . 22 Thus for the case γ > 1 ,

um (M ,W ) = 1/ γ + o(1/ M ) and uw (M ,W ) = 1 − o(1/ M ) , and the utility of the agents
on the "short side" of the market does not satisfy Assumption A1, as it is insensitive to
γ.
           Two aspects of the model are noteworthy. First, convergence to the continuum
limit is at a faster rate than the 1/ N rate required by Assumption A1. This is consistent
with A1, as it corresponds to the case where the functions Gs and Gb are both 0. Second,
although both players care about the "buyer-seller" ratio γ when there are a finite number
of agents, this is not true in the continuum limit. The limit of the women’s utility, Fw (γ ) ,

is one for any γ > 1 . This is not consistent with A1's requirement that the functions Fs
and Fb have non-zero derivatives. One way to modify the model to make it compatible


22
     In fact, Chernoff's theorem (Billingsley 1995, p. 151) shows that the limM →∞ Pr(x ≤ 0) ≤ ρ M for some
constant ρ < 1 , so that the convergence is (at least) exponentially fast.


                                                      20
with A1 might be to assume that a woman’s expected payoff from a match is increasing
in M / W because the women are able to select from the available men.


B. Preference for Variety
         Consider the following greatly simplified version of Gehrig [1998]. In the first
stage, S firms and B consumers choose one of two locations. The firms at each location
are then placed uniformly around a Hotelling circle of possible products and the
consumers draw ideal points from a uniform distribution. Firms play a standard
competition-on-a-circle pricing game.
         Assume that the transportation cost parameter is such that the equilibrium price in
a market with S firms is p* = c + 1/ S . Each firm in expectation sells to 1/ S of the

consumers, so the firm’s profit function is us ( S , B) = B / S 2 . The consumer’s expected
utility would be his or value, minus the price, minus an expected mismatch cost,
ub ( S , B) = v − (c + 1/ S ) − 1/(2S ) .
         Neither of these functions satisfies A1. On the firm side, profit is converging to
zero as S → ∞ with B / S fixed so Fs (γ ) = 0 . This prevents the application of theorem 1,
but a direct analysis of the seller’s incentive constraints (S1′) and (S2′) shows that they
are satisfied with equal buyer-seller ratios in the two markets over an interval of sizes,
just as in the proof of Theorem 1 .
         On the consumer side, utility is converging to Fb (γ ) = v − c , which is independent

of γ . More fundamentally, even in the finite case buyers don’t care about how many
other buyers are in the market, and the (B1′) and (B2′) constraints are satisfied only if
S1 = S2 . Substituting this into the sellers’ constraints yields

1 + 2 / S1 + 1/ S12 ≥ B1 / B2 ≥ 1 − 2 / S1 − 1/ S12 , so that as S goes to infinity, the set of ratios

α = B1 / B2 that are consistent with equilibrium collapses to the knife-edge α = 1 . To
modify this model so that it had an equilibrium plateau, a buyer market-impact effect
would be necessary. For example, adding a buyer to a market would reduce the utility of
the other buyers if there were congestion costs or if firms had increasing marginal costs.




                                                  21
C. Preference for Variety II
         Fujita [1988] develops a general equilibrium model of spatial agglomeration (with
a continuum of locations) in which a preference for being able to buy a variety of
products locally is offset by higher land prices in the city center. A greatly simplified
two-location version of this model with a sufficient amount of land per agent would tip to
having all consumers and firms in one location.
         It would fail to satisfy our assumptions for a couple reasons. First, Fujita assumes
that the preference for the variety is such that a consumer who purchases a small quantity

xi of each good i at a price of pi receives utility ub = ∑ i =1 − xi log( xi ) − xi pi . This utility
                                                                           S



function increases like log( S ) as the agent is able to divide his or her consumption
among a larger number of goods (at a constant price). When utility increases without
bound, the set of interior equilibrium will typically collapse to a knife-edge. For example,
if the seller’s utility has the form us ( S , B ) = K ( B ) ( Fs (γ ) − Gs (γ ) / B ) , then when

B2 = (1/ 2 + ε ) B and the market impact effect is

us ( S2 , B2 ) − us ( S2 + 1, B2 ) ≈ 2 K ( B2 ) Fs '(γ ) / B(1 + 2ε ) ≈ 2( K ( B / 2) + ε K '( B / 2)) Fs '(γ ) / B(1 + 2ε )
and the scale effect is
us ( S 2 , B2 ) − us ( S1 , B1 ) ≈ ( K ( B2 ) − K ( B1 ) ) Fs (γ ) ≈ 2ε BK '( B / 2) Fs (γ ) . Holding ε fixed, the

market impact effect will be smaller than the scale effect for large B if B 2 K '( B) / K ( B)

diverges. This ratio is B / log( B) if K ( B) = log( B) , and is aB if K ( B) = B a .
         Second, the primary market impact that a firm or consumer has when moving to a
market is that he increases the land rent. If land is sufficiently plentiful, then the
equilibrium rent would always be the value of land in its alternate use, agriculture, which
is assumed constant. Hence, there would be no market impact effect. To create a market
impact effect, one could modify the model so that consumers and firms had to outbid a
heterogeneous population of farmers for land.


6. Conclusion
         This paper shows that Assumption A1 is sufficient for market models to have a
plateau of quasi-equilibria. The assumption also yields an easily computed formula that
provides a lower bound on the “width” of this plateau. In our opinion, Assumption A1 is


                                                         22
not very restrictive; it applies to many if not most market models, including those of
Krugman [1991b] and a two-type version of Pagano [1989]. The leading cases where it
fails are when in the continuum limit, some agents are indifferent about the ratio of
“buyers” to “sellers,” and when per agent payoffs converge to zero or infinity as the
number of agents goes to infinity.
       That said, the generality of Assumption A1 and the simplicity of Theorem 1 have
been obtained by leaving our results incomplete in a couple ways. First of all, the
sufficient conditions in Theorem 1 apply to quasi-equilibria with exactly the same
buyer/seller ratio in each market; this leaves open the question of how much broader the
quasi-equilibrium plateau is when one also considers the possibility of quasi-equilibria in
which the buyer-seller ratios differ. Ellison, Fudenberg, and Möbius [2002] provides a
detailed analysis of the case of competing uniform-price auctions, in which each buyer
purchases a single unit, and the price in a market with k goods for sale is the (k+1)st
highest buyer value.
       Secondly, Theorem 1 concludes that the incentive constraints are satisfied, but
does not reveal when these constraints can be satisfied along with the constraints that the
numbers of each type of agent in each market should be integers; these constraints are
addressed in Anderson, Ellison and Fudenberg [2003].
       We have written this paper to emphasize that even when larger markets are more
efficient there will typically still be a plateau of equilibria with two active markets. Our
assumptions also encompass models in which there are no scale effects, and even some
models in which larger markets give lower payoffs to both buyers and sellers, e.g.
because of crowding effects. One implication of our theorem is that as long as the
crowding effects are no stronger than is allowed under assumption A1 there will be an
equilibrium plateau that includes splits in which some markets are substantially larger
than others. Hence, the observation that an activity is concentrated in a small number of
locations need not imply that there are increasing rather than decreasing returns to
agglomeration.




                                             23
                                                          Appendix


          We follow Pagano in assuming agents have mean-variance preferences over
wealth distributions and maximize their utility when choosing between markets in the
first stage. Also following Pagano, we suppose that in the second stage, agents choose the
demand function D( p) that maximizes the expected value of what their conditional
preferences would be if they knew the full vector of endowments but did not know the
random dividend.23
          Write Z − i ≡ ∑ j ≠i K 0 j for the aggregate endowment of all agents other than i.

Consider the possibility of an equilibrium in which each agent j submits the linear
demand curve D j ( p) = AK 0 j − mp .24 The sum of the demand curves submitted by agent

i’s opponents is then AZ −i − ( N − 1)mp . Thus, the ability to submit a demand curve gives

agent i the power to choose the quantity of the risky asset K i ( Z − i ) that he will receive

conditional on every realization of Z − i .25 If agent i receives allocation K i in state Z − i then

the market-clearing condition AZ −i − ( N − 1)mp + K i = Z − i + K oi implies that the price

must be P ( K i , Z − i ) = −((1 − A) Z − i + K 0i − K i ) /( N − 1)m . Hence, the expectation over the
endowment shocks of agent i’s mean-variance utility conditional on the endowment
shock when he receives allocation K i ( Z − i ) is

      
           (                                                         )    b

where we have written P ( Z − i ) for P ( K i ( Z − i ), Z − i ) .


23
  Since the equilibrium prices are fully revealing, this would be utility maximizing behavior for agents
with standard expected-utility preferences. Mean-variance utility, however, does not have the property that
V ( w) = EZ (V ( w | Z )) , so the assumed behavior is not utility-maximizing; we regard it as a "behavioral"
assumption.
24
   We will see that there is always an equilibrium of this form.
25
   This is true provided that K i ( Z − i ) and (1 − A) Z − i − K i ( Z − i ) are monotone increasing. To obtain
allocation K i ( Z − i ) agent i can submit the downward-sloping demand curve




                                                               24
            To maximize this expectation over all functions K i ( Z − i ) , one can maximize the

expression within the brackets, i.e. maximize over K i for each Z − i . For a fixed Z − i the
expression for the conditional mean-variance utility inside the brackets simplifies to

                                                                        ∂K i                 K i* ( Z − i )

            To complete the derivation we need to find the demand curve that produces this
allocation and use the equilibrium condition Di* ( p) = AK 0i − mp to solve for A and m.

Writing X for the denominator in the equation for K i ( Z − i ) , the price in state Z − i that
corresponds with this allocation is
