                 The Implications of Mean—Variance
                Optimization for Four Questions in
                    Tnt ernat ional Macroeconomics


                                ABSTRACT




     The hypothesis that investors optimize with respect to the mean and

variance of their end—of—period wealth has powerful implications for some

standard questions of interest to international macroeconotnists. The impli-

cations transcend the particular econometric technique used to estimate the

return variance—covarjance matrix.

     (1) For conventional estimates of risk—aversion, substitutability between

domestic and foreign securities is close to perfect in the sense that   risk
premiums are small in magnitude (a few basis points), and thus cannot explain

much bias in forward rates. (2) Nevertheless, as long as risk—aversion is

not zero, foreign exchange intervention still affects the level of the

exchange rate. If interest rates are held constant, the effect is proportionate

to the contemporaneous change in asset supplies, and is more—than—proportionate

if the expectations of future asset supplies also change. (3) Current account

deficits have effects that are comparable to, though smaller in magnitude than,

the effects of equal—sized changes in asset supplies through intervention or

government borrowing. (4) The perceived tendency for dollar depreciation to

be associated with appreciation of the mark against the franc is not consistent

with the implication of mean—variance optimization that the franc should be

a closer substitute for the dollar than is the mark.

       Many   important     questions in international finance depend critical-

ly on the nature of the exchange risk premium, defined as the expected

rate of return on foreign assets relative to domestic assets. But the

risk premium has proven to be a difficult variable to get a handle on em-

pirically. In past work, in order to bring more structure to bear on the

problem of the risk premium, I have made the assumption that investors

diversify their portfolios so as to optimize with respect to the mean and

variance of their wealth. But the contribution proved to be a negative

one in that, using my econometric technique to impose the constraint of

mean—variance optimization, I was unable to reject the hypothesis that

investors were risk—neutral and that the risk premium therefore did not

exist.' A failure to reject a null hypothesis could always be attribut-

able to low power in the test. Furthermore, one criticism that could be

and other assets could be accurately measured, a questionable assumption.

       We will see in this paper that the hypothesis of mean—variance op-

timization is sufficiently powerful to have important implications that

transcend specific techniques of data computation or econometric estima-

tion. The hypothesis turns out to imply that the exchange risk premium,

even assuming it exists, is extremely small in magnitude. When the sup-

ply of foreign assets is increased by one percent of world wealth——a

large number——the effect on the risk premium is only on the order of .02

percent, or 2 basis points. (By comparison, the forward discount on the

dollar against the mark or yen was about 300 basis points as of early

1985.) This calculation assumes a coefficient of relative risk—aversion

of 2 and a standard deviation for international returns of 10 percent.

Even if these parameters are estimated at levels several times higher,

the implied effects on the risk premium are still of a negligibly small

magnitude. One implication, the answer to the first question considered

below, is that the risk premium is relatively unimportant for evaluating

tests of efficiency in the forward exchange market.

       It does not follow, however, that imperfect substitutability be-

tween domestic and foreign bonds is unimportant for all questions of in-

terest. Another way of stating the conclusion——the proposition that

changes in asset supplies need have only small effects on the risk premi-

um to be willingly absorbed into the market——is to say that small changes

in the risk premium have large effects on asset demands and therefore on

the exchange rate. We will see that the framework of optimal portfolio

diversification is a useful one in which to examine some standard ques-

tions regarding the determination of exchange rates. Often it will be

possible to get interesting quantitative results that are not sensitive

to the precise techniques used for measuring asset supplies or estimating

variances and covariances.

                               2.   FOUR QUESTIONS



     Question 1.     Can risk premiums account for findings of a nonrandom

                     component in the spot rate prediction errors of the

                    forward rate?


          Many authors have statistically rejected the hypothesis that the

forward rate is a conditionally unbiased predictor of the future spot

rate. Several, for example, have found statistically significant serial

correlation in the forward rate's prediction errors. I found autoregres-

sive coefficients on the order of .4 for the pound and the lire (against

the dollar, July 1974 to April 1978) in Frankel [1980, p. 10941. Hansen

and Hodrick [1980, p. 840] regressed the prediction error against the

lagged prediction errors, not just of the own currency, but of four other

currencies as well (October 1974 to April 1978). The mark had an own—

autoregression coefficient of minus .665. Many of the cross coefficients

were significant as well; they had both positive and negative signs, but

similarly large magnitudes.2 Some authors have tested the hypothesis that

the interest differential is an unbiased predictor of the future rate of

currency depreciation, which given covered interest parity is equivalent

to the first hypothesis, and have also rejected it. Cumby and Obstfeld

[1984] found a statistically significant autocorrelation coefficient of

.5   in   the interest differential's forecast error for the yen.3

          It is well—known that these are all tests of a joint null hypoth-

esis:
                                       —4—



       (a) that there is no risk premium, so that the forward rate is

              equal to investors' expectations as to the future spot rate,

              and

       (b) that the market is efficient, so that investors' expectations

              are equal to the mathematical expectation conditional on

              available information.


Some authors, such as Hansen and Hodrick [19801 and Cumby and Obstfeld

[1981], interpret the test results as evidence of the importance of the

risk premium, thus leaving the market efficiency part of the joint null

hypothesis intact. Could nonzero autoregressive coefficients be attrib-

utable to risk premiums?


       Let


                the ex post percentage change in the spot price of

                foreign currency,

         fd     the forward discount on domestic currency (or, given

                covered interest parity, the domestic interest rate

               minus the foreign interest rate),

                the ex post expectational error Ls÷1 —          where

                     is the market's ex ante expectation of deprecia-

                tion, and

         rp    the risk premium on foreign assets e —     fd.

       The prediction error can be decomposed into the expectational er-

ror and the risk premium:


(1)
                            (1s÷l_fd)=rp+E+1.
                                     —5—



Its autocovariance is given by


(2)         Cov(s÷i —   fd, s — fd1)       =
                                               Cov(rp,   ts —
                                                                fd1)
                                               + Cov(c+i,         fd).

Assuming rational expectations, the last covariance term is zero. Thus

the autoregression coefficient is given by


                                       Cov(rp, s—fd1)
(3)                Autoregr(s1 — fd) =
                                                Var(.s—fd1)

       The risk premium rp is not observable. But it can be assumed

related to the relative supplies of countries' assets as in a portfolio

balance equation for asset demands.4


(4)                           x = A + B(rp).


In inverted form


(5)                         rp =   —B'A         B1x.


An increase in the supply of a country's assets requires an increase in

the expected rate of appreciation of its currency (relative to the for-

ward discount or interest differential) for them to be willingly held.5

      We use equation (5) in (3)

moment that the entire portfolio consists only of dollars and the other

currency in question. Without any way of bounding the parameter B1,

we have no way of judging whether observed autoregression coefficients

are too large to be explained by the risk premium. We must wait for fur-

ther information from mean—variance optimization theory.




      Question 2.       Can foreign exchange intervention have a meaningful

                        effect on the exchange rate?


         One reason why there has been so much interest in estimating in-

vestors' degree of substitutability among countries' assets (as in the

studies cited in footnote 5) is that it has been thought to determine the

effectiveness of foreign exchange intervention, particularly intervention

sterilized so as to have no effect on money supplies. The argument is

that as the parameter B in equation (4) goes to infinity, B' in equa-

tion (5) goes to zero, so that asset supplies have no effect on relative

expected rates of return nor, presumably, on anything else. But the step

from relative expected rates of return to the spot exchange rate is not

Immediate.

        The portfolio share allocated to foreign assets is defined as


(7)                                    x SF/W

        where       S     the level of the spot exchange rate,

                    F the supply of foreign assets,

                D the supply of domestic assets, which we will take

                         to be dollars in the empirical work,

          and W total wealth, SF + D.
                                                  —7—



       The portfolio share allocated to domestic assets is given by


(8)                                           1—x=D/W.

We take the ratio to get an equation of exchange rate determination:



(9)
                                              S=--1---.


Equation (9) says that the exchange rate is determined by the relative

supply of domestic vs. foreign assets and the relative demand for the two

assets. Taking logs,

(10)                             s =   9..   + log(x) —     log(1—x),

       where       s    log S

           and     9.   log(D/F).


       We want to know the effect of an unanticipated change in asset

supplies    9.   on the exchange rate. If expected rates of return and

therefore the asset demand shares x by equatIon (4) are unchanged, then

the effect is simply proportionate to the change in asset supplies. Giv-

en actual magnitudes of intervention, this would not be a particularly

large effect, even if we are talking about nonsterilized intervention.

But the effect could be larger if the change in current asset supplies

alters market expectations as to future asset supplies, and alters the

expected rate of return and therefore x. Differentiating (10):



                                 =           1 dx(rp)        1 dx(rp)
(11)                                   +                +
                          d9..               x di           1—x  di
                                         —8—



         The risk premium was defined to be the domestic—foreign interest

differential minus expected depreciation e The kind of foreign ex-

change intervention we will examine is one that leaves interest rates un-

changed. This is equivalent to sterilized intervention, which holds the

money supply constant, only in the special case (as in IS—LM) where money

demand depends on the interest rate but not on the supply of bonds, and

where the price level does not respond to the exchange rate.6 If one be-

lieves that the interest rate is determined by the supply of money rela-

tive to bonds, then we are not talking about sterilized intervention, but

rather intervention that changes the supply of money and bonds proportion-

ately. The mean—variance optimization model has little to say about the

allocation of the portfolio between non—interest—bearing money and bonds,

so we choose to leave these considerations outside our model and to as—

sume simply that monetary policy is whatever it must be to keep interest

rates constant.

         Allowing only 8e to move in equation (4),

                                                   e

(while recognizing that X will be different at different points in time

as x changes). Then equation (13) can be made to look more familiar:


(15)                              ds =   dL+   Xd(s1 —   s).

If     9.    were interpreted as the relative supply of domestic money, then

equation (15) would be the standard monetarist equation of exchange rate

determination, where X would be interpreted as the semielasticity of

money demand.7

             As in that literature, we can solve for s as a function of               9.




and s1, substitute for s1 the rational expectation of next period's

            and s2, substitute similarly for s2, and so forth. The result

is an expression for this period's exchange rate as a present discounted

sum of the entire future path of expected asset supplies:



(16)                             ds =
                                        th
where        dE(&+j is the revision in the expected value of the asset supply

variable t         periods   into the future.

             The effect of a curreit change in asset supplies on the rationally

expected future path depends on the time series properties of              9..     For


example, if        9.    follows a random walk, then dE(9.÷) = d9.    and ds = d9.,

i.e., the exchange rate simply changes in proportion to the current asset

supply (as we could have guessed directly from (15)). At the opposite

extreme, if        9..   follows a random walk on trends, then dE(2..+)          r d9.,


and ds = (1+X)dP.           (also as we could have guessed directly from (15)).

       In each case, the process is not stationary on levels; first dif—

ferencing is required. But after an innovation in the supply of domestic

assets, the effect on expected future changes damps out fairly quickly.

In no case is the specification of a random walk on trends appropriate.

In different cases, different ARIYIA processes seem most appropriate. To

simplify and standardize, we will consider ARNA (1,1,0); in the case of

the United Kingdom there is a significant autoregressive parameter on

changes of .35. Thus a 1 percent innovation raises the rationally ex-

pected relative asset supply by an estimated (1 + .35) percent in the
                                    2
following period, (1 ÷   .35   + .35 )   percent in the next, and so forth,
gradually damping out. (The magnitude and significance levels of the

first—order autoregressive parameter are lower for France and Germany.

They are close to zero for Canada and Japan, suggesting that asset sup-

plies for these countries follow a simple random walk on levels.)

       Without any way of estimating B and therefore          A, we have no

way of measuring the effect on the exchange rate of expected future

changes in asset supplies. Again we must await the further enlightenment

of mean—variance optimization theory.



    Question 3. Can   the   current account have a meaningful effect

                 on the exchange rate?


       It has been recognized for some time that in models of exchange

rate determination it is not proper to measure the supply of foreign as-

sets as the cumulation of the current account (corrected for foreign ex-

change intervention),8 except in the special case when foreign investors

do not hold domestic assets and so are irrelevant to the determination of
                                        —11—



the exchange rate. But the current account will still have an effect on

the aggregate world demand for foreign vs. domestic assets, and therefore

on the exchange rate, if foreign residents have different behavior from

domestic residents.9

       We specify three separate asset—demand functions of the nature of

(4): one for American residents, one for European residents, and one for

all other residents, respectively. (We could as easily specify more):

                                   SF
                                         =         + B(rp)
                           Xa                 Aa

                                   SF
(17)                                     =         + B(rp)
                           Xe                 Ae


                                   SF
                                         =
                           Xr                 Ar + B(rp).


The subscripts indicate the nationality of the investors. We can aggre-

gate the three equations by multiplying each by its region's share in
                    W            W                 W

                                 W
                                  e     and    wr W—r =1 —
                                                             w — w ,
                                                              a   e    respec—

tively; and then taking the sum:



(18)          x - = Ar + (Ae_ Ar)We — (Ar_ Aa)Wa + B(rp).
We see that the total world demand for F assets depends not only on

their expected relative rate of return rp, but also on the distribution

of wealth across countries. Assuming that European residents hold the

highest proportion of their portfolios in F assets, followed by rest—

of—world residents (whom we have here assumed not to have their own cur-

rency) and American residents:
                                            —12—




(19)                                   Ae >Ar >A.
                                                a



Then a European current account surplus that increases We will raise

the total world demand for F assets. So will an American current ac-

count deficit that decreases Wa•

         Equation (10) provides the link from the portfolio share given by

equation (18) to the level of the exchange rate.              To see the effect of a

change in We we differentiate:


                             ds         1      1
(20)                               =        + —)(A  — Ar ).

                               e


(We do not consider any effects on expectations regarding the future.)

As we would expect, a European current account surplus that transfers

wealth to Europeans from the rest of the world will cause the dollar to

depreciate if European residents have a higher propensity to hold F as-

sets. What determines the relative size of Ae Ar and Aa? What are

the magnitudes of the effects on s? These questions too will be an-

swered below.



       Question 4.   If the dollar depreciates (because of an actual or

                     expected increase in the supply of dollars), will the

                     mark tend to appreciate against the franc?


          A proposition that circulates widely in European policy circles is

that the value of the dollar (against an average of other currencies) af-

fects the cross exchange rates within the European Monetary System. When

the dollar was weak in the late 1970s, both the mark and the franc appre-

ciated against the dollar, but the mark was the stronger and the French
                                             —13—



repeatedly found it necessary to devalue, or in the days of the Snake to

drop out of the arrangement altogether. Since the dollar began its great

appreciation in 1980, the mark has at times been weaker than the franc,

and the French have not found it necessary to devalue as often. The fear

in Europe Is that when and If the dollar makes its long—awaited fall, the

change will take the form of a portfolio shift from dollars into marks,

once again putting downward pressure on the franc's value against the

mark. Giavazzi and Giovannini [1984] examine this problem from several

alternative viewpoints. Here we pursue one of their suggestions, that

the relationship between a dollar depreciation and the franc/mark cross

rate depends on the nature of investor substitutability among the three

currencies in a model of optimal portfolio diversification.

       We return to the version of the model In which residents of all

countries exhibit uniform behavior, but we add a third asset

                          SMM

                                    AF       B(sM) + BFF(sF).
Here         is the share of the portfolio allocated to mark assets, SM is
       xM

the spot dollar/mark exchange rate, M is the supply of mark assets, and

similarly for franc assets F. B4 indicates the degree of substitut-

ability between dollars and marks, and BFF the degree of substitutabil-

ity between dollars and francs. We continue to assume interest rates

constant and so we subsume them in the constant terms. The cross rate in

francs per mark is given by the ratio of the two exchange rates. In log

form it is

                             s =     f —m+     log(x) —           log(x),

where f is the log of F and m the log of M.


         Let us assume that there is a depreciation of the dollar that comes

as the result of an increase in the supply of dollar assets, d in log

form. Then

moment the special case in which the effect on expected future apprecia-

tion of the two European currencies is equal:

                               d (d) =d (d)


Then from (23) the condition for a positive effect on the franc/mark rate

is:

                               BMM—BMF B —B
(24)                                  + FN FF           > o.

If    the mark is a good substitute for the dollar, relative to the substi-

tutability between the franc and the dollar (BMM is high relative to

associated with an appreciation of the mark against the franc.

d (d)
further increases in the supply of dollar assets two periods into the fu-

ture, and more. For each period, the inequality (24) remains the knife—

edge condition that implies an increase in the current franc/dollar rate.'°

         Is (24) likely to hold? It is now time to turn to the mean—variance

optimization theory, to help answer this and the preceding questions.

        3. ANSWERS FROM THE THEORY OF MEAN—VARIANCE OPTIMIZATION



       In   equation (4) we assumed that asset demands as a share of the

portfolio can be expressed as a linear function of the risk premium:


(4)                                 x = A + B(rp).


In Krugman [1981] and Frankel [1983] (or Frankel [1982] for the n—asset

case) it is shown that under certain assumptions, notably that investors

optimize with respect to the mean and variance of their end—of--period

wealth, (4) is the correct form for the asset demand function, with


                                  A= c(1 ---)+-_
(25)
                                  B =   [p

       where     p =   the coefficient of relative risk—aversion
                  =    the weight of foreign goods in consumers'

                       (Cobb—Douglas) utility function

                  =    the variance of the relative rate of return
                       r* —   r   (or in the n—asset case the variance—

                       covariance matrix) .1


Intuitively, the more important to an investor is risk diversification

(the larger is p or ),            the less will he or she shift the portfolio
in response to a given change in expected returns (the smaller is B).

       Looking at the inverted form of equation (4) we see that


                                    Arp = p
                                        —17—



For the moment, we will consider only portfolios of two assets at a time

(dollars and one foreign currency at a time), to get an idea of magni-

tudes. The variance of the forward rate's prediction error was reported

In column (2) of table 1. The coefficient of risk—aversion is generally

considered to be in the neighborhood of 2.12 Twice the variance is re-

ported in the fourth column of table 1, multiplied by 12 so that it can

be used to estimate effects on risk premiums or interest rates on a regu-

lar per annum basis. The numbers are quite small. They Imply, for exam-

ple, that a 1 percent increase in the share of the portfolio consisting

of dollar assets would drive up the expected rate of return on dollars

relative to pounds by only .02 percent per annum, or 2 basis points! We

see that the risk premium cannot vary much. Since the case for a time—

varying risk premium is the only case made, it follows that the magnitude

of the risk premium is very small.'3



    Answer 1: It seems unlikely that the risk premium can explain

                significant autocorrelation in forward rate prediction

                errors.


       In equation (6) we saw that the amount of autoregression in pre-

diction errors which is explainable by the risk premium depends on B',

which we have now seen to be given by p 2.        For each foreign currency,

if one wishes to think about a simple two—currency portfolio as in ta-

bles 1 to 3, then B' is a scalar that could be estimated by twice the

variance of (Ls —      fd_1).   The variance cancels out the denominator in

equation (6), and we are left with simply p times the numerator

Cov(x, s —   fd..1),   which was reported in column (1) of table 1. Even
                                    —18—



if that covariance is multiplied by 2 or higher estimates of the coeffi-

cient of risk aversion, the estimates are extremely small. The small

magnitudes suggest that in studies where statistically significant auto—

correlation is found, a risk premium is unlikely to be the explanation.

At least, that seems to be the implication of the mean—variance optimiza-

tion theory of portfolio balance.

         Three points remain to be made. First, the argument is relatively

invariant to measurement errors in the asset supplies. The "true" asset

supplies would have to behave very differently from the measured asset

supplies to have a correlation with the prediction errors which is very

much greater in magnitude than those reported in the first column of ta-

ble 1.

         Second, when we equated the variance s   perceived   by investors

with Var(s — fd_1),      we implicitly assumed that they have no recent in-

formation relevant to forming expectations.     2 should be conditional on

currently available information, and therefore should be smaller in mag-

nitude than the unconditional variance. But there is wide agreement that

recent information is of little help in predicting changes in the exchange

rate, that the conditional variance is almost as large as the uncondition-

al variance. (For example, Frenkel and Mussa [1980].) In any case, the

direction of the bias is to overstate the numbers in the first column of

table 1, representing autocorrelation attributable to a risk premium. A

finding of an autocorrelation coefficient significantly greater in niagni—

tude than those numbers would suggest an even more decisive rejection of

rational expectations.
                                     —19—



         The third point is that, in theory, it should be a portfolio de-

mand for n > 2 currencies that depends on the risk premiums; in inverted

form, each risk premium should depend on n currency supplies, not just

two. Equation (26) generalizes nicely if we consider market efficiency

tests of the sort run by Hansen and Hodrick [19801 and Cumby and Obstfeld

[19841: for a given currency the current prediction error is regressed

against the lagged values of the prediction errors in all of the

cies, not just the own currency. The results of such tests are reported

in table 3.    For the period 1973 to 1980 (which is as far as I have con-

structed asset supply data for),    F tests reject the null hypothesis of

no autoregression in the prediction errors in the case of several equa-

tions.

         The matrix of regression coefficients that are estimated in table

3 can be represented, using boldface to represent five—currency matrices

and vectors,

                The theory implies that the autoregression
                coefficient of prediction errors is bounded
                by (the corresponding covariance above) x

We have used, first, the rational expectations assumption that the compo-

nent of As+1 —     fd    that is expectational error is uncorrelated with rp;

second, that rp is governed by mean—variance optimization; and third,

that we can approximate the conditional variance—covariance matrix

with the unconditional one so as to cancel out its inverse, as in the

upper bound argument made above. The entire matrix Cov(x, As —          fd.1)
(the generalization of column (1) in table 1) is reported in table 4.

Again we can assume p = 2.        The magnitude of the autoregression param-

eters in table 3 is always far greater in magnitude than twice the num—
                                              5
bers in table 4 (which are shown times 10 ),      in   other words are greater

than can be explained by the risk premium under the assumption of mean—

variance optimization.



    Answer 2: An unexpected increase in the current supply of domestic

                  relative to foreign assets can have a meaningful effect

                 on the current exchange rate, especially when account is

                  taken of effects on expected future asset supplies.


       One    percent   increases in the supply of domestic assets in them-

selves raise the exchange rate by only 1 percent.'4 But the ARIMA esti-

mates reported in table 2 show that a given 1 percent innovation in the

asset supply generates rational expectations of future asset supply in-

creases. We saw in equation (16) that the effect on the exchange rate

will be more than 1 percent, and of a magnitude depending on the semi—

elasticity of asset demand X. Now with equation (14) we see that A

is given by
                                       —21—

          The share of the portfolio allocated to the dollar versus the oth-

er five currencies averaged .49 during the sample period 1973—1980. Thus

     +         is about 4.00. The third column of table 5 reports the esti-
 x       1—x
mates for X implied by the variance estimates. The coefficient for the

United Kingdom is typical: 2,516 on a monthly basis, or 210 if divided by

12 to allow interpretation of X as a semielasticity of asset demand

with respect to per annum rates of return. The numbers are very high as

estimates of semielasticities of demand, but this is a direct implication

of the theory of mean—variance optimization.

          As a preliminary experiment, consider what happens if the 1 per-

cent increase in asset supplies raises the expected permanent rate of as-

set supply growth by as little as 0.1 percent per annum. Our estimate of

X implies that the exchange rate will increase by 21.0 percent! This is

how sensitive asset demands are to expected returns.

          In the time series processes estimated in table 2, the effect of

an innovation on future asset supply changes is not in fact permanent but

dies out fairly quickly. Adopting the simple ARIMA (1,1,0) specification,

we saw that a 1 percent innovation in the relative supply of dollars/pounds

raises the relative supply expected next period by (1 + .353) percent, the
                                        2
following period by (1 + .353 + .353 )        percent, and so on. We use our es-
timate of X, the semielasticity of asset demand with respect to expected

return, to take the correct present discounted sum of future asset sup-

plies. The total effect on today's dollar/pound exchange rate is estimated

at 1.545 percent. The effects for the franc or mark are somewhat smaller,

because of more rapid damping out of asset supply changes. In the cases

of the Canadian dollar and yen, the asset supply changes are essentially

white noise, i.e., £t follows a random walk, so the effect of a 1 per-

cent innovation is simply 1 percent: the spot rate follows a random walk

in lock—step synchronization with the asset supplies.

         The above calculations use semielasticities A that are based on

x =   - , under   the artificial assumption that in each case the currency

in question constitutes the entire nondollar portfolio. In reality each

foreign currency considered alone constitutes a smaller part of the port-

folio. As a consequence, the As are considerably larger, but, as table

5 shows, the effect on the exchange rate is virtually the same. The

present—discounted sum is far less sensitive to A than it is to the

asset supply autoregression parameter R.



      Answer 3: The   effect   of a current account surplus on the exchange

                  rate is meaningful in size, but is nevertheless less than

                  the effect of a government budget deficit that creates an

                  equal quantity of domestic assets.


        Equation (18) says that a European current account surplus that

redistributes 1 percent of world wealth to European residents raises

the demand for European assets, by (Ae —        Ar)   percent and thus raises

the exchange rate by       —             Ar) percent. The theory of mean—
                               j1)(Ae_
variance optimzation, as embodied in equation (25), tells us that

where           is the share of European consumption allocated to European

goods and            is the share of rest—of—world consumption allocated to Eu-

ropean goods, and we have assumed that everyone has the same coefficient

of risk—aversion p.

            The first point to note belongs to Krugnian [1981]: for the wealth

redistribution to have a positive effect, it is not sufficient that

   > c, that residents of each country consume relatively more of their

own goods. It is necessary that we also have p > 1. In the case of

risk—neutrality (p =       0),   residents of each country would prefer the as-

sets of the other country due to Jensen's inequality. The "risk premium,"

as defined above would be, not zero, but fixed at               —
                                                                    --) if   consump-

tion patterns were uniform across residents.'5 In the knife—edge case of

the "Bernoulili investor" who has logarithmic utility (the limit as                p

goes to 1), Ae = Ar = Aa         and the distribution of wealth has no effect.

We will continue to consider the more realistic case of p = 2,               where

A. =
 1      2i - . The
       --   a. — 4        current account does have an unambiguous effect in

the expected direction, assuming c > c > c.
            What is the magnitude of the effect of a current account surplus

equal to 1 percent of world wealth? Whatever the value of p, because

ae, ar and aa are (weakly) between zero and one the effect on the risk

premium is less than (or equal to) the effect of a government budget def-

icit (or of creation of domestically—denominated assets in other ways

such as foreign exchange intervention) equal to 1 percent of world wealth.

Let us consider the example ae =        1.0,    c = 0.5   and        =   o.o.16   Then

a European current account surplus equal to 1 percent of world wealth has

an effect that is (ae — cc) =           as great as a budget deficit equal to 1
                                       —24—



percent of world wealth. If the United States is at the same time running

a current account deficit of the same magnitude, then it too has an effect

that is r —           = 1   as great. Together the two current account imbal-

ances have the same effect as the equivalent budget deficit. This example

is a limiting case.     If Americans consume nonzero German goods and vice

versa, the effect of the current account deficits will be smaller. The

result that the current account should have a smaller effect than an equal

budget deficit was noted by Dornbusch [1983, p. 25].

         The effect on the exchange rate of the 1 percent European current

account surplus, using a value of x =          in   equation (18) is 4.00

(Ae —   Ar),   which is 2.00 percent using our upper bound values of domes-

tic consumption. The     effect   together with an equal U.S. current account

deficit is 4.00 percent. The effect can be greater if there are expec-

tations of continuing current account imbalances in the future, just as

with the equivalent changes in asset supplies considered above.'7



    Answer 4: A depreciation of the dollar would be associated with an

                 appreciation of the franc against the mark rather than

                 the other way around.


        We showed above that the inequality (23) is the condition necessary

for a depreciation of the dollar, whether originating In an increase in

the supply of dollar assets or in the expected future supply of dollar as-

sets, to be associated with an appreciation of the mark against the franc.

Now that we know the matrix of substitutability coefficients is propor—

tionate to the inverse of the variance—covariance matrix (B =         [p
the condition becomes:

                                             XF

        The conditional variance—covariance matrix estimated in Frankel

[1982, p. 2611 gives values for the relevant terms, shown here in table

6. As of 1980, XM was .12 and XF .05. Thus our estimate of p c1           is
a negative number, —1644.2; the condition (23) fails; the dollar depre-

ciation would be associated with a depreciation of the mark against the

franc. This is the same result stated by Giavazzi and Giovannini [1984]:

the portfolio—optimization theory gives the reverse answer from the rela-

tionship generally suspected between the dollar and the franc/mark cross

rate.

        As with most of the questions answered above, this conclusion

would follow even if the variance—covariance matrix and asset shares were

computed in somewhat different ways. It is in part a consequence of the

fact that the variance of the mark/dollar rate is greater than the vari-

ance of the franc/dollar rate, which implies that a well—diversified in-

vestor insists on holding both marks and dollars. Similar findings were

obtained in the unconditional variances reported in column (1) of table

5, in the unconditional variance—covariance matrix of real returns (I.e.

allowing inflation rates to be stochastic) estimated in Kouri and de Macedo

[1978], and in the conditional variance—covariance matrix of real returns

estimated in Frankel and Engel [1984]. The conclusion is also in part a

consequence of the fact that francs constitute a considerably smaller pro-

portion of the world portfolio than marks, which implies that a shift of

the portfolio equally into marks and francs would drive up the price of

the franc farther than the price of the mark.

       How then do we explain the observed tendency of the franc to de-

preciate relative to the mark when the dollar declines in value? A pos-

sible answer is that marks and dollars are in fact relatively close sub-

stitutes, the theory of portfolio optimization notwithstanding. Consider

two lines quoted by Giavazzi and Giovannini (from the International Mone-

tary Fund, Occasional Paper No. 19, May 1983, p. 5): "When the U.S. dol-

lar is relatively weak, mobile international capital seeks alternative

locations, and particularly tends to move to the deutschemark, and vice

versa. With the United Kingdom not actively participating in the EMS,

currencies other than the deutschemark play only a limited role as alter—

native reserve and investment currencies." Given the existence of capi-

tal controls in France, there is little reason for foreign residents to

hold francs unless they need transactions balances for business conducted

in those countries. The absence of substantial capital controls in

Germany, Switzerland, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and

Japan means that these six countries' currencies are the world's invest-

ment assets. The dollar may be a closer substitute for the mark and the

others than the dollar is for the French franc. It would then easily

follow that a portfolio shift out of dollars would tend to be a portfolio

shift into marks rather than into francs, and would cause the mark to

appreciate against the other EMS currencies.

                              4. CONCLUSION



       This paper has tried to show that the hypothesis of mean—variance

optimization has powerful implications for some standard questions of in-

terest to macroeconomists, implications that transcend the particular

methods used for measuring asset supplies and estimating the variance—

covariance matrix. The most striking conclusion is the small magnitude

implied for the risk premium. An increase in the supply of dollar assets

equal to 1 percent of world wealth raises the risk premium that must be

paid on dollar assets by a mere 2 basis points per annum. One corollary

is that a time—varying risk premium does not seem a promising explanation

for any empirical findings of serial correlation or other conditional bias

in the prediction errors made by the forward rate. Another corollary is

that foreign exchange intervention has a negligible effect on the risk

premium.

       However, it does not follow that foreign exchange intervention or

other changes in asset supplies need have a negligible effect on the level

of the spot rate. A one—time permanent intervention undertaken so as to

leave interest rates unchanged will affect the exchange rate in the same

proportion as the change in asset supplies. An intervention that changes

expectations of future policy in the same way as a typical innovation in

asset supplies, will change the exchange rate more than proportionately.

The hypothesis of mean—variance optimization implies that the current ex-

change rate is very sensitive to expectations of future changes. If the

expected permanent rate of growth ol the domestic asset supply is raised
                                  —28—



as little as 0.1 percent per annum, estimates from mean—variance optimi-

zation imply an increase in the current exchange rate of more than 20

percent.

       We have also seen that, under the assumption that the coefficient

of relative risk—aversion is greater than 1, current account surpluses

can have the traditional effects on the exchange rate. The implied ef-

fects are of the same order of magnitude as the effects of changes in

asset supplies, though they must be slightly smaller to the extent that

residents of each country consume goods of the other country.

       Finally, we have seen that the hypothesis of mean—variance optimi-

zation implies that a depreciation of the dollar should give rise to a

stronger portfolio shift into francs than into marks; this would tend to

appreciate the franc against the mark, which is the opposite of the cor-

relation generally believed to hold.

       In the case of each of these answers, the suspicion may arise that

perhaps the hypothesis of mean—variance optimization is steering us wrong.

No final position is taken here on that issue. But if the degrees of sub-

stitutability that have been discussed here seem impossibly high, it should

be recalled that the working hypothesis in many models, both theoretical

and econometric, has long been perfect substitutability. The hitherto—

persuasive argument against perfect substitutability has been that it re-

quires either risk—neutrality or the absence of any "outside assets," both

highly implausible assumptions.'8 But we now see that conventional esti-

mates of risk—aversion and return variances imply a degree of substitut-

ability so high that for some purposes it might as well be infinite.

                                FOOTNOTES



       'Frankel [1982b] fails to reject the null hypothesis that inves—

tors are risk neutral and the risk premium is nonexistent. The portfolio

consists of six assets, goods prices are assumed to be nonstochastic when

expressed in the currency of the producing country, and investor behavior

is allowed to differ depending on country of residence. Frankel [1983]

and Frankel and Engel [1984] use similar econometric techniques but test

the mean—variance optimization hypothesis itself, and are based on dif-

ferent assumptions: the former assumes a two—asset portfolio while the

latter allows goods prices to be stochastic in any currency, but assumes

that investor behavior is uniform worldwide.


       2Among the many other authors testing unbiasedness in the forward

market——most of them rejecting the null hypothesis——are Frenkel [19761,

Cornell [1977], Tryon [1979], Levich [1979], Bilson [1981], Longworth

[1981], Hsieh [1982], Baillie, Lippens and McMahon [1983], Huang [1984],

Park [19841, Gregory and McCurdy [1984], and Hodrick and Srivastava

[1985]. Many of them test whether the forward discount overestimates or

underestimates the tendency of the spot rate to regress toward a mean,

and find the former. The proposition that this finding of "excessive

speculation" (to use Bilson's term) can be explained by a risk premium

can be challenged on the grounds of empirical magnitudes, much like the

finding of autocorrelation.


       3Dooley and Shafer [1983] and Cuinby and Obstfeld [1981] also find

serial correlation in the difference between the interest differential

and the ex post rate of currency depreciation.

       4One can easily interpret equations (4) and (5) and similar equa-

tions appearing below in an n—asset framework: x is a vector of portfo-

lio shares allocated to the various assets, rp is a vector of expected

rates of return on the various assets relative to a reference asset, A

is a vector of intercept terms and B is a matrix of substitutability

coefficients.


       5One approach to testing whether the systematic component of the

prediction error is indeed a risk premii has been to run regressions on

an equation derived from (1) and (5):


(5')                 (s+1 —   fd)   = —B'A + B1x +



Frankel [1982a}, Rogoff [1984], and Booth, Clinton, Cote and Longworth

[1985] found no evidence of a relationship between prediction errors and

asset supplies as in equation (5'); but Park [1984] and Loopesko [1984]

did find such a relationship.


       6Note that this special case is much less plausible in the long

run than in the short run. Henderson [19841 describes a central bank

policy of market intervention so as to keep both the exchange rate and

the interest rate constant as a "rates constant" policy.

       7See Frenkel [1983, p. 11], Frenkel and Mussa [1980], or the

Bilson, Frenkel and Hodrick papers in Frenkel and Johnson [1978].

           should be measured, rather, as the cumulation of the foreign

government deficit (corrected for foreign exchange intervention), analo-

gously to the supply of domestic assets.

       9See Kouri and de Macedo [1978].

         10The reasoning suggests an inductive proof that (23) is suffi-

cient to imply a positive effect on s. But some restriction on the

effect of the supply of dollars on the entire expected future path is

also needed for such a proof.


         "The derivation assumes that goods prices are nonstochastic when

expressed in the currency of the country producing them, so that the ex-

change rate is the only source of uncertainty. Frankel and Engel [1984]

follow Kouri and de Macedo [1978] arid Dornbusch [1982] in allowing goods

prices to be stochastic like exchange rates; the effect is to modify A

in equation (25), but to leave qualitatively unchanged the answers to

most of the questions considered here.


         12 Macedo [1980] and Krugman [19811 refer to the tSamuelson pre-

sumption' that p = 2.     Newberry and Stiglitz [19811 summarize the evi-

dence.

                                    —   + -i--] =     —    —p   c   a.


From   the variance estimates in tables    1   or 3 it follows that the constant
term   is on the order of only .01 percent per annum. More generally, em-

pirical studies have found no significant unconditional bias in the for-

ward rate: for example, Cornell [19771 and Frankel [19801. Thus Hansen

and Hodrick [1980] and others refer only to a time—varying risk premium.


         '4For purposes of comparison, U.S. and European central banks

(mostly the latter) are estimated to have sold about $5 billion in the

foreign exchange market in early 1985 (Wall Street Journal, March 4 and
                                            —32—




11, and Associated Press, March 8). This would represent an increase in
the supply of dollar assets of about 0.3 percent. (Gross U.S. federal

debt outstanding was $1,577 billion at end—1984, from Economic Indicators;

this includes monetized debt but excludes dollar debt issued by foreign

governments.)        It also represents a decrease in the supply of foreign as-
sets of the same magnitude, so that the total effect on the relative asset
supply     is larger than 0.3 percent.

           15mis follows from footnote 13. In the case of divergent consump-

tion patterns, rp is undefined (overdetermined) under risk—neutrality,

because residents of different countries try to set it at mutually incon-

sistent levels, much like risk—neutral speculators who have divergent ex-

pectations, or agents in any market who have infinitely elastic demands

at divergent prices. But in the limit as p goes to zero, rp goes to

   e
       —   — ÷ (ae   —   ar)we — (ar   — a )w ].

           16Shares of expenditure on German goods can be calculated at .99

for German residents, .01 for U.S. residents and .47 for rest—of—world

residents (under the highly artificial assumption that all goods were

produced in either Germany or the United States) [Frankel 1983, p. 322].

           '71f world wealth is measured as the sum of the outstanding stocks

of government debt, whether monetized or not, of the seven largest coun-

tries ($3,057 billion as of 1982, or $2,465 if only central government

debts are included; OECD Economic Outlook July 1984, p. 29, and Historical

Statistics 1960—82, p. 14), then the recent U.S. current account deficits

of $100 billion are redistributing several percent of world wealth. World

wealth would of course be smaller if only monetized debt were considered
                                  —33—



an outside asset. On the other hand, if equities and real estate were

included in the portfolio, world wealth would be higher. Equities alone

are valued at $2,945 billion for the total of twenty countries, as of

December 31, 1984 (Capital International, January 1985). The effect of

the U.S. current account deficit, as of the budget deficit, would dimin-

ish proportionately.

              proposition is demonstrated in Frankel [1979]. The absence

of outside assets would have to extend beyond government debt, to money

and real assets.
