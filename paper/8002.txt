1. Introduction


   One of the lessons from the Asian Currency Crises is the danger of the de


facto dollar peg adopted by the Asian economies that had extensive trade and

                                                                      1
investment relationship with countries other than the United States. When the


yen appreciated vis-à-vis the US dollar, the Asian economies enjoyed the boom,


or a bubble in some cases, due to increased exports. But, when the yen


depreciated, the Asian economies tended to experience a recession, or a burst


bubble. The experience of the Asian boom and bust in the 1990s, along with the


yen-dollar exchange rate fluctuation, is a stark reminder of risk of the fixed


exchange rate regime.


   An obvious solution for this problem is to increase flexibility of the


exchange rate. If the baht had appreciated during the yen appreciation phase


of the 1993-95, the extent of overheating in Thailand might have been limited;


and if the baht had depreciated along with the yen in 1996-97, then the decline


in exports could have been mitigated. This kind of exchange rate flexibility


can be achieved by a flexible exchange rate regime which keeps the real effective


exchange rate relatively stable.


   An obvious insight here is that an emerging market economy, which exports



                                       3
to the United States and Japan, is well advised to consider managed exchange


rate regimes, in order to avoid excessive volatility of the real effective

                 2
exchange rate.       The questions to be considered include how to determine a


reference rate as an appropriate real effective exchange rate and how much


fluctuation is excessive.


   The optimality of the exchange rate regime is defined as the one that


minimizes the fluctuation of the trade balances, when the yen-dollar exchange


rate fluctuates. Ito, Ogawa, and Sasaki (1998) proposed how to calculate the


optimal weights when the emerging market economy exports to Japan and the United


States only. The optimal weights were calibrated with some assumptions on the


demand elasticities and export shares. In this paper, we extend the Ito, Ogawa,


and Sasaki model to include a neighboring emerging market as well as Japan and


the United States. A typical Asian economy exports about one-third to the United


States and one-third to Japan, and the rest to countries in the Asian region


(and EU). Therefore, to simplify, we consider the case that country A (B,


respectively) exports to the U.S., Japan, and country B (A, respectively).


Therefore, the real effective exchange rate calculation includes the currency


of neighboring country. What makes difficult and interesting in this model is



                                         4
that the optimal weights may depend on what the neighboring country is adopting


as weights. In the extreme case, if country A is adopting the dollar peg, country


B should adopt the dollar peg; and if country B is adopting the dollar peg,


then country A should adopt the dollar peg. Namely, the dollar peg is a Nash


equilibrium. However, if country A is using a currency basket which mirrors


the export shares, adjusted for demand elasticities, then country B should adopt


a (similar) currency basket; and if country B is using a currency basket, then


country A should adopt a currency basket. This trade-weighted currency basket


is also a Nash equilibrium.


   Although the paper is motivated by the recent Asian experiences, the


application is not limited to Asia. Results obtained in this paper are relevant


to any developing countries with a trading structure with export destinations


including different currency areas.


   Which of the Nash equilibria is chosen depends on the inertia as well as


rational calculation. If countries can coordinate, then they should choose the


best among Nash equilibria. This process of choosing the optimal Nash


equilibrium can be regarded as a regional currency arrangement. Coordination


failure could occur if a country has some obstacles for coordination from



                                       5
political or social obstacles against breaking inertia. What this paper shows


is that coordinate managed float by the two countries would increase the


stability in the trade balance fluctuations.


   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the model.


We assume that the Marshall-Lerner condition, which means that depreciation


of the local currency will increase the net trade surpluses, is satisfied


throughout the paper. Section 3 examines what the Marshall-Lerner condition


implies in our oligopoly model with imported parts and It also examines in what


situation the Marshall-Lerner condition is satisfied in the model. Section 4


defines and solves for an optimal currency regime. We introduce the exchange


rate policy of the monetary authorities of the two countries in order to analyze


interdependence and coordination failure between their exchange rate policies.




2. Model


(1) Settings


   Our earlier work, Ito, Ogawa, and Sasaki (1998), considered the question


of choosing optimal weights in the basket currency system for a country that


exports goods to the United States and Japan.     An Asian country was modeled



                                       6
as a one-sector economy where a representative firm assembles parts imported

                                                                               3
from   Japan   and   the   United   States   into   manufactured   products.       The


representative firm in one Asian country was assumed to compete with Japanese


firms and/or U.S. firms in the Japanese and U.S. markets. We extend our earlier


model to include another neighbor country in the model in order to analyze


interactions of the exchange rate policies among Asian countries.


   We assume that a representative firm in country A imports parts from the


United States and Japan and exports its products to markets in the United States,

                                                      4
Japan, and country B as well as a domestic market. Also, a representative firm


in country B imports parts from the United States and Japan and supplies its


products to markets in the United States, Japan, and country A as well as a


domestic market. We assume that prices of parts from the United States and Japan

                                                                   5
are given in terms of their production country’s currency.


   Asian countries export their goods and services mainly to Japan, the United


States, and neighboring Asian countries. For example, Thailand exports


one-fourth to Japan, one-fifth to NIES (Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan)


and ASEAN-4 countries (Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia),


one-seventh to the United States. These three categories account for more than



                                         7
60 percent. Similarly, Malaysia exports to 22 percent, 34 percent and 17 percent


to Japan, to the United States, and to Asian countries, respectively. The sum


of these three categories reaches 72 percent. The structure is similar in


Indonesia and the Philippines. Table 1 shows the export shares by destination


to Japan, the United States, Asian countries, and four European countries


(Germany, France, UK, and Italy). Therefore, the assumptions of the model,


Country A exports to Japan, the United States, and neighboring country B, are


realistic.


   Each market in countries A and B is supposed to be a duopoly market where


both country A and B firms compete with each other. Markets in the United States


and Japan are under monopolistic competition. Country A and B firms compete


with many domestic firms in each of the U.S. and Japanese markets. They supplies


their products in the U.S. and Japanese monopolistically competitive markets


given average prices of their domestic products made in the United States and


Japan. We assume that prices of the products made in the U.S. and Japan are


kept unchanged (exogenous to this model) for simplicity. Moreover, we assume


that all firms in countries A and B have identical cost functions. Each firm


maximizes its profits in terms of its own home currency.

    For simplicity, we assume that price elasticities of demand for the country


A and B firms’ product are equal to each other in each of the country A and


B markets. That is, ε = ε = ε                     and ε = ε = ε . Thus, price elasiticities of


the markups of country A and B firms’ products are equal to each other in each


of the country A and B markets. That is, η = η = η                                  and η = η = η .


    From equation (2.9), we obtain equilibrium prices for the country A and B


firms’ products in the duopoly market of countries A and B, respectively:

3. Effects of exchange rates on trade balances


     In the next section, we introduce the exchange rate policy of the monetary


authorities of the two countries into our model under the Marshall-Lerner


condition to analyze interdependence and coordination failure between their


exchange rate policies. In this section, we examine what the Marshall-Lerner


condition implies in the model where domestic firms import parts from Japan



                                                  13
and the United States and in what situation the Marshall-Lerner condition is


satisfied in the model.


     At first, we analyze effects of changes in the exchange rates on trade


balances of countries A and B. In the model, trade balances are equal to a total


exports (to Japan and US) less the sum of total costs of imported parts (from


Japan and US) and imports from the neighbor country. Therefore, the trade


balances denominated in the dollar for countries A and B, respectively, are


shown as:


              7 = (   3 I  + (   3 J  + (   (   3 K − (   3 ω  4 − (   3ω  4 − 3  K 

for  and .


     We derive a relationship between changes in the trade balances and those


in the exchange rates from equations (3.1).

                                                                              14
and , [Ö represents a rate of changes in variable [ . It is assumed, as


mentioned earlier, that prices of the products made in Japan and the United


States are kept unchanged.


   The first line of equation (3.2) represents a direct price effect of exchange


rates on trade balances. The second line of (3.2) represents an indirect effect


of exchange rates via PTM (pricing to market) behaviors of country A and B firms.


The third line of (3.2) represents an indirect effect of exchange rates on trade


balances via trade volumes. It is necessary for the Marshall-Lerner condition


that the volume effect (third line of equation (3.2)) dominates the sum of direct


price effect (first line of equation (3.2)) and PTM effect (second line of


equation (3.2)). We consider whether the Marshall-Lerner condition is always


satisfied in our model if the volume effect dominates the sum of direct price


effect and PTM effect. For the simplicity sake, we examine whether depreciation


of the local currency have positive effect on the net trade volumes, that is,


export volumes minus import volumes.


   The indirect effect via trade volume (third line of (3.2)) can be described


as a function of the changes in the exchange rates as follows:

value added to the parts imports, converting parts into products for exports.


Hence, we assume that these τ parameters are positive.


      The exchange rates have effects on the product prices, which change the


relative prices of the products in the Japanese, the U.S., and country A and


B markets. The changes in the relative prices have effects on the demand for


the products in these markets. Demand for products made in country A (or B)


is equivalent to export volumes of the country in our model. Since parts are


imported from Japan and the United States, and some products are imported from


the neighbor country, the exchange rates have effects on imports as well as


exports.


      In equation (3.3), it is clear that the exchange rates of the neighbor



                                                                           16
country’s currency vis-à-vis the yen and the dollar have unambiguous effects


on trade volumes. The appreciation of the neighbor currency has positive effects


on the trade volume, as the competitiveness of home products would increase.


However, the exchange rates of the home currency vis-à-vis the yen and the dollar


a priori have ambiguous effect on the trade volumes.


                                                                                                                  
   The exchange rate of the home currency vis-à-vis the yen, that is $                                                  is


positive — depreciation will cause export volume to increase— i f the following


inequality is satisfied:


                  τ  ε  ϕ   − α  + (τ  ε ϕ  + τ  ε ϕ )α  > τ  ε

                                                                                              ϕ
                                                                                               
                                                                                                  α           (3.4)


Similarly, the exchange rate of the home currency vis-à-vis the dollar, that


    
is $     is positive, if the following inequality is satisfied:


              τ  ε
                      
                         ϕ
                          
                              − α   + (τ  ε ϕ  + τ  ε ϕ  )  + α    > τ  ε  ϕ  α    (3.5)


   The right hand side of inequalities (3.4) and (3.5) means that the exchange


rates have negative effects on export volumes into the US or Japanese market


through increases in cost of imported parts in terms of the home currency. The


left hand side means positive effects that depreciation of the home currency


increase export volume through relative prices and decrease import volume of


parts.



                                                              17
   Thus, the effects of the exchange rates on the trade balances are ambiguous


because parts are imported in our model. Depreciation of the home currency


against a foreign currency increases price of imported part in terms of the


home currency. The increase in domestic price of imported parts decreases


optimal outputs and, in turn, decreases export volumes as well as decrease


import volume of parts. The depreciation of home currency has an adverse effect


on the trade balance if the negative effect on exports via imported part costs


is larger than the positive effects that depreciation of the home currency


increase export volume through relative prices and decrease import volume of


parts. In this case, the Marshall-Lerner condition is not satisfied even if


the volume effect (third line of equation (3.2)) dominates the sum of direct


price effect (first line of equation (3.2)) and PTM effects (second line of


equation (3.2)).


   Thus, the dominance of the volume effect is necessary but is not sufficient


for the Marshall-Lerner condition to hold in our oligopoly model where domestic


firms import parts from Japan and the United States. In addition, it has to


be supposed that the direct effect of the exchange rates on export volume is


larger than the effect via imported part costs on export volume for the



                                      18
Marshall-Lerner condition to hold. Hence, the Marshall-Lerner condition is


satisfied in the model when the latter condition as well as the dominance of


the volume effect is satisfied.


    Next, let us examine the effects of yen’s and dollar’s appreciation


vis-à-vis both home and neighbor’s currency on the home trade volume, which


is related with stability of exchange rate policy of the two countries analyzed


                                                                                                                         
in the next section. These effects are the sum of $                                                           and $             and that of


$  and $   , respectively. The following equation shows the condition that the

yen appreciation (vis-à-vis the both emerging market currencies) produces the


positive trade volume effects:

Similarly, the following equation shows the condition that the dollar


appreciation (vis-à-vis the both emerging market currencies) produces the


positive trade volume effects:

    Now, we examine several cases about the import status:


    (1) The country i imports parts from both Japan and U.S.



                                                                        19
Then, inequalities (3.4) and (3.5) may be or may not be satisfied. Also,


inequalities (3.6) and (3.7) may be or may not be satisfied.


   (2) The country i imports parts from Japan only. ( ω  = ), α   =
                                                           




Then, (3.5) is satisfied, but (3.4) may be or may not be satisfied. Moreover,


if the production function is symmetric among the neighbor countries — that is,


the third term in the left hand side of (3.6) and the right hand side of (3.6)


cancel out—then inequality (3.6) is also satisfied.


   (3) The country i imports parts from US only. ( ω  =    ), α  =
                                                      
                                                                        .


Then (3.4) is satisfied, but (3.5) may be or may not be satisfied. Moreover,


if the production function is symmetric among the neighbor countries — that is,


the third term in the left hand side of (3.7) and the right hand side of (3.7)


cancel out—then inequality (3.7) is satisfied.




4. Exchange rate policies


   In this section, we develop the above two-country model to analyze how


exchange rate policy of the monetary authorities in one country can be affected


by that in the neighbor country. Interactions of the exchange rate policies


conducted emerge in the two country model, because the competitiveness of home



                                      20
goods depend on the exchange rate vis-à-vis the neighbor’s. At first, we suppose


that the monetary authorities of the two countries have the same objective to


stabilize fluctuations in trade balances. The policy reaction function of


country i is derived in terms of the currency basket in order to stabilize


fluctuations in trade balances, given the exchange rate policy of the neighbor


country. As a result, it is theoretically possible that a coordination failure

          6
may occur.    The coordination failure is a situation where both of the monetary


authorities adopt the dollar peg at the same time and a situation where the


monetary authorities of one country adopt an optimal currency basket peg while


the monetary authorities of the other country adopt the dollar peg.




(1) Optimal currency baskets


   We express the above effects of exchange rates on the trade balances of


countries A and B in terms of rates of changes as follows:

Equations (4.1) and (4.2) corresponds to equation (3.2) for country A and B.


However, by the assumption of the Marshall-Lerner condition, effects of



                                                     21

analysis, we may regard signs of A and B coefficients in equations (4.1) and


                       
(4.2) as the $             , where x = i, j and y = Y, $, sings of coefficients in equation

     A currency basket is defined as weighted averages of exchange rates of a


home currency vis-à-vis the dollar and the yen. Thus, a currency basket peg


means that a currency basket of nominal exchange rates is fixed at a level.

average of rates-of-changes in the exchange rates, is equal to zero:

If the monetary authorities adopt a dollar peg system and a weight on the dollar


in a currency basket is equal to unity, the exchange rate of the home currency


vis-à-vis the dollar is fixed at a level while the exchange rate of the home


currency vis-à-vis the yen co-moves with that of the yen vis-à-vis the dollar.


The home currency appreciates against the yen when the dollar appreciates


against the dollar.


   Both of the monetary authorities are assumed to choose weights on the dollar


and the yen in a currency basket in order to stabilize the fluctuation of their

optimality of the exchange rate policy is to stabilize fluctuations in trade


balances in terms of the dollar under a currency basket peg system. We assume

balances in terms of the dollar. That is, the monetary authorities have the

chosen by the monetary authorities of country B. Also, equation (4.12) is a


policy reaction function for the monetary authorities of country B. They choose


an optimal weight for minimizing their policy objective function given a weight


Z   chosen by the monetary authorities of country A. Thus, both of the monetary


authorities have to determine their optimal weights in a currency basket while


they are affected by behavior of the other monetary authorities.


    There is a unique equilibrium pair of optimal weights for countries A and


B because both of the policy reaction functions are linear functions. From


equations (4.11) and (4.12), we derive a pair of optimal weights on the dollar


in a currency basket to stabilize their trade balances for both of the countries


A and B at the same time:

they are off the equilibrium point ( Z , Z ).


   Figure 2 illustrates policy reaction functions of both the countries in a


case where inequality (4.16) is satisfied. In this case, an equilibrium point

authorities of countries A and B chooses its own weight in order to stabilize


its own trade balances, given the weights chosen by the other monetary


authorities. The weights chosen by the monetary authorities should diverge out

                                             
of the optimal weights ( Z , Z ). Thus, the weights on the US dollar increase


and reach to a unity for both the countries, provided that the weight is


realistically constrained between 0 and 1. Both of the monetary authorities


eventually adopt a full dollar peg system rather than the optimal currency


basket peg system although they have been choosing their weights in order to


stabilize their own trade balances.



                                                                    28
   Thus, if inequality (4.16) is satisfied, an optimal weight point is unstable.


Then, it is difficult for the monetary authorities to change their exchange


rate policy to an optimal exchange rate policy.




(2) Coordination failure in optimal currency baskets


   Next, we analyze whether the monetary authorities of countries A and B can


directly shift their exchange rate system from the current de facto dollar peg


system to an optimal currency basket peg system. The shift to optimal currency


basket peg system depends on whether each of the monetary authorities can


decrease fluctuations in trade balances under the optimal currency basket peg


system in comparison with those under the dollar peg system. Especially, each


of the monetary authorities should care about fluctuations in trade balances


in a case where it shifts to the optimal currency basket peg system while the


other monetary authorities keep the dollar peg system.


   If both of the monetary authorities adopt the dollar peg ( Z = Z =  ) at the


same time, fluctuations in trade balances are calculated as follows:


                                                = ($                )

Thus, the monetary authorities of the two countries should adopt the optimal


currency basket peg system rather than the dollar peg system unless equations


(4.21) and (4.22) are satisfied in a symmetric two country model.



                                                                           30
     Next, we consider a possibility that the monetary authorities adopt the


dollar peg system in a situation where equations (4.21) and (4.22) are not


satisfied in a symmetric two country model. One possible reason is that the


monetary authorities of one county cannot adopt an optimal exchange rate policy


because their loss increases if the monetary authorities of the country alone


adopt the basket while the other country keeps pegging its home currency to


the dollar.


     We consider how the monetary authorities of one country should behave, given


that the monetary authorities of the other country adopt the dollar peg. For


example, suppose that the monetary authorities of country A adopt the above


optimal currency basket peg ( Z = Z ) while the monetary authorities of country
                                                                    

The fluctuations in trade balances in this case are larger than those in the

the monetary authorities of country A adopt an optimal currency basket peg

system. If fluctuations in trade balances at point F are larger than those at

   Thus, both of the monetary authorities should keep pegging their home


currencies to the dollar if their trade balances fluctuate more widely in the


case of the optimal currency basket peg than in the case of the dollar peg.


At this time, they face in a coordination failure that they are forced to adopt


the dollar peg even though the optimal currency basket peg is to minimize the


fluctuations in trade balances if they adopt the optimal currency basket peg


at the same time. Only if both of the monetary authorities coordinated to adopt


the optimal currency basket peg at the same time, they peg their home currencies


to the optimal currency basket.




6. Conclusion


   We examined the question of choosing the exchange rate regime for emerging



                                        33
market economies that export goods to the United States, Japan, and neighbor


countries. The optimal exchange rate regime is defined as the one that minimizes


the fluctuation of the trade balance, as the yen-dollar exchange rate fluctuates.


One might object to this framework, since the Asian currency crises were largely


caused by capital movements, and not by the trade account problem. There are


two reasons why the trade account stabilization is important. First, one of


the important triggers that caused sudden reversal of capital (or an attack


by speculators) in Thailand was the large current account deficit (about 8


percent of GDP in 1996), partly caused by the overvalued baht. The trade balance


is important since it affects the confidence of the exchange rate regime. Second,


when capital movements are large, that would drive the currency overvalued


and/or the current account into deficits. In order to judge whether the exchange


rate is misaligned or not, one needs the “ benchmark. ” The exchange rate that


is calculated to stabilize the real exchange rate gives such a benchmark.


Therefore, having calculated such a basket value, it gives a good reference


to answer a question whether capital flows are too much or too little to cause


misalignment.


   We can draw some policy implications from these conclusions. First, if the



                                      34
Asian region that relies on exports to Japan, the U.S., and other regions, wants


to avoid a boom and bust cycle due to under- and over-valued exchange rates,


the real effective exchange rate must be managed. In particular, the basket


currency regime is helpful. Second, the choice of the exchange rate regime (or


weights in the basket) may depend on your neighboring country’s choice of the


regime. There may be coordination failure. Given the dollar peg of the


neighboring country, the choice is the dollar peg, and the neighboring country


decides the choice in the same manner. However, both countries would be better


off to move to a basket currency regime with more weights on the yen, if the


decisions are made simultaneously. Third, in order to help the calculation of


such a basket tailored to each country, it may be helpful to calculate and


publish the typical currency basket unit for the region. Such a currency unit


(say, Asian Currency Unit, or ACU) has weights on the U.S. dollar, the yen,


and the euro. Each Asian country manages its own currency within the reasonable


band around the ACU, then the coordination failure may be avoided. Calculation


of such a currency unit and simulations of the trade balances under the basket


system is left for future work.


   Although this paper simplifies many aspects of the real world, the essential



                                      35
points, we believe, are very relevant to the real world. Asian countries will


benefit from coordination with each other in choosing the exchange rate regime.

Notes:



1
  Several Asian countries including Thailand and Korea before the currency
crisis claimed that they were adopting a basket system, or a managed float system.
However, the actual movements of the exchange rates suggest that the weight
of the dollar was quite high. See Frankel and Wei (1994). In that sense, we
call the pre-crisis regime as the de facto dollar peg.
2
  The so-called “ two-corner solution ” has become a popular view among some
researchers and policy makers in the post-crisis discussions. (See Eichengreen
(1999), for example.) According to this view, free floating, an ultimate
flexibility, and a currency board, ultimate inflexibility, are only stable
regime in the long run. Any intermediate regime — managed float or fixed exchange
rate regime without adopting the currency board — is unstable. Advocates of the
two corner solution cite the fact that Hong Kong and Argentina, both currency
board economies, survived the currency crisis of the neighboring economies.
    It is not advisable for countries that export substantial volumes to Japan
as well as the United States to adopt the exchange rate regime pegged to the
U.S. dollar. Hong Kong seems to be an exception, as it is a small open country
with lots of reexports and with high labor and price flexibility of domestic
markets. The currency board of the Hong Kong type is not suitable for other
Asian economies.
    Would the free floating exchange rate a recommended exchange rate regime
to other Asian economies? If one believes that the market will (most of the
time) determine the exchange rate at the level (almost) consistent with
fundamentals, then the free floating is advisable. However, if one believes
that the market will (too often) drive the exchange rate to the level (clearly)
misaligned with the fundamentals, then policy actions to the domestic market
and some direct interventions to the exchange rate market may be called for.
The latter view is more convincing in the view of the following evidence. First,
even advanced countries find it necessary to intervene occasionally. Foreign
exchange rates sometimes become misaligned with fundamentals. The U.S. dollar
in 1984-85 and the yen in 1995 are the obvious example of overvaluation.
Misalignment needs to be corrected by intervention and some policy adjustment.
Second, the worst of the Asian crises, say November 1997 to January 1998, came
long after the Asian economies moved to flexible exchange rate regime. When
contagious crises feed each other among the regional economies, free floating
regimes would cause a downward spiral of the region’s currencies. Thus, a
devaluation of a currency would bring down the currencies of trade- and
investment-related countries. Those who praise China to be a barrier to stop
a contagious devaluation spiral in the region by maintaining the fixed exchange
rate should also be advocating some sort of managed float in times of crisis.
3
  Flanders and Helpman (1979), Lipschitz and Sundararajan (1980), and Flanders
and Tishler (1981) emphasized only the real side of the economy in modeling
the currency basket peg issue. On the other hand, Turnovsky (1982) and Bhandari
(1985) used a general equilibrium macroeconomic model which included capital
mobility.
4
  Ohno (1989) examined pass-through effects of exchange rates on export pricing
behavior in manufacturing after taking account of prices of raw materials.
Marston (1990) modeled a similar pricing to market model.
5
  In our model, Japanese and US suppliers of parts are not assumed to price to
markets because many suppliers exist and they behave competitively. Parts are
more difficult to differentiate compared to brand-name products.
6
    Bénassy-Quéré (1999) and Ohno (1999) analyzed pegging the US dollar as a


                                       43
coordination failure.
7
   A currency basket of nominal exchange rates is fixed at a level because we
suppose that economies experience no inflation. The monetary authorities should
adopt a crawling currency basket system if the economies experience positive
rates of inflation that are different from those in the United States and Japan.
   We limit a realistic case though it is theoretically possible to suppose  < Z .
8

9
   The assumption was made in Ito, Ogawa, Sasaki (1998). Alternatively, we may
assume that the monetary authorities minimize absolute variations of the trade
account to GDP ratio. Bénassy-Quéré (1999) assumed that the monetary
authorities are to stabilize both their external competitiveness and the real
price
10
        of their external debt.
    We can obtain the linear reaction functions because we assume quadratic
functions of rate of change in trade balances. It is usual to consider
fluctuations of trade balances as a second order of moment though it is, in
general, unnecessary to limit a second order of moment. We can obtain non-linear
functions if we assume more general form of objective functions.
