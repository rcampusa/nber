                                            ABSTRACT

In this paper we investigate whether the presence of private insurance leads to improved health
status. Using the Health and Retirement study we focus on adults in late middle age who are nearing
entry into Medicare. Estimation addresses endogeneity of the insurance participation decision in
health outcome regressions. Two models are tested, an instrumental variables models, and a model
with endogenous treatment effects due to Heckman (1978). Insurance participation and health
behaviors enter with a lag to allow their effects to dissipate over time. Separate regressions were run
for groupings of chronic conditions. We find that the overall impact of insurance on health tends to
be significantly downwards biased if no adjustment for endogeneity is made. With corrections there
is a four-fold increase in the insurance effect; yielding a 7 percent increase in the overall health
measure for the uninsured. Results are consistent across IV and treatment effects models, and for
all major groupings of medical conditions. Thus, the effect of private insurance on health may be
larger than previously estimated. As for policy, expanding coverage to the uninsured should result
in substantial health improvement. By conjecture, this is likely to reduce the need for health care
when individuals retire and enter Medicare, potentially leading to savings.

1. Background

        According to the 2000 U.S. Census, approximately 40 million Americans are

uninsured and this number is expected to grow in coming years. Although the Clinton

administration was forced to retreat from some ambitious goals for expanding coverage,

providing access to the insured is emerging again as major public policy issue. (Winslow

and McGinley, 2000). Health benefits in the U.S. remain heavily employer-based with

about 60 percent of all insured individuals being enrolled through employer-sponsored

plans. (Acs et al., 1996). While the indigent can often qualify for public assistance

programs such as Medicaid, many participants in the labor force may not have adequate

access to coverage through their employer. Although it is possible to purchase individual

plans privately, these may only be available at prohibitively high rates compared with the

group rates available through large employers. As a consequence, 16% of full time

workers are uninsured (Custer and Ketche 2000).

        Not surprisingly, much of the policy discussion focuses on ways of expanding

coverage to all workers. Two competing approaches have been offered. One approach

favors expanding employer-based coverage and making it easier for firms to purchase

insurance for their employees (Gruber, 2001). Another approach favors providing

stronger incentives for purchasing insurance directly to employees. A prime example of

the former was the Clinton health care reform plan, which would have allowed small

firms to purchase health care insurance at competitive group rates through large

purchasing cooperatives (Cutler, 1994). Recently, the Bush administration proposed a tax

credit of up to $1,000 to help low income workers purchase insurance for their families

(Gleckman, 2002). Several other proposals would go further in severing the link between



                                                                                             1
employment and health insurance but move towards mandated universal coverage

(Blendon, Young, DeRoches, 1999).

        Both sides of the debate seem to implicitly be making the assumption that

expanding coverage will lead to gains in social welfare. This can occur in two ways: first,

by reducing uncertainty for workers and their families, and second, by improving access

to medical services and thereby improving health outcomes. Our primary interest is in the

latter question, i.e. in determining the impact of insurance on overall health.

        Recent studies have tended to focus on mortality, rather than health per se, finding

that adults without health insurance have higher mortality than individuals with private

insurance (Franks, Clancy, and Gold, 1993; Sorlie et al. 1994). Looking at similar

populations, other studies focused on the effect of lack of private insurance on health

measures such as physical limitations (Baker et al., 2001, Ross and Mirowsky, 2000). In

all of these studies the insurance effects were either small or insignificant. However, none

of these studies addressed one important estimation issue, namely endogeneity of the

insurance choice variable in the health equation. This potential bias arises if healthier

people exhibit behaviors that will make them more (or less) likely to purchase insurance

(Gruber et al., 2000). The only study to address this issue explicitly addressed is limited

to a specific population, that of HIV-positive individuals (Goldman et al., 2001). That

study demonstrated that accounting for the endogeneity in insurance results in a dramatic

and statistically significant increase in the effect of insurance on declines in mortality

probabilities.

        In this study we study we reexamine the endogeneity in a different context. We

employ the same sample of middle-aged labor force participants in the Health and

Retirement Survey used recently by Baker et al. (2001), but we use a broader measure of


                                                                                               2
individual health status. We address the endogeneity issue in the context of a treatment

effects model. Our results confirm the direction of the effects found in Baker et al.,

namely that having insurance leads to better health status. However, we also found that

failure to account for endogeneity bias results in underestimating the full effect of

insurance. In this respect our results are also in agreement with Goldman et al. (2001.)

        The fundamental question we aim to address is as follows: will improved access

to private health insurance in and of itself lead to better health outcomes? Evidence to

this effect may provide further support in favor of policies designed to expand health

insurance coverage, irrespective of the policy mechanism ultimately chosen. The plan of

the paper is as follows: Section 2 summarizes the relevant literature on the measurement

and determination of health, as well as insurance choice. Section 3 presents the

methodological approach and estimation framework. Section 4 presents data and variable

definitions. Section 5 presents results from the insurance participation equation and the

health status equation for the full sample. In addition it summarizes results from a

number of tests for endogeneity bias, along with the magnitude of the bias. Section 6

replicates this analysis for subsets of survey respondents based on groupings of chronic

conditions. This was done in order to test whether insurance effects are repeated across

various settings in which symptoms of the underlying medical condition may not be

equally observable to the individual. Finally, implications of the results are discussed in

Section 7.



2. Previous Literature

        A number of separate themes in the literature are relevant to this study. Among

these are the use of physical health measures derived from household surveys; effect of


                                                                                              3
insurance on health, including the endogeneity bias that arises in estimation; the relative

importance of the effects of health behaviors and insurance on health; and the probability

of having insurance. We briefly review each one of them, and explain how they are

connected in relation to the research question in this paper.

        Health measures:

        There is a substantial body of literature on using survey-based measures of health

status. These measures appear with similar wording in major household surveys such as

the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS), the Health and Retirement Survey, and

the National Health Interview Survey. Indicators are generally classified into three types:

Subjective measure, i.e. self rated overall health (poor, fair, good, very, excellent),

objective measures based on a general criterion, especially physical limitation, defined as

inability to perform certain tasks defined in the survey, and objective measures that

pertain to self–reporting of specific diagnoses or medical conditions. In general, these

measures have been shown to perform well. Perry and Rosen (2001) find that “objective

measures give exactly the same answer as subjective measures” (p.19) when testing for

differences in health status between wage earners and the self employed. Specifically in

the Health and Retirement Study, Hurd and McGarry (1995) find that subjective

probabilities of survival vary with health predictors in the same way as actual outcomes.

        By combining the variety of self-reported conditions into a single index the

Medical Outcomes Study produced a health status measure that minimizes individual

error (Ware and Sherborn, 1992, Ware et al., 1995). The index, known as the Short-Form

36 (SF-36), utilizes the same indicators of physical health as those found in large

household surveys. The index avoids the use of self-reports on specific diagnoses, which

have been shown to be sensitive to false negative errors in Canadian data (Baker, Stabile,


                                                                                              4
and Deri, 2001). Variables in the Health and Retirement Study render themselves to a

very close approximation of the SF-36 (Baker et al., 2001, 2000), since it includes the

same basic groupings of health indicators. Differences are found in the wording used to

describe certain physical limitations or conditions. In section 4 we provide further detail

regarding construction of this variable in the HRS

        Effect of insurance on health:

        A number of recent studies have attempted to estimate the effect of insurance on

health, but the results appear to be inconclusive. For working age adults, people without

health insurance tend to have higher mortality probabilities than individuals with private

insurance (Franks, Clancy, and Gold, 1993; Sorlie et al., 1994). Smaller effects were

found for populations with particular diagnoses such as breast cancer in women (Ayanian

et al., 1993). In at least one population, that of HIV-positive individuals, the effect of

insurance on mortality probabilities turns out to be substantially larger after accounting

for endogeneity of insurance in the mortality equation. However, in the case of public

insurance programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, only weak effects of insurance on

adult mortality or infant mortality were found (Sorlie et al., 1994; Kaestner, Joyce, and

Racine, 1999).

        Other related studies focused on health status, rather than mortality, as measured

by self reported health, physical limitations, and presence of selected medical conditions.

Ross and Mirowski (2000) find no significant effects of private or public health insurance

on health outcomes. Perry and Rosen attempt to measure insurance effects by comparing

two populations with different levels of coverage, namely wage earners and the self-

employed. They conclude that the relative lack of insurance among the self-employed has

little to no impact on their health as measured by the presence of medical conditions. On


                                                                                              5
the other hand, Baker et al. (2001) finds small but positive and significant effects of

private insurance on self-reported health and physical functioning for working age adults,

after allowing for appropriate lags. Again, the endogeneity issue was not explicitly

addressed in any of these studies.

         Relative effects of health behaviors and insurance on health:

        A more ‘established’ strain in the literature focuses on the role of human capital.

The Grossman model (1972a, 1972b) defined a health production function, in which

investments in health care including medical care and home activities exhibit diminishing

marginal productivity in maintaining health. The Grossman model also predicts that

education increases the efficiency of investment (MEI) across the board, i.e. it shifts the

MEI schedule to right. In a study based on the National Health Interview Survey, Kenkel

(1991) finds evidence to support this, showing a positive correlation between schooling

and health augmenting behaviors. It has been suggested that health behaviors may

ultimately be more important than the purchase of medical services (Fuchs, 1998).

        ‘Offer’ versus ‘take up’ decisions:

        More recent research has focus on the likelihood of the firm offering insurance to

its employees, namely the offer probability of insurance. An extensive summary of

results can be found in Gruber 2001, who emphasizes the importance of tax rates on the

offer probability, with elasticities ranging from –0.1 to –0.6. Bundorff (2002) examined

the effect of employee preference and worker characteristics on the offer probability, and

found only small effects. Using data centered on firms that provide insurance coverage

Chernew, Frick and McLaughlin (1997) show that employees take up probabilities are

sensitive to premium levels. Generally, take up probabilities are conditional on the

employer actually offering insurance. However, surveys of households and workers tend


                                                                                              6
to provide limited information on employers, leading to studies that incorporate

individual characteristics, while necessarily omitting firm-level variables (e.g., Simon,

2001).



3. Methodological Approach

    Addressing the endogeneity issue requires creating an instrument for insurance

participation in the health status equation. To meet identification requirements Goldman

et al. used state-level policy variables as predictors of insurance, noting that these

variables would be correlated with insurance availability via Medicaid for AIDS patients

while being uncorrelated with health. Unfortunately, the Health and Retirement Study

does not provide any geographic information, including state of residence in the U.S due

to strict confidentiality requirements. However, given our focus on private insurance

markets, we are aided by the notion the worker’s decision to take up insurance is

conditional on the employer’s offer. Thus the identification problem becomes one of

finding instrumental variables that predict the likelihood that an employer offers

insurance without being correlated with health status. As we explain later we use a series

of Wald-tests to make sure that our instruments are valid. We are also aided by the fact

that following Baker et al. (2001) insurance participation enters the health equation with a

lag, although this provides a weaker source of identification.

    We estimate the following system of equations:

Ht = H (Xt-k , Bt-k , It-k , Ht-k )                                                  [1]

It-k = I (Xt-k , Ft-k ).                                                             [2]

Where H = health index in period t, X = socioeconomic characteristics, B = health

indicators and behavioral variables. I = binary indicator of insurance, and F = firm or job


                                                                                               7
characteristics that predict the likelihood of insurance being offered. Finally k denotes the

length of the lag. Equation [1] defines the health “production function” (Grossman,

1972, 1976), while Equation [2] is used to predict the likelihood of having insurance.

Equation [2] is the indicator function for purchasing insurance, which can be estimated as

a probabilistic model. The decision to purchase insurance is an individual decision, but is

conditioned on the employer offering insurance. Most household surveys, including the

HRS, do not contain variables that provide this information directly. However, other

characteristics of the firm and certain job characteristics serve as indicators of the

propensity of the firm to offer insurance benefits. These characteristics are contained in

the vector Ft-k . While interesting issues arise in conjunction with the insurance decision,

our main interest in creating a well-identified instrument. Thus the specification of the

probability equation is incidental to our main research question.

        The lag structure is used in equation [1] to allow for the fact that adjustment to

behavioral covariates does not occur instantaneously. For instance, smoking and alcohol

abuse require some passage of time before causing adverse health effects1 . The same can

be assumed for health insurance. Including the lagged dependent variable, Ht-k , is

consistent with the Grossman investment model, which states that current health depends

on the initial level of health. For convenience, the lag is also applied to time invariant

demographic characteristics such as gender, race, and marital status.




1
  Lags considered in related seminal medical studies on the effects of smoking, physical activity
and alcohol consumption drinking range from one year to a decade, e.g. Frank et al., 1966;
LaCroix et al., 1991; Thun et al., 1997.


                                                                                                    8
        Although this model can be rewritten in the form of a change equation,2 in our

particular case we will stop short of interpreting it as such due to a definitional change

between in health variables that occurred between the 1992 and 1996 waves of the HRS.

In 1996 HRS introduced a change in the phrasing of responses to a small subset of

questions that make up the indicators of the health index. This caused a slight upward

‘’creep’’ in the index. As a result, for some observations health status would appear to

artificially increase over time. However, this does not affect the distribution of health

status within each wave. Thus the 1992 index provides a reasonable baseline measure of

health status, with slightly altered scaling. Note that we are not interested in the

magnitude of change in health status per se, but rather in the effect of insurance

participation, holding everything else constant. More detail on the construction of the

health index is provided in Section 4.

        Lagging the effects of health inputs and insurance gives the empirical model its

recursive structure. Nevertheless, the two equations may not be independent and the error

terms associated with equation [1] and [2] may be correlated if there is some unobserved

trait that makes people who purchase insurance more or less likely to be healthy in a

future period. For instance, if insurance is positively correlated with an unobserved trait,

say ‘awareness’ and this trait also leads a person to take better care of his health, then the

error terms would be positively correlated. In this case the coefficient of insurance in the


2
  To this, we first write the health equation in the following form:
                 Ht = b0 + b1 Yt-k + (1-δ)Ht-k ,
Where Y is a vector of insurance and other variables related to health behaviors, and δ is the rate
of depreciation of health stock. Rewriting we get:
                 Ht - Ht-k , = b0 + b1 Yt-k -δHt-k , where δ ≥ 0.
The coefficients can be alternatively interpreted as being generated by distributed lag, adaptive
expectations, or partial adjustment processes (Maddala, 1980), but these are difficult to
distinguish and not rele vant to our discussion.


                                                                                                  9
health equation would be upward biased. If, on the other hand, insurance is positively

correlated with an unobserved trait that also causes a person to neglect her health, e.g.,

reduce preventive effort, than error terms would be negatively correlated and the

coefficient of insurance in the health equation would be downward biased. The final

direction of the simultaneity bias cannot be ascertained a priori.

        To address this issue, we use a two-step procedure, whereby we initially estimate

equation 2 to obtain the predicted value of It-k , or some related transformation (see below)

and then substitute this predicted value, or some related transformation (see discussion

below) into Equation [1]. Note that the model is statistically identified since the vector of

coefficients Ft-k is included in [2] but omitted from [1]. The estimation procedure we use

is essentially an OLS regression for Equation [2] augmented by the hazard function from

a probit regression for [1], i.e., the ‘treatment effects’ model, due to Heckman (1978,

1979) and Maddala 1983. This model, often referred to as the restricted control function

(RCF) method, is appropriate when the censoring of the non-participating group does not

take place as it would in the standard Heckman selection model. Moreover it is at least as

efficient as its alternative, the instrumental variable estimator (Vella and Verbeek, 1999).

The model can be summarized as follows:

                Hi = α + bI i + γYi + σ tε λi + vi ,                                 [3]

Where Hi is health status or some other outcome measure such as expenditures for

individual i, Ii is a binary indicator of being in the treatment group (in our case, =1 if

insured, = 0 if uninsured), Y i is the vector of covariates, λi is the hazard rate obtained

from the first stage probit on the treatment indicator (e.g., if individual is insured), and σte

is the covariance of the disturbance terms in the treatment function and the non-



                                                                                                   10
augmented OLS equation. An algorithm by Maddala (1983, p. 122) provides adjusted

standard errors. The estimate of σte provides a specification test for [3], with high

statistical significance indicating that the null hypothesis (the non-augmented OLS

equation is true), should be rejected. 3

        RCF is appropriate when the distribution of the dependent variable is fully

observed, but assignment to treatment groups is non-random. Unlike the standard

Heckman selectivity bias model, where the hazard enters in lieu of the treatment

indicator, the RCF method includes the binary indicator in addition to the hazard rate.

Thus, RCF allows for direct comparisons of α with the coefficient of the treatment

indicator in a simple OLS model. Note that model [3] is very similar to a class of

instrumental variable (IV) estimators in which the residuals from a linear probability

regression on the indicator function are included in second stage equation in lieu of the

hazard rate.4

        Choosing one model over the other entails a tradeoff between making

distributional assumptions about the errors and attaining consistency of the structural

parameters of interest. The RCF assumes a bivariate normal distribution of the errors in

the first and second stage equation, but yields consistent and efficient structural


3
   Stated differently a high correlation between regression errors indicates that endogeneity is
present. The covariance term can be expressed in terms of the correlation: σte = ?σe . All relevant
terms are reported in the regression tables.
4
  The use of residuals to account for endogeneity is commonly encountered in models with
censored endogenous regressors. For example, Heckman (1978, 1979) adopted this approach to
account for sample -selection bias and endogeneity bias in models in which the treatment is
captured through an indicator function. Vella (1993) employed the same approach for a range of
models involving selection bias or censored endogenous regressors. Smith and Blundell (1986)
and Rivers and Vuong (1988) adopted the same idea in accounting for endogeneity in models
where the dependent variable is censored and the endogenous regressor is continuous. However
corrections for standard errors have not been fully resolved.


                                                                                                 11
parameters. In comparison, the IV model is free of distributional assumptions, but the

estimates may be inconsistent. Vella and Verbreek (1999) show that if the normality

assumption is satisfied, IV and RCF are identical, and they recommend comparing

estimates from both models. Our own comparison (e.g., Table 3) indicated that the two

models yielded virtually identical estimates. We opted to present regression results from

RCF since it allows for a more intuitive interpretation of the participation parameter as a

‘treatment’ or intervention and because it provided corrected standard errors. Henceforth

we refer to this model as the ‘treatment’ model.

Identification Strategy

        When selecting instrumental variables, we are aided by the notion that the

employee’s decision to purchase insurance, i.e., his take-up probability, is conditioned on

the employer’s offer. In many large household surveys a binary indicator of the firm’s

offer is not typically available. However, many other employer characteristics may be

reported, and can be taken as ‘indicators’ of the propensity of the employer to provide

insurance. In turn, this is substituted into Equation [2] to yield a predictive equation.

Similarly, certain job characteristics such as union membership, for instance, may predict

access to insurance coverage. Regional indicators may proxy for policies that impact

insurance availability (States are intentionally omitted from the Health and retirement

Study). Modeling the decision-making process in this simple way provides the necessary

motivation for picking appropriate instrumental variables. However, as in all

simultaneous equation estimators two important statistical issues need to be addressed.

First, a number of studies have cautioned against using poorly fitted predictive models in

the first-stage, as they may introduce measurement error that outweighs the benefit from

reducing the error due to simultaneous equation bias (e.g., Bound, Jaeger, Baker, 1995;


                                                                                              12
Staiger and Stock, 1999). Even when model specification is guided by economic theory, a

good fit is not guaranteed. Second, instrumental variables might themselves be correlated

with unobservable determinants of outcome in the second stage.

        Define Equation [2] as the “insurance participation” equation, with the indicator

variable coded as =1 if the individual has insurance and =0 if the individual does not have

insurance, to be estimated as a probit. To address the first concern, we report goodness of

fit measures, which are relatively high. We further performed Wald tests for the joint

significance of our instruments and find that it is also high. Note that our interest is only

in obtaining an instrument for the insurance decision in the second stage health status

with variables available in the Health and Retirement Study.5

        Consider the instruments we picked for the insurance participation equation. We

also included employer characteristics such as firm size and a dummy variable indicating

if the firm offers a pension plan. The pension plan indicator is a potentially powerful

instrumental variable, since it is known to correlate highly with other employee benefits,

but there is no reason to assume that it is correlated with employee health. Still, we

cannot be completely sure.

        Firm size is related to insurance coverage since large firms are better able to pool

risks and negotiate lower premiums, but they may also attract healthier workers. We

included job characteristics such as union membership and managerial and professional

position that imply better access to insurance, but admittedly may also draw healthier



5
  Unfortunately, the Health and Retirement Study does not include information on insurance
premiums, Cutler (2002) and Dana et al. (2001) propose using state level variables such as
marginal tax rates and policy dummies, respectively, which may be uncorrelated with health but
correlated with insurance participation. These could not be linked to our file, since states are
intentionally omitted in that survey.


                                                                                                   13
workers. It is possible that for the relatively older age group in question, employer and

job characteristics have been predetermined, given that job switching for this group is a

relatively rare phenomenon.

        The hypothesis that an instrumental variable is uncorrelated with unobservable

characteristics, and hence with the outcome measure itself, cannot be tested directly. To

determine this it is only possible to perform a ‘weak test’ – by regressing the full set of

variables including the proposed instrumental variables on outcomes in second stage

(Goldman et al., 2001). As we later explain [section 5] this approach provided us with

greater confidence that our assumptions are appropriate, at least for our sample of

relatively older adults. We further report Wald tests for joint significance of instrumental

variables in the insurance participation probits. While interesting issues arise in

conjunction with the insurance decision itself, the results are incidental to our main

research question. Our interest here is limited to creating a well-identified instrument in

the health status IV and treatment effects models. These and other variables are

discussed below.



4. Data and Variables.

    Our data came from the Health and Retirement Study, which is a household survey of

mostly working age adults. As part of this survey, follow-up interviews were conducted

every two years. For purposes of our research we focused on wave 1 and wave 3,

corresponding to the years 1992 and 1996. In 1992, face-to-face interviews were

conducted for 7702 households, yielding a total of 12,652 individuals for wave 1 (1992).

We focused our sample on adults 45-64 years old; few people below age 45 participated,

and almost all participants age 65 and older at baseline were insured through Medicare.


                                                                                               14
Because we were interested in the insurance choices available to participants in the labor

force, we also excluded a small number of Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries, and

those enrolled through other Federal health insurance programs(e.g., Veteran’s

Administration, CHAMPUS). Due to the lagged variable structure of our estimation

procedure, we further considered only individuals who participated in both waves. This

and a small number of omitted observations due to missing data resulted in a final sample

size of 9,050 individuals.

        Our main dependent variable is the health index wave 3, which is a summary

measure of self-reported overall health, two measures of physical limitations (mobility

and agility), and a measure of pain. All four components of this health index are coded so

that higher values indicate better health.6 The same structure is used to generate an

independent health index wave 1, which provides a measure of baseline health status. The

health index used in our analysis closely mirrors the construction of a widely used

summary measure of physical health known as the SF-36. Examples of recent studies in

the health care literature that have used variants of this measure in empirical work include

Baker et al. (2001), Ware (2000), Mirowsky and Ross (1998). Indeed, regression analysis


6
    The component items of the index are as follows: Self-reported overall health, with the options
excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor (coded 5 = excellent to 1 = poor). The physical mobility
component which measures ability to perform activities requiring large muscle strength using 4
items: walking several blocks; walking one block; climbing several flights of stairs; climbing one
flight of stairs without resting. The agility component measures physical activities required to
perform instrumental activities of daily living using 6 items: sitting for about 2 hours; getting up
from a chair after sitting for long periods; lifting weights over 10 pounds; stooping, kneeling or
crouching; pulling/pushing a large object; and reaching/extending arms above shoulder level.
Items were coded 1 if the respondent reported no difficulty with the activity, 0 otherwise, then
summed for each component. The pain level measure is taken from several items in the
questionnaire that ask respondents to characterize their pain as none, very mild, mild, moderate,
and severe (coded from 5 to 1, respectively). Finally, all 4 measures were summed and scaled to
form the 100-point health index. A test of the correlation of rankings across the various items
indicated a very high degree of internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.82).


                                                                                                 15
on this index yields results that are consistent with some well known biological and

behavioral phenomena (see section 5).

        All independent variables in the health equation were taken from wave 1, i.e. as

lagged values. This included socioeconomic variables age, gender, race, marital status,

years of school completed, and household income (measured as the ratio of total

household income to the official U.S. poverty line in 1991, adjusted for family size). In

addition, they include variables that reflect past health behaviors, such as smoking,

number of alcoholic drinks of per day, and measures of initial health stock such as the

body-mass index (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), the number

of chronic conditions reported in HRS (including hypertension, diabetes, heart disease,

chronic lung disease, cancer, arthritis, stroke, and visual difficulties), and finally the

lagged health index. Not shown in the Table 1 are the ranges of the body-mass index:

quintile 1: 16.7 – 23.0; quintile 2 : 23.0 – 25.2; quintile 3: 25.3 –27.4; quintile 4: 27.4 –

30.5; quintile 5: 30.6-50.5. According to actuarial and epidemiological standards,

persons are considered “overweight” if their BMI is between 25 and 30, and ‘obese’ if

BMI > 30. Thus the third and fourth quintiles correspond to the overweight category, and

the fifth quintile corresponds to the obesity category (see Averett and Korenman, 1996,

for instance).

        Between the 1992 and 1996 surveys, there was a change in wording of questions

and response options for items in the physical difficulties subscale7 . Health is expected to



7
  In 1992 the options for the physical difficulties in the HRS were ‘not at all difficult’ ‘a little
difficult’, ‘somewhat difficult’, and ‘very difficult/cannot do’. In 1996 the question was rephrased
to ‘Do you have any difficulty?’ with the responses: no; yes; cannot do. To have consistency
between the questions and response options in 1992 and 1996, we used a similar approach to that
used in previous studies. (Baker et al., 2001; Clark, et al. 1998, Burchett et al., 1993): all
questions for 1992 and 1996 were dichotomized into no difficulty (= 0) versus some difficulty (=

                                                                                                  16
decline with time; thus the small increase in mean health index from 75. 8 to 77 reported

in Table 1 is probably an artifact of a slight change in scaling rather than a reflection of a

true increase in health status. However, the distributions are similar in both waves,

suggesting that the 1992 index provides a reasonable measure of baseline health. As can

be seen from Appendix A, the moments of the distribution for both the insured and

uninsured are virtually equal for both periods.

        The main variable of interest is insurance participation. Survey respondents were

classified as insured regardless of whether they had employer-based or individual

policies. In the full sample there were 7,507 individuals with any insurance policy of

which 1,543 were uninsured.8 The Health and Retirement Survey does not contain a

variable indicating whether the employer actually offered health insurance to employees.

However, several indicators for the firm’s propensity to offer such insurance are

available. Among these are employer size, availability of other employer sponsored

benefits such as a 401k plan (pension), and an indicator of the worker’s ability to get

insurance through other sources, e.g. union membership. In addition, we include a binary

indicator of job characteristics (=1 if professional or managerial), to account for firms

that limit health benefits to certain classes of employees. We also included a binary

indicator of employment (6,601 individuals were on-the-job at the time of the survey).

Thus, job and employer characteristics in the model are effectively interaction terms.


1). The absence of the option ‘a little difficult’ in 1996 may have prompted certain respondents
to report ‘no difficulty’, for instance.
8
  Individuals who said they had only minimal coverage, e.g. coverage for special conditions such
as mental health, dental insurance, or long-term care insurance were classified as uninsured
because these policies do not enable access to routine health care services. In the full sample,
there were only 360 such cases.



                                                                                                   17
Regional variables were also included in the regression, to account for differences in

mandates and premium regulation, which vary from state to state, but are known to

exhibit regional patterns. Detailed definitions and summary statistics are presented in

Table 1. Summary statistics for binary indicator are the percent in the sample belonging

to group. Means and standard deviations are reported for continuous variables. Results

from the first stage regressions on insurance participation, and second stage regressions

on health status are described below.

        Other regressions replicated the analysis by type of major chronic condition

available in the Health and Retirement Survey. We designate these as follows: Population

1, persons with no major chronic condition at all; Population 2, persons with any major

medical conditions, i.e. heart disease, stroke, cancer, arthritis, asthma or other chronic

lung disease, diabetes, and hypertension; Population 3, the subset of persons with

asymptomatic conditions, i.e., conditions which may not have external symptoms in early

stages of the disease, namely hypertension and diabetes; and finally, population 4,

persons with hypertension, the single most common chronic condition in the population.

Note that populations 2-4 are nested; population 4 is a subgroup of population 3, and

population 3 is a subgroup of population 2. In addition, this list of medical conditions is

by no means exhaustive; other medical conditions that may be prevalent in the population

are simply not reported for respondents in the survey. Sample sizes for our grouping

were 3210, 5,640, 3,598, and 3290 respectively. Further detail of definitions of medical

conditions are reserved for Section 6.




                                                                                              18
5. Results: The Full Sample

    First-stage estimates: probability of insurance participation

    Table 2 presents probit estimates on insurance participation. Two versions of the

model are shown. The only explanatory variables included in Model 1 are predictors of

the ‘offer’ probability for insurance. Model 2 adds socioeconomic characteristics that are

related the take-up decision. Thus this model has the interpretation of a ‘take-up’

probability, conditional on being offered insurance by the employer. In either case are not

interested in the insurance participation decision per se. Rather, we aim to create an

instrument that can be incorporated into the second stage estimates of health status in

either an IV or treatments effects setting. The two models we employ corresponds to two

levels of identification: First, an instrument that meets identification criteria, but is more

parsimonious; second a model that adds regressors from the second stage that have a

theoretical meaning in the insurance decision, but are not strictly required for

identification purposes. The choice of the two models entails a tradeoff in terms of our

identification strategy. The first model might allow a higher correlation of the

instruments with treatment variable. The second model should allow for a better overall

fit of the predictive model and is akin to a 2SLS procedure. To help choose the better

model we report the usual goodness of fit statistics for each model. In addition, we report

the Wald statistic for the joint significance of the instruments in the insurance

participation equations. The results suggest a slight preference in favor of the second

specification. Model 2 produces much bigger goodness of fit statistics. The Wald statistic

is somewhat lower in this model but still highly significant.

        Firm and job characteristics, which are assumed to be predictors of the likelihood

of being offered insurance the yield similar effects in both models; and are highly


                                                                                                 19
significant. The coefficients exhibit a pattern to be expected with their interpretation as

indicators of insurance offer. Thus union workers and employees in management or

professional positions are more likely to have insurance compared with other employees.

The negative coefficient of ‘employed’ indicates that employees in small firms (i.e. not of

size category two or three) are less likely to have insurance than the unemployed. On the

other hand employees in mid-sized and large firms are more likely to have insurance,

with an effect that increases with the size category. These effects are to be expected given

what is widely known about insurance offering by employers in general. In particular

while most small firms do not offer insurance to their employees (Ginsburg and Gable,

1996) certain employed workers continue to access to insurance, either because they are

on public assistance programs such as SSDI, or in cases of short run employment they

may continue to carry their old insurance policy under ERISA. Firms that offer 401k

plans are more likely to offer health benefits, leading to the positive coefficient of 401k in

the regressions.

        Regional variables were included to account for mandates of minimum benefits

and premium regulation, which vary from state to state, but are known to exhibit regional

patterns. The coefficients indicate that people who reside in the south and west region of

the U.S, are less likely to have insurance than people in the northeast, while those who

reside in the Midwest are less likely to be insured, all else being equal.

        Since results on socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and health

behaviors are incidental to our main research question, we present them only briefly. The

coefficients indicate the likelihood of purchasing insurance increases significantly with

age, adjusted household income level (i.e., income-to-needs quintiles) or education level.

Black and Hispanics were less likely to have insurance, whereas married persons are


                                                                                                 20
more likely to have insurance. Hazard rates (λ) generated from the probit model are

included as independent variables in the health status regressions summarized in Table 4.

The estimated coefficients of the hazard are denoted as ?te.

            Second Stage Estimates: Health Status Equations

            Model 1 and Model 2 in Table 3 represent second stage estimates of ‘treatment

effect’ models, corresponding to first stage estimates of Model 1 and 2 from the previous

table. With some minor rounding off, the two regressions on health status yield virtually

identical results. Thus, the discussion below applies equally to both specifications.

            Although generally health declines with age, the lack of significance of the age

variable here is not surprising given the narrow range of ages in our sample. While there

is considerable discussion of health care disparities in health, racial/ethnic origin does not

have a significant effect in our setting, probably as a result of holding socioeconomic

status and health behaviors constant elsewhere. On the other hand, females have

significantly lower health compared with males. As expected, there is a positive

association between education and health, with diminishing incremental gains from one

level of education to another. This result is consistent with the Grossman investment

model, which predicts that an individual’s marginal efficiency in deploying medical care

and other health inputs increases with the level of education. Increases in relative income

operate in a similar way as increases in educational attainment. There is a positive

association between income (relative to need) and health. Again the incremental gain of

this effect diminishes as income level rises, and becomes negligible at the highest

quintile.

            Three groups of variables deal with risky health behaviors, namely smoking,

drinking, and obesity. Past smokers and current smokers experienced significantly lower

                                                                                                 21
health compared with non-smokers. Moderate alcohol consumption had no significant

adverse health effects, whereas heavy drinking did. On the other hand, obesity is a highly

significant factor, with progressively decreasing health as body-mass quintiles move

higher. The lagged health index, which indexes initial health stock has a significantly

positive effect. The simple interpretation of this variable is that better health in the past

leads to better health in the future. A further interpretation of this variable, based on

rearranging the model to form a change equation, also suggests that it reflects the rate of

depreciation of health stock.9

        Since our main research question has to do with the consequences of the lack of

insurance, all of the preceding effects, while interesting, are essentially viewed here

merely as controls. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that these effects conform with the

broad literature and what is generally well known about determinants of health, further

indicating the validity of the health index as a measure of overall healthiness. This

increases our confidence in the main finding, namely that lack of insurance has a

significant negative impact on health. Because a number of measurement issues arose, we

defer to the summary of related results as presented in Table 4 and Table 5.

        Endogeneity of the insurance indicator:

        Table 4 provides a comparison of the three general types of econometric models:

ordinary least squares, the IV estimator, and the treatment model. The treatment model

was previously described, but the main coefficients are included here for expositional



9
  More explicitly, the complement of the lagged health coefficient, 1- 0.54 = 0.46 is the rate of
depreciation, yielding a cumulative average annual rate of 0.8 percent over the observed four-year
interval. Converted to elasticity terms, a 10 percent increase in past health contributes to
approximately 5.percent increase in health in the later period, all things being equal.



                                                                                                22
convenience. The specification of the IV model is analogous to the treatment model.

Thus the same set of exogenous variable is included in both types of model, and

insurance non-participation is instrumented two ways, i.e., using the strict identification

criterion (Model 1), with insurance offer variables only, and then using a fuller

specification with the full vector of health status covariates (Model 2).

        Only coefficients of the test variables and test scores, along with their levels of

significance are included in Table 4. The most important set of results pertains to the

insurance participation variable. The OLS model serves as a baseline case. As was

suspected, OLS underestimates the true effect of having insurance on health. The IV and

treatment models yield much larger estimates, but are similar to each other (Respectively,

4.06 and 5.05 in Model 1; 4.07 and 4.70 in Model 2).

        The coefficients of the first-stage residuals in the IV model and the coefficients of

λ in the treatment models are negative, implying that OLS underestimates the effect of

insurance. Since these coefficients are statistically significant in the first IV model and in

both treatment models we reject the null hypotheses that the error terms in the two stages

of the estimation are uncorrelated. However, estimates from IV estimators are always less

efficient (Vella and Verbeek, 1999). Therefore we refer to the treatment model

henceforth. Note that we made no a priori conjectures about the direction of the bias. The

results suggest that the former is the dominant explanation. An alternative explanation is

related to an unobservable trait, say a propensity to exhibit behaviors consistent with

moral hazard. This would lead people to choose insurance while reducing preventive

effort, and hence health status.

        Although we obtain strong results about the need to correct for endogeneity bias,

a question may arise regarding the quality of our instruments. The Wald-tests for

                                                                                                 23
parameter restrictions that we report in Table 2 indicate that our instruments are jointly

significant. While it is impossible to test for the correlation between the instruments and

potentially unobservable characteristics in the health equation, results from the indirect

test are encouraging. We regressed the health index on the full set of variables, including

all nine instruments from the first stage. We ran these regressions separately for the

subsample of the uninsured, the subsample of the insured, as well as for the pooled

sample. In all of these runs, none of the instrumental variables were significant at the 5%

significance level, save only the variable, ‘employed’, which designates workers who are

self-employed or in small firm10 . One of regional variables, West, was moderately

significant (10% level) only in the uninsured regression. The low regional variation in

health in our sample may not apply to the population overall. While we cannot assert with

certainty that these variables are uncorrelated with unobservable health status, the results

from these additional regressions11 are strongly suggestive of this, at least for the

particular population in our data.

          To put the magnitude of the insurance participation effect in perspective we

calculated the average treatment effects and population effects on health due to providing

insurance to the previously uninsured, and expressed them in percentage terms. Using

OLS and ignoring endogeneity, these are 2.0% and 0.3%. Accounting for endogeneity,

the effects on health are 7.2% and 1.3% respectively. Thus correcting for the bias

provides more favorable support in favor of extending insurance coverage to all.



10
   In trial regressions we took ‘employed’ out of the first stage, but found virtually no effect on
the lambdas. Thus we report the original specification.
11
     Side regressions are available from the authors upon request.



                                                                                                      24
6. Results: Chronic Conditions.

     One question that arises is whether health insurance matters more when some medical

conditions are present, but not others. When recognizable symptoms appear, i.e., a

medical condition is symptomatic, an individual may seek treatment regardless of

insurance coverage to relieve pain and suffering. Certain chronic conditions, such as

diabetes and hypertension are often asymptomatic; the demand for health care services by

an individual with an asymptomatic condition may be more sensitive to out of pocket

payments. Thus, we hypothesized that lack of health insurance has a greater adverse

effect on health (through greater negative effects on health care use) for individuals with

asymptomatic conditions compared to individuals with symptomatic conditions.

         To allow for differential effects we replicated the previous analysis for major

groupings of chronic conditions available in the Health and Retirement Study. Table 4

presents regression results for no chronic condition, all major chronic conditions (mainly

cancer, stroke, heart disease asthma, other upper respiratory illnesses12 the subset of

‘asymptomatic’ conditions, i.e. diabetes and hypertension, and for hypertension only. 13

We do not report results for the subgroup of symptomatic conditions, since the small

sample size (n= 2,042) resulted in a poor statistical fit. We did not perform separate

regressions on other individual diagnoses such as cancer or stroke due to small sample

sizes.


12
   Respiratory illnesses include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or emphysema.
Cancer may be diagnosed prior to appearance of symptoms, but is classified is a symptomatic
disease because symptoms would typically appear a short time later.
13
  Another common asymptomatic condition, high cholesterol count, was not available from the
survey.


                                                                                              25
        To conserve space and avoid redundancy, first stage insurance participation

regressions are not presented, as all versions were similar to those for the pooled model

previously discussed (Table 2). Thus we present only the second-stage health status

models. Coefficients of risk behavior variables display the familiar pattern whereby

excessive drinking, smoking, and obesity impact negatively on health. It is striking how

these effects persist with similar magnitudes for all subgroups. Having a chronic

condition does not make these effects “worse”, and not having a chronic condition does

not make these effects less pronounced. Effects are somewhat less significant in the

asymptomatic and hypertension groups, probably due to the smaller sample size. Other

persistent effects that are noteworthy are as follows: education is associated with better

health outcomes; females exhibit slightly lowered health values.

        Coefficient of variables of main interest are summarized in Table 6, including a

comparison of OLS and the treatment effects model for each population. The coefficient

of insurance participation, which is of greatest interest, is always higher in the treatment

model. In this sense results for the subgroups are consistent with the results for the pooled

sample. Moreover, these coefficients change from being non-significant in the OLS

models (populations 2-4), to being significant at the 10 percent level in the treatment

models. The magnitude of the adjusted effect is about the same in all populations.

However, because the coefficient of lambda (s ts) is non-significant in these models, we

cannot reject the null hypotheses that the error terms in the two stages of the estimation

are uncorrelated. By extension we cannot reject OLS unambiguously, although the low

standard error on the coefficient of the hazard may be due to smaller sample size.




                                                                                                26
Another reason for treating the results with caution is the possibility of errors in self

reported diagnoses.14 . From inspection of the regression results it is evident the insurance

effects are of similar magnitudes in all of the sub-samples. While we cannot be sure that

we captured relative effects precisely, the results are at least suggestive of there being no

significant differences by type of chronic condition.



     7. Conclusions

     Previous studies that examined the effect of insurance participation on measures of

health have found only small effects. For the most part, these studies did not explicitly

address the issue of endogeneity bias that arises if the decision to purchase insurance is

correlated with unobservable traits that may also impact future health. This study

indicates that adjusting for endogeneity of insurance in health equations in a treatment

effects or instrumental variable model leads to substantially larger insurance effects

compared with a more naïve model. It is encouraging that this finding is consistent with

that of Goldman et al., (2001), even though they examine the endogeneity issue in the

context of a more specific population, that of AIDS patients, and for a different outcome,

namely mortality.

   Underreporting of true medical conditions (i.e., false negative, or Type II errors) may also
occur in symptomatic conditions, although to a lesser extent than in symptomatic conditions. In
an interesting and comprehensive study, Baker, Stabile, and Deri (2001) suggest that false
positive errors may also be high. Using Canadian data they rely on a comparison of self reported
diagnoses with entries made by physicians in administrative medical records in a prior two-year
window. However, the health services research and epidemiological literature caution against
using administrative medical data as a benchmark, which may be even more prone to error since
diagnoses are often coded only if relevant to billing. This literature suggests a higher degree of
specificity in self-reported measures even compared with administrative data complied over long
period (e.g., Vargas et al., 1993, Bowlin et al. 1997). It is not our intension here to side with
either of these approaches, but rather to suggest that results should be treated with caution.

                                                                                                 27
    The possibility that insurance effects may have been underestimated in the past

suggests certain important policy implications. The rising number of the uninsured has

lead to many proposals to expand options for private insurance coverage. While our

results do not bear on the efficacy of one policy proposal versus another, they contribute

to the general debate by showing that insurance participation indeed can result in better

health, or conversely, that lack of access to health insurance may lead to adverse health

outcomes. We found that on average, providing insurance to the previously uninsured

results in a 7 to 8 percent improvement in overall health. The fact that our sample

consists of working age adults, who are in the pre-Medicare stage of their lives, i.e. ages

45-64 suggests that one should also weigh the externalities in terms of potential savings

to the Medicare program from earlier and more effective treatment that would be come

available for the uninsured. Ultimately policy choices for expanding coverage would

depend on programmatic costs of expanding coverage, in addition to benefits, but our

results still make the case for expanded coverage more attractive. It should be noted that

the Health and Retirement Study does not contain information on the type of plan or the

generosity of benefits available respondents. This issue should be examined in future

research.
