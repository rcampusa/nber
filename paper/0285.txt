            WAGE GROWTH AND JOB TURNOVER: PiN RNPIRICAL ANALYSIS

                       Ann P. Bartel and          George 3. Borjas



        This   paper demonstrates that labor turnover is a significant
factor in understanding wage growth since it affects both wag.
growth across jobs      and wage    growth within the job. Our analysis
shows that     young   men who quit      experience    significant wage gains
compared to     stayers and   compared      to their own wage growth prior
to the job change. Among older men, a quit increases wage growth
only if the individual said he changed jobs because he found a
better job.      Yet in both      ago   groups,    individuals who .xpect   to
remain on the current job experience steeper wage growth per time
period on that job. Thus labor turnover has offsetting effects on
wage growth, leading to wage gains across jobs but flatter growth
in shorter jobs. Our empirical analysis shows however that total
life—cycle wage growth       is   positively related to current tenure.
While   early mobility may pay,                    still changing
                                         individuals who are

jobs later in life experience lower overall wage growth.

               WAGE GROWTH AND JOB TURNOVER: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS

                       Ann P. Bartel* and George J. Borjas**


        The question of why an individual's wag•s grow over and above
economy-wid. productivity growth is fundamsnt&l to the analysis of the
earnings distribution. In fact, explanations of the earnings distribu-
tion such as human capital investments or random shock models are basic-
ally   descriptions   of   the wage growth process for   an   individual •   Despite
this importance, and mainly       due to the   lack of longitudinal data for a

given   individual, the pirical       analysis of wage   growth has lagged be-
                                                   2
hind the empirical                            This paper is a partial
                      analysis of wage levels •

attpt to remedy this asysustry. We focus on documenting how the .xis-
t•ncs of labor turnover systematically affects th. rate of growth in
wages both across jobs and within the job. It will be our working hy-
pothesis to interpret wage growth on the job to be the result of human
capital investment., both general and specific         to   the job. We will
also interpret wage growth across jobs as being due to changes in the
individual's human capital stock due to "mobility" investments (e.g.,
search) and losses of specific training incurred when job separation
takes place.
        Given this framework vs tackle two important questions in labor
economics.3 The first is a variation of the old question of whether
mobility "pays." Note that the cross-section comparison of movers to
stayers (or in the migration literature, migrants to non-migrants)
does not necessarily provide an answer to th. relevant questioni does
a person who moved during the time period under investigation do better
                                       —2—



than he would have done had      he   stayed? Of   course,   the   fact that   the
alternative   wage is not observed once the individual's decision has

been made has prevented researchers from       answering     this question.
Recent econometric techniques dealing with selection bias in censored
samples    (Heckinan (1978))   provide one method of approaching this prob-
lam.    In this paper,   however,   we pursue a somewhat simpler approach

that   utilizes   the longitudinal nature of our data. In particular, we

will analyze the on—the—job progress of a given individual before and

after the move.

        A second related question we will analyze is the effect of labor

turnover   on wage growth within the job. It is quite          obvious   that mo-

bility shifts the earnings profile after each separation occurs. It

is less obvious, but equally important, that an individual's inten-

tions   to separate from a firm will     affect the rate of growth of his earn-

ings in the current job. In particular, we hope to establish that job

iimnobility   (i.e.,   longer tenure) is associated with steeper wage growth

than would occur otherwise for a given individual.4 This finding should

prove useful on several grounds. First of all, it establishes that

indeed wages grow with tenure for a given individual. Although this

may seem like a somewhat trivial empirical result it should put to

rest doubts about the interpretation of the observed positive relation-

ship between wage levels and        tenure. In particular, there exists the

possibility that this positive correlation is entirely due to popula-
tion heterogeneity. That is, there exists some unobserved individual
characteristics which      lead to low wages   and   high turnover rates for

some persons, and to high wages and low        turnover rates for other
                                          —3—



individuals.      Then a cross—section correlation of wages and tenure

would be positive even if wages did not grow at all in the job.5

       More importantly, by establishing that wage growth on the job

is   related   to the separation probability, we can obtain some            esti-
mates of the importance of specific training in the labor market.
In particular, as long as specificity is an important component of
human capital     investments, the human        capital   hypothesis predicts a
positive correlation between        investment     costs per   year    and complet.d
job tenure. Since lower probabilities of separation are                 associated

with larger incentives to invest, we should observe steeper earnings
profiles in longer jobs. Note that the prediction implies not only
that wages grow on th. job for a giv.n individual, but that they
gri faster the better th. match (i.e., th. longer tenure). There-
fore, in a sense, the "gains to immobility" are due to the fact that
job tenure "matters" over and above the accumulation of labor market
exposure.
        The    purpose of this paper,      thersfore,     is to provide a systematic
empirical analysis of the relationship between wage growth and job
turnover. We will use two          data   sets in the studyi the National
Longitudinal Surveys      of Young and Mature Men.           Section   I provides a
systematic examination of the relationship between labor turnover and
wage growth across jobs. Section II analyzes th.                effects of job invo—
bility on      wage growth.   In   Section III we consider       the implications of
labor turnover for lifetime wage growth. Section IV briefly describes
the effects of personal and labor market characteristics on individual
wage growth. Finally, Section V summarizes the results of the study.

I. Labor Turnover and the Wage Profile Across            Jobs
       In this section we use the NLS Young and Mature Men samples to anal-

yze the effects of labor turnover on wage growth across jobs. There are

several important restrictions in our use of the data. First of all we

define labor mobility to occur when an individual changes employers.

Thus transfers within the same firm are viewed as part of the returns

to   staying   in the job. Secondly, to simplify the empirical analysis

we do   not attempt to distinguish between local movers and individuals
who changed jobs and      migrated simultaneously. In other words, we

ignore the     role   of geographic mobility and its     interaction   effects
with job turnover on wage growth.6 Third,          our   sample is composed of
individuals    who    either   did not change jobs at all in the period under

investigation or who did not leave the labor force after the separation

took place. Thus individuals who were either retired or in school at

the   beginning of the period or whose job separation was followed by
either retirement or by a return to school are deleted from our sample.7
For both data sets we concentrate on the interval between 1967 and 1973,
and partition this long period into three two-year intervals, 1967—69,
1969—71, and 1971—73.          We then pool the information in each of these

intervals   across the individuals in our sample, in effect tripling the
nanber of observations           The labor turnover variable is defined to
equal unity if the employer at the end of the two—year period is not the
same as the employer at the beginning of the two-year interval. Part A
of this section reports the results of comparing the two-year price de-
flated wage growth of individuals who separated from their jobs during
the period with       the relevant wage increases reported by stayers. In
                                     —5—


Part B we return to the question addressed earlier of whether mobility

"pays" for a given individual.


A. Comparing Movers    to Stayers
     Table   1 contains coefficients on dummy variables that indicate
the individual's mobility status over a two—year interval. These co-
efficient. are taken from regressions using absolute or percentage
wage growth over the two—year period as th. dependent variable and
holding constant a set of standardizing variables listed in the note
to the table.9 It is important to note that these standardizing vari-
ables are measured as of the beginning of the two-year period.
      The coefficients of the separation dummies may be broadly inter-
preted as estimates of the "gains" to mobility. Table 1 shows that
among the young men a quit is associated with an increase in earnings
but for the older   men   a quit has either a negative or zero effect on
wage growth. Thus, for example, young men who quit receive a wage in-
crease of 11 cents an hour more than those who stayed, while for older
men the wage increase is     approximately   minus   3 cents an hour.1° On
the other hand, in both samples being laid off from a job leads to
lower wage growth than for stayers, although in the young men's sample
the difference is not very significant. For the older men, however,
layoffs reduce wage growth over the two-year period by about 19 cents
per hour, An interesting result is obtained by making a direct com-
parison of quits versus layoffs. In the        case of young men, a quit is
worth about 14   cents more than a   layoff; while for the older men, a
quit is worth 16.3 cents more than a layoff. Thus although who gains
and loses relative to stayers varies over the life cycle, the gains to
                                     — 6-.

quitting as opposed to being       laid   off   remain   relatively   constant with

age.

        Of course, it is not surprising that quitters do better than              in-
dividuals who were laid off at all ages. What is puzzling is that

quitters do not do better than       stayers     systematically over the life

cycle. Further analysis of thi8 result can be conducted with the in-

formation   provided in the NLS on     the reasons       for the   quit. Thus we

decompose    the variable QUIT C— 1 if      change   was voluntary, 0      otherwise)

into two kinds of voluntary changes:            a quit   that is due to job-related
reasons and a quit that is due to personal reasons.11 The reader
should, of course, note that these reasons are reported after the sep-
aration took place and hence there may be some element of rationaliza-
tion on the worker's part which may contaminate the results we report.
The coefficients of JOBREL (job-related quits) and PERS (personal
quite) are shown in columns 1.2 and 1.5 of Table 1.                The   results are
quite striking. In both samples we now find              that individuals who quit

for    personal reasons had significantly smaller wage growth than stayers,
while men who had a job-related quit experienced higher wage growth
than stayers. This latter effect is quite significant for the young
men's    sample, but less significant in the older men NLS. The results,

therefore, imply     a very   significant differential in the gains from
quitting    by   reason   of quitting. Moreover, it is also of interest to
note that layoffs and quits for personal reasons have similar qualita-
tive effects on wage growth. This might be due to the fact                 that both

these    types of separations have a large exogenous and unexpected com-
ponent, so that these individuals would have had less search while on
the job than individuals whose quit was premeditated.
                                     —8—


       A further decomposition of the variable QUIT is examined in col-

tunna 13 and   1.6    by segmenting job-related quits into quits due to dis-

satisfaction with the current job (PUSH) and quits occurring because

the individual found a better job (PULL).12 One may argue that it is

irrelevant   whether the change was due to     a pull or a push since basic-

ally   the voluntary separation occurred because the individual's oppor-
tunities   were better in the new job.      That is, it is irrelevant whether
the   quit was due    to the fact that the present job was bad or to the
fact that the new      job was better. Either way, the new job improved the

individual's situation relative to the old       job. Although essentially
correct, this line of argument ignores an empirical peculiarity of the
data: most of the individuals who said they were pushed from the cur-

rent job gave reasons relating to the      non—wage   aspects of the job.
Thus there is no obvious reason to expect any kind of wage increase for
this group. Indeed, Table 1 shows that the effect of quits on wage
growth   differs   significantly depending on whether the quit was    a   pull
or a push.     Thus   a pull always leads to   significantly higher wage

growth than    that experienced by stayers while a push does not seem to
affect wage growth at all. In general, the results in Table 1 suggest
that the nature of a quit is a very important determinant of the gains
to mobility. Moreover, the results obtained with the detailed decom-

position of QUIT provide one explanation, though not a very convincing

one, of the fact that the QUIT coefficient varies over the life cycle.

In particular, a quit is more likely to be due to finding a better job

at younger ages, while at older ages the quit is mainly due to dis-

satisfaction with the current job. These results, however, are not
                                      —9—


•ntirely consistent with the      matching   view   of   labor   turnover since   the

matching process—-and     therefore   quits due to dissatisfaction with the

present employer-—is more likely to take place early in th. life cycle.

The fact that our data show the opposite is somewhat puzzling.

        Finally, one way of measuring the magnitude of the wage increase

due to PULL is to calculate the present value of this increase assuming

both that the individual works full-time until his retirement and                 that
the   wage increase due to the quit is general in the sense that it re-

mains with him throughout his working life.13 From column 1.3 the ob-

served wage increase is worth       $2,940   for the young men and $570 for the

older men. Obviously the longer payoff period for young men clearly

increases   the return   on   mobility investment.

B. Wage Growth    Prior   to, During, and    After   the   Move

        In the previous section we conducted an analysis            calculating    the
"gains" to mobility by comparing movers to stayers. As was pointed
out earlier, this procedure could create problens if population heter-
ogeneity is an important phenomenon in the labor market. The existence
of heterogeneity raises two distinct types of problems. First, the
separation dumeies that compare movers to stayers can be proxying un-
observed individual characteristics indicating both the propensity for
turnover and   the   individual's ability to "g"           on    the job. Since in-
dividuals with high propensities for turnover find it harder to "hold
onto a job," population heterogeneity would create a negative corre-
lation between wage growth and the separation probabilities. Moreover,
if one   reason stayers stay in the job is their          btter progress    (or

prospects for progress), clearly       this would further bias downwards the
"gains" to mobility.
                                        — 10 —




       Thus unless we resort to somewhat more complicated statistical

procedures, ordinary least squares comparisons of movers to stayers

will yield hopelessly biased estimates of the returns to moving. A

correct answer to the question of whether the individual gained by

moving can be obtained only by a comparison of the individual's new

wage progress to that which he would have obtained had he stayed at
the   previous job. Clearly the relevant alternative wage is unavail-
able once the individual's      separation decision is taken.           A simple
approximation, however, exists if        we   utilize fully    the   longitudinal
nature   of our data. For example, suppose we have a sample of in-
dividuals who either did not change jobs between 1967 and 1973 or
who changed only during 1969 and 1971. Thus the basic difference
between   the two   groups of men lies in their 1969—71 separation pro-
pensities. Suppose that we estimate wage growth equations similar
to those given in columns 3 and 6 of Table 1 for each of the sub-
periods:    1967—69, 1969—71, and 1971—73 as         a function of the 1969—71
separation   probabilities. The coefficients on these dummies can

then be studied to     show   how the   mover's wages were growing before he

changed    jobs, during the period in which he         changed jobs, and    after
the job change took place. If         we are willing to assume that the ef-
fect of the    1969—71 mobility dummy      on    1967—69 wage growth     is indica-
tive of how movers were doing in the job prior            to   separation, we can
then   determine conclusively whether a mover         gained    from   moving by
analyzing   the behavior of the separation          dummies over the six-year
period.     In particular,    the   individual improved    his situation by
moving if the   mobility     coefficient is more positive after the move
                                          — 11   —




than before the move. Thus           by looking at changes in the mobility co-
efficient we are,        in effect, controlling for     population   heterogeneity
since these unobserved individual characteristics are assumed to be
constant over time.
         The   results of estimating these equations are presented in Table 2.
Panels A and B give the results for young and            older men using     the sample
of men who either moved during 1969-71 only or who did not move at all

during the      six-year period. To show        how these results should be inter-

preted,    consider     in detail the effect of being "pushed" from the 1969

job on the wage profile of young men. We find that prior to the sepa-

ration, individuals        who were "pushed" from the job had significantly
lower wage growth        than   individuals   who stayed in   that job   subsequently.

o factors explain this result. Clearly, the movers                were not progress-
ing   well on the job and eventually          quit because of   this. Secondly,

if the job was a mismatch, as it         eventually turned out to be, and if
this    information was known      to both firm and worker, the incentives for
investment      in   the job were weak, leading to smaller wag. growth. 14
During the 1969—71 period, when the move actually occurred, we find
that    these same individuals had larger wage growth than stayers.             Again,
assuming that the difference between movers           and stayers in the 1967—69

period was the        correct comparison between the mover's old job and        the

stayers'    job, clearly the positive coefficient of PUSH on 1969—71 wage

growth provides very strong         evidence that the movers improved their
situation      significantly through job mobility. Moreover, we find that

these   gains   were   not temporary since the comparison of movers         to stayers
in   the 1971—73 period (after the move took place) yields the finding that

there   is no difference in the, wage progress of the two groups. There-

fore, we can safely conclude that individuals who moved used job mobil-

ity as a tool to achieve a better wage package.

        The reader can easily verify that almost (qualitatively) identical

results are obtained for the other types of voluntary     separations    in

the NLS Young Men's sample. For the mature men, this exercise yields

somewhat   mixed results. The reason is probably due to the fact that
the separation dunmties have vary low means. For example, the frequen-

cies of PUSH, PULL and PERS   are   .0098, .0059, and .0059, respectively.

        It may be argued that these findings are seriously biased by the
existence   of a selectivity bias since our sample consists of individ-
uals who either did not change jobs at all or who moved in only the
1969—71 period, so that the move was,     in a sense, successful. In     fact,
the use of an unrestricted sample where we include all individuals and
relate their wage growth in   all   three periods to their 1969—71 separa-
tion behavior, barely affects our results as can be    seen in Panels C

and   D of Table 2. If anything, we obtain somewhat more reasonable re-
sults for the mature men.

II. Labor Turnover and Wage Growth Within the Job
        In the previous section we have shown that labor turnover affects
the wage profile across jobs. In this section we demonstrate how labor
turnover also affects the earnings profile within the     job.   In   Part A

we present a simple framework for analyzing the relationship between
labor turnover and   on—the—job   wage growth and in Part B we document
empirically that labor turnover systematically affects the slope of
the earnings profile within the job.

A.   A Framework for Analyzing On-the-Job Wage Growth
        One way in which on—the—job wage growth can be studied is to inter-
pret it as the result of human           capital   investment. If no iibility oc-

curs during the period t—l           to t, then the absolute change in the indi-

vidual's earnings capacity during that period can                be written as:


                                Et — Et — Eti — rC_1                                     (1)


where   Et is earnings capacity at experience year t,                   denotes dollar

investment costs       in   t; and   r is the rate of return to post—school in—
vestments     on   the current     (th) job. Note that        C is composed of all in-

vestment costs borne by               individual. That is, it is composed         of   gen-

eral investments as well as the share of specific training costs paid by

the individual.

        The   change   in earnings capacity given by equation (1) is unobserved.

However, if all investment costs are             foregone    earnings, observed earnings,

     are defined      by       — Et -   C.   Thus equation (1) can       be rewritten    as:



                           —
                               rC1 -    (C
                                             —
                                                 Cr1)
                                                        —
                                                            rC1 +   8                    (2)


where B —     - (C     -
                           C_1).     Since, by assumption, no job change has        oc-
curred, observed wage growth on the job is composed               of    the returns to

on—the—job  training plus the change in investment costs from period to
period. If the investment profile is assumed to be continuous and lin-
early declining (within the job), the change in investment costs is
given by the constant rat.           of decline in investment in the current job,

8. Thus observed wage growth incorporates the saving in investment
costs as job       tenure increases.
                                             — 16 —




        To   convert equation (2) into observables, we hypothesize that in-
vestment     costs are a negative function both of previous experience and
of currant job experience.15 That is, re investment is undertaken
the younger the individual was when he started the job and the shorter
the   tenure on the job. Of course,            both these implications must be
qualified     by the fact that at low         levels   of tenure there is a consider-

able amount     of   learning taking place as both the individual and           firm
consider whether the job match is worthwhile. Moreover, at younger

ages,   as   the individual learns       about   the labor market, "job shopping"

might lead to an initial increase in investment.                 Thus   it is possible
that htnan     capital       investments may be zero or rise initially both with

age and     with   job    tenure.   We assume that these mtching periods are

reasonably short so that our linear approximations do not greatly dis-
tort reality. In particular, if ii measures experience prior to the
current job and a measures current job tenure, a simple relation
determining     investment costs would         be:16

                                    Ct —con —ow
                                              nn—Be
                                                 nn                                    (3)


Note that C measures the level of investment that would take place
          on
initially if the current job were the first job in the life cycle.

Substituting (3) into (2) yields:



                     tY
                         t      non +Bn +rB)—rair
                             —(rC         nfl nnn -rBe

Thus    a   simple regression of wage        growth on   previous and   currant experi-
ence gives coefficients that are             proportional to the effect of aging
both prior to        the job and    within   the job.
                                             — 17 —




           We   can introduce the relationship between labor turnover and on-
the—job wage growth by noting that C will vary systematically with
the probability of separation. That ii, sinc, a part of dollar in-
vestment costs is specific to the current job, there will be a posi-

tive correlation between the            level of the investment profile (measured

by C) and expected completed job duration. In other words, the in-
dividual (and       the    firm) will   invest more in longer jobs because they

can both collect the returns            to   specific training over a longer pe-

riod of time. Simultaneously, those individuals who              have invested
                                        incentive to stay longer. 17 Denoting t
                                                                                   *
more on the job will have an

as   expected     completed   tenure in the job as of the beginning of the

job, this       implies:

                                    C
                                        on
                                             —n+pt
                                                nn
                                                       *
                                                                                   (5)




If longitudinal data are used, information on t is generally available

as long as actual events closely parallel expectations. If we make

the   simplifying assumption that actual completed tenure equals t as a
first-order approximation, and if we observe a sample of individuals
changing jobs at some point during the survey, then it is possible to
estimate the parameter n (times a constant). In particular, rewrite
tn   as:



                                    tn —en +Rn
                                        *
                                                                                   (6)


where en is current job tenure and Rn is time remaining in the current
job. Using equations (4)—(6) we can derive:

       The human   capital   hypothesis would   predict   that   the coefficient
on R is positive, i.e., wage growth is steeper in longer jobs. It is

important    to note that this relationship cannot be measured        by observ-

ing   the coefficient on current    tenure, e. As equation         (7) shows, the
coefficient on e     is ambiguous because longer observed tenure (as of
the   time of the survey) implies both that the individual is older (the

aging effect 8) and that more will be invested since for given R the

job will be longer (the investment effect p). The key to demonstra-

ting that labor turnover and on-the-job wage growth are related is the

availability    of longitudinal data which enable us to observe an         in-

dividual s completed tenure. 18
        It is important to note, however, that an alternative interpreta-
tion can be given to the observation of a positive coefficient on R.
One could simply argue that in jobs where an individual is progressing,
i.e. where his wages are growing faster than they would elsewhere
(perhaps because of better opportunities for investment), the individ—
ual will have an incentive to stay. Again, we would observe a positive
correlation between on-the-job wage growth and completed job tenure.
Actually, either interpretation highlights the importance of human
capital in explaining labor turnover.

B.    pirical Results on Wage         Growth Within the Job
        Table   3   presents the results of estimating equation           (7) on both

NLS samples. In both cases, we selected a group of individuals who
had   stayed on the job between 1967 and 1969 but who had changed jobs

at any time during 1969 and 1973. Thus we have a sample of individ-

uals for whom time remaining on the job is observed.19 The equations

in Table 3 relate wage growth in 1967—69 to previous experience (PREy),

current   job tenure (JOB),       tim. remaining     on the job measured as of

1967    (RTEN), and      a   set of standardizing variables listed in the foot-
note to Table 1. As before,          the   wage growth   equations   are estimated in
two alternative ways: in column            3.1,   the absolute change in wages over

the 1967—69 period is the dependent variable, while in column 3.2, the

percentage change in wages is analyzed.



        Although the results are not statistically very strong, the co-

efficient of time       remaining on the     job, REMTEN, has the right sign and
                                                                     20
se to be more significant for the older men                sample         For example,
an extra year of job tenure in the older men sample increases the
hourly   wage   rate by about 2 • 5 cents     more   over the two-year time period
under investigation.         An   interesting exercise that can be        carried out

is to ask how much       does the   positive      correlation   between completed

tenure and wage growth contribute to total wage gains on the job?
This calculation can be done roughly in the following way. First of
all, in terms of yearly earnings (i.e., 2,000 hours supplied to                 the

labor market), we obtain the increase in annual earnings of expecting
to    stay one additional year on the job by multiplying .0125 by 2,0O0,2

                                      — 21 —




this    amount   is   $25.70. The individuals in our   sample,   in fact, stayed

20 years on the job (15 years prior to the survey and 5 after the sur-

vey). Therefore, from an ex ante point of view, staying an additional

20 years on the job is equivalent to an increase in annual earnings of

$514. The present value of this increase in annual earnings over the

completed job span (20 years of tenure) is $4,446. Thus there is sub-

stantial wage growth       on the job over and above that obtained if there

were no positive correlation between wage growth and          completed    job

tenure.     In   the case of young men, even though the coefficient of REHTEN

is 8.4 cents, the completed tenure is significantly smaller, only 6.6

years (2.9 years before the survey, 3.7 years after the survey). Thus

the present value of the wage gains due to the correlation between com-

pleted job tenure and wage growth        is   $2,700.22 of   course,   we recognize

that the insignificance of REMTEN in our equations indicates the need

for further research on this question.


III. Labor       Turnover and   Lifetime Wage Growth

         Parts   I and II of our paper have shown the role that labor turnover

plays in determining wage growth both across jobs and within the job. We

have    observed that individuals who change jobs voluntarily experience
wage gains while individuals who stay on the job appear to experience
steeper wage growth within the job. Thus one can xt predict a priori
whether turnover leads to smaller or larger lifetime wage growth. In
this    section we suggest how this question can       be answered.

         It might     seem appropriate to estimate an earnings function of the
form:


                          Ycz0+ct1t+a2t2+a3e+cz4e2                               (8)

where t is total labor force experience and e denotes current job tenure.
                                           — 22 —




This     type of earnings function is essentially basedon the argument that
on—the-job training        is composed both      of general and specific training.
The coefficients of t          capture the    growth of the individual over the life

cycle, while the coefficients of a measure any growth which                        is specific

to   the current job over and above the growth which would have occurred
due to general labor force experience. Thus, in principle, the estima-
tion of (8) would provide some insight into the                       importance   of    job

specific     skills in determining the observed wage                  structure. Unfortu-

nately,     a problem with this interpretation arises when (8) is applied
to   a   cross—section of individuals. In particular, consider an extreme

case in which there is no specific training and thus ci3 and a4 are
truly zero. If individuals self—select themselves into different types

of   jobs   because     they   differ in   their propensities to separate--in other

words,     there   is population heterogeneity--it may                be    that individuals

who match into a         "good" job receive high wages            and   therefore    show      low

propensities       to   separate    and individuals with "bad" matches receive low

wages and are therefore observed to have high propensities to separate.23
In this case, in the cross-section a3 may                   turn out       to be positive

artificially Thus the cross—section estimates of (8) may                           not   be very

meaningful in analyzing the relationship between turnover and life-

time wage growth.

          Using longitudinal data, however, we can provide a solution to

this problem. In particular, consider the equation:


                                                    2                      2
                                —
                                      = y1t   +         +         +                              (9)
                                                  y2t       y3e       y4e



where Y0     gives earnings in the first year               of the life cycle. Thus             by
                                 —23—



looking at wage growth we net out any individual differences that are
unobserved but   affect the individual's earnings throughout the life

cycle. The    coefficients 'y (i — 1,   ...   4) can   be interpreted   as the

effects   of experience and job tenure on total life cycle wage progress.
In particular, consider the extreme case in which there is no specific
training. Clearly the coefficients vi and '2 siaply captur. scale .f
fects and are expected to be positiv, and negative respectively. If
there    only general training, there is no obviou, reason as to why
        is

length of current job tenure provides any additional information on
total life cycle wage growth. In fact, if mobility "payee (that is,
there are non-negative gains associated with changing jobs), longer
tenure i*plies a smaller propensity for separation. If there is
serial correlation in this propensity over th. individual's life cycle,
this implies less turnover in the individual's previous experience t-e.
But under the assumption that mobility pays, the net effect of current
tenure should then be negative' On the other hand, if wag. progress
over the life cycle is a function not only of total experienc, but of
current job tenure, we would   expect   13 and 14 to be positive and nega-
tive respectively in equation (9). If this is the case, however, the
results can be interpreted as an indication of the fact that specific
training is an important component of wage determination.24 In other
words, job tenure matters over and above the passage of labor market
exposure.
        Unfortunately, the two data sets we use in this paper do not con-
tain any information on initial earnings in the life cycle. Moreover,
in the Young Men NLS the individuals are much too young and both labor
                                       — 24   —




market   experience and job tenure too short to get any robust estimates
of the parameters. However, in the older men NLS we do have a measure
of labor market progress made by the individual over the life cycle
since we are given the Duncan scale for the initial and current occu-
pations. One    distinct      advantage of using the Duncan     scale   is the
fact that the    measure of "earnings" is of a sore permanent nature.25

Table 4 presents the lifetime earnings growth regression estimated for

the Older Men NLS. In each case the linear job tenure coefficient is

positive and   significant      indicating that holding total labor force ex-

perience constant, longer        job tenure is associated with higher levels
of total life cycle wage growth. Therefore, the results unambiguously
show   that while mobility that      takes place   early in the life cycle may
pay,   individuals who have finally settled in a firm experience larger

lifetime wage growth than individuals who          are   still changing jobs.


IV. Effects of Other Variables

         In the previous sections we have documented that turnover is an

important    determinant of wage growth. In this section we explore in
more detail the other determinants of wage growth for both the Young
and Mature NLS    samples.      The basic results are    presented   in Table 5
where wage growth regressions are estimated separately for stayers,

quitters and    layoffs   in both age samples. In order to conserve space

we present only the results using arithmetic wage growth.



         The effects of the other variables are interesting. For ex-

ample, education has      a   strong positive effect on the wage growth of

young men. Moreover, within the young          men's sample, education

affects   the wage growth    of   men who separated from    the   job much more

strongly   than   that   of stayers. In the older men sample, however,          edu-
cation   has a significant affect only for those who quit. Therefore the
results   seem to suggest that education helps to increase the gains from

mobility for young men and the gains from quitting at older ages.

       The   coefficients   of experience are quite interesting in the young

men's sample. In particular, as predicted in Part II, experience has

a   negative effect on the wage growth       of stayers. Note,       however, that
experience   is positive (though very weak) for both quitters and layoffs,

indicating   that the accumulation of labor market experience            may   b. help-
ful in creating the gains from mobility. A similar pattern i. found
for older men: experience has a negative effect on the wage growth of
stayers, a positive effect on the wage growth of quitters and a zero
effect on the wage growth of people who          were   laid off.
         Other variables of some interest include a union coefficient which
seems to have a zero or negative effect on the wage growth of stayers.
Marital status and the       labor force participation status of the wife          have

significantly positive and        negative   effects respectively on the wage
growth of the young men stayers •        These   .f facts can   be   interpreted by
arguing that marriage increases the labor market investment incentives
of males (perhaps due to       the household division of labor), while if the

wife   works these incentives are diminished.

         Finally, one of the most    significant variables in the regression
is the size of the local       labor market. This variable has a strong

positive effect on the wage growth of stayers. Surprisingly, it has a

negative      effect on the wage growth of older men who were laid    off   from

their   jobs.


V. Suay
    In this        paper we have presented a systematic empirical analysis

of   wage growth in the National Longitudinal Surveys of Young and Mature
Men. We have demonstrated that labor turnover is a significant factor
in understanding wage growth since it affects both wage growth across
jobs and wage growth within the job. Some specific findings are smma-
rized below.
        1. Although the gains to quitting appear to be positive for young
men and zero      or negative for older men, this was           by distin-
                                                         clarified

guishing among       three types of quits: quits due to finding a better job,
quits   due to being dissatisfied with the current job and quits       due   to

personal      reasons •   It was then shown that in both age groups, individ-
uals who     quit because   they said they found a better job experienced
significant wage gains. At older ages a quit is mainly due to dis-
satisfaction with the current job and these types of quits do not in

general      significantly increase earnings. Since the nature of a quit

changes over the life cycle, this is the reason for the age differ-

ences in the impacts of quits on wages.

        2.    We extended our analysis of the wage gains from mobility by com-

paring not only movers and stayers but individuals to themselves in the

sense that we analyzed the individual's wage profile before, during and

after the move to determine whether it had been significantly affected

by mobility. It was shown         that   at least for the young men, this type

of   exercise led to the conclusion that a mover significantly gained         from

his   actions.

      3.    Labor turnover    and wage growth within the job are related

through the observed positive correlation between wage growth       and   com-

pleted job tenure. Individuals who expected to remain on        the job an

additional   year experienced steeper wage growth in the current period,
ceteris paribus.
      4. Since labor turnover was therefore found to have offsetting
effects on wage growth,      i.e. leading to wage gains across jobs but

flatter    growth in   shorter jobs, its   effect on lifetime wage growth
could not be predicted. Our empirical analysis showed, however, that,
even after holding total labor force experience constant, there exists
a strong positive correlation between length of current tenure and
total life—cycle wage growth. Thus, while early mobility may pay, in-
dividuals who are still changing jobs later in life experience lower
overall wage growth.
      In summary, this paper has tried to show that labor turnover af-
fects not only the growth of wages across jobs but also the rate at
which wages grow on the job. It is therefore an important factor that
must be taken account of in any study of the earnings distribution.

        31n previous work (Bartel and Borjas, 1977) we have analyzed the
problem of y people move. Mere we concentrate on establishing the
consequences of labor turnover for the individual' s wage-experience
profile.

        4Jovanovic (1978) provides a model that predicts wage growth on
the job based on the matching process between the individual and the
firm.

        5An extensive discussion of the role and effects of heterogeneity
in the labor market is given in the Heckman article in this voltvne.
Further analysis of the problem, with labor turnover used as the focus,
is provided by lovanovic and Mincer in this volune.

       7These   sample selection rules are far more serious than they ap-
pear to be. In particular, in the extreme age groups sampled in the
NLS, a significant portion of turnover may be due to either retirement

or   school enrollment changes.


        8There are two important qualifications to be noted here. First,

in the young    men's   NLS, many individuals were enrolled in school in

the early years of the survey. Since we concentrate on the labor mar-
ket behavior of men permanently attached to the labor force, we do not
have   observations for these individuals in the        early years so that
pooling cross—section and       time    series less than triples the number of
observations. Secondly, the efficiency of ordinary least squares can
be improved upon    by utilizing one of the many methods ni available
for pooling     cross—section   and    time-series.   We do not pursue this re-
finement    in this paper.

        9
         An exact description of these variables is given in Appendix A.


       '°Recall that these    numbers refer to the gains made over the two-
year period. To obtain annual effects of labor mobility, simply divide

the coefficients by two.


            job—related quit is one that occurred because (a) the individ-

ual was dissatisfied with wages, hours, working conditions, and/or

location of his job, (b) he disliked his fellow employees, or (c) he

found a better job. A personal quit is one            that   occurred because of

(a) health problems or (b) family reasons. For young men, 85 percent

of the quits were job-related while for the older men 73 percent were

job related.

       12PUSH     is defined as a quit that occurred because (a) the individ-
ual was   dissatisfied with wages, hours, working conditions or location

of   his job; or (b) he disliked his fellow employees. PULL is a quit
where the individual reports he found a better job. Anng the young
men 50   percent of job—related quits were "pulls' while for the older

men   only 35 percent    of these quits were "pulls."


          13The    calculation uses the formula:

                       PV —   2,000    •   (6W) 1T—1969 e_Xt dt



where 6W is the absolute wage increase, 2,000 hours            are   worked each

year, and T is the year of retirement. For young men, T—1969 is 43

years while for older men it is 10 years. We assume r equals 10 percent.


          14This hypothesis will be explored in detail in Part II.


          15These    implications      follow easily fron   life-cycle   optimization

models developed by Ben-Porath (1967), Becker (1975) and Heckman (1976).


          16The implications of this investment function for the wage

level equation are derived in Borjas (1975, 1978).


          171f firm    and    individual investments are positively correlated,

then clearly the firm         too   has a smaller incentive to lay off the

worker, further lowering the probability of separation.


          18Although the derivations in this section are in terms of abso—

lute   wage growth, similar equations can be derived for percentage wage
                                         — 36   —




growth.      In   particular, the analysis would      then   be conducted in terms

of   time—equivalent investment ratios. These ratios, in turn, would

then be expected to decline both over the life cycle and within the

job. Moreover, if higher levels of investment can only take place by

spending a larger portion of work time investing, one would expect a

positive correlation between these investment ratios and completed

job tenure. Thus the analysis may carry             over   to percentage wage

growth.

        19These sample        restrictions,   of course, raise the possibility of

sample selection bias; see Heckman (1978) for a thorough discussion of

this problem.

        20
             There are two possible reasons for the insignificance of REMTEN
in the Young Men NLS. First, these men are in the very early years of
their jobs when investment may not            be taking place. Second, the usable

sample is very small because during 1967—69 approximately half of the

individuals       were enrolled in school and are deleted from the sample;
anng the remaining 50 percent, the job separation rate is very
high thus resulting in further deletions. It is interesting to note
that by enlarging the young men's sample to include individuals who did
not   leave the job by 1973 and assigning an arbitrary value of 10 for

REMTEN for these individuals, the REMTEN coefficient becosies positive

and significant.

        21
             We use   .0125   rather than   .025 because the wage growth   equations
refer   to two—year intervals.
                                       — 37 —




      22Note   that the coefficient of REMTEN is never significant in
oolisn 32 when   we deal with percentage wage growth. In principle,
the correlation between investment and completed tenure need hold
only in terms of dollar investment costs and not in terms of time—
equivalent investment ratios since it is not clear a priori how
initial earnings capacities are correlated with completed job tenure.

           problem of heterogeneity versus state dependence is dis-
cussed in detail in the Heckinan and Jovanovic and Mincer papers in-
cluded in this volume.

      24
        Of course,   the   results could also be consistent with       the hy-
pothesis that wages   grow   on   the job because of a successful "match"

between employer and   employee.      In other words, an individual's mo-

bility ultimately led to his finding a firm        in which   he was   able   to

"move up the ladder."


      25The Duncan Index is       described   in Reiss (1961). It is very

highly correlated   with earnings in the occupation.
