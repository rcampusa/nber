The purpose of this paper is to understand the effects of endogenous markups and trade costs on the
pricing behavior of exporters when firms are heterogeneous in productivity. Using new analytical
distributions for markups under Bertrand competition, we uncover Ricardian patterns of export pricing
that generate higher markups and export price volatility when industrialized countries sell to developing
countries. These Ricardian patterns dissipate when developing countries move from bilateral to multilateral
trade liberalization. The results arise from a form of price rigidity for exports that arises endogenously
due to cut-throat competition, even though prices are otherwise perfectly flexible.

1    Introduction
The purpose of this paper is to understand the effects of endogenous markups
and trade costs on the pricing behavior of exporters when firms are heteroge-
neous in productivity. Using new analytical distributions for markups under
Bertrand competition, we uncover Ricardian patterns of export pricing that
generate higher markups and export price volatility when industrialized coun-
tries sell to developing countries. These Ricardian patterns dissipate when
developing countries move from bilateral to multilateral trade liberalization.
The results arise from a form of price rigidity for exports that arises endoge-
nously due to cut-throat competition, even though prices are otherwise per-
fectly flexible.
    Diminishing pass-through and volatility in traded goods prices over the
past several decades, as documented by (Bergin and Feenstra (2008), Corsetti,
Dedola, and Leduc (2008), and Gust, Leduc, and Vigfusson (2010)), present
a puzzle for models of heterogeneous firms with endogenous markups. Atke-
son and Burstein (2007 and 2008) demonstrate for the first time that trade
costs reduce the market power of heterogeneous exporters, limiting the degree
to which they can pass through shocks to marginal costs to consumers and
thereby dampening export price volatility relative to other aggregates. Yet
trade costs have been falling at the same time as pass-through and volatility
in traded goods prices. This presents a conceptual challenge for current models
of trade with heterogeneous firms. Both Edmond, Midrigan, and Xu (2012)
and Arkolakis, Costinot, Donaldson, and Rodriguez-Clare (2012a) show for
a wide class of models with imperfect competition and endogenous markups
that trade liberalization can actually increase the market power of exporters
as they internalize the drop in trade costs by charging higher markups, given
that the liberalization takes place between symmetric countries or between
only two countries with independent productivity distributions. Under these
circumstances, theory would predict increased pass-through and volatility in
an age of falling trade costs while the data suggests the opposite.
    In this paper, we demonstrate with concise functional forms exactly when
                                      1
trade produces pro-competitive effect under Bertrand competition with het-
erogeneous firms that would result in less ability for exporters to pass through
shocks to marginal cost into the prices of their goods. We argue that devel-
oping countries must charge lower markups when exporting to technologically
more advanced countries, which reduces their ability to pass through shocks
to marginal costs into prices. Further, accession into multilateral trade agree-
ments can reduce pass-through and volatility in the prices of goods exported
to developing countries from industrialized countries. Bilateral trade liber-
alization allows exporters from a favored industrialized country to compete
principally with domestic producers in the destination market, where the av-
erage foreign exporter would have a technological edge. However, multilateral
trade liberalization in this case forces exporters from different industrialized
countries to compete more directly with each other, so they have less ability
to garner market power in the destination market and thus less ability to pass
on cost shocks into prices.
    We characterize the bilateral result, where exporters respond to trade lib-
eralization by charging higher markups, resulting in increased volatility, as an
anti-competitive effect. The decrease in markups charged by exporters in the
favored nation when the destination market expands to multilateral liberal-
ization is thus a pro-competitive effect. Pro-competitive effects also emerge
among domestic producers when their native market opens to trade under any
circumstances, as new competition from foreign rivals forces them to reduce
markups.1 The mechanisms behind pro-competitive effects have heretofore
been a black box in international trade and macroeconomics– are they driven
by technological differences, by domestic contestability, by geographic fric-
tions? We show that they are a product of all three and show their relative
contributions.
    Understanding this balance is crucial in open economy models, as it gener-
   1
    There is ample empirical evidence from the trade literature that pro-competitive effects
from trade exist and can be large. Among these are Levinsohn (1993), Harrison (1994),
Roberts and Supina (1996), Bottasso and Sembenelli (2001), Novy (2010), and Feenstra and
Weinstein (2010), Edmond, Midrigan, and Xu (2012), and de Loecker, Goldberg, Khandel-
wal, and Pavcnik (2012).

ates a type of price inertia distinct from the conventional forms of price rigidity
assumed in standard macroeconomic models. Atkeson and Burstein (2007 and
2008) and Alessandria (2009) show that the special behavior of the endoge-
nous markups combines with costly trade to generate a lower volatility of the
terms of trade relative to the real exchange rate.2 This rigidity can have other
important macroeconomic manifestations, as in Obstfeld’s (2009) argument
that incomplete pass-through in export prices following a nominal exchange
rate appreciation broke the Harrod-Balassa-Samuelson effect during the ap-
preciation of the Japanese yen from 1985-95. Recent evidence also suggests
a Ricardian influence over the degree of pass-through: Bergin and Fenstra
(2008) and Gust, Leduc, and Vigfusson (2010) show that pass-through is par-
ticularly limited for exporters from developing countries to the U.S. market,
while Frankel, Parsley, and Wei (2012) document that pass-through is greater
for exports to developing countries than to industrialized countries. We believe
that the two sets of findings– lower markups under trade and relatively rigid
export prices, with the degree of rigidity varying in a Ricardian pattern– are
related through trade costs and Bertrand competition by heterogeneous firms.
    Our model involves a finite number of firms competing within each industry.
The most efficient firm in the industry ultimately becomes the sole supplier
of that particular good, but only because it beats back its competitors by
underselling them: it cannot charge a price higher than the marginal cost of
its next best rival. We argue that trade costs make firms’ prices more likely to
be bound by their next best rival when selling overseas compared to their home
market. We show analytically that this cutthroat competition can generate
reduced markups under trade, pricing to market, and imperfect pass-through
by causing price rigidity even when prices are not set in advance due to menu
costs or other constraints.
    Bernard, Eaton, Jensen, and Kortum (2003, hereafter BEJK) pioneered
the use of this form of price competition with heterogeneous firms and trade
  2
     In particular, papers such as Baxter and Landry (2010), Berman, Martin, and Mayer
(2012), Fitzgerald and Haller (2010), Schoenle (2010), Gopinath, Itshoki, and Rigobon
(2010), and Gopinath and Itshoki (2010) show that firms often price to market and do not
fully pass on changes in marginal costs and exchange rates to foreign buyers.

almost a decade ago. It is not clear whether they assumed the number of rivals
to be infinitely large or Poisson distributed.3 In contrast, we generalize their
approach by endogenizing and explicitly focusing on a finite number of entrants
that compete in each industry so that markups are sensitive to market size
and structure, in line with findings in the closed-economy literature such as
those by Campbell and Hopenhayn (2005). When the number of competitors
is infinitely large, our distribution of markups converges to that of BEJK. In
particular, in this limiting case, there are no anti- or pro-competitive effects
from trade, allowing Bertrand competition to fit within a gravity framework.
    Because we explicitly include a finite number of rivals, we see that the dis-
tribution of markups is directly affected by the number of firms competing to
be the low-cost supplier in the closed economy or in the case when both of the
best potential suppliers to a market are in the same source country.4 One can
conceptualize the number of rivals as an exogenous policy parameter, as in the
numerical analyses by Atkeson and Burstein (2007 and 2008) and de Blas and
Russ (2011), or endogenize it using a free entry condition as we do below, and
as Holmes, Hsu, and Li (2011) have recently done, as well. The key is that
unlike models using Chamberlinian monopolistic competition or limit pricing,
such as Melitz (2003) and Melitz and Ottaviano (2008), the degree of entry
embodied in the number of rivals changes the shape of the entire distribution
of markups, costs, and firm size. Although the number of rivals appears simi-
lar to a scale parameter representing technological advancement in our model,
it has a more complex effect on the distribution of markups through the joint
distribution of the first and second order statistic for unit cost. The num-
ber of rivals itself is not critical, unless it becomes so large as to obscure the
    3
      Their results nest within ours and within those of Holmes, Hsu, and Li (2011) if the
number of rivals is infinite. However, in the statistics literature, it is known that a Poisson-
distributed number of draws from the Weibull can be integrated out to focus on other
parameters (Raftery 1987). Finally, the number of rivals also drops out of the distribution
of markups in two special cases discussed below if the underlying distribution of efficiency
levels is Pareto, rather than Fréchet.

      Claessens and Laeven (2004) and de Blas and Russ (2011) refer to this as “contestabil-
ity,” a phenomenon with roots in the industrial organization literature. See in particular
Baumol, Panzar and Willig (1982), related to the Panzar-Rossi measure of contestability
used by Claessens and Laeven (2004).

effects of trade costs or technological differences on market structure. Most
importantly, having a finite number of rivals allows other elements of mar-
ket structure– including trade costs and differences in technology and wages
across countries– to influence the distribution of markups. We use these new,
closed-form distributions to draw out Ricardian effects on markups, as well
as the impact of multi- versus bilateral trade liberalization on price volatility
that have been observed empirically but not integrated into the theoretical
literature on pass-through.
    The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the relation-
ship of our model with previous empirical and theoretical studies. Section 3
presents a simple closed economy model with analytical solutions for the dis-
tribution of markups and prices which include the number of rivals. We show
the relationship between entry and the aggregate domestic price level. Section
4 considers the implications of trade in goods for these distributions given
asymmetric trading partners. In Section 5, we show that our distribution of
markups implies a higher degree of price adjustment (higher price volatility) in
response to these shocks for domestic versus export sales. Section 6 concludes.


2       Related literature
The basic insight motivating our construction of the model stems from the nu-
merical simulations of Atkeson and Burstein (2007 and 2008), Garetto (2012),
and de Blas and Russ (2011). All of these numerical studies start with a
Fréchet or lognormal distribution of firm efficiency levels, then build on BEJK
by computing markups under Bertrand competition (also Cournot in the case
of Atkeson and Burstein (2008)). Collectively, they note that the size of the
markup shrinks under trade and that trade costs make firms less able to pass
on shocks to marginal costs by raising export prices.5 They also note another

    A number of recent papers make advances using nominal rigidities to achieve the stickier
export prices behind the low relative volatility of the terms of trade. These include Corsetti,
Dedola, and Leduc (2008), Gopinath and Itshoki (2010), and Schoenle (2010). Alessandria
(2009) and Drodz and Nosal (2012) use consumer-oriented frictions in distribution and
marketing. In Section 5, we discuss nominal rigidities as complementary to the real rigidities

key feature– that the number of competitors within each industry, either the
number of domestic competitors or foreign trading partners, affects both the
size of the average markup and the degree or frequency of pass-through.
    We introduce a finite, cutthroat group of rivals for each industry within
the BEJK framework that generates the markup and pricing behavior observed
both empirically and numerically in previous studies. We assume an indepen-
dent Fréchet distribution of efficiency draws for each country, following Eaton
and Kortum (2002). Our model achieves tractable analytical solutions for the
distribution of markups under autarky and trade with a finite number of firms
competing to supply the market. In short, we build a standard Ricardian
model of trade with a fully specified distribution of markups that is consistent
with observed domestic and export pricing behavior. The assumption in our
model that rivals to the best firm in each industry are latent is not necessary to
achieve these distributions (see de Blas and Russ 2012 for a search framework
with similar numerical results). We maintain this assumption to nest within
existing literature and keep the model as simple as possible while we illustrate
their implications for firm-level and aggregate price adjustment.
    Entry in this Ricardian model does not affect the number of goods pro-
duced, but rather the number of firms competing to be the low-cost supplier
of a particular good. “Competing” in this sense means drawing an efficiency
parameter from an identical distribution and being ready to jump into pro-
duction if a chance arises to undersell an active firm. The most efficient firm
will have the lowest cost— the first order statistic for costs in the industry6 —
and become the only active supplier. An increase in the number of firms that
compete to be the low-cost supplier of a good changes the shape of the en-
tire distribution of marginal costs and markups. Since the circulation of this
paper, Holmes, Hsu, and Li (2011) have used a similar approach to analyze
agglomeration and allocative efficiency, as well as to draw important new in-
sights regarding the gains from trade. Zolas (2011) has shown that the number
arising from market structure.

of potential competitiors influences a firm’s choice of where to file patents. Fi-
nally Peters (2011) has developed a related framework with dynamic entry to
analyze growth in total factor productivity within a closed economy.
    Edmond, Midrigan, and Xu (2012, hereafter EMX) in an important con-
tribution extend our understanding of and rigorously quantify the degree of
gains from trade due to pro-competitive effects based on the model of Cournot
(quantity-based) competition in Atkeson and Burstein (2008). They use Tai-
wanese data to calibrate the model and estimate the gains, and push the
frontier of Cournot modeling with heterogeneous firms forward by linking the
pro-competitive effects of trade to changes in the dispersion of markups, as
well as the average markup, within a two-country framework, with the second
country representing the rest of the world. They run several experiments, but
the one closest to our treatment of the Bertrand setting of price competition is
their experiment where the distribution of productivity draws across countries
is independent. In this case, they find that pro-competitive effects of trade are
actually negative in their simulations. The logic behind their result is similar
to the insight drawn by Arkolakis, Costinot, Donaldson, and Rodrı́guez-Clare
(2012a) regarding other models of trade with endogenous markups: highly ef-
ficient exporters exploit reductions in trade costs by absorbing them as higher
markups. Our multi-country setting provides a distinct and nontrivial result.
In short, this anti-competitive effect is only likely if trade costs are not lowered
for competing trade partners– thus, in unilateral, versus multilateral trade lib-
eralization. Second, EMX attribute the result largely to the fatness of the
tails in the distribution of efficiency levels, but it is difficult to see the exact
relationship between trade barriers and the parameters of the distribution in
a numerical setting. We show the precise likelihood that lower trade costs
will be absorbed into the markup as a function of this dispersion by deriv-
ing an explicit distribution of markups. In addition, our model suggests that
we can verify empirically whether anti- or pro-competitive effects arise after
liberalization even when it is not possible to measure markups by measuring
whether the degree of pass-through and import price volatility increases (anti)
or decreases (pro).

3       Autarky
The heart of the model lies in the production of intermediate goods by het-
erogeneous firms. For simplicity, we assume that producers of the final good
are perfectly competitive and assemble the intermediate goods, with no addi-
tional capital or labor necessary. The continuum of intermediate goods j spans
the fixed interval [0,1]. The assembly process uses a technology involving a
constant elasticity of substitution across inputs, with aggregate output given
by                                                σ
                                  1            σ−1

                                      0

Output of the final good is purchased for immediate use by consumers or as an
input into the production of intermediate goods. When used as a production
input, it is fully expended– no inventories are carried over into future periods.
We consider each intermediate input j as representing a different industry and
assume that the price elasticity of substitution between output from different
industries σ is greater than one. The
                                    demand−σ     for an individual input is down-

    Each producer of an intermediate good draws an efficiency parameter z
from a cumulative distribution F (z) with positive support over the interval
(0,∞]. Eaton and Kortum (2009, Chapter 4) describe a process whereby over
time, F (z) can emerge as a frontier distribution representing the efficiency
levels associated with the best surviving ideas available to produce a particular
good j. Being the distribution of the best surviving ideas, F (z) naturally takes
on an extreme value form and under mild assumptions, it can be characterized
by a Fréchet distribution.7 Thus, we assume that an endogenous number of

    In particular, EK suppose that each period a group of new ideas emerges with the
quality of these ideas distributed as Pareto. Over time, the distribution of the best (most

                                     F (z) = e−T z .

We assume that T > 0 and also that the shape parameter, θ, is positive. Only
the most efficient firm with efficiency level Z1 (j) in any industry supplies the
market. This efficiency parameter increases the level of output a firm produces
from one unit of a composite input Q:

                                   Y (j) = Z1 (j)Q(j).

    Marginal cost for this most efficient firm, C1 (j), is inversely related to the
efficiency parameter,
                                            wd
                                C1 (j) =         ,
                                          Z1 (j)
which accounts for both the cost of the composite input, w, and any frictions
involved in sending intermediate goods to the assemblers of the final good, d ≥
1 . We assume that both labor and the final good are used in the production
of intermediate goods with constant cost shares: w = ω β P 1−β , ω being the
labor wage rate and p the cost of a bundle of intermediate goods. The cost
parameter drawn by any firm hoping to produce good j is distributed

Given that some number of rivals r draw an efficiency parameter hoping to be
efficient) idea surviving from each period then becomes Fréchet, also known as an inverse
Weibull (Pawlas and Szynal, 2000). Costs are inversely related to efficiency levels, so costs
in this case are Weibull distributed, as in Eaton and Kortum (2002).

We assume that d = 1 under autarky in this section and for domestic sales
in the open economy in Section 3. The limiting distribution– G1 (c1 ) given an
infinitely large sample r– is well defined for any positive, finite T . (See Castillo
(1988, p.116) and Castillo, Hadi, Balakrishnan, and Sarabia (2005, p.207) for
the derivation of the limiting distribution of maxima drawn from a Fréchet
distribution.)


3.1     The distribution of markups
Let C2 (j) represent the unit cost of the second-best competitor in industry
j, who sits inactive but ready to begin production instantly should the op-
portunity arise. Given the CES assembly technology for the final good, the
lowest-cost firm producing good j would like to set a price using what we call
the “unconstrained” markup, where marginal cost equals marginal revenue—
                         σ
the CES markup m̄ ≡ σ−1     > 1. However, if charging the CES markup results
in a price that exceeds the marginal cost of the second-best competitor waiting
in the wings, the lowest-cost supplier may find itself undersold. In short, no
firm can charge a price that exceeds the unit cost of its next best rival. The
low-cost supplier in each industry j takes the prices of the low-cost supplier in
every other industry as given. The markup for industry j is then

     See Rinne (2009), p.237 for derivation. The assumption that BEJK use regarding the
number of entrants to simplify their framework is not stated in the published or working-
paper version of the text. Their results can be replicated by assuming that it is infinitely
large. (See Holmes, Hsu, and Li (2011) for details regarding the derivation of the composite
distribution of efficiency draws, or our discussion below with regard to markups.) Alterna-
tively, the number would drop out of the analysis if one assumed that the number of firms
competing in any industry is a random variable with a Poisson distribution and integrating
over its domain. In contrast, we preserve the number of rivals in the following analysis.

                                            10
    With this formula for the markup, we compute the expected output-weighted
price for any good j in several steps. First, note that the price for good j,
P (j), is given by
                                (                       C2 (j)
                                    C2 (j)        for   C1 (j)
                                                                 ≤ m̄
                      P (j) =                           C2 (j)

Thus, the pricing rule depends not only upon the distribution of the first and
second order statistic of the marginal costs, but also upon the distribution of
the ratio of the two order statistics. In Appendix A we use a straighforward
Jacobian transformation on a result from Malik and Trudel (1982) to obtain
                    C2 (j)
the distribution of C 1 (j)
                            , which is the distribution of the markup before impos-
ing the unconstrained markup from the CES bundling of intermediate goods.

every industry j, the probability density of the ratio C      2 (j)

At the unconstrained markup, there is a mass point, which we show in Figure
1.
    Like the distribution of markups given in BEJK, this distribution is sta-
tistically independent of C1 (j) and C2 (j). In fact, for very large r, we have
limr→∞ h(m) = θm−θ−1 for 1 ≤ m ≤ m̄, which is a Pareto density for markups
identical to the one in BEJK. With the CES bundling technology, firms will
never set a markup greater than m̄, creating a mass point in the density at m̄,
                      C2 (j)
since all cases where C 1 (j)
                              exceeds m̄ are assigned a value of m̄. The probability
of charging the unconstrained markup is simply

                             Z∞
                  C2 (j)                        r

                                             11
Note that as m̄ goes from its own upperbound of ∞ (for σ = 1) to its lower-
bound of 1 (for σ → ∞), this probability moves monotonically from 0 to 1, so
it is a well behaved cumulative distribution function over the range of possible
markups.

Proposition 1 The average markup is decreasing in the number of rivals r
under autarky.

                                                                           C2 (j)
Proof. For any given value 1 ≤ m0 ≤ m̄, the probability that M (j) ≥       C1 (j)
                                                                                    is
greater than or equal to m0 is decreasing in r:
                          ∞                   
                           R r(r−1)θm−(θ+1)

                               (r−1)+m−θ ]            −[(m0 )θ − 1]
                      =                          =                       < 0.

Equivalently, we can say that the distribution of markups when r is low first-
order stochastically dominates the distribution of markups with a higher r.
First-order stochastic dominance implies a higher expected value; therefore
E[M (j)] must be decreasing in r.
   It follows from Proposition 1 that the number of rivals affects the size of the
mass of firms charging the unconstrained markups, as stated in the following
corollary.

Corollary 1 In expectation, the fraction of firms charging the unconstrained
markup is decreasing in the number of rivals r under autarky.

Proof. The proof of Proposition 1, combined with equation (4) shows that
                   C2 (j)
the probability of C1 (j)
                          being at least as large as m̄ is decreasing in the number
of rivals. Markups are set equal to m̄ whenever M (j) would be greater than
m̄ without the restriction of the CES upperbound. Thus, in expectation,
the fraction of firms charging the unconstrained markup is decreasing in the
number of rivals.
    As the number of rivals in an industry j increases, both the average markup
and the probability that any firm charges the unconstrained markup falls—
increased rivalry squeezes markups. Intuitively, the result emerges because,
                                          12
on average, increasing the number of rivals in our order-statistic framework
diminishes the difference between the costs of the two best potential suppliers.
This is not the case for a Pareto distribution of firm efficiency levels, as shown
in Appendix A. When firms draw from a Pareto distribution of efficiency levels,
markups are again Pareto distributed as in BEJK (and in our special case
above with many competitors), with no impact from the number of rivals. To
reinterpret BEJK’s sports analogy in our setup: with the distribution of costs
in equation (2), a competitor running second in a race will run even faster
relative to the winner when there are more competitors behind him. However,
with Pareto efficiency draws, no matter how many additional competitors trail
behind in the race, each runner maintains both his speed and spacing relative
to the person in front of him.9 In economic terms, the Fréchet distribution
implies diminishing returns to technological growth through entry: as the
number of rivals increases, there is a greater chance that additional rivals’
efficiency draws will fall within the existing production possibilities frontier
than that they will expand it outward.
    To illustrate our new distribution of markups, Figure 1 shows the restricted
distribution of markups when r equals its minimum value of 2, versus 20,
the number of rivals chosen by Atkeson and Burstein (2007) calibrated to
match U.S. industry concentration. We use θ=3.6 and σ=3.79, as estimated
by BEJK. The fraction of firms charging the unconstrained markup falls dras-
tically, from one-half to just over one-third. We will discuss the implications
of this statistic for price rigidity in Section 5. For now, we use the distribution
of markups to compute the aggregate price level.
   9
     We believe the key difference is that the value of any outcome z enters the inverse of the
hazard function linearly, which is not the case for the Fréchet used here or the lognormal
used in Atkeson and Burstein (2008). Or more simply, the Pareto mean is linear in its
minimum, which is also the case for the uniform distribution. Their density functions are
flat or convex, rather than being strictly concave around the mode as in our model.

3.2     The distribution of prices
As shown in de Blas and Russ (2011), the joint distribution for the first and
second order statistic also contains the number of rivals r:
                                           2    θ−1 −T w−θ cθ1 −(r−1)T w−θ cθ2
          g1,2 (c1 , c2 ) = r(r − 1) θT w−θ cθ−1
                                    

To find the marginal distribution for C1 (j) (C2 (j)), one can integrate the
joint distribution over values of c2 (c1 ).10 We find that increasing the number
of rivals leads, on average, to lower costs in the industry. We compute the
moment 1 − σ, which appears in the formula for the aggregate price level
Equation (1), for the first and second order statistics of marginal costs, so
  10
    Integrating the joint distribution over c2 from c1 to ∞, for instance, one obtains the
marginal distribution g1 (c1 ) and sees immediately that it is equal to the first derivative of
G1 (c1 ). To obtain the marginal for C2 (j), one instead integrates over c1 from zero to c2 , as
we do later for the open economy in Appendix E.

                                                θ

Taking the derivative with respect to r, we see that these 1 − σ th moments are
increasing in r as long as θ ≥ σ − 1. Since we assume that σ is greater than
1, the first moments, E[C1 (j)] and E[C2 (j)], by implication are falling in r.11

Proposition 2 The aggregate price level P is decreasing in the number of
rivals r under autarky as long as the dispersion in firm efficiency levels is
large enough to balance the consumer’s love of variety, θ ≥ σ − 1.

Proof. Intuitively, Proposition 2 is true because an increase in r shifts the
distribution of markups to the left at the same time it reduces the expected
marginal cost of the best supplier. More rigorously, since firms in all industries
draw from the same underlying distribution, using the law of large numbers
one can calculate the aggregate price level,
                       1           
                       Z               Z1
         P 1−σ    = E  P (j)1−σ dj  = E[P (j)1−σ ]dj = E[P (j)1−σ ].
                            0                      0


Recall that P (j) = M (j)C1 (j). Using this pricing rule and noting that the
distribution of the markup is independent of outcomes for the individual order
statistics C1 (j) and C2 (j), we have

                 P 1−σ = E[M (j)1−σ C1 (j)1−σ ] = E[M (j)1−σ C1 (j)1−σ ]

We show above that both E[M (j)] and E[C1 (j)] are decreasing in r as long
as θ ≥ σ − 1, thus P is also falling in r.
  11
    We also know hfrom Proposition
                          i          1 that E[C2 (j)] falls faster in r than E[C1 (j)], since the
                   C2 (j)
expected ratio, E C1 (j) is falling in r.
                                                  15
3.3     The number of rivals
The variable in our model which BEJK normalize to suppress the effects of all
other aspects of market structure on markups is the number of rivals r. We
use a free entry condition to motivate the treatment of r as finite.12 Following
Melitz (2003), we assume that there is a uniform probability of death, 0 < δ <
1, in every period. Entrepreneurs must pay a fixed cost f in order to draw
an efficiency parameter. This fixed cost is denominated in units of revenue
here, but we can also specify f in units of labor as in Melitz (2003) without
affecting our qualitative results below at all. When drawing, they can only
see how many rivals there are in the industry, not the marginal cost of any
rival. In equilibrium, the finite number of rivals, an integer, must be such that
the expected present discounted value of output for an active producer is no
smaller than the sunk cost of entry,

                 s=0


We also use the labor market clearing condition to define market size Y . In
steady state, it is
                               ωL = βλP Y,                               (7)

where L is the number of workers, β is labor’s cost share in the input bundle
used to produce intermediate goods and λ is the share of variable costs as a
fraction of total expenditures,

                                      E[C1 (j)Y (j)]   E[M −σ (j)]

steady-state expressions

We this present this condition graphically in Figure 2, which is calibrated as
in Figure 1, with the quantity 1 + βδf  L
                                           calibrated to show entry by 20 rivals
in each industry, the level used in Atkeson and Burstein (2008). Recall that
the probability of forced exit, δ, is independent of firm efficiency, and that the
distribution of the markup is independent of the distribution of costs,13 so in
Appendix B using Jensen’s inequality, we show that the free entry condition
reduces to                                           

                                                   L
In Appendix B.2, we prove that the left hand side is decreasing in r, as shown
in Figure 2, resulting in a unique equilibrium solution for r. This means that
the number of rivals in each industry grows as the fixed cost f , and the exit
rate δ fall, as well as when market size L is bigger.
    The distribution of the markup derived above does not yield a closed-form
solution for the expected markup E[M (j)] or for the expected log markup,
E[ln M (j)]. However, we can determine an upper- and lowerbound for r. Not-
ing from Jensen’s inequality that E[M (j)] ≥ ln E[M (j)] and that ln E[M (j)] ≥
E[ln M (j)], the form of the free entry condition in equation (10) implies
                                                                           

Proposition 1 states that the mean markup, E[M (j)], is decreasing in the
number of rivals, r. In combination with this insight from Proposition 1,
E[M (j)] ≥ ln(1 + βδf

at least as large as the amortized fixed cost of entry.

Notice that the number of rivals in each industry grows as the fixed cost f , the
share of labor in the input bundle β, and the exit rate δ fall, as well as when
                                       18
market size L is bigger. Campbell and Hopenhayn (2005) show a negative
relationship between markups and market size in U.S. cities consistent with
the scale effect implied by our free entry condition. Note also that entry is not
proportional to changes in market size L, but can grow much faster than L,
a departure from the Melitz model that will impact gains from trade below.
This yields many interesting implications, for example, from equation (2) it is
clear that increasing the number of rivals influences the distribution of costs
exactly like an increase in the technology parameter T .Thus, reducing barriers
to entry pushes out the technological frontier, in addition to lowering the
average markup. Since λ and P are both falling in r, we can see from equation
(7) that reducing either the fixed cost or the exit rate increases aggregate
output Y by boosting the number of rivals.


4    Trade in goods
Trade in our model not only shifts production toward lower-cost producers in
the classic Ricardian sense, but also reduces markups in countries with low
contestability, lowering the aggregate price level. The reason is simple: all else
equal, openness increases the number of firms competing to serve the domes-
tic market. In addition, trade costs increase the marginal cost for exporters
situated far from a destination market relative to their rivals, making it more
likely that their price will be bounded by a geographically closer rival. Fur-
thermore, openness has a second effect on the sensitivity of markups to changes
in economic conditions. As trade costs eat into markups due to the direct
competition of firms from closer locations, this relative gravity effect prohibits
a larger fraction of exporters from being able to adjust prices in response to
idiosyncratic or country-specific shocks and limits the degree to which those
that can actually do adjust them.
    Below, we focus principally on how trade changes the distribution of markups.
It also has an impact on entry. We do not consider entry in a dynamic setting,
as does Peters (2011), rather, we compare two worlds– one with trade and one
without– and characterize the number of firms ex ante that would want to pay
                                       19
a fixed cost to draw an efficiency parameter having been born into one versus
the other.


4.1    The distribution of costs in the open economy
We follow BEJK’s notation, adding the subscript n to the terms Ck (j), gk (ck ),
and Gk (ck ) from the autarkic case to refer to the costs and distribution of costs
for goods supplied to country n in the open economy. When the potential
supplier is from country i we add the subscript i, so that the unit cost of
the k th most efficient firm from country i when supplying any good (j) to
country n becomes Ckni (j), drawn from the underlying cumulative distribution
function Gkni (ck ), with the corresponding probability density gkni (ck ). We
assume that Eaton and Kortum’s (2002) no arbitrage condition for trade costs
holds: dni < dui dnu , so that it is always cheaper to send a good directly to its
destination market, never to re-route it through a third country.
    Let G1n (c1 ) be the probability that the low-cost supplier of a good j to the
home country n has a marginal cost less than or equal to some level c1 under
trade. The probability is equal to one minus the probability that any other
potential supplier– domestic or foreign– has a marginal cost greater than c1 .
The cumulative distribution for low-cost suppliers under trade is thus

                                                  N

4.2          Geography and markups
In three steps, we can compute the full distribution of markups under costly
trade with asymmetric countries. First, we consider the case that the best
two rivals for a destination market originate in the same country. Let ψni be
the probability that the two best rivals to supply country n both originate in
country i. Then, it must be that the two best rivals in a particular industry
in country i are more efficient (have lower marginal costs) than any other
potential suppliers of the good to country n. Let c2i be the second-best cost
draw for an industry in country i. Then the probability that it is lower than
the best draw for the same industry in any country u 6= i is

where we define ψni 0
                       = (rΦin−1)T i (wi dni )

                                               , the probability that the second best
producer in i will be the second best supplier to country n in the world mar-
ket as a whole, given that the best producer of a good in i is also the best
supplier to n worldwide.14 The distribution of markups in this case is a simple
application of our autarkic distribution, renaming r in equation (3) as ri (see
Appendix C for further detail).
     The second step is to compute the probability that the best supplier to n
is from country i and the best rival supplier to supply country n is in country
u 6= i, denoted ψniu . The unconditional probability that this occurs is the
probability that the best supplier native to country u has some marginal cost
c1u , which lies between the first- and second-best draws in country i, c1i and
c2i > c1i , while the best rivals from all third countries (v 6= u, i) have a
marginal cost that is larger than c1u . See Appendix C for the full derivation
    14
         Under symmetry, the probability ψni collapses to the very intuitive expression ψ =
1         r−1
N   ∗    N r−1 .

    Finally, we compute the distribution of markups charged in country n given
that the best rival to supply a good is in i and the second-best is in country u,
which we call hniu (m). We use the formula for the distribution of the ratio of
two independent random variables, C1ni (j) and C1nu (j), described by Mood,
Graybill and Boes (1974, pp.187-88), given that C1nu (j) is greater than C1ni (j)
but less than C2ni (j) and the best supplier to n from any third country:15

charges the unconstrained markup when its next-best rival is an exporter in a

     We show in Appendix C that because the distribution of efficiency levels in each country
is independent, terms for third countries cancel out of this conditional distribution. We can
integrate the density over the domain [1, m̄], noting the mass point at m̄ and see that it
forms a well behave cumulative distribution function that integrates to one.

                                               Ti (wi dni )−θ
             Pr[Mniu   ≥ m̄] =                                              .         (17)
                               Ti (wi dni )−θ + ru Tu (wu dnu )−θ (m̄θ − 1)

One can see immediately that the supplier to country n exporting from country
i will be more likely to charge the unconstrained markup when its next-best ri-
val (a) resides in a country far from the destination country n (high dnu ), or (b)
resides in a country with low contestability, low technology, or a high wage rel-
ative to country i. The country-i supplier’s own distance from the destination
country lowers the probability that it can charge the unconstrained markup.
If all countries are identical, the terms representing technology, wages, and
trade costs cancel out and this expression is easily shown to be lower than the
probability under autarky in equation (4) for finite r ≥ 2. We formalize this
result in Proposition 3.

Proposition 3 If a producer from country i exports to country n with the
next-best rival to supply the same good to country n from a different country
u 6= i, then the exporter’s market power on average is increasing in country
i’s technology relative to country u, TTui , but decreasing in country i’s relative
wage, wwui ; relative distance to the destination market, ddnuni
                                                                 ; and the level of
contestability in the rival’s home country, ru .

Proof. From equation (17), for any markup m0 , 1 ≤ m0 ≤ m̄, the probability
that the exporter’s markup is greater than or equal to m0 , given that its rival
resides in a different country, is

                                                 Ti (wi dni )−θ
            Pr[Mniu ≥ m0 ] =                                                  .
                                 Ti (wi dni )−θ + ru Tu (wu dnu )−θ (m0θ − 1)

All else equal, the derivative of this probability is increasing in TTui . By the
property of stochastic dominance, the average markup is also increasing in TTui .
  16
    More generally, the cumulative probability P r[M (j) ≤ m0 ] = 1 − Pr[Mniu ≥ m0 ] ranges
from 0 to 1 as m0 increases from 1 to ∞, so it is a well behaved cumulative distribution
function for markups.
                                            23
Similarly, the probability is decreasing in wwui , ddnu
                                                     ni
                                                        , and ru . Thus, the average
markup in this case is also decreasing in these three factors.
     Considering the special case where the next-best rival resides in the domes-
tic market, u = n, demonstrates that opening to trade from autarky (reducing
dni from infinitely large to a much lower level, while dnn remains fixed at 1),
we see that trade openness, on average, reduces the market power of domes-
tic producers, forcing them to charge lower markups on sales in their native
market. The only way that the average markup can increase under trade is
if the home country n opened its borders to trade with a world dominated
by one country that was both much closer than other trading partners (low
dni ) and this close neighbor was far superior to all other countries by having
much lower labor input costs (low ωi ), or very advanced technology (high Ti ).
What is more, equation (17) implies that reducing the trade cost dni for only
one particular country i increases the probability that a foreign supplier from
i will be able to charge their full autarkic markup when selling to country n.
Thus, our model nests the anti-competitive mechanism underlying results in
EMX and Arkolakis, Costinot, Donaldson, and Rodrı́guez-Clare (2012), but
also demonstrates that it can be superseded by multilateral, as opposed to
unilateral, trade liberalization.

Corollary 2 If an exporter to country n is located in a country i 6= n with
its next best rival to supply n in a third country u 6= i, n, then changing from
bilateral to multilateral trade liberalization reduces the average markup.

Proof. Lowering trade costs only between i and n (dni ) reduces i’s geographic
friction with respect to n relative to its competitor in country u, ddnu
                                                                      ni
                                                                         . It follows
from Proposition 3 that exporters from i to n can proceed to charge a higher
markup on average than before the bilateral liberalization given that the next
best rival is in country u. If afterward, country n lowers trade costs with
respect to u, changing from bilateral to multilateral liberalization, then ddnu    ni


increases and by the same Proposition 3, the probability Pr[Mniu ≥ m0 ] falls.


                                         24
   Thus, bilateral liberalization can create an anti-competitive effect, increas-
ing market power for exporters on average, while switching from bilateral to
multilateral agreements can generate a pro-competitive effect. As in any Ricar-
dian model, regardless of whether it is bilateral or multilateral, trade openness
reduces prices, as seen in the following Lemma.

Lemma 1 Trade lowers the aggregate price level.

Proof. A country will never import a good with a higher price than it pays
under autarky and the second-best competitor will never be less efficient than
the second-best competitor under autarky. To quantify the impact on the
aggregate price level, we can compute

Pn1−σ = E[Pn (j)1−σ ]
        = Pr [Mn (j) > m̄] m̄1−σ E[C1n (j)1−σ ] + Pr [Mn (j) ≤ m̄] E[C2n (j)1−σ ]

Since σ > 1, this moment is strictly greater than its counterpart under autarky.

which we know is at least as great as its counterpart under autarky because
the second-best rival producer of a good j in the entire world (including the
home country) by definition could not have a marginal cost any higher than
the second-best rival under autarky.

    Under costly trade, the markups that firms charge are different when they
sell domestically compared to when they export. The formula for the distri-
bution of markups, h̃n (m), reveals that firms internalize a portion of the trade
cost, unless they are so technologically superior or have such a huge unit input
cost advantage that they can pass the entire trade cost on to the foreign con-
sumer. We demonstrated that the probability of charging the unconstrained
markup is lower when one’s next best rival is from a different country. The
effect of incremental reductions in the trade cost on the import penetration
ratio is no longer a constant, which Arkolakis, Costinot, and Rodrı́guez-Clare
(2012b) report is the case for the BEJK model without entry. More formally,
profits are no longer a constant share of revenues, independent of the variable
trade cost.17 Instead, the share of profits in total revenues varies with the
variable trade cost d, shrinking as d falls and firms are forced to charge lower
markups due to competition from new foreign and possibly new domestic en-
trants. This violates the gravity restriction satisfied by many trade models,
even though the probability of exporting to any country n, πni , appears very
similar to the export equations in Eaton and Kortum (2002) and BEJK.
    Put more simply, the gains from trade liberalization cannot be inferred
from the value of aggregate flows alone because liberalization reduces markups,
distorting the relationship between the trade cost and observed expenditures.
Thus, trade liberalization has the potential to create welfare gains not only
through productivity-based comparative advantage, but also by reducing firms’
market power. We close the model and show output growth under free trade
versus autarky under symmetry and free trade in Appendix E, but save de-
tailed analysis of gains from costly trade with variable markups in this gener-
alized Ricardian setting for future research and in order to focus our analysis
on entry, pricing behavior, and the aggregate price level.
    One potential question is whether the fact that rivals within each industry
are latent– they do not produce and thus can not be observed for empirical
analysis– is important in interpreting our results. The answer is a resounding
  17
     The constant share in bilateral profit is also an important intermediate result in Arko-
lakis, Costinot, Donaldson, and Rodrı́guez-Clare (2012a).

“No.” De Blas and Russ (2011) generalize the type of Bertrand competition
employed here to use a search framework in the open economy, which allows
for a continuum of firms to produce the same good as long as search costs
restrict the number of prices that buyers check before making a purchase,
in the spirit of Burdett and Judd (1983) and Alessandria (2009). They use
numerics rather than the analytics here, but all of the same intuition is reflected
in the numerical results, suggesting fertile ground for future research applying
our analytical distributions.


5      Price adjustment, volatility, and pass-through
Empirical studies indicate that idiosyncratic shocks are likely to be prevalent
and economically important: Gabaix (2011) finds that a substantial portion
of observed aggregate fluctuations in U.S. output can be explained by id-
iosyncratic shocks falling across a distribution of heterogeneous firms, while
Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008) determine that idiosyncratic shocks
affecting plant-level output have a standard deviation five times as large as
that of industry-level productivity shocks. Thus, recent literature indicates
that idiosyncratic shocks are likely to be important from a macroeconomic
perspective. In this context, our setup can shed some light on the pricing
behavior of individual firms subject to idiosyncratic shocks in domestic versus
foreign markets. In Appendix F, we analyze price adjustment in the closed
economy with idiosyncratic shocks to fix show that the degree of contesta-
bility can affect firms’ ability to pass on idiosyncratic (firm-specific) shocks
into prices. We show, drawing from the insights of Kucheryavyy (2012), that
perfect substitutability is not necessary to achieve this type of price rigidity.18
  18
    Kucherayavyy (2012) proves that the market share of each rival to the lowest-cost pro-
ducer in an industry continuously falls to zero as the elasticity approaches infinity. By
implication, he contradicts the common misconception that the number of firms charging a
markup constrained by competition with rivals jumps to zero when this elasticity is finite.
In fact, it converges continuously to zero as the elasticity falls to 1. We build on his in-
sights to show numerically a continuous drop in pass-through as the elasticity approaches
1 in Appendix F. Thus, we disagree with the suggestion in Atkeson and Burstein (2008,
p.2013) that the discontinuity in the number of firms, which jumps from r > 0 to 1 when
                                            27
Here, we focus on pass-through in the open economy by applying a country-
specific shock.


5.1     Trade and prices
The expressions for markup behavior in Section 3.2 yield pricing-to-market,
incomplete pass-through, and the closely related facts that firms change prices
on exported goods less frequently and with less synchronization relative to
prices in the domestic market. Atkeson and Burstein (2007 and 2008) de-
scribe in brilliant detail the manner in which numerical simulations of BEJK
and an innovative new quantity-based competitive framework result in pricing-
to-market and incomplete pass-through, matching them with data on pricing
behavior. Here, we demonstrate similar results algebraically. First, pricing-to-
market is evident in the formula for h̃n (m) and both of its components, hi (m)
and hniu (m). Unless trade is costless, firms can charge higher markups in their
home markets than abroad because trade costs increase their domestic market
power, as discussed above. The formulas also depict how firms set markups
depending on the proximity of other export competitors in a particular desti-
nation market, if their next best rival is another exporter. Second, as under
autarky, firms will only fully pass an increase in marginal cost to buyers in
export market n if (a) they are already charging the unconstrained markup,
and (b) the price increase would not surpass the marginal cost of the next-best
rival to supply country n. Although the logic is quite general, we can show
this mathematically if we again invoke symmetry, this time with costly trade.
    Suppose again that there is a shock to marginal cost ε such that a shock
ε > 1 reduces efficiency and increases the marginal cost of an industry’s low-
cost supplier in country n. Using equation (17), the probability that pass-
the elasticity reaches infinity, causes a discontinuity in pricing behavior which would make
Bertrand competition less useful than Cournot or that assuming perfect substitutability is
not a useful approximation to examine limited price flexibility.

By Proposition 3, it follows that pass-through is increasing in the technological
advantage of the exporting country, TTui , and decreasing in ddnuni
                                                                    , wwui , and ru – the
same Ricardian factors that govern the market power of exporters.19
    Our markup formulas demonstrate results described in the numerical simu-
lations of Garetto (2012). As we noted above from equation (17), the probabil-
ity that a firm charges the unconstrained markup (and as a result, the degree
of passthrough) in an export market is greater when the exporting country
has a higher level of technology T or a lower wage ω than its competitor’s
source country. Thus, we show the point Garetto (2012) argues– that firms
exhibit less market power in setting markups “when exporting to relatively
more productive (richer) countries.”


5.2     Export price rigidity and macroeconomic volatility
The macro-level manifestation of restricted price adjustment in export markets
is reduced volatility in the terms of trade relative to the real exchange rate for
high levels of contestability (r) in the host market or in the presence of trade
costs. To illustrate the relationship between the micro and macro effects of
relative cost shocks across countries, such as a small movement in the nominal
exchange rate (see Burstein, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2005) for a discussion
contrasting the impact of large versus small shocks on the real exchange rate),
Table 1 lists the volatility of the terms of trade relative to the real exchange
rate in U.S. data alongside results from simulated data for small cost shocks
  19
    Although several studies have shown that pass-through depends on the choice of cur-
rency invoicing, Goldberg and Tille (2009) demonstrate that this currency invoicing choice
also depends on the degree of competition in the destination market, so we view our market
structure approach as quite relevant.



                                           29
in our model.20 We see in the table that the model delivers a variance in
the terms of trade that is approximately one-half the variance of the real
exchange rate when d = 1.5, between our lower-bound for trade costs of 1.25
from the survey by Russ and Valderrama (2010) and the higher value for
trade costs (1.74) estimated by Anderson and van Wincoop (2004). This ratio
of volatilities corresponds with the figure reported for the U.S. in Corsetti,
Dedola, and Leduc (2008). The variance of the terms of trade relative to the
real exchange rate increases monotonically as trade costs fall in the symmetric,
two-country case. This relative variance is higher when the level of domestic
rivalry is higher. High trade costs suppress exporters’ ability to adjust prices
more strongly than the level of domestic entry, which is quite similar to the
results from the variable elasticity of substitution framework developed by
Gust, Leduc, and Vigfusson (2010).
    Thus, we interpret our framework as a complement to but not a replace-
ment for nominal price stickiness analyzed in existing studies.21 However, if we
  20
      That is, to focus on the main mechanism of the Bertrand pricing behavior, these are
small departures from a symmetric steady state without second-order effects on wages or
entry. We use the same calibration as in Figure 1, with lognormal shocks that enter like
ε above, but applied to all firms within a country. The shock is lognormally distributed
with log of these shock distributed as normal with mean zero and variance 0.015, so that
the standard deviation is equal to the standard deviation of aggregate technology shocks in
the U.S. estimated by Basu, Fernald, and Kimball (2006), applied to each of two symmetric
countries. Again, these are small deviations from steady state to focus on the workings of
the pricing mechanism, apart from general equilibrium effects. We hold r constant in each
case.
   21
      Qualitative results for pass-through and relative macroeconomic volatilities do not de-
pend on perfect substitutability between goods within a market niche. However, with this
special limiting case of perfect substitutability, distributions in Section 3 imply that the
frequency of price changes will be smaller in export markets than in domestic markets.
Unless an exporting country has a huge advantage in the form of high T , high r, or low
labor costs, it is harder for firms to charge the unconstrained markup in an export market
compared to their native market. This is due to the trade cost, which effectively increases
exporters’ marginal cost relative to domestic firms in the destination country. Since firms
must be charging the unconstrained markup in order to pass on idiosyncratic or country-
specific shocks in the form of higher export prices, fewer firms will change prices in export
markets (as compared to their native market) when marginal costs increase. As a conse-
quence, the median and average frequency of price changes must be lower for exports, as
shown by Schoenle (2010) and Fitzgerald and Haller (2010). Interestingly, it also replicates
the frequency of export price changes relative to the frequency of domestic price changes
documented by Schoenle (2010), but only for very low trade costs.
                                             30
interpret country-specific shocks as exchange rate shocks, then our results co-
incide with the departure from Harrod-Balassa-Samuelson effects observed in
Japan following the Plaza Accord by Obstfeld (2009). He documents that real
exchange rate appreciation coincided with a drop in measured productivity in
the traded goods sector during this period. If the appreciation of a country’s
nominal exchange rate results in its exporters charging lower markups, this can
reduce measured TFP, either because reduced markups may cause exporters
to operate under capacity, as Obstfeld (2009) suggests, or due to empirical
methodologies that confound changes in TFP with changes in markups. Us-
ing a numerical framework very similar to the one we present here, Garetto
(2012) similarly finds that an appreciation of an exporter’s home currency rel-
ative to that of the destination country squeezes the exporter’s markups. In
line with the Ricardian effects in our markup distributions discussed above,
she also finds empirical evidence that pass-through of these shocks is more lim-
ited for exporters selling in countries that are relatively more technologically
advanced– exactly where we predict their markups would be lower and their
likelihood of pass-through less. Feenstra and Weinstein’s (2010) finding that
exporters in low-wage countries, which have lower labor productivity, charge
lower markups also supports this prediction. This is where our approach has
a nontrivial nuance that is hard to reproduce with an assumption of nominal
stickiness, unless we assume that degree of nominal stickiness is increasing in
the technological development of the destination market relative to the source
country.
    Table 2 demonstrates that the volatility of the terms of trade in a 2-country
model is higher for any level of trade costs when the home country has a
lower level of available technology, which we interpret as a developing econ-
omy. Similarly, the volatility of both import and export prices is higher in the
developing-country case. We calibrate the exercise from parameter estimates
by Eaton and Kortum (2002), with Tn = 0.5 < Ti = 1. A decrease in trade
costs in the 2-country case dramatically increases the volatility of import prices
and, in more competitive environments (r = 20), it increases the volatility of
import prices faster than export prices. This is compatible with empirical evi-
                                        31
dence by Frankel, Parsley, and Wei (2012) demonstrating the higher volatility
of import prices in developing countries and is the flip side of an analysis by
Bergin and Feenstra (2009) that reproduces a drop in the volatility of import
prices for the U.S. when trade increases with developing countries.
    Moving one step beyond this Ricardian effect, one can see that reductions
in trade barriers that replace bilateral treaties with multilateral treaties can
actually reduce volatility in traded goods prices for developing countries. Our
multi-country distribution in equation (16) shows the importance of asymme-
try in a multi-country world, demonstrated in the last four columns of Table 2.
In the 3-country world simulated in this table, lowering trade costs across all
trading partners reduces the relative volatility of the terms of trade, as well as
the volatility of import and export prices. The crucial difference here is that
a bilateral trade liberalization– maintaining a low level of trade barriers with
only one advanced country– can result in higher price volatility for a country
with inferior technologies, as high-tech exporters from the advanced trading
partner with favored treatment can take advantage of the relatively protected
environment and inefficient domestic competitors by charging higher markups.
Thus, they can pass along more of their own production cost shocks. How-
ever, multilateral liberalization– lowering trade barriers toward two or more
advanced countries– can inhibit this markup effect (reduce the market power
of foreign exporters) by forcing competition within the developing country
between high-tech foreign suppliers from different advanced countries. This
reduction in volatility for developing countries has some support in new find-
ings by Flach and Cao (2011) that entry into multilateral trade agreements
like the GATT/WTO or FTAs reduces import and export price volatility in
developing countries.

ior for heterogeneous firms in the open economy under Bertrand competition.

ture, demonstrating how market structure has important implications for gains
from trade and both the level and volatility of prices. The distributions allow
us to characterize in an analytically clean way firm markup behavior under
trade, as well as the percentage of firms who can change their price in response
to an idiosyncratic shock in any market, or in response to a source-country-
specific shock in an export market. As in previous numerical studies using sim-
ilar frameworks, key results include imperfect pass-through, pricing-to-market,
and a lower volatility of the terms of trade relative to the real exchange rate.
Our breakthrough is that we explicitly characterize in tractable formulas an
endogenous degree of export price rigidity that depends on a multi-country
market structure and varies across destination markets due to the degree of
domestic entry and the level of trade costs.

A      Deriving the distribution of markups
Malik and Trudel (1982, equation (5.17)) use Mellin transforms to derive the
following distribution for the ratio z = cc12 , the ratio of the first order statistic
to the second, given that the sample is from the Weibull distribution G(c)
in the main text. This distribution is also reported in Rinne (2009, p.244,
equation (5.42c)):
                                      r(r − 1)θz θ−1
                             ĥ(z) =                   ,
                                     [(r − 1) + z θ ]2
Since we specify the (unrestricted) markup as m = cc21 , we note that m is a
function of z, m = z1 , and apply a straightforward Jacobian transformation:

                                                 1 θ−1
                                                        !
                                   r(r − 1)θ
                                                                     
                                                 m            1
                     h(m) =                         θ
                                   [(r − 1)   + m1 ]2         m2
                                               −(θ+1)
                                 r(r − 1)θm
                            =                      .
                                 [(r − 1) + m−θ ]2

    Similarly, Malik and Trudel (1982) use a Mellin transform to derive the
following distribution for z = cc12 given a Pareto distribution of efficiency draws
(a power law distribution of cost draws)

                                   ĥ(z) = θz θ−1 .

                                                              c2
Again, we specify the (unrestricted) markup as m =            c1
                                                                 ,   implying that m = z1 ,
and apply the Jacobian transformation:

                                          θm1−θ
                                h(m) =
                                            m2
                                        = θz −(θ+1)


B      Free entry under autarky
Since the distribution of markups is the same for all goods j, we drop the goods
index below for simplicity. Taking (natural) logs, the expression decomposes

                            L
Since the natural log is a concave function, Jensen’s inequality implies E [ln M 1−σ ] ≤
ln E [M 1−σ ] and E [ln M −σ ] ≤ ln E [M −σ ]. The function M −σ has a greater
degree of convexity than M 1−σ , so ln E [M −σ ] − E [ln M −σ ] ≥ ln E [M 1−σ ] −
E [ln M 1−σ ].22 This last inequality implies that

B.1      Uniqueness
Standard properties of expectations tell us that E [M (j)1−σ ] > E [M (j)−σ ] for
∞ > σ > 1 and M (j) ≥ 1. In Proposition 1, we showed that E [M (j)] is
decreasing in the number of rivals. Thus, E [M (j)1−σ ] is increasing in r and
E [M (j)−σ ] is increasing even faster. Thus, E[M (j)1−σ ]/E[M (j)−σ ] is greater
than 1 and decreasing in r toward 1, meaning that there can only be one r for
which the ratio equals the constant 1 + βδf
                                              
                                            L



B.2      Upper- and lower- bounds for the number of rivals.
The distribution of the markup does not yield a closed-form solution for the
expected markup E[M ] or for the expected log markup, E[lnM ]. However,
we know from Proposition 1 that the mean markup E[M ] is decreasing in r.
                                                             , ln E M 1−σ , E [ln M −σ ], and

     Another way to see this is to note that E ln M 1−σ
        −σ
                                      with ln E M 1−σ < |ln E [M −σ ]| < |E [ln M −σ ]| and
                                                        
ln E [M    ] are
               all negative numbers,
                 < E ln M 1−σ < |E [ln M −σ ]|. Thus, switching the logs from outside to
       1−σ                   
 ln E M
inside the expectation in equation (B.1) reduces the left hand side more than the right hand
side.
                                             40
Therefore, we determine an upper- and lower- bound for r. Specifically, we can
express the minimum number of rivals as a function of the expected log markup
and derive a clean closed-form solution for the maximum number of rivals. Let
V = ln M . Then the probability density for V is a simple transformation of
h(m),

                           hV (v) = ev h(ev )IR+ (v)
                                        r(r − 1)θ (ev )−(θ+1)
                                   = ev h                   i2 .
                                                      v  −θ
                                          (r − 1) + (e )

The probability that V ≥ m̄ (or any other positive constant) is then

                  Z∞
                          v r(r− 1)θ (ev )−(θ+1)             r
                         e h                  i2 dv =                 .
                                                      1 + (r − 1)eθm̄
                ln(m̄)      (r − 1) + (ev )−θ

Using a generalized version of Chebyshev’s inequality23 , we can characterize a
lower-bound for the number of rivals:

                             m̄ Pr[ln M ≥ m̄] ≤ E[ln M ]
                               rm̄
                                         ≤ E[ln M ]
                         1 + (r − 1)eθm̄
                                           E[ln M ](eθm̄ − 1)
                                       r ≥                    .
                                           E[ln M ]eθm̄ − m̄

As noted previously, the expected markup and the number of rivals is inversely
related, a relationship seen here in the lowerbound for r. When E[M ] falls,
the lowerbound increases, reflecting the fact that more rivals will enter when
the expected markup is high (and vice versa). We know from equation (11)
that the expected log gross markup E[ln M ] must be at least as large as the
gross log per-period cost of production, ln(1 + βδf
                                                 L
                                                    ), producing an upperbound

   See Theorem 5 in Mood, Graybill, and Boes (1974, p.71): For a random variable X, a
nonnegative function g(·), and a scalar k > 0, then kP [g(X) ≥ k] ≤ E[g(X)].

for r. Thus, we know that r lies within the following bounds:

C      The distribution of markups under trade
We calculate the distribution of markups using conditional densities and con-
ditional probabilities. That is, one can compute the probability of an outcome
m under costly trade and asymmetry as

  h̃(m) = P r[m|A1] ∗ P r[A1] + P r[m|A2] ∗ P r[A2] + ...P r[m|Ax] ∗ P r[Ax],

where A1...Ax are all the possible geographic locations of the first- and second-
best supplier (both in country 1, one in country one and one in country 2, etc.).
The weights in our expression for the compound distribution in the main text
are the probability of any particular geographic pairing (P r[A1], ..., P r[Ax]).
Below, we show how to calculate the weights, then how we calculate the con-
ditional densities for m.
    To calculate the unconditional probability that both the first and second
best suppliers of a good to country n are from country i, we start from the
main text:

    The first step is to derive the marginal distribution g2ni (c2i ) from the joint
distribution, which is analogous to the joint distribution under autarky but

C1nu < c2ni and C1nu < c1nv for all v. Note that all of the third-country terms
cancel out, since each country’s firms draw efficiency levels simultaneously

    The same process results in the distribution of the markups when both of
the two best rival suppliers to n are from the same country i reveals that the
distribution is the same as in autarky, with third-country terms cancelling out
due to the independence of each country’s distribution:

                                                       ri (ri − 1)θm−(θ+1)

    The difference between hniu (m) and hni (m) arises due to the fact that
outcomes c1nu and c1ni come from the best of ru draws from country u’s dis-
tribution, which is independent of the realizations of the ri draws in country i
from which the best firm in country i emerges. In contrast, the distribution of
two ordered draws in country i is not independent and thus the difference be-
tween them can not be constructed from two independent distributions, rather
from one joint distribution.

D      Gains from trade
To close the model under autarky or trade, we use a market clearing condition.
Let λD be the share of variable costs in expenditures for each country, given
the vector of trade costs D that it faces when exporting. We can use the free
entry condition to show that under autarky, λD equals 1+1δβf . Similarly, under
                                                                    L

free trade with symmetric countries, λ equals       1+    δβf      . Given our unit cost
                                                   (   L 1+ N −1

specification, the share of labor in these variable costs is β. Then, the labor
market clearing condition stipulates that payments to labor equal labor’s share
in production costs:
                                ωn Ln = βλPn Yn .

We use the wage as our numeraire, ω ≡ 1. Then, we can compare output under
autarky with output under free trade in a world with N symmetric countries:
                                                  

The first term on the right-hand side is greater than one and reflects the fact
that aggregate revenues and average firm profits fall under trade versus autarky
because opening to foreign competition squeezes markups. We already know
from Propositions 2 and 3a that the autarkic price level is greater than the
price level under free trade. To find out how much greater, we must substitute
in our formulas for the aggregate price level under autarky and free trade,24

Even under symmetry, the level of gains from trade clearly depends upon the
number of domestic rivals before liberalization. In Figure 3, we show that
they are lower for countries with a high level of contestability (ra ) to begin
  24
   If we do not normalize the wage ω to equal 1, this expression is the ratio of the real
wage under trade, relative to the real wage under autarky.
                                           47
with, as these countries already have lower average markups than their trading
partners.
    Trade increases contestability for any given market, which reduces markups,
generating a gain from trade that is new to the BEJK framework, though not
to models with alternative environments with imperfect competition, such as
Bergin and Feenstra (2009), Devereux and Lee (2001), Melitz and Ottaviano
(2008), and Rodriguez (2011). However, in our model, an increase in entry due
to market scale effects can shift the distribution of efficiency levels among ac-
tive firms to the right at the same time it changes the shape of the distribution
of markups, a combination not captured by any of these papers. Thus, the
increase in entry acts both as a technological advance and an increase in the
intensity of competition. Geography, in the form of trade frictions, interferes
with welfare gains from both Ricardian efficiency effects and contestability.


E      Gains from free trade vs. autarky
To the degree that free trade results in an increased number of rivals for any
particular market, it shifts the entire distribution of marginal costs to the left,
similar to an innovation in available technology T . A particularly clean case
occurs when countries are identical and that trade is costless, so that Ti = T ,
ωi = ω ≡ 1, and dni = 1 for all i. Then we see that the distribution for the
lowest unit cost among all potential suppliers to any country n in equation
(12) reduces to the Weibull distribution

                                                          θ
                                G1n (c1 ) = 1 − e−rN T c1 ,

which is observationally equivalent to a world with R = rN rivals who all
draw from an underlying distribution that takes the same form as the distri-
                                                                      θ

     The distribution of first order statistics for samples drawn from a Weibull distrubution
is also Weibull.


                                             48
distribution of markups in this special case takes the form

                                    R(R − 1)θm−(θ+1)
                          h̃(m) =                     .
                                    [(R − 1) + m−θ ]2

 The implication is clear: trade has the same effect on the distribution of
markups as increasing contestability and therefore reduces the number of firms
charging the unconstrained markup and, all else equal, the aggregate price
level, which takes the same form as under autarky, but with the total number
of rivals for each market, R. Defining ra as the number of rivals under autarky,
we will show below that R > ra . Proposition 3 follows directly from this
increase in contestability under trade.

Proposition 4 In a world with symmetric countries, free trade (a) increases
the total number of rivals competing to supply a destination market, (b) reduces
the aggregate price level, and (c) reduces the expected markup, as well as the
probability that firms will charge the unconstrained markup.

Proof.
    Part a) To show that the total number of rivals under trade equals a number
R > ra , we use the open economy version of the free entry condition and a
labor market clearing condition that takes the same form as the closed economy
version in equation (7) for each country. If all countries are identical and trade
is costless, we have

that the possibility of exporting strictly increases entry. Thus, leaping from
autarky to free trade increases the number of rivals competing to produce any
good (R = N r > ra ), in addition to reducing prices by reallocating production
to more efficient producers.26
    Part b) E[C2 (j)1−σ ] under free trade and symmetry takes the exact form
of its counterpart under autarky, only substituting R > ra for the number of
rivals, making E[C2 (j)1−σ ] greater than its counterpart under autarky. From
the discussion in Lemma 1, we know that E[C1n (j)1−σ ] must also be greater
than its counterpart under autarky. Therefore, (P )1−σ must be greater than
its counterpart under autarky (P a )1−σ , revealing that the aggregate price level
falls under trade: P < P a .
    Part c) It follows directly from the derivative in Proposition 1 and the
fact that R > ra that the average markup falls under trade. Similarly, the
likelihood of charging the unconstrained markup falls when opening to trade.

    The results from Proposition 3 echo those of Bergin and Feenstra (2009)
and Melitz and Ottaviano (2008), but now within the homothetic prefer-
ence structure of Bernard, Eaton, Jensen, and Kortum (2003). Atkeson and
Burstein (2007 and 2008) show the results in Parts (b) and (c) numerically,
while de Blas and Russ (2011) demonstrate that having a large number of
rivals under autarky reduces the impact of trade liberalization on markups.
Note also that increasing the number of trading partners has a similar effect
to increasing the number of rivals in any trading partner, seen in numerical so-
  26
    We assume the fixed cost of exporting is zero for simplicity, but one can also derive a
reasonable restriction on the size of a fixed cost of exporting that preserves this result.

lutions calculated by Garetto (2012). Under costless trade, it does not matter
how the rivals are distributed across countries. Markups respond as though all
entrants worldwide compete on equal footing to be the low-cost supplier. As
in classic studies of trade and endogenous market structure, geographic fric-
tions here increase market power, dampening the effect of foreign industrial
structure on domestic markups and prices.
    In Figure 3, we show an estimate of the gains for a country opening to
free trade with an arbitrary number of partners identical to itself. In this
stylized case, the number of rivals competing to supply the domestic market
under trade relative to autarky determines the increase in aggregate output.
Each line in the graph represents an increase in the number of rival suppliers
                                                      t
compared to autarky by 1, 5, or 10. The ratio YY a on the vertical axis is
computed as in Appendix E. The number of total competitors for a market
under trade, R, lies on the horizontal axis. Where R equals 20 under trade,
for instance, we see the gains from trade if there were 10, 15, or 19 domestic
rivals under autarky. For example, a country which under free trade has 20
potential suppliers of a product experiences an increase in aggregate output of
less than 3 percent if it already had 19 competitors under autarky, but greater
than 40 percent, if it had only 10 competitors under autarky. Equation (9)
implies that small countries, ones with smaller market size L, will have fewer
rivals in each industry under autarky. Thus, gains from trade are greatest for
small countries opening to trade, even if a pair of small countries establishes
a free trade agreement, echoing a result in representative firm models such
as Devereux and Lee (2001) under Cournot competition or Novy (2010) with
translog preferences.


F     Price adjustment in the closed economy
In the simple, closed-economy framework, a lower number of rivals leads to
more frequent price changes in response to idiosyncratic shocks to marginal
costs. The reason is clear from Figure 1. When r is low, more firms charge
the unconstrained CES markup– their prices are not tightly bounded by the
                                     51
   Figure 3: Gains from trade depend on the number of additional rivals


marginal costs of their next-best rival, so they are better able to pass on id-
iosyncratic increases in marginal cost to their customers. The fraction of firms
that set their price equal to the marginal cost of the next-best rival are unable
to do this. Since firms will not change prices in response to an idiosyncratic
shock unless they charge the unconstrained markup, Figure 1 suggests that
at least half of firms will never be able to adjust their prices upward ever,
unless they experience a shock common to all rivals and which affects all rivals
at exactly the same time. We apply a lognormally distributed idiosyncratic
shock with the log of the shock being distributed N(0,10), so that the standard
                                       52
deviation of the shock is 10%.27 After 1000 simulations, using the same pa-
rameters as in Figure 1, we compute that, all else equal, 73.3% of firms adjust
their price in response to a shock when r = 2, while the figure falls to 64.8%
when r = 20. This is consistent with results from Nakamura and Steinsson
(2010), who find that no price changes are observed for 40% of products over
the period 1982-2007, as well as Gopinath and Rigobon (2008) and Gopinath,
Itskhoki, and Rigobon (2010), who report static prices for approximately 30%
of their sample. The following corollary to Proposition 1 formalizes this result.



Corollary 3 The probability that shocks to marginal cost are reflected in a
firm’s price is falling in the number of rivals r, as is price volatility.

Proof. For some random i.i.d. shock ε to firm-specific marginal cost with
probability density η(ε) over the domain (0,ε̄), we can compute the fraction of
firms that will raise prices in response to an idiosyncratic increase in marginal
costs. Suppose a shock occurs such that ε > 1, increasing the marginal cost
for a particular active firm but not its rivals in the industry.
    First, we note that only firms charging the unconstrained CES markup
would be able to increase their prices, since firms setting prices bounded by
the marginal cost of their next-best rival can not. Then, the probability that
a firm will pass an idiosyncratic increase in marginal cost fully to buyers by
raising its price is equal to the probability that the current price (m̄ times

shocks, drawing on empirical estimates by Basu, Fernald, and Kimball (2006) and Foster,
Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008).

probability as

It follows from Corollary 1 that regardless of the probability distribution for ε,
as long as the marginal cost shock is independent of the markup, the probabil-
ity of full pass-through under autarky is decreasing in the number of rivals.28
Multiplying ε above by some positive constant less than one, we see that the
result is general to any degree of pass-through, not just full pass-through.29
The intuition also applies for a downward cost shock, which is omitted here for
the sake of brevity. In this case, all firms charging the unconstrained markup
would have to lower their prices, otherwise their markup would rise above m̄,
implying marginal revenues less than marginal costs. Further, some portion
of firms charging a price equal to C2 (j) would also lower prices, namely those
for whom leaving the price at C2 (j) resulted in a markup greater than m̄.
Thus, downward adjustment is most likely when firms are more likely to have
relatively inefficient rivals, which is the case when r is low. Note that having
less complete and less frequent price adjustment in response to idiosyncratic
shocks implies lower price volatility.
    Limited pass-through of the marginal cost shock does not depend on the
elasticity of substitution being infinite. In Figure F, we vary the elasticity of
  28
      That is, given the calculus used to prove Proposition 1, equation (D.6) implies that the
probability of the markup being high enough to permit adjustment to positive price shocks
is decreasing in the number of rivals r.
   29
      Our assumption that firms pay a fixed cost when they become active prevents the
lowest-cost producer from having to adjust prices in response to temporary idiosyncratic
shocks hitting its next-best rivals. The rivals will not find it profitable to try to undercut an
existing producer unless they experience a transitory shock large enough to cover the entire
fixed cost. We assume that the variance of costs is small enough that the likelihood of such
a large shock is negligible.

our calibrated value for σ) to 10,000 and show that pass-through by the low-
cost producer is limited even at this low elasticity and decreases continuously
as the elasticity of substitution increases, in response to a large shock (ε = 1)
to marginal cost, given two rivals in each industry. The degree of pass-through
varies the size of the shock and the number of rivals, but always displays this
continuous decreasing behavior. 30

    We are very grateful to Ariel Burstein for alerting us to the fact that this continuity
can be shown numerically and Konstantin Kucheryavyy for sharing insights and code for a
numerical illustration of markup behavior within his proof in Kucheryavyy (2012).
