The Trade Performance of Asian Economies During and Following the 2008 Financial Crisis
Jing Wang and John Whalley
NBER Working Paper No. 16142
June 2010
JEL No. F14

                                             ABSTRACT

This paper documents and compares the trade performance of the major Asian economies both during
and following the 2008 financial crisis. We consider China, India, Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea,
Japan, Singapore and Chinese Taiwan. We access separate country data files giving monthly trade
performance for both the import and export sides throughout the crisis. We use these to compare the
size, speed and acceleration of trade compression with the onset of the crisis, and the reverse effects
on recovery. We do this in aggregate and by product and bilateral trading partner. The data reported
show considerable diversity of country experience. Among manufacture exporters China has seen
a major decline in trade with a slow recovery, whereas Korea experienced smaller initial impact but
a quick rebound. Import impacts are mildest for India and commodity exporters including Malaysia.
On the import side, the falls in world oil prices impact sharply on import values. We also compare
trade impacts in the 2008 financial crisis with those in the 1930s and the Asian financial crisis. In the
1930s percentage impacts on trade in the first year were similar, but of much longer duration, reducing
trade volumes in the US by nearly 80% by 1933, and placing Germany close to autarchy. In the 1998
Asian crisis trade impacts were much smaller since export markets in the OECD were not affected,
but negative growth impacts on affected countries were greater.

1. Background and Issues
       In September and October 2008, the world experienced the onset of a major
Financial Crisis, triggered in part by a loss of confidence by investors in the value of
securitized mortgages in the US during 2007. It also coincided with the reversal of
price bubbles in housing, oil, and resource commodities, and resulted in significant
stock price declines and exchange rate volatility. These events were followed by a
worldwide recession in 2009 with a sharp reduction in world trade and rising
unemployment. Although the worldwide crisis seemingly originated in the United
States, its effects were felt by all economies around the world. To date there has been
no research which compares the speed, severity, and acceleration of both decline in
trade and the rebound of Asian economies. This is what we attempt to do here.
       We document the trade performance of the Asian economies throughout the
crisis. In the preceding two decades many of these had become major manufacturing
exporters. The impacts on auto exports for Japan, consumer electronics exports from
China, and manufactured exports from Korea were all major. We use official data for
key Asian economies, including China, India, Japan, South Korea (referred to as Korea
hereinafter), Malaysia, Chinese Taiwan (referred to as Taiwan hereinafter), Thailand
and Singapore, and compare and analyse their trade performance during and beyond
the crisis.
       Comparison of May 2008 and May 2009 shows that monthly exports of China,
India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand fell by 26.3%, 37.1%, 49.4%,
15.4%, 29.8%, 26.6% and 44.4% respectively. Monthly imports fell by more by 43.1%,
37.3%, 42.7%, 24.3%, 30.3%, 40.3% and 56.6% respectively, reflecting in part the oil
price decline. Among these countries, Korean trade performed the best, with a smaller
drop after the initial onset of the crisis and a quick rebound. Japan's trade was affected
most, with a severe and prolonged decline on both the export and import side.
       We compare this trade performance both with that of the North American and
European economies in the 1930s and with that of the severely impacted Asian
economies in the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis. In the 1930s initial year trade impacts
were similar in percentage terms, but persisted in the North American and European

                                           -2-
economies for four years or more. Japan in the 1930s, however, had several years of
strong export growth, and China also performed much better than North America and
Europe. Trade impacts in Asian were more severe than in either Europe or North
America, and are more severe in the recent crisis than in the 1997-98 Asian financial
crisis, but growth impacts on affected countries were more severe in 1997-98.

  2. The Overall Trade Performance of the Asian Economies during the Financial
  Crisis
           We first discuss the overall trade performance of the Asian countries (region)
  during the financial crisis. We consider China, India, South Korea (Korea for short),
  Japan, Malaysia, Chinese Taiwan, and Thailand for whom monthly data are available
  for 2008 and 2009, and initial months of 2010. We also consider Singapore, for which
  there are quarterly data.

           Monthly growth rates for exports (compared with the same month in the
  previous year) are reported for these countries in Table 1. Indian exports grew the
  fastest and Korean exports grew the second fastest in 2008 pre-crisis. Others showed
  almost the same performance; Japan was the only country which had export growth
  rates in single figures in 2008.

       For 2009, the picture is different. Korea was still the best performer among these
countries (regions), with negative growth in only four months and a smaller decline
than other countries. The worst performer was Japan. With sluggish growth pre-crisis,
Japan's exports shrank by over 30% for ten months, and they were almost half of the
previous year in the first quarter of 2009. Taiwan also showed a significant decline
from November 2008 and had a decline of over 40% in two months. Exports from
Malaysia showed the same trend as those of Taiwan but with a milder decline both on
onset and rebound. China's 2009 performance was slightly better than that of India,
Malaysia and Taiwan.

       The growth rates of imports by the same Asian economies are reported in Table 2.
Korean imports fell least among those economies (as for exports). Pre-crisis, the


                                                      -5-
fastest growth of imports occurred in India and Korea, whereas the lowest growth rates
in 2008 were for Malaysia and Japan. Imports by Malaysia and Taiwan started to fall
in October 2008, followed by China and Japan one month later, but Korea maintained
strong positive export growth for the whole of 2008. Imports of all these economies
declined in the first ten months of 2009, and Korean imports declined the least among
these economies. Taiwan's imports dropped the most at the beginning of 2009 and
those of Japan fell the most in proportional terms in 2009. Except for Korea, country
imports seem to follow a pattern whereby the faster the growth pre-crisis, the greater
the decline during the crisis. One reason for the decline in imports was falling oil
prices in 2009, along with the recession in the real economies. Trade for all economies
started to rebound at the end of 2009 and they experienced accelerated recovery. There
is a solid rebound shown for 2010 in available data, with Taiwan's imports doubling in
January 2010 and China's increasing by over 60% in the first quarter of 2010.
      Interestingly, the Korean economy more broadly and Korean financial markets
experienced less impact in the current financial crisis than in that of 1997-98. As Huh
and Nam (2010) note, several factors have contributed to this outcome. One was that
Korea in 2008 did not have the problem of non-performing assets that needed to deal
with through restructuring processes as in the 1997-98 crisis. Also, policy reactions
were more prompt and provided significant resources which stopped the economy's
downward spiral during 2008 financial crisis. Also, policy coordination among leading
OECD with Asian economies to counter the down turn benefited Korea.
      Quarterly growth rates of foreign trade and GDP for Singapore are reported in
Table 3. Singapore's trade performance is close to the mean compared with other Asian
economies, in both the decline and recovery of growth. Compared with the same
period in the previous year pre-crisis, Singapore's real GDP grew by 7.3% (nominal
growth rate was 10.6%) in the first quarter of 2008, whereas foreign trade grew by
16.1% (with exports at11.5% and imports at 21.5%) at the same time. Total trade
started to decline in the last quarter of 2008, GDP began to see negative growth and the
overall price level shifted to deflation. Overall trade declined by 28% in the first
quarter of 2009 and Singapore's real GDP fell by 9.4%. This linkage highlights the

                                          -6-
         pronounced impact of the financial crisis on Singapore as an economy highly
         dependent on foreign trade.

                 From the data above, we can also see the collapse of 2009 world trade as
         reflecting a sharp decline in Asian countries' foreign trade in general. For instance,
         China's foreign trade halted a trend of export expansion in place since 1999. As a result,
         China's exports dropped by 26% in May 2009 and imports dropped by 43% in January
         2009, compared with the same months in 2008. Also, China's share of net global export
         growth in GDP growth dropped from over 10% between 2000 and 2007 to 0.8% in
         2008. In the rebound, in March 2010, China's foreign trade was in deficit by US$7.2
         billion, the first since 2004. China's trade balance returned to surplus in April 2010 but
         with only a US$1.7 billion surplus, which is less than 10% of the earlier sum.


                 This overall Asian performance can also be seen relative to the wider global
         picture of sharp trade compression in the crisis. The volume of world exports and
         imports fell by 23% and 24% (in current US$) respectively in 2009 according to the
         WTO (2010)1 and along with this went substantial variation in trade performance by
         region and country. On the export side in 2009, oil exporters in Africa saw an export
         volume fall of 40% and Russian exports dropped by 36% owing in large part to falling
         prices of oil and other primary commodities. Exports by Asian and North American
         economies fell less than the global average level with drops of 18% and 21%
         respectively.

         Dismal 2009", 26 March 2010.

      Asian export performance shows China and ASEAN dropped by only 16% and
18% respectively, which accounts for 56.5% of total Asian exports. Exports from
Korea even increased by 1% in 2009, whereas those of Japan fell by 28%. These fell
more than the world average. On the import side, imports of Africa, Middle East, and
Asia fell by less than the world average by 16%, 18% and 21% respectively. Imports
by Korea and Malaysia dropped by 12% and 17%, which were smaller than world
import drops in percentage terms. Imports by Japan and Taiwan fell by 28%, and those
of ASEAN and India fell by 23% and 21% in 2009, which contributed significantly to
the decline of Asian imports.


      The slightly smaller drop of Asian imports than world imports mainly reflects
China's imports (which account for about a third of Asian imports) which only fell by
11%. Also, China's Southern trade has grown significantly faster than its Northern
trade in the past decade (Wang & Whalley, 2010), and so the smaller compression in
trade by Africa, Asia (except Japan) and Latin America partly explains the trade
performance of China.


      Though Asian trade performance was relatively good for the year 2009, it was
affected more severely during the initial impact of the current crisis. Global trade
volumes fell by 17.5% between September 2008 and January 2009 in an episode now
termed the “Great Trade Collapse” (Gregory et al., 2010, page 4), and trade volumes of
Taiwan and Japan fell by 50% and 46% respectively. Even the trade of Korea and
China, good trade performers during the crisis, fell by 29% and 42% respectively
during the same period. Trade in India and Malaysia also fell by over 33% during the
same period.


      The constant US$ world trade volume reduction of 12% in 2009 is larger than
those on the three other occasions this has happened since 1965 (-0.2% in 2001, -2% in
1982, and -7% in 1975). Japan's export fell the most by 24.9% and was over twice the
world average level. World GDP declined by 2.3% in 2009. GDP of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Japan and the EU(27) fell by 7.1%, 5%,

                                         -8-
and 4.2% respectively, whereas GDP growth in Africa, the Middle East and Asia
remained positive at 1.6%, 1.0% and 0.1% respectively, and China grew by 8.5% in
2009.


          According to the WTO (2010)1 the value of world merchandise trade increased
by around 25% in the first quarter of 2010 over the same period in 2009, with global
exports rising by 27% and imports rising by 24%.


          Why trade compression occurred at such a greater rate than GDP growth during
the crises, especially in the early stages, and why the rebound also occurred at an
equally high rate, is a puzzle that has been noted by others (Baldwin, 2009), but
remains largely unexplained. As we note later, in the 1930s, rates of trade compression
also exceeded compression rates for GDP, but persisted for much longer.

                  Next we assess the bilateral trade performance of individual Asian countries
           with four major trading partners, the US, China, the EU, and ASEAN. Growth rates of
           trade between the US and Asian countries are reported in Table 4.

                  These data indicate that Japan's exports to the US started declining as early as
                                                          - 10 -
February 2008, and declined the most in the first quarter of 2009, producing less than
half the reported exports for the same period in 2008. Asian countries' exports to the
US all fell sharply from January 2009 to August 2009, with monthly declines of 23.9%
for China, 58.4% for Japan, 28.2% for Korea, and over 30% for other countries.
Thailand and China's exports to the US rebounded at the end of 2009, and followed
other countries with a significant rebound in 2010. On the import side, the imports by
India, Korea, Thailand and Taiwan of US products declined more than their exports to
the US, with monthly declines of 46.3%, 44.4%, 41.7% and 65.2% respectively.
China's exports to and imports from the US are similar in trend, but imports show a
stronger rebound in 2010 than exports, which contributed to China's trade deficit in
March 2010. Similarly to exports, the most severe decline in imports occurred in the
first quarter of 2009.


       The picture is thus of sharper than average declines in US trade with some Asian
countries ( Japan and Korea), and smaller declines with other countries (China).
       The growth rates of other Asian countries' trade with China during the crisis are
reported in Table 5. Exports by India, Korea, Thailand and Taiwan to China fell sharply
in the last quarter of 2008, and declined more than exports to the US in percentage
terms. Japan's exports to China declined less than those to the US during the crisis,
which is slightly better than Japan's total export performance. All countries' exports to
China rebounded strongly from the end of 2009. These countries' imports from China
fell sharply in the first quarter of 2009, lagged a couple of months more than exports to
China, and started to rebound from the end of 2009, almost synchronously with exports.
The rebound speed for imports is significantly lower than that for exports, which
indicates that China's large market for foreign goods contributed to the recovery of
neighborig trade.

         Growth rates of trading by China, India, Japan and Thailand with the EU are
  reported in Table 6. China's and India's trade with the EU grew rapidly on both the
  export and import side. Also, imports by Thailand of EU products increased faster
  before the financial crisis. The trade of China, India and Thailand with the EU began to
  fall from the end of 2008 (imports of Thailand from the EU fell from January 2009)

  trade with the EU shrank the most among the Asian economies during the financial
  crisis. Exports by Japan to the EU grew by 10.6% in January 2008; then the growth
  abated gradually before turning negative from April 2008 onwards. Growth rates of
  imports by Japan from the EU fluctuated between -10% and 6% during the first nine
  months, then declined sharply and continuously for sixteen months.

  before the crisis. The proportional decline in exports by India and Japan to ASEAN
  was approximately the same during the crisis. Exports by India to ASEAN grew at a
  high rate during the first half of 2008, with a growth rate of 142.5% in June 2008, but
  started declining sharply from October 2008 onwards. Imports by India from ASEAN
  grew the most rapidly before the crisis and fell the least during the crisis among these
  countries. The trade of Thailand with other ASEAN countries grew the second most
  rapidly before the crisis, and dropped less than Japan and India on the export side and
  less than Japan and China on the import side.

       Quarterly growth rates of trade between Singapore and its major partners are
reported in Table 8. On the export side, Singapore's exports to China dropped the least
during the crisis and rebounded the most. On the import side, imports from the EU
grew the fastest in 2008 and declined the least in 2009 among these partners. Exports
to the US and imports from Japan fell the most in 2009.

       The overall picture from the above is that of a severe impact of the financial
crisis on the trade of Asian countries which affected most trading partners. The most
severe impact caused by the recession has seemingly been on US imports from Japan
and China, but from the end of 2009, the trade of all these Asian economies shows a
rebound, and the strongest rebound occurs in trade between ASEAN and China, which
suggests the importance of geography in trade recovery.

          4. Comparing the Trade Performance of Asian Economies by Major Product
          Group and Type of Trade
                 We next turn to the trade performance of major export product groups involving
          Asian countries during and following the crisis. As well as look at type of trade
          (processing / non-processing) and type of enterprise in China's case. Data are presented
          in Tables 9 to 15. Performance in terms of total trade varies by country and type of
          trade, but more by product group than by trade type.

                 In Table 9, growth rates for China's export of manufactured goods are almost the
                                                             - 16 -
same as for China's total exports, since manufacture accounts for over 90% of China's
total exports. Japan's exports of manufactures increased slowly during the first half of
2008, but experienced a sharp decline with a fall of more than 35% for ten consecutive
months. They showed a rapid rebound in 2010. Korean exports of manufactures grew
considerably during the whole of 2008, then experienced a slight recession in the first
half of 2009 before resuming growth, interrupted intermittently by months of negative
growth. India and Thailand both experienced fast expansion of export of manufactures
before October 2008, which then fell sharply as the crisis hit. The faster growth of
India's trade before the crisis and its sharp decline during the crisis suggest an inverted
relationship.
      For textile, yarns and clothing, exports by India grew faster than for China and
Thailand pre-crisis, but fell more sharply during the crisis. Exports by China declined
the least. For exports of electronics, Japan and Korea show a different picture. As with
other product groups, Japan's exports of electronics declined first and sharply during
the crisis, whereas Korean exports only declined slightly in the three months pre- and
post-crisis. For Korea and China, this difference reflects the less severe impact of the
crisis on the competitiveness of Korean exports.

      Table 10 reports Asian countries' imports during the crisis, reporting growth
rates of imports by product group. These data reflect the situation of the real,
underlying, economies. For oil, imports by these countries all grew rapidly before
October 2008, then fell sharply (except for Korea). The global oil price fluctuations
influenced all of these countries' trade, the smaller decline in Korean demand for oil
reflecting a weaker impact of the crisis on the Korean economy.

      For trade in other minerals, India experienced the most rapid growth pre-crisis
and the sharpest decline during the crisis. For base metals and related products, Korean
imports grew the most rapidly in 2008 and fell sharply in 2009, whereas Japan's grew
the most slowly pre-crisis and dropped the most post-crisis. China's imports of base
metals dropped considerately in the crisis and started to rebound beginning in May
2009, following China's stimulus package. This is almost two quarters (i.e. six months)

                ahead of the rebound in other countries' imports of base metals.

                           Quarterly growth rates of Singapore's trade in major product groups are
                reported in Table 11. On the export side, exports of oil grew fastest pre-crisis and
                dropped the most in proportion term during the crisis. Exports of chemicals fell first
                from the beginning of 2008 and showed a strong rebound in the last quarter of 2009.
                On the import side, imports of iron and steel grew the fastest in 2008, but fell rapidly in
                2009. Imports of crude materials (excluding oil) of Singapore saw positive growth in
                the two years with only a slight drop of 2.4% in the last quarter of 2009.

         To analyse the impact of the crisis on type of trade, we take China as a more
detailed case study and discuss its trade performance in terms of processing and
non-processing trade, and also trade by different type of enterprise. The processing
trade accounts for a large share of several developing Asian countries including China,
India, Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia. These countries are all host countries to FDI
inflows and the endpoints of manufacturing chains for multinational enterprises.
Although foreign-invested companies promote foreign trade for these countries, they
also compete with local companies, especially with nationally-owned enterprises in
China.


           Proportion of China's processing trade and non-processing trade pre- and
post-crisis are reported in Table 12 (these sum to a little less than one owing to small
amounts of so-called special trade (gifts, for example)). These shares changed
relatively little in the crisis. On the export side, shares of processing and
non-processing trade were similar pre- and post-crisis, with processing the least at 43%
and non-processing the most at 51% in January 2009. On the import side,
non-processing trade was almost half of China's imports with a high of 54% and a low
of 48%, whereas processing was over 30% of China's imports, with a high of 36% and

                                                                   - 19 -
a low of 30% during 2008 and 2009. The financial crisis seemingly did not affect
China's processing trade pattern greatly.

imported for processing trade, export of goods for foreign contracted projects, leasing trade,
imported equipment used as investment by foreign funded enterprises, barter transaction, duty-free
commodities on payment of foreign currency; inbound and outbound goods in bonded warehouses,
merchandise for transit in bonded warehouses, equipment imported in the export processing zones,
etc. The total special trade is insignificant.

         Table 13 reports growth rates of China's non-processing and processing trade
compared with the same month in the previous year. On the export side, China's
processing started to fall in November 2008, two months ahead of non-processing trade.
Processing trade fell more rapidly than non-processing trade in the first quarter of 2009,
and then the situation was reversed. On the import side, non-processing trade grew
more quickly than processing trade before November 2008, then processing trade
decreased more sharply than non-processing trade for a year. Processing trade then

         As the majority of FDI inflows into Asian developing countries comes from
American and European countries, most processing activities in these countries are
completely or partly controlled by developed countries. Goods manufactured by them
are mostly shipped back and sold in OECD markets. The trend of China's trade pattern
in processing trade is consistent with the general trend in her trade with the US and the
EU and reflects the impact of the recession in external markets on China's foreign
trade.

         We also report changes in China's trade by different types of enterprise during
the crisis. Shares of China's trade by type of enterprise are reported in Table 14.
Foreign-invested enterprises always account for over half of China's total trade and this
did not change markedly during the crisis. Both on the export and import sides, shares
of national-owned enterprises decreased slightly and shares of private enterprises
increased slightly after the crisis.

       Growth rates of China's trade by type of enterprise compared with the same
month of the previous year are reported in Table 15. Exports by private enterprises
grew the most in 2008 and decreased in 2009, with a two-month lag compared with
nationally-owned and foreign-invested enterprises. Imports by nationally-owned
enterprises grew the most before November 2008, and declined the fastest after that.
Changes in China's processing trade are closely tied to changes in China's trade by type
of enterprise.

5. The Trade Compression in Asia during the Financial Crisis, the 1930s and the
Asian Financial Crisis


      Comparing trade performance with earlier crises is complex and inevitably
involves inexact comparisons. For the 1930s we compare both North American and
European trade impacts as well as Asian, since in the 1930s Asian trade was
insignificant except for Japan (and to a lesser extent China). We use Japan (the worst
trade performer among these Asian countries) and China (the average trade performer)
for examples of trade in the Great Depression of the 1930s. The annual growth rates of
trade are presented in Table 16. China's export and import growth rates declined from
26% and 21% to 17% and 19% between 2007 and 2008, then experienced -16% and
-12% negative growth in 2009, respectively. Exports by Japan grew by 11.5% in 2007,
then fell slightly in 2008 and sharply by 33% in 2009. Japanese imports reversed a
trend of steady growth and declined by 35% in 2009.


      The comparison with the 1930s is striking. During the Great Depression, US
trade experienced the shortest recession period of all the major economies; three years,
far shorter than that of other countries. French trade experienced the longest recession
with exports experiencing negative growth each year between 1927 and 1936 and
imports falling sharply between 1930 and 1935. On both export and import sides, the
trade of the US, Germany, France, and China fell sharply during 1930 and 1932. Either
because of the magnitude of the drop, or the length of the Depression, the US,
Germany, France and China experienced a significantly deeper trade compression in
the Great Depression than China and Japan in this financial crisis.


      GDP growth rate comparisons for China and Japan pre- and post-financial crisis
and in the 1930s are also striking. The average annual GDP growth for China between
2007 and 2009 remained high whereas Japan's GDP growth rate fell from 2% to -0.7%.
During the 1930s, US annual GDP growth rates between 1930 and 1935 were -8.6%,
-6.5%, -13.1%, -1.3% and 10.9 respectively (Maddison, 1997), whereas China's GDP
growth rates between 1932 and 1936 were 3.68%, -0.72%, -8.64%, 8.30%, and 5.87%

                                          - 24 -
       respectively (Yeh, 1977). Japan's strong growth performance of 3.7% during the Great
       Depression was higher than China's (average 1.7%) (Maddison, 1997). These data
       suggest that the impact of the 1930s Depression on real GDP was significantly smaller
       than that on trade in the Asian countries and trade rebounded more strongly than GDP
       after the crisis.

              We also present quarterly growth rates of Chinese and Japanese trade (compared
       with the previous quarter). Trade performance during this financial crisis and OECD
       countries' trade performance during the Great Depression are also reported in Table 17.
       The trade of Japan and China fell proportionately more in the first quarter of 2009 than
       for OECD countries in the initial years of the Great Depression, but the trade of Japan
       and China in the financial crisis shrank less than three quarters before rebounding
       quickly.

       In the 1930s OECD countries suffered years of decline before recovery; if we
compare the proportional decline in individual quarters, the trade of Japan and China
fell more in the first quarter of 2009 than OECD countries in the 1930s. Yet the
proportion of decline during the crisis is significantly more than the shrinkage of

                                               - 26 -
   Chinese and Japanese trade in the 1930s. For the OECD the fall is smaller. Therefore,
   the initial impact of the recent financial crisis on the trade of Japan and China is more
   severe than the impact of the Great Depression, but the duration of the impact is
   shorter.


              We also report data on Asian economies' performance during the Asian
   financial crisis and make comparisons with trade performance in the crisis. The year-
   on-year growth rates of exports of Asian economies during the Asian financial crisis
   are reported in Table 18. Exports by China and Vietnam retained positive growth
   between 1996 and 2003 whereas others experienced a fall, but at most for two years.
   The biggest annual proportional trade decline among other Asian economies was 17%,
   but this is significantly less than exports of Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan in 2009.
   Thailand and Indonesia, who suffered the severest recession during the Asian financial
   crisis, found their exports only declined 6.9% and 4.6% in 1998 respectively, but they
   dropped about 15% in 2009. Exports of Singapore declined the most among these
   economies, with a fall of 15.7% in 1998, and exports of Taiwan, Japan and the
   Philippines fell by over 16% in 2001. Among these economies, only the exports of
   Korea performed better in 2009 than in the Asian financial crisis. Thus, in general, the
   impacts of the recent crisis on the exports of the Asian economies are more severe than
   the impacts of the Asian financial crisis.

          The year--on-year growth rates of imports by Asian economies during the Asian
   financial crisis are reported in Table 19. Except for China, imports kept growing with
   Vietnam's imports experiencing only a slight decline in 1998. Other countries' imports
   experienced severe decline during the recent financial crisis. Imports of China, India,
   Japan, Philippine, Taiwan and Vietnam dropped more in 2009 than in 1998, and
   imports by Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand dropped less in 2009 than in 1998.
   World oil prices dropped about 40% in 2008, but dropped from $137.1 per barrel in
   July 2008 to $34.6 per barrel in January 2009, a 75% fall (EIA). Even excluding the
   impact of the oil price changes, the impact of the financial crisis on Asian imports is
   still more severe than that of the Asian financial crisis.

            Finally we present data in Table 20 on annual growth rates of key Asian
   economies before and after the Asian financial crisis and compare them with data for
   the recent financial crisis. China, India and Vietnam kept growing rapidly during both
   financial crises. China and Vietnam lost 1.5 points and 2.4 points of GDP growth in
   1998, whereas they lost 4.0 and 2.3 points of GDP growth in 2008. Indonesia and
   Thailand experienced declines of over 10% in GDP in 1998, whereas Indonesia's GDP

                                                    - 28 -
   increased by 4.5% and Thailand declined by 2.3% in 2009. GDP for Korea and the
   Philippines kept growing between 2007 and 2009, although it declined by 6.9% and
   0.6% respectively in 1998. GDP growth rates of Taiwan are positive between 1996 and
   2000, but dropped to -2.2 in 2001 then rebounded. GDP growth rates for Taiwan
   dropped from 5.7% in 2007 to -2.5% in 2009. GDP of Japan and Singapore declined
   mildly at -2.0% and -1.4% respectively. GDP growth rates of Singapore have
   fluctuated substantially over the last two decades. They dropped from 8.3% to -1.4%
   between 1997 and 1998 and from 7.8% to 1.1% between 2007 and 2008.
           Thus, in general, the Asian financial crisis affected the Asian economies more
   severely in terms of GDP growth than the recent financial crisis, but the trade impacts
   were greater. Green (2010) also analyses Asia's policy response to the 2008 crisis using
   ASEAN economies as an example, and argues that south-east Asia was slow to
   mobilize to reduce the impact of the crisis. Fiscal expenditure policy delayed
   stimulating domestic demand and mitigating the impact on the poor (see also
   Athukorala & Chongvilaivan, 2010; Basri & Rahardja, 2010).

          The impacts of the recent financial crisis on Asian countries' trade thus seem


                                                   - 29 -
significantly milder than the impacts of the Great Depression on the trade of OECD
countries, but impacts of the Asian financial crisis on the trade of Asian countries were
more severe. In terms of GDP growth, the impacts of the financial crisis seem less
pronounced than those of the Asian financial crisis on the Asian economies.

6. Conclusion
      In this paper we document and compare the trade performance of the major
Asian economies both during and following the 2008 financial crisis. We present data
for China, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Korea, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan on both the
import and export sides on a monthly basis throughout the crisis. We compare their
trade performance in aggregate and by product and bilateral trading partner. Except for
Korea, which experienced an initial smaller impact but a quick rebound, Asian
economies experienced considerable declines in trade in the whole of 2009. In general,
imports dropped more proportionally than exports for these economies, which reflects
both the consequences of oil price fluctuations and the impacts of the financial crisis on
the real economies in the OECD. For Asia, on both the export and import sides, there is
a solid rebound in 2010.

      We also make comparisons of the impact of the recent financial crisis on Asian
trade with both the Great Depression in China and Japan and the Asian financial crisis
of 1998. The impact on Asian trade between 2008 and 2009 is milder than for OECD
countries during the Great Depression and more severe than for Asian countries during
the Asian financial crisis. For GDP growth rates, Asian countries' impacts are greater
and declined more in the Asian financial crisis than between 2008 and 2009.
