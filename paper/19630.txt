  This paper develops a model of investment decisions in which uncertainty about a
one-time change in tax policy induces the firm to temporarily stop investing–to
adopt a wait-and-see policy. The basic idea is that uncertainty about a future tax
rate creates uncertainty about the profitability of the investment. If the uncertainty
is likely to be resolved in the not-too-distant future, the firm rationally delays com-
mitting resources to irreversible projects. After the uncertainty is resolved, the firm
exploits the tabled projects, generating a temporary investment boom. The size of
the boom depends on the realization of the fiscal uncertainty, with lower realizations
of the tax rate producing larger booms.
  In the model studied here investment has two inputs, projects and cash. Projects
can be thought of as specific investment opportunities, as in McDonald and Siegel
(1986) and Jovanovic (2009). For a retail chain or a service provider, projects might
be cities or locations where new outlets could be built. For a manufacturing firm,
a project might be the construction of a new plant. For a real estate developer, a
project might be a parcel of land that could be built on. The key feature of a project
is that it is an investment opportunity not freely available to others: it is exclusive
to one particular investor, or likely to be so. This feature is important in generating
delay: the investor is willing to wait because–at least with high probability–the
opportunity will still be available later.
  Both projects and liquid assets can be stored, and a “wait-and-see” policy–delay–
is defined as a situation where the stocks of both projects and cash are positive. When
is delay an optimal strategy? Proposition 4, the main result of the paper, answers
this question: an optimal response to uncertainty about future policy always involves
a period of delay. That period is short if the extent of uncertainty is small, and it does
not begin immediately if the uncertainty is in the distant future, but delay is always


                                             2
part of the optimal strategy. Perfectly anticipated policy changes, on the other hand,
typically lead investors to accumulate one input or the other, but not both.
  Although the literature on investment under uncertainty is vast, most of it focuses
on ongoing idiosyncratic shocks, typically interpreted as shocks to the demand for the
firm’s product or to its cost of production.1 Most closely related to the model here are
papers by Cukierman (1980) and Bernanke (1983). Cukierman looks at the decision
problem of an individual firm with a single investment opportunity. The project is
characterized by an unknown scale parameter, drawn from a known distribution. Each
period the firm receives a signal about the parameter and updates its beliefs. The
firm must decide when to invest–how long to wait and receive more information–
and how much to invest. The paper shows that an increase in the variance of the
distribution from which the parameter is drawn (weakly) increases the number of
periods that investment is delayed.
  Bernanke (1983) looks at a dynamic inference model, in which investment opportu-
nities arrive every period and the underlying distribution from which these are drawn
is, at random dates, replaced with a new one. When this happens, investors learn
about it slowly, by observing the outcomes of previous investment decisions. There-
fore, after a switch occurs there is likely to be at least one period when investors
are very uncertain which distribution is in place. The paper provides an example in
which the switch from one distribution to another necessarily produces at least one
period in which investors adopt a “wait and see” strategy and no investment takes
place.
  Other related theoretical work includes papers looking at the aggregate eﬀects of
uncertainty through its impact on investment. Hopenhayn and Muniagurria (1996)
look at the aggregate implications of policy variability in the sense of regime switching
in a standard growth model, and find it can have unexpected growth and welfare

eﬀects. More recent work looks at the aggregate eﬀects of increased variance in the
distribution of idiosyncratic productivity shocks. In Bloom (2009) the eﬀects of higher
variance come through fixed costs of investment, while in Arellano, Bai, and Kehoe
(2012) they come through financing constraints. Lee (2012) looks at a setting in
which investment opportunities must be created, and higher idiosyncratic volatility
has a beneficial eﬀect by inducing investors to create more opportunities and then set
a high threshold for selection. By contrast with this work, the model here focuses on
uncertainty about a large, one-time policy event.
  On the empirical side, related work includes studies of the aggregate eﬀects of fiscal
shocks, “news shocks,” and “uncertainty shocks.” Shocks to fiscal policy have long
been recognized as an important source of cyclical variation, as in Baxter and King
(1993), McGrattan (1994, 2012), and elsewhere. Later work has found evidence that
“news shocks” also have aggregate eﬀects, as in Beaudry and Portier (2004, 2006,
2007), Jaimovich and Rebelo (2009), Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2010), and Barsky
and Sims (2011). Although this work looks at news about productivity growth, it
seems plausible that news about fiscal policy would have similar announcement eﬀects.
  More recently still, a number of papers have looked for evidence of real eﬀects
from “uncertainty shocks,” changes in the variance of the shock of interest. The
conclusions here have been mixed, with some studies finding a substantial impact,
as in Alexopoulos and Cohen (2009), Fernández-Villaverde, et. al. (2012), Baker,
Bloom and Davis (2013), and Bloom, et. al. (2013), and others finding small eﬀects,
as in Born, Peter and Pfeiﬀer (2011), Bachmann and Bayer (2012), and Born and
Pfeiﬀer (2013).
  The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview.
In section 3 the model is described in more detail, and the transition after the tax
change is studied. Section 4 analyzes the firm’s strategy before the tax change. The
main result is Proposition 4, which shows that uncertainty about the new tax policy


                                           4
necessarily leads to delay. Section 5 extends the model to allow a Poisson arrival date,
and Proposition 5 shows that the main result carries over, provided the arrival rate is
not too small. Section 6 contains a numerical example, and section 7 concludes. All
proofs are in Appendix A, and Appendix B describes the computational procedure.

                                   2. OVERVIEW

  The model uses an investment technology designed to produce an option value.
Briefly, the key features are that each investment opportunity is exclusive to the firm,
there is an intensity decision that is irreversible, and there are storage possibilities
that permit delay. This rest of this section describes these features in more detail.
  First, investment requires a project, as well as an input of cash. As noted above,
projects should be thought of as specific investment opportunities. For retailers they
might be new locations for outlets, for manufacturers they might be new plants, and
so on. The key feature of a project is that it is available only to one particular
investor. Hence that investor can wait to make a decision about how best to exploit
it. This exclusivity assumption could be relaxed to some extent. For example, similar
conclusions would hold if projects had a positive hazard rate of becoming available to
other investors. The assumption cannot be dropped altogether, however. If a specific
project were immediately available to multiple investors, there would be Bertrand-like
competition to be the first to exploit it, precluding the possibility of delay.
  Second, the intensity of investment in a project is an irreversible decision. Specif-
ically, all investment in a particular project must take place at a single date: the
capital cannot be increased or decreased later on. Thus, investment intensity has a
putty-clay character: it is flexible ex ante but fixed ex post. This feature could also
be relaxed. A model with costly reversibility would deliver similar conclusions, at the
cost of added complexity.
  Third, the firm can accumulate projects, and those projects do not depreciate.

                                           5
A positive depreciation rate or a positive probability of becoming obsolete could be
incorporated, but storability is key for creating an option value.
  Fourth, the total cost of investment is linear in the number of projects for a fixed
intensity and strictly convex in the intensity for a fixed number of projects. Strict
convexity in the intensity is critical for making projects a valuable commodity. With-
out it, investment could be concentrated on a small set of projects, at no additional
cost.
  Finally, the firm cannot borrow, although it can hold stocks of liquid assets. The
interest rate on liquid assets is less than the discount rate for dividends, however.
Thus, in the absence of uncertainty holding liquid assets is unattractive, and the firm
pays out dividends as quickly as possible. But in the presence of uncertainty, liquid
assets can be attractive as a temporary investment while waiting for the uncertainty
to be resolved. The assumption of a low interest rate on liquid assets makes the
firm’s dividend policy determinate, and the no-borrowing assumption is primarily for
convenience. Allowing the firm to borrow at an interest rate higher than the discount
rate would make the firm’s financing decision more complex, and reduce or eliminate
the incentive to hold liquid assets. Investment decisions would be qualitatively the
same however, and the firm would borrow only to accelerate investment.
  Formally, time is continuous, and new projects arrive at a constant rate . At
each date a firm chooses  the number of projects (a flow), and  the intensity of
investment in each project. Total investment is the product  =  (a flow). The cost
of implementing a project with intensity   0 is () where the function  is strictly
increasing and strictly convex. Hence cost minimization implies that the firm chooses
the same intensity for all projects implemented at the same date, and investing at
the total rate  =  has total cost () = () (a flow) if it is allocated across
 projects. If projects and liquid assets have been accumulated, there may also be a
discrete investment with intensity ̂, where the number of projects ̂ the increment to


                                           6
capital ̂̂ and the total cost ̂(̂) are masses. This type of investment is discussed
in more detail later.
  The role played by projects can be seen in a two-period example,  = 1 2 with a
project inflow of  = 1 in each period, and 0 given. The firm chooses the investment
scale in each period, 0 ≤ 1 ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ 2 ≤ 2 − 1  as well as the intensities,
1  2 ≥ 0 The capital stock and total investment costs are then

                           = (1 − ) −1 +         = 1 2
                                            1
                          = 1 (1 ) +      2 (2 )
                                          1+

If the firm uses the projects as they arrive, choosing 1 = 2 = 1 total investment
costs in the option model are ( ) + (2 ) (1 + )  as usual. But if the firm chooses
to concentrate investment in the second period, if 1 = 0 and 2 = 2 with total
investment 2  0 in the second period, the option model reduces total cost from
(2 ) to 2(2 2) Because it allows (forward) smoothing over time, the option model
reduces the cost of delay.
  Installed capital  produces the net revenue flow () and depreciates at the con-
stant rate   0 The revenue from installed capital is taxed at a flat rate  and
uncertainty about  is the only risk the firm faces. We will study the eﬀect of uncer-
tainty about a one-time tax reform that is expected in the future. Two assumptions
about timing are considered. In the first, the date  of the tax reform is known, and
only the new tax rate is uncertain. In the second, the date of the reform is stochastic,
with a Poisson arrival time. In both cases the new tax rate ̂ is drawn from a known
distribution  (·)
  The following assumptions are maintained throughout:
       –dividends are discounted at the constant rate   0;
       –liquid assets held by the firm earn interest at the constant rate 0 ≤   ;
       –the firm cannot borrow: all investment is from retained earnings, and

                                             7
            the dividend must be nonnegative;
       –capital cannot be sold: gross investment must be nonnegative;
       –the firm receives a constant flow   0 of new projects;
       –the revenue function  is strictly increasing, strictly concave, and twice
            diﬀerentiable, with (0) = 0  0 (0) = ∞ and lim→∞  0 () = 0;
       –the cost function  is strictly increasing, strictly convex, and twice
            diﬀerentiable, with (0) = 0 0 (0) ≥ 0 and lim→∞ 0 () = ∞;
       –the time horizon is infinite.

           3. THE MODEL AND THE TRANSITION AFTER 

  Consider a one-time tax reform, announced at date  = 0, that will take eﬀect at
date   0 There are no changes in the tax rate during the interval [0  ) and after
the single reform there are no further changes. The new tax rate is not announced
at  = 0 however. Instead, the firm knows only that it will, at  be drawn from a
known distribution 
  We will compare the firm’s optimal strategy in the option model with its behavior in
a benchmark model where projects cannot be accumulated. The goal is to characterize
the firm’s optimal investment on [0  ) in anticipation of the change, and after  ,
when the new rate is in eﬀect. As usual, it is convenient to start by looking at
decisions after 
  In the option model the state variable for the firm is  = (  )  where   0
and   ≥ 0 are its stocks of capital, liquid assets, and projects. In the benchmark
model the state variable is ( ) 




                                           8
a. The firm’s problem at 

  At date  the tax rate ̂ is announced and takes eﬀect. Consider the optimal
investment strategy for a firm with state   where   0 and    ≥ 0 If
    0 the firm can make a one-time discrete adjustment (DA), using some or
all of its stocks of cash and projects to produce an increment to its capital stock. In
particular, it can invest in a mass of projects ̂ ≥ 0, with intensity ̂ ≥ 0, producing
a mass of new capital goods ˆ = ̂̂ The cost of this investment, ̂(̂) must be
financed out of its stock of liquid assets. In addition, the firm can use any remaining
liquid assets to pay a discrete dividend ̂. After these one-time adjustments, if any,
the firm faces a standard control problem.
                                         ³        ´
  Thus, the firm’s problem is to choose ̂ ̂ ̂ and the subsequent dividend flow
and investment intensity {() () ()}∞
                                           = to maximize the PDV of total dividends.

Let ( ; ̂ ) denote the maximized value of the firm,
                                          ∙     Z ∞                 ¸

                    s.t.     ̂ =  + ̂̂                                       (2)

                             ̂ =  − ̂ − ̂(̂)

                            ̂ =  − ̂

                             ̇ =  − 

                              0 ≤                       all   
           ³               ´
where ̂ = ̂  ̂  ̂ denotes the firm’s state after the DA.

                                               9
  The benchmark firm faces a similar problem except that it cannot accumulate
projects. Hence it cannot make a DA to its capital stock at  , and after  its scale
of investment is equal to the inflow of projects at every date. Thus, its problem is as
in (1) - (3), but with  = ̂ = 0 and [() ≡  () ≡ 0    ] Let  (   ; ̂ )
denote the maximized value of the benchmark firm.
  The option and benchmark models have the same steady state (SS), which is unique
and has  = 0  = 0 and

                     (1 −  )  0 ( ) = ( + )  0 ( )                         (4)
                                            
                                     =     
                                           
                                    = (1 −  ) ( ) − ( )

where     and  are strictly decreasing in  As will be shown below, for any
  0 and    ≥ 0 the solution to (1) - (3) converges asymptotically to the SS.
  Before proceeding, however, it is useful to bound the ranges for the capital stock
and the tax rate. Let  =   (0) be the SS capital stock when the tax rate is  = 0
Only nonnegative tax rates are of interest, so  is a natural upper bound on the set
of capital stocks. Then define   0 as the tax rate for which investment to maintain
the capital stock at  just exhausts after-tax profits,

                             (1 −  ) () − () = 0

For any lower tax rate and smaller capital stock,  ∈ [0  ] and  ∈ (0 ] after-tax
revenue is suﬃcient to finance investment to maintain the capital stock, a fact that
simplifies some arguments later on. In the numerical examples in section 6,  is about
65%.

b. The transition after  in the benchmark model

  Propositions 1 - 3 describe the transition after the new tax rate ̂ is realized. It
is convenient first to characterize the solution for the benchmark model, and then
describe how the option of storing projects alters that solution.
  The benchmark solution has a partial ‘bang-bang’ form with two critical values for
capital. While the capital stock () is below the first critical value,   all earnings
are invested and the dividend is zero. While () is above the second critical value,
  all earnings are paid out as dividends and there is no investment. While () is
between the two critical values, both investment and the dividend are positive.

  Proposition 1: For any ̂ ∈ [0  ]   ∈ (0 ] and  ≥ 0 the solution to the
benchmark version of (1)-(3) has the following properties.
  (a) The capital stock () converges monotonically to   and () () are con-
tinuous along the transition path.
  There are two critical values for capital, with 0       ≤ ∞ If  0 (0)  0,
then   +∞ and if 0 (0) = 0 then  = +∞
  (b) If  = 0 then () = 0 all  ≥  and
                  ¡     ¢
       for () ∈ 0   () = 0 and ()  0 is strictly increasing;
                  ¡       ¢
       for () ∈    , ()  0 is strictly increasing and ()  0
            is strictly decreasing;
                   ¡       ¢
       for () ∈     ()  0 is strictly decreasing and ()  0
            is strictly increasing;
       for ()    ()  0 is strictly decreasing and () = 0
  (c) If   0 and  ≥   then ̂ =   ̂ = 0 and the transition is as in (b).
  (d) If   0 and     there is a continuous and strictly decreasing function
( )  ∈ (0  ], with ( ) = 0 such that
       ̂ = 0 and ̂ =  for  ≤ ( );

       ̂ =  − ( ) and ̂ = ( ) for   ( )
In either case () is strictly decreasing while ()  0, and () reaches zero while
()    Thereafter () = 0 and the rest of the transition is as in (b).

  Let  = (   ) denote the costate variables. Figure 1 shows the projection of the
phase diagram on (  ) −space, with () ≡ 0. The value  =  (0) is indicated on
the horizontal axis. The ̇ = 0 and ̇ = 0 loci are the dotted curves, and the stable
manifold  is the solid curve. The broken curve, () is the threshold where the
firm becomes cash constrained. Above that curve the firm is constrained, with   1
and  = 0 Below it the firm is unconstrained, with  = 1 and   0 The critical
value  is defined by the intersection of  and (). In this example    so
the region where ∗ = 0 does not appear in the figure.
  If the initial asset stock is zero,  = 0 the transition is along  in Figure 1, and
liquid assets are never acquired. If initial assets are positive,   0 there are two
possibilities. If  ≥   the relevant portion of  lies below () in the region
where  = 1 Thus, the firm’s profit flow is suﬃcient to finance investment at the
desired rate with funds left over for a dividend. Hence the entire initial asset stock is
paid as a dividend, ̂ =   and rest of the solution is unchanged.
  If     the firm’s profit flow is insuﬃcient to finance investment at the desired
rate. In this case the initial dividend is less than the asset stock, 0 ≤ ̂    and
the remaining assets are used for investment. Thus, the solution involves ()  0
over a finite period. Let ̂ denote the date when assets are depleted. Since ̇  =
( − )  0 for  ∈ [ ̂ ) it follows that  (̂ )  1 which implies (̂ )   

c. The transition after  in the option model

  Next consider a firm with the option to store projects. Proposition 2 describes
a key feature of the transition: stocks of liquid assets and projects are never held


                                              12
simultaneously. Thus, the DA (̂ ̂ ̂) exhausts at least one of the initial stocks, so
the subsequent transition begins with ̂ = 0 or ̂ = 0 or both, and at least one
stock is zero at every later date as well. In addition, the post-DA stock of liquid
assets can be positive only if the post-DA capital stock is less than  

  Proposition 2: For any ̂ ∈ [0  ]   ∈ (0 ] and    ≥ 0 the solution to
(1) - (3) has the property that: ̂ ̂ = 0 and ()() = 0 all    In addition
̂  0 implies ̂   

  The proof of the last claim is immediate. If ̂ ≥  the firm is not liquidity
constrained, and ̂ = 1 Hence any excess cash is paid out immediately as a dividend,
and ̂ = 0
  The next result describes potential post-DA transitions in the option model. In
accord with Proposition 2, attention is limited to initial conditions with ̂ ̂ = 0
with ̂   if ̂  0 The transitions involve two new thresholds, 0    If
                                           £       ¤
the capital stock lies outside the interval 0   and  = 0 the firm accumulates
projects. For capital stocks below 0 the firm is cash constrained, and it accumulates
projects in order to fund them later, at higher intensities, after its cash flow has
improved. For capital stocks above  the firm is decumulating capital, and it
hoards projects to use later to reduce the cost of replacement investment.

  Proposition 3: For any ̂ ∈ [0  ]  ̂ ∈ (0 ] ̂  ̂ ≥ 0 with ̂ ̂ = 0 and
with ̂   if ̂  0 the solution to (1)-(3), involves two thresholds 0    in

the transition is as in (a). In particular, if   0 at this point, the solution involves

 If ̂ = 0 the transition in the option model is the same as in the benchmark

the firm immediately starts decumulating projects if ̂ ∈ 0    For capital stock
outside this range, it accumlates more projects before tapping into the stock.

d. The DA at 

  The firm’s choice about the DA at  depends on the realized tax rate ̂  with
lower rates producing an incentive for higher investment intensity. For fixed   0
and positive stocks of both assets,     0 Figure 2 shows, qualitatively, how
̂ ̂ ̂(̂) ̂ and the initial costate value ̂ vary with ̂  Note that the description
of ̂ as low, moderate or high means relative to other values in the support of  The
initial tax rate  may be higher or lower than all these values.
  The support of  is divided into three regions. For the lowest realizations of ̂ 
Region A, the firm would like to invest in the accumulated projects with a high
intensity, but it is cash constrained. In this region the DA exhausts the firm’s stock
of liquid assets, ̂(̂) =   and some projects remain, ̂    No initial dividend is
paid, ̂ = 0 and cash is at a premium, ̂  1 In this region ̂ is strictly increasing


                                              14
in ̂  while ̂ and ̂ are strictly decreasing. After date  the stock of remaining
projects is gradually used. During this period all earnings are used for investment,
and no dividend is paid. When the stock of projects is exhausted the solution lies on
(̂ ) and the remaining transition is as in the benchmark model.
  For higher realizations of ̂  Region B, the DA continues to use the entire stock of
projects, ̂ =   but the intensity of investment declines and the firm is not cash
constrained. The excess liquid assets are paid as an initial dividend, ̂  0 The
post-DA state lies on (̂ ) and the rest of the transition is as in the benchmark
model. Since ̂ = 1 the post-DA capital stock satisfies ̂ ≥  (̂ )
  For even higher realizations of ̂  Region C, neither the stock of projects nor the
stock of liquid assets is exhausted by the discrete investment, and the excess assets
are paid as a dividend. That is, ̂   , ̂ =  − ̂(̂)  0 and ̂ = 1 Indeed,
for ̂ suﬃciently large, ̂ = 0 For tax rates in this region, the post-DA adjustment
starts with a stock of projects ̂  0 which is gradually used. When the stock is
exhausted, (  ) lies on (̂ )
  Note that while the intensity ̂ of the DA is decreasing in ̂ over the entire range in
Figure 2, the scale ̂ is increasing in Region A, constant in Region B, and decreasing
in Region C. Thus, a stock of projects remains after the DA in Regions A and C. The
economic motive for holding investment options after  is diﬀerent in the two regions,
however. In Region A the firm is accumulating capital, but it is cash constrained.
Thus, it holds some projects back in order to finance them later, out of retained
earnings, at higher intensities. In Region C the firm is reducing its capital stock, and
it hoards projects to reduce the cost of replacement investment later on. As we will
see below, there must be positive probability of a realization in Region A, where cash
is exhausted by the DA and  (̂ )  1 The firm does not accumulate excessively
large stocks of cash.
  Note, too, that the firm does not hold liquid assets after date  Although liq-


                                           15
uid assets remain after the discrete investment in Regions B and C, they are paid
immediately as a dividend.

                     4. THE FIRM’S STRATEGY ON [0  )

  Next consider the firm’s strategy during the time interval [0  ) Assume that when
the reform is announced at  = 0 the firm has no initial stocks of liquid assets or
projects, 0 = 0 = 0, and its initial capital stock is at or below the steady state
for the old tax rate, 0 ≤  ( ) Values for 0 near  ( ) represent mature firms,
while smaller values represent younger firms. The new tax rate ̂ , which takes eﬀect
at  is drawn from the known distribution  (̂ ) and there are no further changes
thereafter. If  puts unit mass on a single point, the change is deterministic.
  Since there are no initial stocks of liquid assets or projects, there can be no DA or
discrete dividend at  = 0 Hence the firm chooses {(  )}=0 to solve
                        Z   
                  max           − () + − E̂ [(( ); ̂ )]   s.t. (3),        (5)
                        0

where the expectation uses  . The necessary conditions for an optimum are as before,
and the terminal conditions are

            lim  () = E̂ [ (̂ )]                                                 (6)
            ↑

            lim  () ≥ E̂ [ (̂ )]            w/ eq. if   0       =  
            ↑


where  (̂ )  =    are the initial costate values for the problem in (1) - (3),
given the initial state (     ) = (( ) ( ) ( )) and the realized tax rate ̂ 
Thus, the costate for capital approaching date  before the uncertainty is resolved,
must equal its expected value ex post. The costates for liquid assets and projects
may exceed their expected ex post values if the stock is zero.




                                                   16
a. The period of delay

  The main result of the paper is the next proposition, which states that in the option
model, uncertainty about the new tax rate always leads to a period of delay: there is
an interval of time before  during which investment ceases.

  Proposition 4: Suppose a tax change at   0 drawn from the distribution 
is announced at  = 0 Unless  puts unit mass at a single point, there exists ∆  0
such that ()() = 0 for  ∈ ( − ∆  ) 

  The proof is by contradiction. Suppose the contrary. Because  is convex, smooth-
ing the intensity of investment across projects reduces the total cost. Delaying some
projects from before  until just after  permits this type of smoothing. Of course,
if the uncertainty is small in magnitude, the period of delay is short. Thus, if  is
large, the period of delay may not begin at  = 0
  Proposition 4 implies that     0 so all three conditions in (6) must hold with
equality. One important feature of the solution is clear from that fact and Figure
2: the firm’s optimal strategy before  necessarily produces a positive probability
of being cash constrained when ̂ is realized. Since liquid assets are acquired before
 the necessary conditions imply that  is increasing on (0  )  Since  (0) ≥ 1 it
follows that  ( )  1 At date  the post-realization value satisfies ̂  1 only if
the new tax rate lies in Region A. Hence (6) implies that the solution lies in Region
A–where the firm is cash constrained–with strictly positive probability.
  Can delay occur in the absence of uncertainty? Yes, anticipation of a deterministic
tax decrease can induce the firm to accumulate both cash and projects. The Appendix
provides an example of this sort, with  ≈  ≈ 0 an extremely convex cost function 
and an approximately linear profit function . The motive for delay in this example
is simply to wait and exploit projects when the tax climate is more favorable. The
assumptions on  and  make the profits from an incremental stock of projects almost

                                           17
independent of when it is exploited, and the assumptions on  and  make waiting
almost costless.

                          5. STOCHASTIC ARRIVAL DATE

  The date when a tax change will occur may also be uncertain, and in this section
the model above is extended to include uncertainty about  For tractability, the
arrival is assumed to be Poisson, with arrival rate 
  A stochastic arrival date for the tax change does not aﬀect the firm’s post-arrival
problem in (1)-(3) or the continuation value function (; ̂ ) Before the arrival the
firm’s problem, given 0 = (0  0 0)  is to choose {(  )}∞
                                                                 =0 to solve
                   Z ∞
              max      −(+) {() + E̂ [((); ̂ )]}      s.t. (3),               (7)
                      0

where the second term in the objective function is the post-reform continuation value,
and the extra exponential term represents the probability that the tax change has
not yet occurred.
  The solution for (7) consists of {[     ]  all   0}  This solution con-
verges asymptotically to a steady state. Let ∗ () denote the steady state value for
 = (  )  as a function of 
  Let e denote the random date when the tax change arrives. The initial condition
for the post-reform transition depends on the realization of e call it   For small
  the initial condition is close to 0 = (0  0 0)  so the transition is essentially as in
Proposition 1, with negligible initial stocks of assets and projects. For large   the
initial condition for the post-arrival transition is close to ∗ ()
  The next result has two parts. First, it shows that for   0 suﬃciently small, the
firm does not accumulate stocks of liquid assets or projects, although it may adjust
its capital stock slightly. That is, ∗ () = [∗ () 0 0]  where ∗ () is close to  ( )
The second part is an analog of Proposition 4. It shows that unless the distribution 

                                               18
puts unit mass on a single point, for all  is suﬃciently large, the steady state stocks
of liquid assets and projects are positive, ∗ ()  0 and ∗ ()  0.

  Proposition 5: (a) For all   0 suﬃciently small, the steady state for (7) has
the property that ∗ () = [∗ () 0 0]  where ∗ () is close to  ( ) (b) Unless 
puts unit mass at a single point, for all  suﬃciently large, ∗ () ∗ ()  0

                                     6. EXAMPLE

  The example uses the revenue and cost functions
                                                           1
                          () =          () = 1  + 2 2 
                                                           2
and the parameter values

                        = 1       = 070 1 = 1        2 = 15
                        = 010  = 1         = 004  = 003

The initial tax rate is 0 = 020, and the post-reform rate is
                           ⎧
                           ⎨   = 022 with probability 0.486,
                     ̂ =
                           ⎩   = 042 with probability 0.514.

Thus, the tax reform could raise the tax rate by 2 or 22 percentage points, with
approximately equal probability. The reform is anticipated  = 050 years in advance.
Figures 3 - 5 show the transition for a firm with an initial capital stock that is three
quarters of the steady state level for the initial tax rate, 0 = 075 ·  (0 )
  Figure 3 compares the short-run transition in the option model with those in the
benchmark model and in a full information setting, where the new tax rate is known
at  = 0 (although it takes eﬀect at  ). With full information, the firm immediately
begins adjusting toward the new steady state, in a way that is almost indistinguishable
from the adjustment to an immediate tax change. In the benchmark model, the
adjustment over [0  ] is, approximately, a weighted average of the two with full

                                             19
information. If the new tax rate is uncertain, the firm adopts a “split-the-diﬀerence”
investment strategy over [0  ]  At date  the path splits, and thereafter the two parts
parallel the full information paths. The adjustment is lagged, however, reflecting the
fact that investment over [0  ] was at a “split-the-diﬀerence” level.
  In the option model the period of delay begins immediately: investment ceases over
[0  ]  and the capital stock declines through depreciation. At  when the uncertainty
is resolved, the capital stock jumps because of the discrete adjustment, with the size of
the jump depending on the realization of the new tax rate, and thereafter the capital
stock adjusts gradually to its new steady state level. The path for the capital stock
after  in the option model is very close to the one with full information, reflecting
the fact that the investment intensities for the discrete adjustment are tailored to the
new tax rate: a higher intensity if the lower tax rate is realized.
  Figure 4 displays additional features of the short-run transition. Panels (a)-(h)
show the stocks of capital, projects and liquid assets; investment; the marginal values
of capital, projects, and liquid assets; and the dividend.
  Over [0  ]  the capital stock declines through depreciation and the stock of projects
grows linearly, as shown in panels (a) and (b). Panel (c) shows liquid asset accumula-
tion, which begins only about 1.5 months before date  with the stock of assets then
growing linearly until  and panel (d) shows investment, which ceases over [0  ] 
  The marginal values for capital and projects jump down at  = 0 as shown in
panels (e) and (f), since news about the tax change–an increase, and perhaps a
large one–reduces the value of capital. The marginal value of capital continues to
fall over [0  ]  as the date of the tax increase draws closer. The marginal value of
projects rises at the rate , as it must while the stock is positive.
  The marginal value of liquid assets, shown in panel (g), remains constant at unity
while dividends are paid, but rises at the rate  −   0 over the period when
liquid assets are accumulated. The dividend, in panel (h), jumps up at  = 0 when


                                           20
investment ceases, and then jumps down to zero when liquid asset accumulation
begins.
  At date  the new tax rate is realized, and the discrete adjustment increases the
capital stock, as shown in panel (a). If the tax rate is the higher one,    the
firm chooses a lower intensity for investment, and the entire stock of projects can be
financed, with some liquid assets left over. Hence the stocks of projects and liquid
assets, in panels (b) and (c), both drop to zero. The extra cash is paid as a dividend
at  The marginal values of capital, projects, and liquid assets all drop, with the last
falling to unity, as it must when a dividend is paid.
  If   is realized, the firm chooses a higher intensity for each project, and it is
cash constrained at  . The stock of liquid assets is insuﬃcient to finance the entire
stock of projects, and, as shown in panel (b), some projects remain after the discrete
adjustment. As shown in panel (d), these are implemented over a short interval after
 as cash becomes available. The marginal values of capital, projects, and liquid
assets all increase at  . Until the stock of projects is exhausted, the marginal value
of liquid assets remains above unity and no dividend is paid.
  Figure 5 displays the longer run transition for the capital stock and investment,
as well as the steady state levels (dashed lines) for each realization of the new tax
rate. Since 0 lies between  (  ) and  (  ) the transition for ̂ =   involves
accumulating capital, and the transition for ̂ =   involves slowly decumulating
capital.
  In this example the option to store investment projects allows the firm to capture
about 42% of the gains from having full information, compared with the benchmark
model. Admittedly, those gains are small in this example, but the substantial period
of delay is the main point.

                                7. CONCLUSIONS

  The positive predictions of the model developed here are stark: policy uncertainty
leads to sharp swings in investment. Although agregate investment also displays sharp
swings, additional features will be needed to incorporate this micro-level theory into
a quantitative macro model. One possibility is to utilize the fact that some types of
policy uncertainty aﬀect only certain sectors or certain types of firms. For example,
financial market regulation aﬀects banks, exchange rate policy aﬀects importers, and
so on.
  Another possibility is to let stored projects depreciate. Depreciation could be inter-
preted as market changes that make the investment less profitable, or as “poaching”
by a rival firm that exploits a similar project. Since projects with high depreciation
rates are less storable, for a given policy reform, projects with depreciation rates
below some threshold might be stored, while those above the threshold would be
exploited immediately. This logic also suggests where to look for delay: since rivals
are more important in highly competitive sectors, delay may be more important in
sectors with highly diﬀerentiated products.
  The model here is formulated in terms of tax policy and business fixed investment,
but the idea could as well be applied to business hiring decisions and household
decisions about purchases of housing and other durables, and to uncertainty about
financial regulation, trade policy, energy policy, and other matters that aﬀect the
profitability/desirability of various types of investment.
  Most of the empirical work to date on uncertainty and investment has focused
on the eﬀect of changes in the variance of a shock, and hence that literature sheds
little light on the mechanism proposed here. A notable exception is Julio and Yook
(2012), who look at cross-country evidence on business investment and election cycles.
Consistent with the model here, they find that firms reduce investment substantially


                                           22
during election years, relative to non-election years.
  Event studies like those used in finance might also be useful for assessing the impor-
tance of policy uncertainty. The event could be a tax or tariﬀ change, a devaluation,
or a currency reform. The key predictions of the model are a period of depressed
investment before the reform is passed, and a boom after the uncertainty is resolved.
And for the reasons noted above, the eﬀect may be stronger in sectors with highly
diﬀerentiated products.
  The mechanism studied here may also be important in prolonging and amplifying
the consequences of other shocks. If a financial crisis produces a severe downturn,
the private sector may wait for legislative decisions about whether to turn to fiscal
stimulus, to see what form it will take and how it will be financed. If the fiscal
stimulus is ineﬀective, investors may wait again for decisions about a second round.
If central bankers and political leaders stall on decisions about how to deal with a
currency crisis or a potential default on sovereign debt, investors may choose to delay
until the main outlines of a policy have been agreed upon.
  The contribution of this paper is to highlight the potential for uncertainty about
a single policy decision to aﬀect decisions about the timing of investment. Because
policy uncertainty aﬀects all firms, it aﬀects aggregate investment, providing a channel
through which legislative inaction can lead to a cyclical downturn. Thus, stalling on
a major policy issue may have substantial hidden costs. The model here suggests
several new avenues for empirical work to assess the role of policy uncertainty in
triggering or exacerbating cyclical downturns.

  Let  = (     ) denote the costates for the problem in (1)-(3). The discrete
           ³          ´
adjustment ̂ ̂ ̂ satisfies2

where  (̂ )  (̂ ) and  (̂ ) are the costate values at date  after ̂ is realized.
Thereafter the solution satisfies

  For the benchmark model,  =  the solution satisfies the first line in (8) and the
first and second lines in (2)-(3) and (9)-(10), and  does not appear. Call this the
benchmark system.

  Proof of Proposition 1: The solution ̂ {         ≥  } satisfies the
benchmark system. Clearly (4) is the steady state, where the assumptions on  and
 ensure it is unique.

       See Kamien and Schwartz (1991) or Seierstad and Sydsaeter (1977) for a detailed discussion.


                                                  27
  Suppose  = 0 and conjecture the solution has () ≡ 0 Then   satisfy

                       ≤   0 ()                    w/ eq. if   0              (11)

                       = (1 − ̂ ) () − ()                 all  ≥             (12)

Use (11) and (12) to define () by
                                £           ¤
                               0−1 (()) ≡ (1 − ̂ ) ()

For any , the intensity  satisfying 0 () = () is just suﬃcient to absorb all of
after-tax earnings. The function  is strictly increasing, with (0) =  0 (0) and the
threshold () divides (  ) −space into two regions.
  Above the threshold the firm is cash constrained. In this region the dividend is
zero and cash is at a premium,  = 0 and   1. The investment intensity, call it
∗ (  ) is determined by (12), so it is strictly increasing in  and independent of  
and (11) determines  
  Below the threshold the firm is not cash constrained, so   0 and  = 1 In this
region the investment intensity is determined by (11), so it is strictly increasing in 
and independent of  and the dividend is determined by (12).
  Hence the intensity isoquants in (  ) space are L-shaped, with kinks on the
( ()) threshold. If  0 (0)  0 there is a second threshold, the horizontal line where
 =  0 (0) Below this threshold ∗ = 0 and above it ∗  0
  The locus where ̇ = 0 satisfies ∗ (  ) = , so it is upward sloping, hitting the
vertical axis at  = 0 (0) For ̂ ∈ [0  ] and 0 ∈ (0 ) the ̇ = 0 locus lies in the
region where   0 below () The locus where ̇ = 0 satisfies

                            ( + )  0 [∗ (  )] = (1 − ̂ )  0 ()

so it is downward sloping in the region where  ∗  0 and vertical in the regions
where  = 0 and ∗ = 0

                                                 28
  The stable manifold, call it  slopes downward, and for any  ∈ (0 ] there
is unique value   0 for which the system converges to the steady state. The
critical values       are defined by the points where  cuts the () and
 0 (0) thresholds. Along  intensity ∗ increases with  (as  falls) for    
                            ¡      ¢
it decreases with  for  ∈     and it is constant at ∗ = 0 for  ≥   The
dividend is  = 0 for  ≤  and increases with  for    
  To verify that the conjecture () ≡ 0 is correct, it suﬃces to show that ̇  ≤ −
If   0 then  = 1 and ̇ = 0. If  = 0, then       so  and ∗ are
increasing, and  is decreasing. Since  =   0 (∗ ) it follows that ̇  0
  If   0 and  ≥   then for ̂ =  and ̂ = 0 the rest of the solution is as
above.
  For   0 and     solutions can be constructed as follows. Choose any
point (  ) on  with     use (12) with  = 0 to determine ∗  and calculate
 =   0 (∗ )  1 Construct trajectories for (     ) by running the relevant
ODEs in (3) and (10) backward in time, with ̇  = −  0 and  0 (∗ ) =    The
restriction  ≥ 1 limits the length of the extension. The terminal pairs (  ( ))
for the longest extensions define the function 
  Varying the length of the backward extension traces out a one-dimensional fam-
ily of initial conditions (   )  and varying the initial point on  gives a two-
dimensional family. Lower initial values for  on  have higher initial values for
  allowing longer extensions. Hence  is a continuous, decreasing function, with
() → 0 as  ↑  .
  For 0   ≤ ( ) the initial dividend is ̂ = 0 and the transition begins with
̂ =  and   1 The solution follows a constructed trajectory until assets are
exhausted. This occurs while    , and thereafter the solution follows  For
  ( ) the initial dividend is ̂ =  − ( ) and the transition begins with
̂ = ( ) and  = 1     ¥


                                             29
  Proof of Proposition 2: For the first claim it suﬃces to show that ̂  0
implies ̂ = 0 Fix ̂ and suppose ̂  0
  If ( + )( + ) = 0 for  ∈ (0 ∆)  then ̇( + )  0 which implies    (̂ )
In this region  lies below (·; ̂ ) so  ( + ) ≡ 1 and consequently ( + ) ≡ 0
Hence the solution requires ̂ = 0
  If ( + )( + )  0 for  ∈ (0 ∆)  then the second and third lines in (9) hold
with equality over (  + ∆)  Diﬀerentiate them to get two equations involving ̇

                                   ̇   ̇ 00 ̇
                                       =     + 0 
                                           
                                  ̇    ̇      00 ̇
                                       =     + 0         
                                         − 

By hypothesis   0 so the third line in (10) holds with equality, and if   0 the
second line also holds with equality, so

                             ( + ) 0 − (1 − ̂ )  0 = 00 ̇                     (13)

                                          [ 0 − ] = 00 ̇

                                   0 +  = (1 − ̂ )  0

and hence
                                                          
                                  (1 − ̂ )  0 =  0 +  
                                                          
Suppose this condition holds at  . It continues to hold on (  + ∆) if and only if
                                             h         ³ 0  ´i
                          (1 − ̂ )  00 ̇ =  00 +     −     ̇                  (14)
                                                            

The term in brackets on the right is positive, and the second line in (13) implies
̇ ≥ 0 Since  00  0 (14) holds only if ̇ ≤ 0 which implies    (̂ ) The rest of
the argument is as before.
  The same argument shows that ()  0 implies () = 0 for any   


                                              30
     Finally, suppose ̂ ≥   and let  0 denote the solution for ̂ = 0 For ̂  0
increasing the dividend by ∆̂ = ̂ and using  0 for the rest of the solution satisfies
all of the conditions for an optimum.            ¥

     Proof of Proposition 3: (a) Suppose ̂ = ̂ = 0 The solution for the option
model coincides with the solution to the benchmark model if and only if ̇  ≤ 
all 
     In the region where   1 we have   0 and

                                       =  [ −  0 ] 

so
                                   ̇   ̇ 00 ̇
                                       =    + 0 0      
                                            − 
In this region ̇  0 and ̇  0 Since the investment intensity  is determined by
the cash flow constraint, ̇  0 and the required condition may fail if the growth in
intensity is rapid. Define 0 as the threshold below which ̇    on 
     In the region where   0 and  = 1

                          =  0 () − ()        and        0 () =  

Hence
                                       ̇ = 00 ̇ = ̇ 

so the required condition holds if      It also holds in some region above    but
may fail for  suﬃciently large. It may also fail in the region where  = 0 Define
 as the threshold above which ̇    on 
     (b) Solutions with ̂  0 can be constructed as follows. Choose   0 let
(  ) = (  0 0), and let (     ) be the associated costate values on the SM.
Construct the solution for (     ) by running the ODEs

                               ̇ =  −                                            (15)

  (c) If ̂  0 then the solution in Proposition 1 is also a solution for the option

( + ∆) ≥ 0  This happens if ̂ is not too far below 0  Otherwise, the firm is still

above.    ¥

  Proof of Proposition 4: Suppose to the contrary that for any ∆  0 the
optimal policy has ()()  0, all  ∈ [ −∆  ) Consider the following perturbation
to the conjectured solution over ( − ∆  + ∆)  where ∆  0 is small. Reduce the
flow of projects by   0 over ( − ∆  ) and accumulate the projects and cash. For
  0 suﬃciently small, this is feasible. Then increase the flow of projects by  over
(  + ∆)  and adjust the intensity on an additional group of projects of size  For
each ̂  choose the intensity for this group of 2 projects as follows.
  Let ( ) denote the intensity on ( − ∆  ) and let  (̂ ) denote the intensity on
(  + ∆)  conditional on ̂  Since ∆ is small, these intensities are approximately
constant before and after  , although the latter varies with ̂  For the 2 projects use
the intensity
                                      1
                                        [( ) +  (̂ )] 
                                    (̂ ) =
                                      2
so the capital stock at ( + ∆) is unaltered.
  The perturbation changes the investment cost by

                ∆ (̂ ) = ∆ {2 [ (̂ )] −  [( )] −  [ (̂ )]}       all ̂ 

Since  is strictly convex, ∆ (̂ ) ≤ 0 with equality if and only if  (̂ ) = ( ) Unless
 puts unit mass at a single point, this condition must fail on a set of ̂ ’s with positive
probability. Therefore, unless  puts unit mass on a single point,

                       ≡ E̂ {2 [ (̂ )] −  [( )] −  [ (̂ )]}  0

Since the perturbation reduces the cost of investment, at least weakly, for every ̂ 
and delays the timing of expenditures, it is also feasible in the sense that it can be
financed without any additional liquid assets.

                                                 34
  The cost of the delay is the foregone revenue. The perturbation changes the capital
stock by

                  ∆ ( − )      ≈ − (∆ − ) ( )          ∈ (0 ∆) 

                  ∆ ( + ; ̂ ) ≈ −∆( ) +  [2 (̂ ) −  (̂ )]

                                  = − (∆ − ) ( )          ∈ (0 ∆) 

where the changes after  are conditional on ̂  Hence the change in revenue is

                   ≈ −2 (1 − ̂ )  ( )     (∆ − )
                                              0
                    = −∆2 (1 − ̂ )  0 ( )

The reduction in revenue is of order ∆2  while the reduction in investment costs is
of order ∆ As noted above,   0 Hence for ∆  0 suﬃciently small,

                    E̂ [∆Π (̂ ) − ∆ (̂ )] ≈ ∆ [−∆ 0 ( ) − ]  0

and the perturbation raises expected profits. ¥

A deterministic tax cut with delay

  To construct an example where a deterministic tax change produces delay, suppose
 is approximately linear in the relevant region, let   0 be close to zero, and let
 ≈  Let  = 1, and suppose the marginal cost of investment is piecewise linear,
with  0 () = 1  for 0   ≤ 1 and 0 () = 2  for   1 with 2  1 = 1
  We will compare the strategy of investing at the intensity  = 1 on [0 ]  for some
0     with the strategy of accumulating projects and cash and carrying out
the same investment at  If the firm invests at the rate  = 1 over [0 ]  then the
increment to its capital stock over [0 ] is approximately

The three conditions in (20) determine (∗  ∗  ∗ )  Let ∗ () denote the SS as a

  Proof of Proposition 5: (a) For  = 0 the first line in (20) requires  ∗ =

Hence ∗ (0) = [ ( ) 0 0] 
  Consider the term in braces on the left in the first line of (20),

If  = 0, then the first line also holds for   0
  Otherwise, since  is strictly convex and  is strictly concave, an increase in ∗
increases the RHS of the first line and decreases the LHS. Thus, if   0 an increase
in  ∗ is needed to restore equality for small   0 If   0 then by the same
reasoning, a decrease in ∗ is needed to restore equality. In both cases the second

and third lines continue to hold for   0 suﬃciently small. Hence, in these cases
∗ () = [  ( ) + () 0 0]  where () has the sign of 
  (b) Choose  large, and suppose to the contrary that ∗ = 0 or ∗ = 0 or both.
Consider the initial condition 0 = ∗ () and consider the following perturbation to

  Let ∗ denote the SS intensity, and choose  ∆  0 small. Over (0 ∆)  reduce the

stock of  = ∆(∗ ) liquid assets. Over ∆ e reduce the intensity of replacement

  After the tax change arrives, over    + ∆ increase the scale of investment by
 and alter the intensity for an additional  projects as in the proof of Proposition 4,
so the capital stock at e + ∆ is as it would have been under the original plan. Define
 (̂ ) and  (̂ ) as in the proof of Prop. 4. Conditional on the new tax rate ̂  the
perturbation to the investment cost is

                 ∆ (̂ ) = ∆ {2 [ (̂ )] − (∗ ) −  [ (̂ )]}     all ̂ 

As shown in the proof of Prop. 4, ∆ (̂ ) ≤ 0 with equality if and only if  (̂ ) = ∗ 
Therefore, unless  puts unit mass on a single point,

The first three terms are positive, and the last is negative. But as  grows without

                APPENDIX B: COMPUTATIONAL METHOD

  This Appendix describes the computational method for the example.
  1. Preliminary: Choose the three tax rates, and construct the stable manifolds
( ) for  = 0        including values for the costate   Choose an initial capital
stock 0 ≤  (0 ) and probabilities    , for the two post-reform tax rates.
  2. Before  acquiring projects and liquid assets: Choose  not too large,
and conjecture that () = 0 on (0  )  Then

                                 = 0 −          = 

Since    the firm does not pay a dividend while it holds liquid assets. Thus, for
some date  ∈ (0  )  all earnings are paid as dividends before , and all are retained
after . Given  the stock of liquid assets and its costate at  are
                                      Z 
                                            ¡      ¢
                     = (1 − 0 )         0 − ( −)   0

                       =                    1

Thus, increasing  reduces both  and   An iterative procedure determines 
  Conjecture that the tax rates ̂ =   and ̂ =   lie in Regions A and B of Figure
2, respectively. In Region B the firm has excess liquid assets, which are paid out as
a discrete dividend at  Hence in this region ̂ (  ) = 1 In Region A the firm is
cash-constrained and ̂ (  )  1
  3. The solution for ̂ =   : In Region A the stock of liquid assets is exhausted by
the DA, but some projects remain. The solution is constructed by backward shooting.
                                  ¡       ¢
Choose a candidate terminal point ∆  ∆ on (  ) and a candidate value ∆  0

                     ¡      ¢

The endpoint from this exercise is a candidate for the post-DA state ̂  ̂  Let
̂ be the investment intensity at this point, and let ̂ =  − ̂ . Check whether the
DA is consistent with these values, whether

                        ̂ −  = ̂̂       and       = ̂(̂)
                          ¡        ¢
Adjust the candidate point ∆  ∆ on (  ) and the time interval ∆ until both
conditions are satisfied.
  To verify that  satisfies the first line of (9) and the second line of (10), note
that with time running forward,  is rising and  is falling, so  is rising. Hence
 =   0 () is falling, so ̇    −  In addition, since  ≥ 1 on (  ) it
follows that  ≥ 1 on all of (  + ∆ ) 
  The rest of the transition to the new steady state follows the stable manifold
(  )
  4. The solution for ̂ =   : In Region B the stock of projects is exhausted
by the DA. Let  (;   ) denote the investment intensity on (  ) given the
capital stock . Since the intensity does not jump after the DA, choose the intensity
̂ satisfying
                                 ̂ =  ( +  ̂;   )

                                             41
Since  is decreasing in its first argument, there is a unique solution. The stock
of liquid assets at  must finance this investment, which requires  ≥  (̂) The
remaining liquid assets are paid out as a discrete dividend at  .
  After the DA, the rest of the transition to the new steady state follows the stable
manifold (  )
  5. Iterating to find : Under the conjecture that   and   lie in Regions A and
B of Figure 2, ̂ (  )  1 and ̂ (  ) = 1 A larger initial stock of liquid assets 
reduces ̂ (  ) so E̂ [̂ ] is a decreasing function of   Hence E̂ [̂ ] increasing in
 while  is decreasing in  and there is at most one value for which E̂ [̂ ] =  
If no solution exists, the conjecture that () = 0 on (0  ) is incorrect, and a smaller
value for  is needed, or else the conjecture that   lies in Region A is incorrect.
  6. The costates before  : The post-DA costates ̂ (̂ ) and ̂ (̂ ) are known,
for ̂ =       Use (6) to determine  and   and then use the laws of motion in
(10), running backward, to construct solutions over (0  ) 
