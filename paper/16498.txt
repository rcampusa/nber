Dynamic Labor Demand in China: Public and Private Objectives

This paper studies dynamic labor demand by private and public manufacturing plants in China. It contributes
along two dimensions. First, it uncovers the objectives of public enterprises and compares them to
private enterprises. Second, it estimates adjustment costs of these plants and thus their (dynamic) labor
demand. One of our principal findings is that public plants maximize the discounted present value
of profits without a soft-budget constraint. There is strong evidence of both quadratic and linear firing
costs at the plant level. Costs of adjusting hours are small and lower for private compared to public
plants. The private plants operate with considerably lower quadratic adjustment costs. The higher quadratic
adjustment costs of the public plants may reflect their internalization of social costs of employment
adjustment. Domestic private plants and collective plants have about the same discount factor, much
lower than state controlled plants.

1         Motivation
Any analysis of the effects of government policy, such as labor market interventions, trade
policy, environment reforms, must predict the response of private households and firms. For
some economies, like China and many European countries, the presence of a large public
sector adds another dimension: predicting the effects of policy on public firms.
        In the absence of a large public sector, many analyses solve constrained optimization
problems for agents and use the resulting policy functions as inputs into forecasting policy
effects. The natural extension of this methodology is to do the same for public firms: use
the solution of a constrained optimization problem to predict responses to policy interven-
tions. While it is natural to use utility and profit maximization as the objectives of private
households and firms respectively, what are the objectives and constraints of public firms?
Answering that question is one goal of this paper.
        The paper contributes to the broad literature linking ownership to performance. In our
analysis, ownership varies between public plants and private plants. The private plants are
assumed to be profit maximizing, facing costs of adjusting labor. The public firms maximize
a more flexible objective and may face constraints different from the private plants. Our
results are best interpreted as comparative: how does the behavior of the public plants differ
from the private ones?
        Historically, the nature of public firms in China was distinct from those in capitalist
countries. In the US and other countries with free markets, public firms arose either be-
cause of natural monopoly, like electric utility and telegraph industries, or because of the
need to provide public goods. The former sectors are under rate-of-return regulation and
the objective of public firms under this regulatory constraint has been tested empirically.
For instance, using the operation data of utility firms in the US between 1965 and 1970,
Pescatrice and Trapani (1980) show that public utilities behave as cost minimizers with zero
profit. Meanwhile, the public good sectors are commonly under output price control and
are subsidized by the government. The objective of these public firms is mainly to provide
community benefits.
        Prior to the economic reform, the public firms in China dominated the economy, account-
ing for over 95 percentage of total industrial output.1 The public firms acted more like public

good providers. These public firms, especially the medium and large-sized ones, established
a resident community or small society providing all kinds of social services and facilities to
its community members. The public firms had multiple objectives including expansion of
social employment, and provision of various social services and securities, such as housing,
education, hospital care, health insurance, and pensions. In the middle of 1990s, about half
of industrial public firms were unprofitable.
       China’s state-sector reforms began in the 1990s, aiming at increasing the efficiency of
public firms and promoting economic growth. The reforms broke the lifetime employment
system, the so-called ‘iron rice bowl’, encouraging labor mobility. Over the past two decades,
the labor market has been transformed to an increasingly market-driven system. The re-
forms changed the incentive system, allowing firm autonomy and linking managerial pay and
promotion to firm’s profit. The public firms have been pushed into the market place to either
compete or go bankrupt. Private firms, including foreign firms and joint-ventured firms, have
developed rapidly and have contributed more than 60 percentage to China’s total industrial
output since 2002.2 As competition among firms increases and the transformation toward
a market oriented system has occurred, one might expect that the difference in behavior
among public firms and private firms would narrow.
       With our question and this background in mind, this paper studies dynamic labor demand
for private and public manufacturing plants in China.3 To do so, we estimate the costs of
labor adjustment and the objectives of private and public plants using a simulated method
of moments (SMM) approach. The idea is to use key moments of labor input, output and
productivity at the plant level to infer the parameters of the dynamic optimization problems.
Our approach is to specify a couple of alternative objectives and determine which one better
matches pertinent data facts.4 One contribution of this paper is to use the SMM methodology
to infer the objectives of the public plants.
       In looking at the behavior of private and public plants, there are some striking similarities.
First, the public plants, like the private plants, appear to be maximizing the discounted
expected value of profits. Importantly, labor demand is not a static decision: adjustment

       As discussed in section 3, a public plant is determined by share holdings rather than registration. Public
plants are then decomposed into state controlled and collectively controlled plants.
   4
     A similar approach underlies Gowrisankaran and Town (1997) who study the behavior of not-for-profit
hospitals, and estimate an objective function which includes both profits and quality.

costs are present and imply forward looking behavior by plants. Second, the best fitting
model entails a non-convex firing cost along with linear and quadratic adjustment costs.
        However, there are some notable differences. The estimated quadratic adjustment costs
are much larger for the public plants, perhaps reflecting an internalized gain to employment
stability. The cost of adjusting hours is also higher for the public plants. Finally, private
plants discount future slightly more than public plants, but domestic private and collective
plants have about the same discount factor, much lower than state controlled plants.
        In terms of the objective of the public plants, they are best described as profit maximizers
with an added quadratic cost of employment adjustment. We allow public plants to operate
under a soft budget constraint where profits are non-negative. This does not improve the fit
of the model.



2         Dynamic Optimization Problem
This section discusses the dynamic optimization problems for the private and public plants.
The generic dynamic optimization problem is


                             V (A, e−1 ) = max Γ(A, e, h, e−1 ) + βEA0 |A V (A0 , e)            (1)
                                             h,e

for all (A, e−1 ). Employment adjustment is assumed to be completed within a period. The
function V (A, e−1 ) is the value function of a plant continuing in operation.5 The state vector
contains two elements: A is the stochastic profitability of the plant and e−1 is the stock of
workers in the previous period. The control variables are the hours worked per worker, h,
and the number of workers for the current period, e.
        The function Γ(A, e, h, e−1 ) represents the current payoff to the plant. Imbedded in this
function are the adjustment costs as well as the objective function. Ultimately, the differences
in adjustment costs between private and public plants are captured by this function.
        While there is no physical capital, it is important to be clear the sense in which this is
not a static optimization problem. With costs of adjusting labor, the stock of workers at the
start of a period is a state variable for a plant. Hires and fires made during the period are
reflected in the value of the state variable in the next period. Unlike capital, this dependence
    5
        At this stage, we do not consider entry and exit decisions.

over time is not due to time-to-build: labor hired in a period are used in that period. Rather,
the dynamics come solely from the presence of adjustment costs.
       Given that this is an intertemporal decision, the discount factor, β, will indeed play an
important role in determining the response of firms to variations in the profitability of their
operations. To the extent public and private firms discount at different rates, their behavior
will differ.
       In solving (1), the plant takes as given the cost of inputs, principally labor. Thus we
view the labor market as a spot market. Once the profitability of a plant is observed, it
is able to hire labor, on both the extensive and intensive margins, as needed. The model
abstracts from ex ante contracts that might arise between firms and workers as well as search
frictions. As presented in Cooper, Haltiwanger, and Willis (2007), the frictions we identify
here as hiring and firing costs can be included in a search and contracting model of the labor
market.


2.1        Private Plants
The generic model in (1) can be tailored to study privately-owned profit maximizing plants.
The objective function for a privately-owned plant is

                        Γ(A, e, h, e−1 ) = R(A, e, h) − ω(e, h) − C (A, e−1 , e, h) .                    (2)

Here R(A, e, h) is the revenue flow of a plant employing e workers, each working h hours in
profitability state A. The revenue function has the form


                                            R(A, e, h) = A(eh)α .                                        (3)

This revenue function is the product of a production function, defined over the total labor
input eh, and the demand curve facing the plant. The parameter α captures the curvature
of the production process along with the elasticity of demand. Other factors of production,
which are assumed not to entail any adjustment costs, are chosen optimally as well but are
implicit in revenue and thus in the optimization problem.6
   6
       That is, one can think of R(A, e, h) as the revenue obtained less the costs of the other inputs. Since
the quantities of those other inputs are dependent on (A, e, h), the R(A, e, h) captures these choices. The
functional form in (3) can be derived from a plant optimization problem over flexible factors with a constant
returns to scale technology and a constant elasticity demand curve for plant output.

                                                       5

       The function ω(e, h) in (2) is total compensation paid to the e workers each working h
hours. The compensation function takes the form

                                         ω(e, h) = e(ω0 + ω1 hζ ).                                      (4)

The parameters characterizing this function will be part of our estimation.
       The cost of adjusting the stock of workers is given by C (A, e−1 , e, h). A general cost of
adjustment function is:

if there is job destruction e < e−1 . If e = e−1 , so there are no net changes in employment,
then C (A, e−1 , e, h) ≡ 0.
       There are three forms of adjustment costs, with differences allowed for the job creation
and job destruction margins. The first is a quadratic adjustment cost, parameterized by
ν. A second, parameterized by F , is a fixed cost of adjusting the work force.7 In general,
these costs can vary depending on whether the plant is creating or destroying jobs. Finally,
we allow linear adjustment costs, parameterized by γ to capture, for example, severance
payments to workers.
       In addition to the differences in adjustment costs of hiring and firing workers, this study
adds another feature: the use of thresholds for the non-convex adjustment costs. So, as a
leading example, the fixed cost of firing (F − ) may apply only if the job destruction rate ex-
ceeds a bound. Through this modification of (6), we are able to capture certain institutional
features that may generate nonlinearities in adjustment costs.
       The optimization generates choices along a couple of dimensions. First there is the
discrete choices of job creation, job destruction or inaction. The latter is an important
option given plant-level observations of no net employment changes. Second, there is the
   7
       In previous work on labor adjustment, Cooper, Haltiwanger, and Willis (2004) found evidence in U.S.
plants in favor of an opportunity cost model relative to the fixed cost form of non-convex adjustment costs.
There was no evidence in favor of this form of adjustment cost in the Chinese data and it was dropped from
consideration in what follows.


                                                      6

continuous choice of job creation (destruction). If the job creation (destruction) rates exceed
the threshold, additional non-convex adjustment costs might apply. Third, there is the
adjustment of hours. Variations in hours will reflect both the state of profitability and the
choices on the extensive and intensive employment margins.


2.2        Public Plants
The dynamic optimization problem for a public plant is potentially different from (1). The
key difference is in the objective function of the public plant which might reflect social objec-
tives. Of course, the public plants are not operated directly by the government. Operational
decisions are made by managers who may also have aspirations for promotion within the
structure of state controlled enterprises or even in the private sector. The objective function
for the plant reflects the desires of the government insofar as the manager is motivated to
pursue these goals.
       In general, the current payoff of the public plant is given by:

                                     Γ(A, e, h, e−1 ) + S(A, e, h, e−1 ).                                (7)

Here Γ(A, e, h, e−1 ) is the same as in (2). Profits are included both because a public firm
could be interested in maximizing profit per se and also because tax revenues flow to state
and local governments.8 Further, a manager wishing to signal ability to the market could
gain through higher profits.9
       The second term in the objective function, S(A, e, h, e−1 ), covers objectives of the public
plant beyond profit maximization. A public plant undergoing mass job destruction will
impose big social pressure on governments and government officials at all levels. For example,
by 2009, in most governments, as well as in important organizations and enterprises, an
“Office of Social Stability” has been established to evaluate, resolve, and monitor social
unrest, big criminal events, and terrorism. To the extent these events are triggered by
employment adjustment, they are captured in our objective.
   8
       Lee (2009) discusses the review of managers at public enterprises which includes an assessment of how
well the firm is achieving the goals of the state as laid out in the overarching five-year plan and industry-
specific development plans.
   9
     Groves, Hong, McMillan, and Naughton (1995) discusses incentives for profit maximization by managers
in public plants in the 1980s.



                                                      7
                                                       2 DYNAMIC OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM


       We consider a couple of models of S(A, e, h, e−1 ). The first, termed the “employment
stabilizer”, asserts that the public plant is interested in employment stability. Thus there
is an additional cost, beyond the adjustment cost already included in Γ(A, e, h, e−1 ), of
employment variability. In this case,
                                                                         2
                                                      νS
                                                           
                                                               e − e−1
                                 S(A, e, h, e−1 ) = −                         e−1 .                     (8)
                                                       2         e−1
In this specification, the cost of employment adjustment is parameterized by ν S . This term
is exactly like the quadratic adjustment cost term already included in Γ(A, e, h, e−1 ) through
C(A, e, e−1 ). Hence the quadratic cost of adjustment for a public plant is straightforward to
estimate and compare to the adjustment costs for private plants.
       A second model, termed the “job creator” adds a benefit of job creation to the public
plant’s objective function and penalizes the public plant for job losses. In this case,


                                           S(A, e, h, e−1 ) = F̃ +                                      (9)

when e > e−1 and
                                          S(A, e, h, e−1 ) = −F̃ −                                     (10)

when e < e−1 . If there are gains to job creation and costs to destruction, we would expect:
F̃ + > 0 along with F̃ − > 0.
       In many descriptions of public plants, the theme of a “soft budget constraint”, hereafter
SBC, arises. One interpretation of this is that by following other objectives, imbedded in
S(·), the public plant may in fact operate in an non-profitable fashion.10 In that case, the
government may provide a subsidy.
       We model this by assuming that the first term in the objective function (1) is given by


                       Γ̃(A, e, h, e−1 ) = max{0, Γ(A, e, h, e−1 ) + S(A, e, h, e−1 )}                 (11)

where Γ(A, e, h, e−1 ) is defined in (2). With this subsidization, the public plant can un-
dertake other objectives, such as employment stability, without incurring sustained losses.
Further, under this objective, the public plant has no incentive to shut down temporarily
  10
       This draws upon the discussion of soft budget constraints in Lin and Li (2008). In that analysis, the
state imposes a “policy burden” on a public plant, such as employment stability, and must support the
public plant in order for it to remain in operation.

or even permanently. Without a SBC, a public plant with extremely low profitability may
choose to close temporarily, and perhaps retain its workers but not paying them. With this
subsidization, a public plant with very low profitability may still produce and pay its workers
at least a base wage.
       Our approach is to estimate the parameters for these specifications of the public plant
objective. We use the estimates from the profit maximizing plants to create a baseline and
to attribute public plant patterns of dynamic labor demand that differ from those of private
profit maximizing plants to these difference in objectives.
       As with the private plants, we assume that the public plant takes as given the cost of
labor. The estimation will uncover a compensation function for public plants that differs
from that of the private plants.



3        Data
The data are from Annual Surveys of Industrial Production (1998-2007), conducted by the
                                                          11
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of China.                  The raw data consist of all private plants
with more than five million Yuan in revenue (about $700,000) and all public plants.12
       The number of plants in the survey increased from over 160,000 in 1998 to above 330,000
in 2007. Since there are numerous mergers, acquisitions, entry and exit, and public-to-private
transformations in the earlier years of the survey, we focus on a balanced panel of plants
excluded from the above changes and in operation during the period 2005-2007.13 We choose
to study three years of data to smooth away year-over-year aggregate fluctuations. Indeed,
the moments we use for the period 2005-2006 do not differ systematically from those for the
period 2006-2007. Another reason to look at the data after 2005 is the presence of numerous
macroeconomic policies undertaken in 2004 to prevent the overheating of the economy.
  11
       Each observation in the raw data has a unique physical address. For example, in 2006, 17 observations
in 17 different locations, share the brand name of one of the biggest dairy product makers, Mengniu. Brandt,
Biesebroeck, and Zhang (2012) study productivity at the firm level over the 1998-2006 period. The data are
similar though since they note that about 95% of the firms own a single plant.
  12
     The five million Yuan threshold is not a “hard rule”. About 5% of the private plants in the sample have
revenue below this threshold. From Brandt, Biesebroeck, and Zhang (2012), the cut-off on private plants of
five million Yuan in revenues is likely to eliminate less than 1% of the private plants.

       The classification of the plants as public or private is an important element in our anal-
ysis. The Annual Surveys of Industrial Production has two variables defining whether an
enterprise is public or private. One is “enterprise type”, representing state-owned, collective,
domestic private, joint venture, and foreign (including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) pri-
vate enterprises. State-owned means the enterprise is owned by all the people in the country,
while collective means the enterprise is owned by a group of local people. According to the
Chinese constitution, both state-owned and collective enterprises are classified as public. An
enterprise is termed as a joint venture if part of its shares is owned by foreign investors
or companies, no matter how big the fraction is. Enterprise type is how an enterprise is
registered with the Administration of Business and Commerce, as well the Administration
of Taxation. It does not have any information on who among shareholders makes deci-
sions.14 The decision maker of a joint venture can be either public shareholders or private
shareholders.
       The other variable is “control of shares”, representing state controlled (SCE), collectively
controlled, domestically privately controlled, and foreign (including Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan) privately controlled enterprises. “Control” means holding over 50% of total shares,
or being pivotal in decision making if not holding over 50% of total shares. By this standard,
a joint venture is public if it is state controlled or collectively controlled, even if it is not
registered as a state-owned or collective enterprise according to the enterprise type criterion.
For example, Volkswagen, Ford, and Honda in mainland China are all state controlled en-
terprises, registered as private joint ventures. There are also a large fraction of enterprises
that are registered as collective but are controlled by domestic private shareholders.
       To make a clear distinction between public and private, we rely on the variable control
of shares to determine the type of an enterprise. To deal with outliers, we remove the top
and bottom 2.5% of the plants, by employment size. This trimmed sample is the basis of
our analysis. In the balanced panel, there are 12,432 state-controlled enterprises and 13,893
collectively-controlled enterprises, both classified as public. Our private category consists
of 115,581 domestically privately controlled enterprises and 32,809 foreign (including Hong
  14
       Before January 2008 when China began to adopt the unified tax scheme, foreign companies were enjoying
preferential corporate tax rates compared to domestic companies, and companies may be inclined to be
registered as ”foreign” for tax avoidance consideration. Thus ”ownership type” may not reflect actual
decision-making. See: http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90778/90860/7216695.html.

       Table 1 summarizes capital (Ca.), employment (number of workers employed, denoted as
Emp., revenue (Rev.), and value-added (Va.) by enterprise type for the 2005-2007 period.15
All nominal terms are deflated to thousand Yuan in 2005. Capital (plant and equipment) is
calculated by the book value of fixed capital net of depreciation. Hours information is not
available.
       About 85% of the sample consists of private plants, most of them are domestic not
foreign owned. Of the public plants, about 47% are SCE. Of the four types of plants, the
SCE are the largest in terms of value-added, employment and capital. On these measures
the collective plants lie between the foreign plants and domestic ones. The SCE plants are
also considerably more capital intensive on average.
       In terms of average revenue per worker, the SCE public plants and the foreign private
plants are more productive than the other types of plants on average. In terms of average
revenue per unit of capital, the collective public plants are the most productive, while the
large SCE have the lowest revenue per capital ratio. These statement mirror the high capital
intensity of the SCE compared to other plants.



4        Quantitative Analysis
We first obtain reduced form estimates of the curvature of the revenue function, (3), and
the properties of the profitability shock from data on labor input and revenues. These are
then used as moments to estimate the structural curvature of the revenue function, the serial
correlation of the shock and the standard deviation of the profitability shock as part of a
simulated method of moments approach. The adjustment cost parameters are estimated in
this second stage as well.


4.1       Parameter Estimates of Revenue Function
Using data on revenues and the labor input at the plant level for the trimmed sample, we can
obtain an OLS estimate of α from Rit = Ait Lαit , where Lit is the total labor input at plant i
  15
       Because the Annual Surveys of Industrial Production is a census conducted by the NBS and not by
the Administration of Taxation, we believe the information reported is unlikely to be contaminated by tax
evasion incentives.

The standard deviation of the innovation to this process is denoted σ.

 The dependent variable is the log of revenue and the independent variable is the log of employment. Here
 α̂ is the estimated coefficient on log employment, ρ̂ is the estimated serial correlation of the profitability
 shock and σ̂ is the standard deviation of the profitability shock. Other regressors were year, location and
 industry to remove heterogeneity from the estimates. Standard errors are reported below the estimates.



       The results of this part of the estimation, summarized in Table 2, reveal a couple of key
points. First, the curvature of the revenue functions are both less than one. A curvature
less than one is interpreted either as reflecting market power or diminishing returns to scale.
Second, though the profitability shocks are highly serially correlated for both types of plants,
the processes are stationary. Given the costs of hiring and firing workers, the serial correlation
of these shocks is important for the choice between adjusting hours and the number of workers
in response to variations in profitability.
       As is well understood, these OLS reduced estimates are biased due to endogenous factor
inputs. In our application, this problem is magnified by the unobserveability of hours. For
different values of the adjustment costs for workers and hours, the covariance of hours with
both the profitability shocks and employment will vary.
       Consequently, in the following analysis, the OLS reduced form estimates, (α̂, ρ̂, σ̂), are
moments to estimate the structural parameters of the revenue function and the shock process
in a simulated method of moments routine. By including the estimation of (α, ρ, σ) in the
moments estimation, we allow an interaction between these parameter estimates and the
adjustment costs for both workers and hours.16 Thus, this approach will help to overcome
  16
       To be clear, the notation distinguishes the OLS estimates from the structural parameters. For example,
α̂ is the OLS estimate of the curvature of the revenue function. The structural parameter is denoted α.

the problem of hours not being observed and thus concerns that reduced form estimates are
not uncovering structural parameters.


4.2        SMM Estimation Approach
The parameters are estimated via SMM. This approach finds the vector of structural param-
eters, denoted Θ, to minimize the weighted difference between simulated and actual data
moments: The estimation procedure solves minΘ £(Θ) where

                               £(Θ) ≡ (M d − M s (Θ))W (M d − M s (Θ))0 .                               (12)

The weighting matrix, W , is obtained by inverting an estimate of the variance/covariance
matrix obtained from bootstrapping the data 1000 times. The resulting estimator is consis-
tent.17
       In this expression, M d are the data moments and M s (Θ) are the simulation counterparts.
The moments are listed as the columns in Table 4. The std(r/e) is the standard deviation
of the log of revenue per worker. The moment sc is the serial correlation in the log of
employment. The distribution of the job creation (JC) and job destruction (JD) as well as the
inaction rate (zero net employment change) summarize the employment growth distribution.
These are averages across plants and years, weighted by employment. The inaction rate of
nearly 40% for the private plants and 28% for the public plants motivates the inclusion of
non-convex adjustment costs. The OLS estimates of (α̂, ρ̂, σ̂) are contained in the set of
moments.
       The data moments are from the Annual Surveys of Industrial Production described above.
These moments are annual averages over the 2005-2007 period. These moments do not
change very much across years implying that we are matching the cross sectional variation
in the data. This is appropriate as our model contains cross sectional differences rather than
time series variation.
       The simulated moments are obtained by solving the dynamic programming problem in
(1) for a given value of Θ. The resulting decision rules are used to to simulate a panel data
set. The simulated moments are calculated from that data set.18
  17
       See, for example, the discussion and references in Adda and Cooper (2003).
  18
       The simulated panel has 350 time periods and 400 plants. As the process is ergodic (after dropping the
first 50 periods), the simulated microeconomic moments are determined by the total observations.


                                                      14

       The parameters estimated by SMM are Θ ≡ (ζ, ν, F + , F − , γ + , γ − , β, α, ρ, σ). Note that
we impose symmetry between the quadratic costs of hiring and firing. With the inclusion of
linear hiring and firing costs, asymmetries in the quadratic costs, which will provide another
source for inaction, will be very difficult to identify.
       The moments, listed at the top of Table 4, were selected in part because they are infor-
mative about these underlying parameters. Roughly speaking, the curvature of the compen-
sation function is identified from the standard deviation of the log of revenue per worker.19
An increase in ζ will lead to a larger variation in employment relative to hours and thus a
reduction in this moment. The quadratic adjustment cost parameter, ν, is identified largely
from variations in the serial correlation of employment and from the prevalence of employ-
ment adjustments in the 10% range. The distribution of employment changes, particularly
the inaction and the large adjustments, act to pin down the non-convex adjustment costs.
Finally, variations in β influence all the moments, particularly the standard deviation of the
log of revenue per worker. When, for example, β is low, the future gains from employment
adjustment are more heavily discounted and so the plant relies more on hours adjustment.
       The fixed and linear adjustment costs provide a basis for inaction as well as the large
values of job creation and destruction. As noted earlier, we estimate a critical level of job
destruction such that the fixed cost applies only when job changes exceed this bound. As the
estimate of this bound is not zero, the linear adjustment costs are responsible for the inaction.
Importantly, with these linear costs rather than the fixed cost explaining the inaction, it is
possible to also obtain small values of job creation and destruction, as in the data. To be
more precise, the difference in the linear costs of hiring and firing produce inaction. If instead
the inaction was produced by a fixed cost, the model would not generate small employment
adjustment.
       As noted earlier, the curvature of the revenue function, α̂, as well as the estimated per-
sistence of the profitability shock, ρ̂, from the OLS estimation are included in the moments.
These are informative about the structural curvature of the revenue function as well as the
serial correlation of the shocks. The standard deviation of the profitability shocks, σ̂, is
included in the moments to help identify σ.
       Relative to others studies, our approach is more flexible in that we allow for asymmetric
adjustment costs and, as just noted, allow for the non-convex costs to apply only after critical
  19
       We do not have direct information on hours in the data set.

levels of employment adjustment. Further, our study includes the estimation of the discount
factor, which is potentially different between public and private plants.
    Two parameters of the compensation function, (ω0 , ω1 ) are set in the estimation to guar-
antee the model matches median plant size and 40 hours per week in steady state. Through
this calibration we set the state space for the problem in accord with the data.



5     Private Plants
This section provides the results from our estimation. It also includes discussion of sensitivity
of our results as well as other implications.


5.1    Parameter Estimates
Results for private plants are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. The first table presents pa-
rameter estimates and the second contains the moments for employment and the revenue
function (including the shock process) respectively. The rows refer to the entire (trimmed)
sample of plants and then a split between domestic and foreign privately controlled plants,
as defined earlier.
    The structural parameter estimates are given in Table 3. In reading this table, the
                      +                                              −
parameters with a         refer to hiring costs and those with a         are firing costs. The standard

errors are reported in parentheses.20
       For the sample of all private plants, the most important employment adjustment cost is
the linear firing cost, γ − . The fixed cost of hiring is zero and the fixed firing cost is very
small.21 The linear cost of hiring is actually negative, though also quite small, indicating a
tiny gain to hiring. One interpretation is that this is capturing some type of political credit
for private job creation.
       As noted earlier, part of the estimation included a level of job destruction before incurring
the fixed firing cost. The motivation was to consider some of the institutional ramifications
of large job destruction rates. These might range from the need to justify these adjustments
to government authorities, labor unrest in response to large firings and future effects on
government regulation from large job destruction rates.22
       In our estimation, we experimented with a number of critical values, ranging from 0 to
25% job destruction rate. The results reported here are for a 5% critical job destruction
value which fits the all of the private data best.23 For the domestic and foreign private
plants, the fit was slightly better at 10%.
       The linear adjustment cost is estimated to be 0.142 which is about 17% of average annual
compensation per worker. Since the fixed cost is small and only applies for job destruction
in excess of 5%, the linear cost is important for obtaining inaction in adjustment since the
adjustment cost function is not differentiable at zero net employment growth. There is also a
cost of adjusting hours as ζ = 1.07 that is near the typical estimate for US plants.24 Finally,
the model allows for some quadratic adjustment cost but the estimate of ν is very small.
       As noted earlier, one important feature of our estimation is that we include estimates of
the discount factor. The estimate of β = 0.93 for the best fitting model implies a marginal
borrowing cost of about 7.5%.
       The curvature of the revenue function is 0.621. This structural estimate is distinct from
  20
       The standard errors are computed using numerical derivatives of the moments with respect to the
parameters combined with the estimated variance-covariance matrix.
  21
     The fixed costs are reported as a fraction of average revenues. The costs incurred relative to revenue
during adjustment states are reported in Table 9.

itemid=363\&catid=9\&subcatid=60\#06 and http://www.solidarity-us.org/current/node/26.
  23
     To be precise, we estimated the model for these different critical values (0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25) and
are reporting the best fitting model.

the reduced form OLS estimate of 0.726 reported in Table 2. The difference between the
structural parameter and the reduced form OLS estimate reflects the endogenous employ-
ment choice and the fact that hours, which covary with employment, are not observed. With
α = 0.621 in the model, the OLS estimate of the curvature of the revenue function, from
Table 4, is 1.011. The estimated serial correlation for the profitability shock of 0.989 is much
higher than the reduced form estimate of 0.874 reported in Table 4.
       The results for the breakdown of the plants into domestic and foreign are not that dif-
ferent with one important exception. The estimated discount factor is larger for the foreign
compared to domestic plants, perhaps reflecting easier access to capital markets. The point
estimates imply a marginal borrowing cost of 5% for foreign controlled private plants against
a marginal borrowing cost of 10.75% for domestic private plants.
       Looking at the moments in Table 4, a couple of key features stand out. First, there is
ample evidence of inaction: in 37% of the plant-year observations, there is zero net employ-
ment change. Second, there is also evidence of large job creation and destruction rates with
about 15% of the observations entailing job creation in excess of 30% and over 5% with
job destruction over 30%. Third, there are also relatively small variations in employment
as indicated by the 20% or so observations of job creation and job destruction rates below
10%. It is precisely these dimensions of employment adjustment that help to identify the
structural parameters.
       The final column in Table 4 reports the fit of the model, divided by 1000. The models are
rejected. This is not surprising given that the moments are very precise and consequently
the weighting matrix has very large values.25 Further, this estimation imposes identical
structural parameters across plants in different sectors. This is a very strong restriction. We
explore below estimation on a sectoral basis.


5.2       Sensitivity
Here we explore the sensitivity of our findings to parameter variations. The goal is to
appreciate how our results change as we vary the estimates of adjustment costs and the
discount factor. For these exercises, the baseline estimation is for all private plants. Table 5
contains our results.

    The rows of the tables indicate the data, the baseline results, followed by three experi-
ments. The first shuts down the quadratic adjustment cost by setting ν = 0. The second
puts all but the linear firing cost to zero. The final row uses the baseline adjustment costs
but sets β = 0.95, a more standard value.
    The effects of the small quadratic adjustment cost is seen by comparing the second and
third rows of the table. Without the quadratic adjustment cost, the dynamic demand for
labor displays more inaction and more adjustments in the tail of the job creation distribution.
Further, the relatively small adjustments between inaction and 10% from the baseline are
gone without the quadratic adjustment cost. The fit without this cost is about 4 times worse
than the baseline.
    Setting the fixed costs to zero, worsens the fit further. Since the fixed firing cost applies
for job destruction greater than 5%, eliminating this cost produces an outcome with only
inaction and large adjustments. The fit with only the linear costs is about 8 times worse than
the baseline. Clearly the quadratic and fixed costs are needed to produce the observations
of intermediate adjustment.
    If β is increased from its baseline value of 0.929 to 0.95, there is a response in the moments
of the employment distribution. In the presence of adjustment costs, changes in the stock
of workers is an intertemporal choice with current as well as future costs and consequences.
Not surprisingly, variations in β influence those choices. From Table 5, an increase in β
reduces inaction and increases the frequency of large job creation and destruction rates. As
employment is more responsive to shocks, the standard deviation of revenue per worker is
lower. The fit of the model worsens by about 6%.



6     Public Plants
The same estimation approach is applied to public plants. But, as discussed earlier, the
parameterization and specification of the objective and constraints is allowed to differ. The
estimation results are presented first, followed by a sensitivity analysis.


6.1     Results
Tables 6 and 7 present results for public plants. The tables include results for all public plants
as well as the state controlled enterprises and collectively controlled enterprises separately.

Notes: The SBC treatment estimates parameters for all public plants allowing a soft budget con-
straint. Standard errors are given in parentheses.


For all public plants, we report results with and without a soft-budget constraint.
   The parameter estimates are reported in Table 6. The first row is for all public plants
and the next rows are for the state controlled enterprises and for the collectively controlled
plants. These estimates were obtained without a soft budget constraint.
   The parameter estimates indicate that the most significant adjustment cost is the linear
firing cost. There is support for a small fixed firing cost as well. The fixed hiring cost
is not significant. This pattern is true for the collectively controlled plants as well. The
SCE sub-sample has no significant adjustment costs other than the quadratic cost, the fixed
firing cost and the linear firing cost. We estimate that the fixed firing cost applies at a job
destruction rate in excess of 10% for all of the public plants as well as the sample splits. In
contrast to the private plants, there are larger quadratic adjustment costs and a larger cost
to hours variation.
   Comparing the collective and state controlled enterprises, a prominent feature is the
difference in the discount factor. The SCE do not discount as much as collective plants. This
is consistent with the view that the SCE are linked to state-owned banks and thus receive
favorable treatment in financial markets. In fact, many SCE are publicly traded. Collective

enterprises, which are largely owned at a more local level, do not have such favorable access,
as reflected in higher borrowing costs.
       Table 7 reports the employment moments for the public plants. These are the same
moments reported for private plants. As with the private plants, there is substantial inaction
in employment adjustment. This is much higher for collectively controlled public plants than
for the SCE, presumably because the collective plants are smaller. As with the private plants,
there is considerable action in the tails of the job creation distribution, with more job creation
in excess of 30% for the collectively controlled enterprises.
       Table 7 also reports the moments for the revenue function and the stochastic process of
the profitability shocks. The (α̂, ρ̂, σ̂) estimates termed “data” come from OLS regressions
on the actual data. The other entries are from OLS regressions run on simulated data.
The curvature of the revenue function is much lower for collective enterprises, though the
structural estimates are close for all types of plants. The serial correlation and standard
deviation of the shocks are about the same across types of public plants.
       The estimated model with the soft-budget constraint (SBC) is in the last row of Table
6. It has a lower cost of hours variation and slightly higher quadratic and linear firing costs.
From Table 7, the model with the soft-budget constraint does not fit the data nearly as
well as the model without this constraint.26 From Table 7 the model with the soft-budget
constraint produces too much inaction.


6.2        Sensitivity
As with the private plants, we explore the sensitivity of our findings on the public plants to
parameter variations, focusing again on the adjustment costs and the discount factor. For
these exercises, the baseline estimation is for all public plants. Table 8 contains our results.
       As we saw with the private plants, removing the quadratic adjustment costs has large
effects on the moments and hence the fit of the model. The inaction rate increases and the
serial correlation of employment falls without the quadratic adjustment cost.
       The model with only linear adjustment costs fits even worse. With only the linear
adjustment costs, the model again produces either inaction or large adjustments. It misses
the small labor adjustments and produces low serial correlation in employment.
  26
       This is also true for the SBC models estimated for the SCE and collectively controlled plants indepen-
dently.

    Finally, the increase of β to 0.95 reduces the fit of the model by about 4%. There are
lower deviations in revenues relative to employment and slightly less inaction caused by this
change in β.. But these effects on the moments are not large and this is reflected in the
standard errors around the point estimate of β.



7     Comparing Public and Private Plants
The paper asked the question: what do public plants maximize? The model assumes that
these plants have a well specified objective function and thus we assume that these plants
maximize a return each period which is naturally termed “profits”. But what constitutes
“profits” for the public plants? We answer that question by comparing the results for public
and private plants.
    For both public and private plants, linear firing costs are a prominent form of adjustment
costs. The parameters estimates are larger for the public than for the private plants. As
noted earlier, γ − is only about 17% of the annual compensation to a worker in the private
sector. For the public sector, the linear firing cost is considerably larger, 161% of annual
compensation.
    For the fixed and quadratic costs, the magnitude of these costs relative to revenue depends
upon the endogenous adjustment decisions of the plants. For example, the fixed cost of firing
workers relative to revenues will depend on the revenues when those workers were fired. Table
9 reports the average quadratic and fixed adjustment costs actually paid as a fraction of plant
revenue.
    Overall, the estimated adjustment costs are considerably larger for the public plants
relative to the private ones. This is particularly true of the fixed firing costs. As a fraction
of revenue, though, all the adjustment costs except for the fixed firing costs in the public
sector seem small. Yet, as demonstrated in the sensitivity analysis, these apparently small
costs do influence the choices of the private and public plants.
    It is important to consider how these higher adjustment costs translate into employment
decisions. All else the same, one would conjecture that the higher adjustment costs of the
public plants would imply more inaction and more bursts of job creation and job destruction.
Yet, from Tables 4 and 7, it is the private plants that have more inaction and slightly more
action in the tails of the job creation and job destruction distribution. This is true in the

actual as well as the simulated data using the estimated parameters. As shown later, this
finding is true in the sectoral data as well.
   There are two other parameters that help account for these differences between public
and private plants. First, the estimated costs of adjusting hours, ζ, is considerably higher for
the public plants compared to the private ones. A higher cost of hours adjustment implies
that the public plants rely more on adjustment in the number of workers, despite the higher
costs. This translates into less inaction. As shown in Table 5, if the estimated ζ for the
public plants is used in the private plant’s problem, the moments for the private plants would
exhibit considerably less inaction. In addition, the quadratic adjustment cost is considerably
larger for the public plants. Using this higher cost in the private plant’s problem generates
less inaction, as shown in Table 5.
   Returning to our discussion of the objectives of public plants, we find some support for
the “employment stabilizing” objective. The adjustment costs are larger for public compared
to the private plants.
   The quadratic adjustment costs are an order of magnitude larger for public plants. In
this sense, the public plants are penalized for employment variations. Note that these costs

are a bit smaller for SCEs than the collectively controlled public plants.
       Further, the public plants face fixed firing costs that differ from those incurred by private
plants in two respects. First, the public plants firing costs are much larger as a fraction
of revenues. Second, as indicated by the calculations in Table 9, these larger parameters
translate into larger costs actually incurred.
       Finally, the analysis uncovers important differences in discounting. While the discount
factors for all public plants and all private plants are not much different, the SCEs discount
considerably less than the domestic private plants and collective public plants. This is
consistent with numerous accounts of financial frictions within China.
       For example, Hale and Long (2011) look at interest expenses relative to debt and argue
that the cost of capital for state firms is considerably lower than that for private firms. For
their sample, collective firms lie between the state and private firms.
       Poncet, Steingress, and Vandenbussche (2010) use an Euler equation approach to study
the capital investment decisions at the firm level. They argue that domestic private firms
face borrowing constraints while SOEs and the foreign private firms do not.27 Though these
results are obtained from a very different economic model, they coincide with our findings
on dynamic labor demand.



8        Sectoral Results
Our estimates thus far pertain to all manufacturing plants. This approach constrains the
parameters to be the same across sectors. Further, the comparison of private and public
plants may reflect their different sectors of operation rather than differences in adjustment
costs and/or discount factors. We now study a couple of specific sectors: autos parts, steel
and iron, machinery and apparel.
       Table 11 and 12 in the Appendix are comparable to Table 1 in terms of providing some
basic statistics on the (trimmed) public and private plants in these sectors. Most of the plants
in these sectors are private. The public plants are considerably larger than the private ones.
This is true in terms of value added, revenues, employment and the capital stock. Public
plants are more capital intensive, particularly in steel and iron, except for the machinery

sector. The revenue and value added per unit of capital are generally higher in public
compared to private plants, except for apparel. In contrast, the revenue and value added
per worker measure of productivity are all higher in the private plants, except for steel and
iron. Difference in productivity is most evident in the revenue per capital measure in steel
and iron.
   The same estimation approach applied to all plants was used for the sectoral estimation.
The results for these sectors are provided in Table 10 and the moments are in Table 13 in
the Appendix.
   Most of the basic patterns from total manufacturing appear in the sectoral results as
well. The public plants have significantly larger estimated quadratic adjustment costs and
higher linear firing costs. The costs of hours variation is considerably higher for the public
plants than the private ones, as was the case with the full sample. Fixed hiring costs are
negligible for all plants in all sectors and fixed firing costs are small for private plants.

    One interesting difference from the previous results is in the discount factors. For all of
manufacturing, we found that the private and public discount factors were overall about the
same. But, the SCE had a much higher discount factor than did the collective enterprises.
Looking at these sectors, the private plants discount more than the public sector plants in
all sectors.
    Looking at the moments in Table 13, there is more inaction by the private sector plants
compared to the public plants in all of these sectors. This is the same pattern as in total
manufacturing. Further the private plants exhibit more frequent bursts of job creation and
job destruction in excess of 30%.
    These patterns of higher inaction and more frequent bursts are normally explained by
larger non-convex adjustment costs and lower quadratic costs. As noted earlier, the public
plants have higher quadratic and higher linear costs in all of these sectors. As was the case
in the comparison of public and private plants for all of manufacturing, the differences in
employment adjustment also reflect the higher costs of hours variation for public plants as
well as larger quadratic adjustment costs.
    As indicated in Table 13, the sectoral models fit better than those for overall manufac-
turing. This is partly because the parameter estimates are sector specific. In addition, with
a smaller number of observations, the terms in the variance/covariance matrix are larger and
thus the terms in the weighting matrix are smaller.
    From this table, the public plants in both the auto parts and steel and iron sectors
exhibited “increasing returns” with the OLS estimates of α in excess of 1.0. Yet, from Table
10, the estimated curvature of the revenue functions are less than unity, though higher than
the private sector counterparts.



9     Conclusion
This paper estimates labor adjustment costs for private and public plants. For all of these
plants, we find evidence of adjustment costs in the form of fixed and linear firing costs along
with quadratic adjustment costs. These fixed firing costs apply when the job destruction rate
exceeds 5% for the private plants and 10% for the public ones. The quadratic adjustment
costs for public plants are larger than those for the private plants. Importantly, we also find
that hours variation in more costly for public plants and this has an impact on their demand

for labor.
       In addition, we uncover differences in discount rates across types of plants. In particular,
the SCEs discount the future least. The private plants discount more than the SCEs but
less than collectively owned plants. In the presence of adjustment costs, hiring is like an
investment activity so that discount factors matter for employment decisions.
       Turning specifically to the objectives of the public plants, we see no evidence of soft-
budget constraints influencing the labor demand of public plants. We do see evidence of
higher adjustment costs in the public plants. This amounts to support for public plants
acting to stabilize employment, as reflected by differences in estimated quadratic and non-
convex adjustment costs.
       As argued in the introduction, an estimation exercise such as this is needed to evaluate
the impact of a number of interventions. While this paper refrains from analyzing any specific
interventions, it is clear that any policy analysis requires the ability to predict the response
of firms.
       For example, this analysis uses data prior to the introduction of worker protection regula-
tions in China. That intervention, in part, reflected concerns about hours variation and the
lack of severance pay to workers. One interpretation of the fixed firing costs for excessive job
destruction was a political one that may have been manifested in the recent regulations.28
Studying the impact of those new regulations on labor demand using our estimated model
is of considerable interest.
       The results are also useful as inputs into an analysis of gains to reallocation. Given
our focus on private versus public plants, reallocation can occur within and across owner-
ship classes. We plan to use our model to study productivity implications of reallocation,
both in the present and in the earlier years of our sample. The theme of reallocation is
clearly important as well in considering the effects of the introduction of worker protection
regulations.

10.1     Measurement
“Revenue” in (3) refers to output price times quantity of output, net of variable costs on
inputs excluding labor. The data provide direct measures of output in monetary terms, i.e.
output price times quantity of output, which can be deflated to base-year measures.
   Although the “revenue” (hereafter referred to as “net revenue”) in (3) is not directly
observed from the data, we can use the output price times quantity (hereafter referred to as
“gross revenue”) in the data to estimate the curvature of the net revenue function (α) and
back out the profitability shock. This approach is common in the dynamic factor demand
literature. The appendix of Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006) presents a detailed discussion
of the derivation and measurement issues in the context of a capital adjustment problem.
