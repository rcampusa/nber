             THE NONEQUIVALENCE OF' HIGH SCHOOL EQUIVALENTS


                               ABSTRACT
      This   paper analyzes the causes and consequences of the
growing proportion of high-school-certified persons who achieve
that status by exam certification rather than through high school
graduation. Exam-certified high school equivalents are
statistically indistinguishable from high school dropouts. Both
dropouts and exam-certified equivalents have comparably poor
wages, earnings, hours of work, unemployment experiences and job
tenure. This is so whether or not ability measures are used to
control for differences. Whatever differences are found among
exam-certified equivalents, high school dropouts and high school
graduates are accounted for by their years of schooling
completed. There is no cheap substitute for schooling. The only
payoff to exam certification arises from its value in opening
post-secondary schooling and training opportunities. However,
exam-certified equivalents receive lower returns to most forms of
post-secondary education and training.
     We also discuss the political economy of the recent rapid
growth of exam certification. There has been growth in direct
government subsidies to adult basic education programs that
feature exam certification as an output. In addition, there has
been growth in government subsidies to post-secondary schooling
programs that require certification in order to qualify for
benefits. These sources account for the rapid growth in the use
of exam certification in the face of the low economic returns to
it.

         This paper examines the causes and consequences of a neglected social phenomenon - the recent

 rapid growth in the fraction of persons who achieve high school certification by means of
                                                                                                 an equivalency

 exam rather than through the traditional route of high school graduation. In 1968,
                                                                                           only five percent of
 all new high school certificates were awarded through equivalency exams. By 1987, the
                                                                                                 corresponding

 figure was in excess of fourteen percent. In 1968, only two percent of all persons who completed their

 education with high school degrees were exam certified, in 1987, the corresponding figure was almost

 eleven percent.

        Conventional wisdom and statistical practice equates the two types of certification. For example,

 it was only in 1988 that the Current Population Survey - the central framework for socioeconomic

accounting in the U.S. - distinguished the two types of certification in standard surveys. The 1990 U.s.

Population Census is the first to distinguish exam-certified equivalents from high school graduates.

        This paper challenges the conventional wisdom. Exam-certified high school equivalents are not

identical to traditional high school graduates in terms of their ability as measured by a standard

psychometric test (the Armed Forces Qualifying Test), in terms of their wages and hours of work or in

terms of their post-certification educational and training decisions. We demonstrate that exam-certified

high school equivalents are psychometrically inferior to traditional high school graduates. We note

elsewhere (Cameron and Heckman, 199 la,b) that the detenninants of high school certification by exam

are very different from the determinants of traditional high school graduation. We demonstrate here that

the economic consequences of the two avenues of high school certification are quite different - exam

certified persons are indistinguishable from high school dropouts who are uncertified. Differences in

wages among high school graduates, exam certified equivalents and dropouts are accounted for by years

of schooling attained. There is little evidence of value added from exam certification beyond the effect

of years of schooling completed on wages. However, exam-certified graduates are more likely to take

vocational and technical training while traditional high school graduates are more likely to attend

academic four-year colleges and complete academic programs when they begin them. Exam-certified high
school graduates are more likely to participate in some form of post-secondary training than are non-

exam-certified high-school-dropouts. Exam-certified persons who take post-secondary schooling and

training earn lower returns than high school graduates undertaking the same activity. Whatever return

there is to high school equivalency certification comes from returns to post-secondary training.

        Contrary to these facts, it is widely believed that exam-certified high school equivalents are the

equals of traditional high school graduates in all relevant behavioral dimensions. This view is fostered

in part by the American Council on Education a private organization representing institutions of higher

education as well as regional education associations. That organization administers the most widely used

equivalency exam - the GED (for Qeneral ducational flevelopment). Researchers affiliated with the

American Council on Education claim that

                "...persons who meet stare/provincial established minimum score

                levels for the high school equivalency credential based on GED rests

                should be considered high school graduates for admissions, milirwy.

                licensing and employment purposes. The test results. - - demonstrate this

                achievement equivalency". (Malizio arid Whitney, 1982. p. 10)



        The growing use of GEl) certification suggests an important role for widespread misperception

on the part of test takers. However, there are several reasons why informed persons may take the GEl)

even if the gross returns to it are low: (a) the costs of exam certification are low and hence commensurate

with gross returns: ) exam certification qualifies high school dropouts to take post-secondary training

which may enhance earnings; and (c) state and federal adult basic education programs and manpower

training programs subsidize exam certification. Performance standards in federal and state human

resource bureaucracies have led to an emphasis on easily monitored objectives such as high school

equivalency at the expense of less easily measured improvements in basic skills. Such an emphasis would



                                                    2
appear to be justified in light of the claims of the American Council on Education.

        The growth in the level and proportion of exam-certified high school credentials is a direct

consequence of federal and state human resource policies. Since the mid-1960', both federal and state

governments have increasingly subsidized adult basic education programs which have placed a growing

emphasis on adult equivalency as a clearly identified and desirable objective. in addition..ahigh school

degree or an exam-certified-eauivalent is required for participation in a host of post-secondary vocational

and academic financial support programs increasingly subsidized by federal and state governments over

this period. The demand for participation in these subsidized programs induced a derived demand for high

school certification on the part of high school dropouts.

        A major conclusion of this paper is that the GED is a vehicle for participation in post-secondary

education due to its value in satisfying bureaucratically determined qualifications for admission and

financial support. The subsidy to these programs reconciles the apparent conflict between low gross

returns to obtaining the GED and the large and growing demand for GEDs. The GED does not signal

achievement of market skills above and beyond what is signified by a person's years of attained

schooling. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to consider the (3ED as an educational end in itself - an

emphasis placed in many contemporary state and federal programs.

       Our paper develops in the following way. Section one documents basic facts about high school

equivalency and reasons for growth in this form of high school certification. Psychometric and market

evidence demonstrates the nonequivalence of high school equivalents. Section two presents evidence on

the economic returns to high school equivalency. The paper concludes with a summary.

                 1.The Chaneine Structure Of Hieh School Certification and Its
     Conseouences For Measuring The Determinants and Cpnseauence of Educational Decisions

                     A. The Growth in Rieh School Eouivalency and Certification


       There are three main routes through which Americans achieve certification as high school


                                                    3
graduates: (a) through traditional course attendance, culminating in graduation at the end of the 12th

grade: (b) through night school and other formal schooling programs for those who drop out of traditional

high school programs; and (c) through certification on a standardized exam for high school dropouts.

Although the vast majority (84.5% in 1987) of all new high school credentials are issued through

traditional route (a), a sizeable proportion of new graduates come from the less traditional avenues (b)

and (c). The largest non-traditional source is from persons certified by an equivalency exam - roughly

14% of all newly issued high school credentials obtained in 1987 were secured by this means. Virtually

all of these credentials come from individuals who passed the nationally-normed GED exam developed

by the American Council on Education. Graduation through formal adult secondary schooling produced

no more than 2% of all new high-school-certified persons in 1987.

       There has been a dramatic change in the number of exam-certified high school graduates ova

the period 1953-1988. Figure 1 plots the percentage of GED recipients relative to all high school

graduates for each year over the period. It rises from less than two percent in 1954 to more than 14

percent in 1986. The period 1965-1985 is one of especially rapid growth. There has been concomitant

growth in the percentage of all persons with high school diplomas (and no farther academic degree) who

achieve that status by GED certification. Figure 2 reveals that of the total stock of persons with only

high school degrees by 1987, more than 10% achieved their degree by taking a GED exam. In 1968,

only 2% of the total stock was exam-certified. Figure 3 documents the near stability in non-GED sources

of high school graduates. Certification through adult education courses ("other programs") has grown

over the period 1974-1987, but the level is low (ranging between 1-2% of all new high school graduates)

and the growth rate is small. The major change in the source of high school credentials is growth in

GED certification.

       The GED testing program began in 1942 as the Veterans Testing Service and was ajoint venture

of the United States Armed Forces Institute and the American Council on Education. The premise of the


                                                   4
testing program was that the life experience of military personnel could substitute for classroom training

in developing skills associated with high school certification. The relevant skills could be measured by

an exam. By 1952, all but three states issued certificates of high school equivalence to veterans and

servicemen who passed the Veterans Testing Service exam. The Armed Forces accepted exam-certified

equivalents as the equals of high-school-graduates in making their enlistment and screening decisions —

even for service academies, A Commission on Accreditation of Service Experiences in 1952 documented

the widespread acceptance of the GED as a high school certificate by major firms and state and local

governments. In that same year the American Council on Education began to offer the exam to non-

veteran civilians and its name was changed to the GED. By 1963, all 50 states used the GED exam to

certify high school dropouts.

        The post-1963 growth in the proportion of high-school-certified persons taking the GED evident

in figure 1 is directly linked to the large scale and unprecedent expansion of the federal government and

state programs in human resources that began in the Kennedy-Johnson era. The two main social programs

that fueled the post-1963 growth in GED recipiency are (a) the 1966 Adult Basic Education Act and

subsequent amendments to it and (b) a variety of federal programs for post-secondary education that

created a demand for high school credentials to qualir for program benefits. Surprisingly, manpower

training programs that expanded greatly in the 1960' and 1970' contribute little to the growth in GED

recipiency.

        The Adult Basic Education Act of 1966 was a War on Poverty program designed to provide adults

with levels of education that were thought likely to elevate them out of poverty. Throughout the course

of the Adult Basic Education program, the emphasis has shifted from an amorphous goal of improving

basic skills to a more easily specified and monitored goal of producing GED-certified high school

equivalents. Figure 4b reveals that enrollment in this activity expands throughout the period 1963-1986

although Figure 4a reveals that total expenditure on this program ceased to expand after 1973 and the


                                                    5
federal share in total program expenditure declines after that date. Figure 5 reveals that in 1972, 24%

of all GED recipients were produced by Adult Basic Education Programs and the time series of GED

recipiency closely tracks the time series of GED credentials produced by these programs. (These data are

not available before 1972). Amendments to the 1966 Act set forth in 1970 drop the age of eligibility for

participation in this program from 18 to 16 and add an explicit emphasis on high•school completion via

the GED or by night school as a main objective of the program. The amendments became operative in

1972. States responded to the reduced age requirements by lowering minimum age requirements for

taking the GED. Most states began to allow persons who were out of school at least six months to take

the exam irrespective of their age. Waiting periods for retaking the exam after failure were scaled down

to zero - 90 days instead of the previous 90-180 days. In 1973, 20% of all GED degrees were produced

by Adult Basic Education Act programs. By 1980, almost 40% of all GED were trained by this

program. Total enrollment increased four-fold between 1970-1980.

        Manpower training programs were introduced and expanded during the early 1960', beginning

with the Manpower Development and Training Act (MDTA) of 1962. The set of programs created by

the Act did not emphasize academic training Q..evitan and Gallo, 1988, chap. 1). Job Corps was an

exception and did produce GED recipients. However this manpower program was never large. In 1975

the number of Job Corp GED recipients was less than 2% of the total granted. The successor programs

to MDTA maintained its disinterest in high school certification as a major objective, and were negligible

contributors to the level or rate of growth of GED recipiency. (Levitan and Gallo, 1988).

       In addition to the growth in programs that made attainment of the GED as a main objective, there

was substantial expansion in programs that required high school degrees or their equivalents to receive

benefits. These programs fueled the demand for high school certification. Figure 6a charts the growth

in expenditure on major post-secondary educational finding programs which required high school

certification for eligibility. Figure 6b charts participation in numbers. There was gradual growth in

National Defense Student Loans (NDSL). work-study support programs and the Supplementary

Educational Opportunity Grant program (SEOG) during the period 1963-1975 when GED certification

was growing steadily.     All of these programs required a high school degree or its equivalent for

eligibility. Not only did the scale of these programs increase over the period 1963-1975, but their

benefits became applicable to less academically oriented post-secondary institutions such as not-for-profit

propriety training centers.

        The most dramatic development in post-secondary educational finance was the growth in the Fell

grant program in the period 1973-1981. Starting in 1973, benefits for all components of this program

could be used to finance proprietary training. Family income restrictions were relaxed and loans became

more widely available to the middle class in 1976. As recorded in Figures 7a and 7b, Fell grants to

proprietary students continue to grow after 1978 while payments to two and four year college students

stabilize after 1976.

        Between 1977 and 1981 guaranteed disbursements rose sharply with the passage of new Student

Loans amendments that allowed students at all non-profit and proprietary postsecondary institutions access

to government grants and loans to high school graduates and (3W degree holders, and that liberalized

family income restrictions on loan eligibility. (See Figures Ba and Sb) There was a sharp rise in the

number of GED degrees issued relative to all high school credentials during this same period (Figure 1).

        In 1979 and 1980, however, new regulations began to take effect that allowed any individual with

the "ability-to-benefit," including hich school dronouts, to participate in any of these programs. A

General Accounting Office study of proprietary institutions in 1984 found dropouts to be more likely than

high school graduates and GED holders to drop out from their programs and more likely to default on

loans and on grant obligations (GAO, 1984, pg. 56). Because of the threat of federal sanctions imposed

on institutions with loan default rates exceeding 15% for two consecutive years, lending agencies had an

incentive to screen out dropouts. The "ability-to-benefit" requirement remains controversial (Fraas, 1990

Appendix A). In fact, a Congressional Research Service Report found that in 1986, dropouts comprised

only 9% of proprietary school students, 1% of two-year college vocational students, and 3% of students

enrolled in any postsecondary program in a community college (Apling and Aleman, pg. 25). By way

of comparison, 74% of the persons in the proprietary schools were high school graduates and 9% were

6EV holders. Among two-year college vocational students 88% were high school graduates and 8%

were GED recipients. Among students enrolled in community college postsecondary programs, 86% were

high school graduates and 8% were GED holders.

       Temporal coincidence cannot establish causation. However, the close association between the

growth in 6EV recipiency and the growth in government programs that subsidize attainment of the (3EV

or require high school certification for eligibility is strongly suggestive of an important role for

government subsidy policies in accounting for the growth in 6EV certification. (See Figure 9). This

evidence helps to reconcile the growth in GED certification and the low gross returns to obtaining a 6EV

which we document in this paper.

                 B. Some Features of the Recent GED Exam and Those Who Take It

       The age distribution of GED test-takers has remained roughly constant over time although the

influence of the baby boom and subsequent baby bust is evident (see Figure 10). Most GED test-takers

are less than 25 years old. Assuming temporal stability of pass rates by age, the baby boom accounts

for part of the post-1970 growth in GED-certified graduates as a fraction of total high-school-certified

persons. Between 1970 and 1987, the ratio of 16-19-year-olds to 20-24-year-olds fell from .89 to 75.

Over the same period, the proportion of persons age I? relative to ages 20-44 declined from .056 to .040.

Relatively more persons were in the age brackets at risk for the GED than in the age brackets at risk for

traditional high school graduation. However, rough calculations suggest that changing population

proportions by age account for, j , two points of the eight-percentage-point growth in 6EV-certified

persons as a proportion of total new certified persons that occurred over this period.

        The growth in exam-certified equivalents explains an apparent contradiction in the data on high

school dropouts. Figure 11 plots the proportion of traditional high school graduates for cohorts of 17-

year-olds over the period 1951-1988. The proportion declines after 1968, although it slightly rebounds

in the late 1910' and 1980'. Figure 12 shows a very different pattern over the period 1971-1986 for high-

school-certified persons age 20-24. The recent growth in exam certification explains the discrepancy

between the two figures. (See also Chester Finn, 1987). There appear to be sharp differences in the use

of (lED certification by race. Table I documents that Black CPS-measured high school equivalents are

twice as likely as whites to have the GED. Part of the measured convergence of black and white high

school attainment rates (Kominski, 1990) appears to be due to growing high school certification of Blacks

by (lED exams.

        High school certificates awarded by adult education institutes reward students for completing a

traditional high school curriculum at a somewhat later stage of life than do typical high school graduates.

Equivalency exams operate on a radically different principle. Since the GEl) certifies the vast majority

(well in excess of 90%) of all exam-certified high school graduates over the period 1970-1987, we focus

our attention on that exam.

        (lED candidates are tested on a total of 290 items in five subject area tests: Writing skills (80

items), Social Studies (60 items), Science (60 items). Reading skills (40 items) and Mathematics (50

items). Conceptual - and not factual - knowledge is stressed. The focus is on general knowledge and

not specific details. (Malizio and Whitney, 1982). Individual states set pass rates, but these vary within

a fairly narrow band. The majority of the states (29) require a minimum score of 35 (out of 80 possible -

 20 is the minimum score) on each exam and an average of 45 over all exams. Most of the rest require

a minimum of 40 and an average of 45. ((lED, 1989 Annual Statistical Report, p. 30.) Graduating high

school seniors are used to norm the test. Fifty percent of graduating high school seniors score 50 points

or higher.

        By setting the minimum passing level at 35 on the distribution of graduating seniors with a range

of scores set at 20-SO, the GEL) examiners niarantee that GEL) graduates outperform graduating high

school seniors on the test.' This is an artifact of test construction although Malizio and Whitney (1982.

p. 10 as quoted in the introduction to this paper) use such evidence to conclude that GED-certified

persons are the equals or superiors of high school graduates. Below, and in Cameron andHeckjnan,

 1991b, we demonstrate that GEL) recipients are psychometrically inferior to high school graduates in

terms of the Armed Services Qua]i'ing Test and its components.

        Candidate preparation for the GEL) is limited. In April and May 198O a survey was conducted

of 13,000 GED candidates at 250 randomly selected GED testing centers throughout the United States.

The median examinee spent 20 hours preparing for the test and spent $10 in preparation costs. Seventy-

five percent of the examinees spent 60 hours or less in preparation. The upperS percentile reported more

than 200 hours in preparation. The upper quartile of the candidates spent $25 in direct-out-of-pocket

costs or $30, including lost salary. (Malizio and Whitney, 1981, Table 18). Even at the upper 5

percentile point in the distribution of costs, the corresponding figures are $100 and $106. Twenty-one

percent did not prepare in any way. Only 22% took the GEL) practice test and 40.5% studied from a

book or manual. Less than 1% of the candidates incurred any expenses for individual tutoring. Despite

the generally low level of preparation, usually more than 70% of those taking the exam pass it in any

given sitting. Candidates who fail may retake the exam without penalty, although there is a short (two-

three month) waiting period in some states. In Corpus Christi Texas, one of the authors (I-Jeckman) in

1991 observed a federally sponsored GEL) program that gave persons initially certified at fourth grade

levels in numeracy and literacy four weeks of intensive instruction. The program has a first time pass

(1982) suggests that GED recipients have a thinner right tail of test scores compared to high school

 intrinsic economic value might be low.

                                    Of Exam-Certified Enuivalents


         Despite a torrent of claims to the contrary issued from the American Council on Education, there

is considerable evidence that GED-certilied persons do not possess the same skills or motivation as high

school graduates. Janice Laurence (1983, Table 1) notes that high school dropouts and GED-certified

high school equivalents have basically the same attrition rates from the U.S. military over the period

1977-1979, and both groups attrite at jç the rate of high school graduates. She goes on to note that

in 1982, the U.S. Army required for minimal admission standards that GED-certified graduates and high

school dropouts should be in the 31" percentile of the Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT) distribution.

High school graduates were only required to be in the 16" percentile. The higher minimum scores were

judged necessary to guarantee successful completion of basic training courses by GED-certi fled applicants.

        An extensive study of the performance of GED recipients in the University of Wisconsin system

has been performed by Pawasarat and Quinn (1986). At the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, GED-

certified persons had lower completion rates for the first four semesters than did high school graduates

from the bottom 20 percentiles of their high school class (31% vs. 41%). The four-semester-completion

rates for high school graduates in the top 50% of their class was 62% - twice that of the GED graduates.

At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, only 73% of GED holders admitted to the school enrolled for

a second semester, compared to a 95% rate for all entrants to the school. At Milwaukee Area Technical

College - a vocational school - GED-holders seeking a two-year Associate Degree had attrition rates

comparable to those of high school dropouts. Over the period 1980-1983, 8% of GED entrants attained

the two-year Associate Degree, compared to 10% of high school dropouts and 30% of high school

graduates. A study of the Milwaukee labor market by Pawasarat and Quinn finds that 48% of the firms


                                                     II
interviewed preferred hiring conventional high school graduates to GED-certified graduates, while the

rest of the employers were indifferent between persons with the two types of high school credentials.

        Psychometric evidence from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, ages 13-20 in 1978,

contradicts the psychometric claims of equivalency for the two types of high school certification made

by the American Council on Education. çrhe survey is described at length in Appendix A). Table 2

displays the results of the Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQ for males administered to all members

of the NLSY sample. For the random subsample of the data (Panel A of Table 2), AFQT scores for the

decilea going from the bottom to the top are presented, as well as mean scores. High school graduates

have statistically significantly higher mean test scores than do GE!) holders who, in turn, have statistically

significantly higher mean test scores than do high school dropouts. The pattern is the same at each decile

from the top to the bottom. The pattern holds true for a sample standardized to have the same

approximate age at the time they take the exam anel B), or for an enriched sample that oversamples

blacks and hispanics (results not shown). The same pattern is found for persons who do not complete

four-year colleges both for the entire sample and for those who were 16 or 17 at the time the test was

given: GED recipients are not the psychometric equivalents of high school graduates. (Cameron and

Heckman, 1991b). However, they psychometrically dominate high school dropouts. Similar patterns

appear for each race group: whites, blacks and hispanics. A Wilcoxon test for stochastic dominance

(Bickel and Doksum, 1977) - a statistical concept that compares distributions of the same outcome for

different groups and determines if higher outcomes are more common in one group than another-is

presented in the first row of Table 3. It reveals that the high school graduate AFQT distribution first-

order-stochastically dominates the GED-AFQT distribution, and the latter distribution first-order-

stochastically dominates the AFQT distribution of high school dropouts. The same pattern is found for

persons who do not attend college and for disaggregated components of the AFQT exam. (See Cameron

and Heckxnan 1991b).

         This subsection presents simple mean-difference and univariate distributional comparisons among

 high school dropouts, GED recipients, and high school graduates. Using the NLSY data for male youth

 age 13-20 in 1978 we compare the determinants and labor market and educational consequences of the

 three types of high school certification status.

         Table 4 reveals that family background variables are ordered in the expected direction. High

school dropouts are more likely to be minority group members and come from larger families with lower

incomes and less educated parents than do GED recipients who, in turn, have poorer background

characteristics than high school graduates.2 The Wilcoxon test, reported in Table 3, reveals that the

family income distribution of traditional high school graduates stochastically dominates that for GED

recipients and dropouts. There is no stochastic-ordering relationship for family income between the latter

two groups. (Similar results hold for people age 28).

        Tables 5A and SB present evidence on labor market outcomes for individuals with the three types

of high school status. At age 25 (Table SA), the mean labor market status of high school dropouts is the

same as that of GED recipients. The small premium in hourly wages and salary for GED recipients over

those of dropouts is not statistically significant. Both groups are inferior to high school graduates in

terms of hours, wages, salaries, weeks worked, and length of time on their current job. The lower work

experience of high school graduates is a consequence of their greater schooling. The relationships in

means carry over to first-order-stochastic dominance on these variables: GED and high school dropouts

are indistinguishable, and both groups have labor market outcome distributions that are first-order-

characteristics. This sampling induces a stochastic dependence among sibling observations which we
analyze in Appendix A where it is shown to have a minor effect on the estimated standard errors of
the coefficients of wage equations.

stochastically dominated by those of high school graduates. (See Table 3A). Table 4B reveals the same

pattern at age 28, when post-school investment activity begins to diminish and long-term differences in

wages and labor supply begin to emerge. High school dropouts are indistinguishable in their means from

GED recipients, and both are inferior to high school graduates. As displayed in Table 38, the

relationships for means carry over to more general first-order-stochastic dominance relationships for entire

distributions.

        One way to gauge the economic significance of these results is to examine the implications for

the estimated rate of return' to education arising from the CPS convention that equates GED recipients

and high school graduates. Using two samples of NLSY observations of young men ages 25-28

(enriching the random sample with black and hispanic subsainples), we compute a least squares regression

of log hourly wages on mutually exclusive dummy variables that measure whether 0! not a person has

a high school diploma (= 1 if a person has a high school diploma irrespective of subsequent achievement)

or two years of college, or four years of college. (See Table 6A, column one). Column two shows the

effect of distinguishing how the high school diploma was achieved: through a GED or through a

traditional degree program.

        Defining high school diploma in the CPS-Census manner produces a differential effect on wages

at age 25 of four-year college attendance compared to high school graduation of 21% (Column 1).

Breaking out the GED from the traditional high school diploma produces a college-high school differential

of only 19.6% for the traditional high school degree. The comparable figures at age 28 are 21.9% and

20.7% respectively. F-tests based on more robust McKinnon-White (1985) standard errors reject the

hypothesis that GED recipients should be considered the same as high school graduates, but do not reject

the hypothesis that GED recipients are indistinguishable from high school dropouts. The CPS-Census

convention of equating GED recipients to high school graduates overstates the returns to college education

relative to traditional high school graduation. Inappropriate pooling of the two types of high school

credentials would cause the college-high school differential to increase over the period of the late 1970'

and 1980', as GED certification became a wide-spread phenomenon but the effect appears to be relatively

small. Approximately 10% of the growth of the four year college - high school differential documented

for younger workers (with 5 years of work experience) documented by Katz and Krueger (1990) arises

from falsely attributing the market productivity of traditional high school graduates to GRID recipients.

        Additional evidence on the nonequivalence of high school equivalents is presented in Tables land

8, which look at post-certification educational choices for both types of degrees. Table 7 shows first

choices after completing certification. GED-certifted persons are much less likely to attend four-year

colleges and are more likely to enter the military or not undertake any post-secondary education. Table

8 reveals that GED graduates are less likely than high school graduates to attend four-year colleges, or

graduate from them if they attend them. Attendance and completion rates at two-year colleges are

comparable for the two groups.

        The evidence from the NLSY and the other studies indicates that GRID recipients are not the

equivalents of high school graduates. Their labor market outcomes and performance in the military

suggest that GED recipients are similar to high school dropouts. GEE) recipients are less likely to pursue

post-secondary academic education and are less likely to finish an educational program if they begin it.

The balance of this paper and our companion papers (Cameron and Hecknan, 199 la,b) presents a more

refined statistical analysis of the NLSY that supports these basic conclusions.

                                             A. Introduction

        This section presents econometric evidence on the nonequivalence of exam-certified equivalents.

We demonstrate that controlling for detailed person-specific and market characteristics, the unadjusted

differences reported in section I remain. GED-certified persons are much closer to high school dropouts

than are high school graduates. Subsection C presents evidence on this question for wages and hours of

work. Subsection D documents that most of the (low) gross return to (JED certification comes from

returns to post-secondary schooling and training. However, the gross returns from these activities are

lower for GED certified persons than for high school graduates. This evidence supports our contention

that the growth in GED certification over time arises partly from the growing subsidy to post-secondary

programs that require high school credentials.

        Subsection E presents an analysis for unemployment, labor force participation and job turnover.

On these dimensions of labor market attachment, GED-certifted persons are much closer to high school

dropouts than high school graduates. Subsection F presents some confirmatory longitudinal evidence.

The section concludes with a brief assessment of the consequences of the CPS and Census convention that

equates high school graduates with (lED recipients for measuring the time series of the returns to

education. Before presenting this evidence, we first sound a cautionary methodological note.

                             B. A Remark on Conventional Testing Criteria

        The evidence presented in this section of the paper is largely based on classical testing theory for

multivariate regression models. Because we use "robust" procedures (McKinnon-White, 1985) we do

not rely on standard, and controversial, normality assumptions. Nonetheless, there is a well-known

ambiguity in the classical theory that centers on the choice of a correct significance level for conducting

a test and the matter of how it should be adjusted in different sample sizes. (Lindley, 1957). These

considerations are especially relevant for this paper in light of the small samples available in the NLSY

compared to the Current Population Survey samples that have generated so much of the recent knowledge

on the structure of the wages and labor supply.

        In order to avoid placing undue-and increasing- weight on minimizing type II errors (the

probability of accepting a false null hypothesis) as sample sizes increase, the probability of type I errors

(i.e. the significance level) should be adjusted downward with sample size. Stated more simply, given


                                                    16
that P values are to be used, we should be more tolerant - less likely to reject a null for any P value-on

a small sample like the NLSY than on a large sample like the CPS.

        In the context of this paper, this advice comes down to two principles that are important to keep

in mind in reading the evidence reported below: (a) when one rejects a null hypothesis in a model fit on

the NLSY, one can be relatively confident in doing so; (b) when one does not reject, but the sign pattern

of estimated differences seems plausible, one sbould not be too confident in accepting the null.

                  C. The Direct Effects of Certification on Wp2es and Hours Worked

        This subsection demonstrates that GED-certified males are more like high school dropouts than

high school graduates in terms of their labor supply and wages. Tables 9A-9D present estimates of

alternative specifications of labor supply and wage equations that distinguish GED recipients from

traditional high school graduates. We estimate wage and labor supply equations at ages 25 and 28 for

two different samples. The first specification (model I) is fit on samples of young men not in college

(two-year or four-year) at ages 25 or 28 who also are working at those ages. The second specification

(model 2) is fit on samples of young men who have not attended any college up to age 25 or 28 and who

work in the year following the date at which the age is attained. These samples are defined so that data

on hourly wages are available for each observation and so that persons holding low-wage pan-time

student jobs are excluded from our analysis. In order to correct for potential sample-selection bias

problems that arise from excluding workers on the basis of their labor force or educational activity, we

estimate a bivariate-selection-correction model presented in Appendix B. The variables used in the

analysis are defined in Appendix A although the common English meanings are precise enough.

       For all specifications of the wage and labor supply equations with and without selection

corrections, we are unable to reject the hypothesis that GED recipients are indistinguishable from high

school dropouts (see the 1" values for the test of the hypothesis 'GED = 0 given at the base of Tables

9A-9D). For all specifications of the labor supply equations and for specifications of the wage functions

 that exclude job tenure and work experience1 we reject the hypothesis that the GED degree is equivalent

 to the high school diploma ("GED = HS GRAD"). When job tenure and work experience are entered

 as regressors in wage equations, there is less evidence of a distinction between the two forms of high

 school certification. There is a strong negative relationship total work experience and GED status. The

 wage equations at ages 25 and 28 and the labor supply equation at age 28 reveal an important role for

 the local unemployment rate.3

         Using conventional statistical significance levels, the NLSY data strong reject the hypothesis that

GED recipients are the labor market equals of high school graduates. The same data do not reject the

hypothesis that high school dropouts and GED recipients are indistinguishable. A closer look at the

evidence indicates, however, that GED recipients are between dropouts and graduates in their economic

standing but are a lot closer to the former than the latter. These findings suggest that with larger data

sets, it is likely (very likely if fixed significance levels are retained) that recipients of GEDs will be

shown to have a somewhat superior labor market position compared to high school dropouts.

        It is plausible that the differences in economic outcomes among the GED recipients, dropouts and

high school graduates are largely due to differences in ability. (Recall the ordering reported in Table 2).

Tables IQA and lOB present estimates of augmented versions of the models presented in Tables 9A-9D

when an AFQT test score - interpreted as a measure of ability - is added to wage and hours of work

equations. AFQT scores may be as much a consequence as a cause of schooling, so the results shown

in these tables should be interpreted with caution. introduction of the AFQT variable tends to reduce the

precision and size of the estimated GED and high school graduation coefficients, as would be expected




    'The selection-correction procedure used in this paper does not play a central role in producing
these inferences. However, it does affect the strength of the inference in the specifications of the wage
function that include tenure and experience. In Cameron and Heckman, l991b, we examine the fit of
estimated selection-corrected and uncorrected wage and labor supply functions to the data. The
selection-corrected wage models fit the data although the uncorrected wage models do not. Neither
corrected nor uncorrected hours models fit the data.

if the test score merely proxies schooling. However, the bottom two lines of these tables reveal that the

central inferences of Tables 9A-9D are not reversed. GED recipients are statistically indistinguishable in

terms of their hourly wages and hours of work from high school dropouts and have lower wages and

hours of work than traditional high school graduates.

        The observed ordering in economic status among dropouts, GET) recipients and high school

graduates may simply be due to differences in years of schooling completed. Table I IA reveals that on

average dropouts have completed one fewer year of schooling than GET) recipients. Table 1 lB

establishes that almost 60% of the GET) recipients have completed eleven years of schooling compared

to only 33% for the dropouts. About 45% of the dropouts have nine or less years of schooling compared

to only 10% of the GED recipients.

        If the ordering in labor market outcomes among graduates, GED recipients and dropouts is simply

due to years of schooling completed, the value of high school exam certification as an end in itself is in

doubt. Government sponsored programs with such an emphasis are misguided.

        Table 12 sheds valuable new light on this question. That table displays the effect on wages of

interacting dropout and GED indicator variables with actual years of schooling completed. The

benchmark group is dropouts with nine or fewer years of schooling. Dropouts with an additional year

of completed schooling earn S to 10% higher wages. The same is true for GED recipients (holding post-

secondary schooling constant). Differences between GET) recipients and dropouts are almost completely

accounted for by years of schooling. At the same completed schooling level a GED earns only 1% more

than a high school dropout. GED' with 11 years of completed schooling earn only 3% less than high

school graduates. Dropouts with Ii years of schooling earn only 4% less than high school graduates.

Using the P values shown at the bottom rows of the table, we do not reject the hypothesis that GET)

recipients and droputs with the same years of schooling earn the same wages. (See the first three rows

of the lower table). High school graduates and GED recipients or high school dropouts with 11 years

of schooling are also indistinguishable. (See rows four and seven). High school graduates earn

statistically significantly higher wages only compared to GED recipients        dropouts with ten or fewer

years of schooling. Note further that high school graduates who completed two year colleges earn 6%

more than GED-certified males with two years of college but this difference is not statistically strong (as

measured by "P" values). Too few GED-certified persons completed four years of college to make a

meaningfiul comparison at that education level.

        Table IS pushes the analysis of Table 12 a bit flurther. When the total number of years of

schooling completed are added to the models of Tables 6A and B, one cannot reject the Mincer (1974)

specification that the coefficients on the dummy variables indicating GEl), high school graduation, and

various years of college certification are jointly insignificant at conventional significance levels. There

are no statistically precise sheepskinw or certification effects in the data controlling for the total

number of years of schooling completed. The GEl) cannot, after all, turn a sow's ear into a silk purse.

There is no cheap way to acquire the skills obtained from conventional classroom instruction.

        Cameron and Heckman, 1991b, present a parallel analysis for hours of work. Again, years          of

schooling completed,       certification levels, account for differences in labor supply behavior.

                              C. Direct and Indirect Effects of Certification

        The GED effects just discussed are nartial or jj measures that hold constant (lED effects on

post-secondary schooling and training. The total effect of (lED acquisition on wages also includes the

effect of certification on the volume of post-secondary schooling and training multiplied by the return to

this activity. Tables 7 and 8 discussed in section one reveal that (lED recipients are more likely to take

post-secondary training and schooling than high school dropouts although they are less likely to attend

and complete such programs than high school graduates.

        Table 14 presents evidence on the indirect effect of (lED certification and high school graduation

on wage rates. The wage equations reported in Table 9 are augmented to partition years of college

military training as additional post-secondary training and schooling choices. In Cameron and Heck.man

(199 la,b) we document that it is necessary to broaden the range of post-secondary schooling and training

options considered - beyond the conventional focus on college education - in order to obtain economically

interpretable empirical models.

          Table 15 reports the components needed to estimate the indirect effects reported in Table 14. In

the column labeled "estimated returns", the estimated effect of an extra unit of post-secondary schooling

or training on log wages is reported for GED recipients and high school graduates. The rates of return

to post-secondary activity for the two forms of certification arestatistically indistinguishable. (See the first

test at the base of the table). However, by age 28, the returns to college for high school graduates are

higher than they are for OW recipients. With the exception of military training, GED recipients take less

post-secondary training or schooling than high school graduates. The product of the rate of return and

the volume of training taken is the contribution of the form of the post-secondary activity reported in each

row to wages. The sum across rows is the estimated total indirect effect. The estimated direct effect is

the coefficient on GED or high school graduation holding constant year effects, post-secondary schooling

and dummy variables for race. The omitted educational category is high school dropouts.

          The indirect effect of high schoolgraduation ranges between 34% to 42% of the total effect on

wages. For GED recipiency, the indirect effect ranges between 100% (at age 25) and 63% (at age 28)

of the estimated total effect.    Although the estimated parameters for GED recipients are not precisely

determined, the evidence assembled in Table 14 indicates the effect of the GED on wages comes

primarily through its effect on certification for post-secondary training. The indirect effects for high

school graduates and GED recipients are nearly identical at age 25 and statistically indistinguishable at

age 28.

secondary schooling and training differs between high school graduates and GED recipients. These

differences are only partly accounted for by the lesser amount of time spent in post-secondary education

by GED recipients. One possible source of these differences is the choice of curriculum within each type

of post-secondary education but we have no direct evidence on this issue.

          E. The Effect of the GED on Unemployment. Labor Force Activity and Job Tenure

        Table 16 presents mean proportions of time spent unemployed, mean weeks of job tenure and

mean weeks out of the labor force for high school graduates, GED recipients and high school dropouts.

At age 28, GEl) recipients have hiffher unemployment rates than dropouts or high school graduates1 and

1Qu job tenure than the other educational groups. Their labor force activity more closely resembles

that of high school dropouts than high school graduates. At age 25, the same patterns are found except

that GED recipients have slightly lower unemployment rates than high school dropouts.

        Tables 17A and 17R report regressions of unemployment and job tenure on the same baseline

variables used in Tables 6 and 9. (rime out of the labor force is not separately analyzed since it can be

generated from the time unemployed and hours of work equations.) At age 25 and 28, GED recipients

are indistinguishable from dropouts and are sharply and unfavorably distinguished from high school

graduates. These results hold up even when years of schooling are entered as separate regressors. (See

Cameron and Heckman, 1991b)

                                    F. Some Lon2itudinal Evidence

       Using the longitudinal structure of the NLSY, we compare a variety of characteristics of GEl)

recipients in the year before and after they receive their certificate, Table ISA excludes persons in the

military in the year before or after receiving the GEl).' There is little evidence of any GED-induced

change in labor market outcomes in these tables, although the small sample sizes may preclude precise




   'The exclusion of military personnel is done to avoid making pay comparisons between military
and civilian wage scales. The exclusion turns out not to affect our conclusions,

         In Cameron and Heckman (1991b), we document that GED recipients are more likely to change

jobs than are high school dropouts. Since a significant portion of the wage growth of young men comes

from job changing, it is interesting to compare the wage growth of GED recipients who change jobs

they receive the GED with the wage growth of GED recipients who stay put. Table 18B reveals that

post-GED job changers receive some increase in wages but it is unclear how much of this growth to

attribute to job changing and how much to attribute to receipt of the GED.

                            Studies Of'flie Chaninp Returns To School 1fl2


        Until recently (1988), the Current Population Survey did not distinguish GED recipients from

high school graduates. It is natural to ask How much of the measured difference in log-wage between

four-year college graduates and pooled GED and traditional high school graduates is due to inappropriate-

ly assuming that the two categories of high school certification have the same economic reward"? Using

the estimates reported in Tables 9A and 9C combined with estimates based on pooling exam-certified high

school graduates with traditional high school graduates, we obtain the numbers reported in Table 19.

Inappropriate pooling of the two forms of high school certification raises the measured difference high

school graduates and four-year college graduates by a modest 7% at age 25, and 6% at age 28.

Inappropriate pooling has modest effects on two year - four year college differentials and two year - high

school differentials as well.

        In Cameron and Heckman (199 la,b) we document that inappropriate pooling of the two forms

of certification has only minor effects on CPS based estimates of the effects of school graduation on

transitions to post-secondary schooling.

credentials achieved by means of exam-certification rather than by the traditional route of high school

graduation. The growth in exam certification helps to reconcile the recent decline in the proportion of

17 year old high school graduates and the constancy in the proportion of 20-24 year olds with high school

certificates. Exam certification is the principal vehicle through which black high school certification rates

have approached that of whites. This paper explores the causes and consequences of this phenomenon.

        The main conclusion of this paper is that exam-certified high school equivalents are statistically

indistinguishable from high school dronouts. Both dropouts and exam-certified equivalents have

comparably poor wages, earnings, hours of work, unemployment experiences and job tenure. CEO-

certified persons are intermediate between traditional graduates and high school dropouts in their

measured ability and in their market status. They are much closer to dropouts than graduates. Controlling

for ability, CED-certifled males have inferior labor market status compared to high school graduates.

        Our main conclusion is strengthened when account is taken of years of schooling completed.

Whatever difference is found among GED recipients, dropouts and high school graduates is largely

accounted for by years of schooling. There is no cheap substitute for classroom instruction. Educational

programs that focus on the GED as an end in itself are misguided.

        Whatever economic return exists from CEO recipiency arises from its value in opening post-

secondary schooling and training opportunities. CEO recipients take less post-secondary training than

high school graduates (military training is an exception to this rule), and receive lower returns - especially

for their college education. The available evidence indicates that CEO recipients who attend college take

a more vocationally oriented curriculum than high school graduates. Both anecdotal and econometric

evidence suggests little direct market value for the CEO controlling for returns from post-secondary

training.

        An important qualification to this analysis should be stated. The sampling frame of the NLSY has

forced us to confine our attention to the early stages of adulthood. It is possible that CEO recipients and



                                                     24
high school dropouts will look more dissimilar at older ages and that GED recipients and high school

graduates will look more similar. That issue can only be settled by looking at later waves of the NLSY

data not currently available or by using other data sources with older persons.

        Since the economic value of GED recipiency is low, its recent dramatic growth as a means of

high school certification is apparently paradoxical. Our investigation of the political economy of the GED

resolves this paradox. Federal and state Adult Basic Education programs subsidize GED test taking and

use GED recipiency as a measure of monitoring bureaucratic performance in these programs. The growth

in finding and participation in these programs tracks the time series of liED recipiency closely. These

subsidies to test-taking partly resolve the paradox.

        In addition, over the past twenty five years, there has been dramatic growth in the federal subsidy

to post-secondary schooling and training programs. High school certification is a requirement for

participation in these programs. This subsidy has created a derived demand for liED certification.

       The evidence assembled here strongly suggests that the dramatic rise in liED certification is a

consequence of Federal and state government policies. The direct subsidy to certification and the derived

demand for liED certification in order to receive subsidies for post-secondary training reconcile the low

gross economic returns to certification and the rapid growth in GED recipiency.

Introduction

        Appendix A contains several supplemental discussions and the means for the data used in our

empirical analysis. It is organized as follows: Section 1 contains a brief description of the NLSY

data. Section 2 describes the NLSY data we use for the analysis of self-selection decisions. Section

3 describes the county average earnings variable. Section 4 describes the AFQT score. Section 5

contains a description of the wage and labor market outcome data. Section 6 presents a discussion of

GED exam preparation. Section 7 presents estimates of wage equations, taking into account intra-

family correlation of the residuals.

1. Background on the NLSY Data

        The micro data we use are from the 1979-1987 waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of

Youth (NLSY). The NLSY includes a randomly
                                         chosen sample          of 6,111 U.S. youths and a supple-
mental sample of 5,296 randomly chosen black, hispanic, and non-black, non-hispanic, economically-

disadvantaged youths. The youths were ages 13-20 in 1978 and were interviewed annually beginning

in 1979. Our sample consists of males who were in the random sample, the black supplemental

sample, and the hispanic supplemental sample. From these samples a total of 3,003 observations are

available from the random sample, 1,105 from the supplemental black sample, and 729 from the

supplemental hispanic sample. Combining the blacks from the random sample and the blacks from the

supplemental sample, we have a total   of 1461 randomly-chosen blacks. Similarly, we have 939

randomly-chosen hispanics. Finally, from just the random sample we have a total of 2437 randomly-

chosen non-black, non-hispanic youths.

2. Data for the Analysis Self Selection Decisions

       One advantage of the NLSY data is its rich variety of measures on family background, school
quality, location, and ability- To measure family background we extract variables on the highest

grade completed of the mother and lather; income in 1978 of the respondent's parents; occupation of

each parent; the number of living siblings; whether the respondent came from a broken home at age

14; whether the respondent was black, hispanic, or neither; and regional labor market characteristics

at age 14 and in each sample year. Finally, we can identi' the state and county of each respondent

for each sample year, as well as the state in which the respondent lived at age 14. The county and

state unemployment rate from the NLSY are merged with supplementary measures of county and state

labor market conditions. Finally, as a measure of ability, we use test scores from the Armed Services

Vocational Aptitude Battery. administered to all NLSY respondents in 1980. This test is described

below.

         For about 10% of our sample, Family Income had missing values for one of two reasons:

first, because of invalid skips in the interview; and second, because the family income questions

pertained to the respondent's family and not that of his parental family.

         Another two percent of the potential sample was deleted because of missing values in the

highest grade completed variable for the mother or the father. Even individuals from a broken home

were likely to report a highest grade completed for both parent-s.

3. Data on Local Labor Market Conditions

         We describe the County Average Earnings variable in this section, From the NLSY data we

know the state and county for each respondent for each year of the survey starting in 1978. and for

the state at age 14. It also has county unemployment rates for each year. However, since we could

identi& each state and county, we merged into our data a supplementary data set from the Bureau of

Economic Analysis' containing more detailed measures of labor market conditions by industry for the



   'We would like to thank Joe Hotz and Seth Sanders for supplying us with the tapes and
documentation for these data.


                                                    2
years 1969 to 1986. These data, collected mostly from state unemployment insurance programs,

contain measures of total full-time and part-time employment and earnings both in the county and

state for each major industry. Using these measures, we constructed variables for average earnings

per job for each skilled industry by county and state for tacit individual in the NLSY.

4. Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery

        In 1980, the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) was administered to

NLSY respondents, with a completion rate for the total sample of approximately 94%. The NLSY

respondents were ages 16 to 23 when the test was taken. Groups of S to 10 persons were tested at

more than 400 sites throughout the country, and each individual was given a 50 dollar honorarium for

completing the test.

        The ASVAB consists of a battery of ten tests: general science, arithmetic reasoning, word

knowledge, paragraph comprehension, numerical operations, coding speed, auto and shop

information, mathematics knowledge, mechanical comprehension, and electronics information. The

military uses ASVAB scores to determine eligibility and assignment qualifications for new enlistees.

In particular, the Armed Services Qualification Test (AFQT) sums word knowledge, arithmetic

reasoning, paragraph comprehension, and one-half of numeric operations. The AFQT is a general

measure of trainability and isa primary criterion for enlistment eligibility for the Armed Forces. It is

the measure of ability used in our analysis.



5. Analysis of Wages and Labor Supply
        To examine the effects of having a GED or High School diploma on hourly wages and labor

supply, we take a subset of our data that were sampled at ages 25 and 28. For 25-year-olds, we

include everyone between ages 16 and 20 in January of 1978. Altogether, 3139 individuals from the

random hispanic supplement and black supplement are interviewed at age 25. For our study of wages


                                                    3
 at age 28, we could include only those ages 19 and 20 and a portion of those who were age 18 in

 January of 1978, for a total of 1284. Of these, approximately 6.5% were dropped at each age

 because of missing values in the job tenure variables, or because hourly wages were greater than $50

 or less than $.40 (1967 dollars). Our sample has 2926 males age 25, and 1199 males age 28 years

old. For those few in the military, the hourly wage was constructed using a measure of military

income that includes allowances for housing and food and other special pay. Hourly wage is scaled

in 1967 dollars and is the wage received on the current or last job during the time of the interview. If

an individual was enrolled in college during the past survey year, he was counted as being enrolled in

college and was excluded from our analysis on wages. Those who were counted as unemployed or

out-of-the-labor force for a reason other than school attendance were those with no job during the

survey year who were not in school. Definitions of all the variables used in this analysis, including

those used in the decision rule for the selection correction follow.

6. Where the GED is Obtained

         Table A-I presents evidence on where individuals obtained the GED. Roughly 10-13% of thefl

sample obtains the GED in the military. (These persons are older than our sample average.

Beginning in the early 1980', the all-voluntary-military reauired a GED or high school graduation for

admission). Roughly 3% of all GEDs were obtained in college programs. Blacks are much more

likely and whites are much less likely to receive GED degrees while in government-sponsored-training

programs. The black and white roles reverse in attainment of GED degrees while working.

  The cells are detined exc usively according to which program was taken most recently, though
       overlap between cells was minimal. GED must have been received between January 1, 1978
       and the interview date in 1987.
   The individual is counted in one of these cells if he had attended the program within four months
       of receiving the GED.


7. Intra-family Correlations

       One feature of the NLSY sampling scheme is that it includes all children living in a

randomly-chosen household who were in the relevant age range. Since we can identify household

                                                  S
members in the data, we estimate the Intra-class correlation coefficient for houshold members apply a

GLS to the log-wage and log-hours regressions reported in the text. The estimates change little from

the OLS estimate. For example, in Model 1 at age 25 with only black and hispanic indicator

variables and High School graduate and GED indicators, we estimated the intra4amily coefficient

component to be .095. Twenty-three percentof the sample have a brother who was working at age

25. Applying a standard GLS procedure we obtain the following estimates (t statistics are in

parentheses):


                                                  01_s                               cl_S

                GED                          .0535 (1.395)                      .0541 (1.411)

      High School Graduate                   .1892 (7.825)                      .1900 (7.869)



The change is only about 1% for the estimated GED coefficient and associated test statistic. It is even

less for High School graduates. For the other specifications reported in Table ISA, the estimated

intra-family coefficient was between .085 and .069. Similarly trivial changes in the estimates were

found in the other specifications as well.




                                                   6
                                                Appendix B

        The wage equation at ages 25 and 28 is

We seek to estimate die parameter vector . We use a sample of working persons not in college.

Wages of working students - most of whom hold part-time jobs - are excluded, We correct for both

sources of exclusion: not-working and 0in college. We specify linear utility functions. For

individual i,

(B-i)           U11 = Xfl1 + V11         (working and not enrolled in college at the indicated age in the

                                         survey year following ages 25 or 28)

                   = Xfl2 + V          (enrolled in college in survey year following ages 25 or 28)

                U, = V,                (not working in survey year following ages 25 or 28)

We have thus normalized the coefficients of the regressors in U, to zero, so that we have for each

individual i,
                                                                                 -

                          = Pr(V11 - V > XMr$i), V11 - V,1 > - Xfl1).

                       Lettingt711 = V11-V and                    =   V11-V,1,

The covariance matrix of (V11, V,, V) has the following form:


                                               40
                                '- 4I 10

                                                      1
We estimate the parameters 5,. fl2, and the covariance matrix of11 and          using the multinomial

probit algorithm of Borsch-Supan and Hajivassiliou (1990). Assuming that can be decomposed into

a normal and non-normal additive component      Pu   with the latter unaffected by selection, we obtain

(B-3)                                                 +p1       p A.;,    j = 1,2.
For the wage equation, we have

                        + 'EØ I          > X2-$1), > - Xflj.
Using estimates of 5. 52, and the covariance matrix of q, and         we evaluate the two truncated

moments above, using equation (3) on page 225 of Talus (1961), using Monte Carlo simulation to

form the orohahilicies in that expression. A thousand replications were taken to compute each

probability accurately. The parameters 4,       and 72 are then   estimated from the wage equation.

        For the models with no selection, we use the McKinnon-Wbite (1985) standard errors to

account for more general forms of heteroskedasticity. For models with selection, we need to correct

for the variance of the estimated parameters in the first step. The selection-corrected regression is

                         In W4   = 4 + t1X1W1fl2,V) + 72X2(fl1ft,,V) +         ,,
where fi and $2 are defined above and V is the covariance matrix of SI and 5,. Rewriting we have


            1nW —        + y1A1(A,,BJ +


                 + Y'(X,(P',Pk)     —

                                                     2
The third and fourth terms arise from the error due to the variance in estimated parameters from the

first step. The covariance matrix we use is formed by taking McKinnon-White standard errors on the

diagonal. The off-diagonal elements are the elements from the estimated error in the first-step

estimation, from above.

        MOdel 2 is defined inclusively for samples of persons who have not attended college up to

ages 25 or 28. They may have taken non-collegiate training courses.

        U1, U2, U, refer, respectively, to:

                 U1    working and never attended college at indicated age for the survey year.

                 U2 = ever attended college by indicated age.

                U, = not working at indicated age for the survey year.
Coefficients and estimation procedures are identical to those defined for Model I.

        The coefficients of the probit models used to generate the sample selection corrections for

samples at ages 25 and 28 are given in Tables B-I and B-2, respectively. A positive coefficient

indicates that an increase in the associated variable raises the probability of being in the state relative

to a no-work-no-college state. There are few surprises in this table. A minor surprise is that

family income at age Li raises the probability that a person works and does not attend college relative

to the no-work-not-attending-college state.

                                           Goodness-of-fit Tests

        To assess the fit of the model to the data, we calculate goodness-of-fit tests that compare data

simulated from our model to the actual data. From the wage equation and equation (B-2) above, we

have

                         In W1 = ZQ + yiii + 7'7a + P.
        We assume {,j, i} and p1 are normally distributed. The validity of our estimation results do

not require that p1 is normal; however, we make this assumption to perform the goodness-of-fit tests

and gauge the performance of the model,' The parameters , y,, and y, are estimated from the wage

regression, and the normalized covarlance matrix, V, of (,, 'bj is estimated from the multinomial

probit. The s in equation (B-I) are also estimated by multinomial probit.

        We generate the simulated data in the following way. First, for those working, i.e., in state I

in (B-I), we calculate X1( - fi,) and -Xfi,. We then draw a bivariate normal with mean zero and

covariance V; if171 > X,($2 - $,) and 173> -Xfl1, then we form c =            + 7217n + A where p1 is

distributed normally with mean zero. The variance of p is calculated in the following way: estimate

the variance oft, Var (e), from the residuals of the selection-corrected wage regression. However,

Var(c) =      Var(,) + y' Vn(i) + 1', 72 Cov(%,IS + Var(p). We know y,, y, and the elements

of the covariance matrix V; so we have identified Var(p). Using the estimates of from the wage

equation, we thus calculate

                W = ZQ + 71171 + 7:'lm + Pi.

Following this procedure for each individual 1000 times, we then calculate the predicted distribution

using the simulated data. We then compare the predicted distribution against the empirical

distribution and calculate a Kolmogrov-Smirnov statistic, which tells us the maximum vertical distance

between the empirical and predicted distributions. We also form a chi-square test.2 The chi-square

test is constructed as follows. Let P,,(t) and P2(t) denote the predicted and empirical distributions.

At the decile-values of the predicted distribution, we evaluate

                where (U = P,(Q - P,(t-1)
                and     I(t) =         - P(-1)


    'Allowing p to be non-normal in a general way enables the unconditional (on the regressors)
distribution to be perfectly fit, although obviously not all conditional distributions can be fit rovlded
that the distribution of p1 is not permitted to depend on regressors in an arbitrary fashion).

   'These tests should be corrected for parameter estimation. However, as discussed in Heckman
and Walker (1990), these corrections have been shown to be of secondary importance in numerous
applications and so we do not perform them here,

Summingover i, we obtain a chi-square statistic with four degrees of freedom.
