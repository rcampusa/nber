        Death, Population Growth, Productivity Growth and Debt Neutrality




                                    ABSTRACT




         Debt neutrality is said to occur if, given a program for public
spending on current goods and services over time, the real equilibrium of the
economy (private consumption, investment, relative prices, etc.) is
independent of the pattern of government borrowing and lump—sum taxation over
time. The paper brings together work of Blanchard on individual uncertain
lifetimes and debt neutrality and Weil on population growth and debt
neutrality. It is shown that there will be debt neutrality if and only if the
sum of the rate of growth of population and the individual probability of
death equals zero. If this condition holds, non—zero rates of growth of labor
productivity will not destroy debt neutrality.

t.   Introduction

         This paper reconsiders the necessary arid sufficient conditions for

debt neutrality. There is debt neutrality if, given a program for public

expenditure on current goods and services over time, the real equilibrium of

the economy is not affected by a change in the pattern over time of Lump—sum

taxes. If there is debt neutrality for instance, the substitution of

borrowing today for lump—sum taxation today (followed by such further changes

in the time path of future lump—sum taxes as are required for maintaining

government solvency) does not affect the current and future behavior of

private consumption and capital formation.

         I consider this issue in a simple closed economy growth model. There

is a single produced commodity which can be consumed privately, consumed

publicly or used in private capital formation. Population and labor supply

grow at the constant exogenous instantaneous proportional rate n. Labor—

augmenting technical hange occurs atthe constant exogenous instantaneous

proportional rate   it.   Private   consumption behavior is modeled following the

Yaari—Blanchard uncertain lifetimes approach (Yaari [1965], Blarichard [1984,

1985]). The constant instantaneous probability of death of each individual is

XO.
         The paper combines the results of Blanchard [1984, 1985] about debt

neutrality and uncertain lifetimes and of Weil [1985] about debt neutrality

and population growth and completes the triad by considering the implications

of productivity growth for debt neuerality.

         Blanchard showed that uncertain life;:imes (x >     0)   are sufficient for

absence of debt neutrality. They drive a wedge between effective (risk—

adjusted) private sector discount rates and government discount rates. The

future flow of resources expected to be available to those private agents
SUD/wb—1/082786                      — 2 —




currently   alive grows at the exponential. rate 1T—X. Governments can tax the

resources not only of those private agents currently alive, but also of those

yet to be born. Their resource base grows at the exponential rate 1T+n.          In

Blanchard's model, the size of the total population is non—stochastic and

constant. Weil showed that even with infinite—lived consumers, population

growth alone (n > 0) would, again by expanding the intertemporal. resource

base of the government beyond that available to those households currently

alive, destroy debt neutrality. For debt neutrality, intergenerational

linkages are necessary (say through an operative bequest motive). Infinite

horizons for "isolated" individual consumers are insufficient if n          0.

         In this paper I show that A + n = 0 is necessary and sufficient for

debt neutrality. It follows that, as long as A + n = 0, non—zero

productivity growth (iT    0) does not destroy neutrality. The intuition is
that productivity growth, with A + n =   0,   augments equally the future

resource bases of the individual consumer and the government.

         I also show that, even though the probability of death A and

population growth enter additively in the criterion for debt neutrality,

changes in A will have different effects on the economy from changes in n

(and changes in it).

         Section II develops the model. Section III gives the conditions fcir

debt neutrality in a rather general way, for any pattern of Lump—sum taxaticn

over time that is consistent with government s&.vency. Section IV gives a

more detailed analysis of a specific kind of ta policy: a short—run cut in

lump—sum taxes which, over time, is transformed into a long—run increase in

lump—sum taxes. Section V uses this example to illustrate the different

effects of changes in A, n and it on the behavior of the economic system.

II.   The Model

          A. The Individual's Consumption Behavior

          I shall use the simplest version of the Yaari—Blanchard model of

consumer behavior (Yaari [1985]), Blanchard [1984, 1985]). The only novelty

is in the consideration of population growth and productivity growth in the

subsection on aggregation.

          At each instant t, a consumer born at time s                t solves the

following problem.


                                = max                —ó(v—t) —
(1)       max          W(s,t)               Et Se           thc(s,v)dv               tS > 0

          f(s,v)}                 f(s,v)}


Et is the expectation operator conditional on period t information; c is

individual consumption of the single good;            tS is the pure rate of time

preference. During his or her lifetime each consumer faces a common and

constant instantaneous probability of death (or probability of dynastic

extinction through childlessness) X >           0.   The probability at time t of

surviving until time v            t is therefore given by e1t). Equation (1) can

therefore be rewritten as



          max
                        .-   —(6+X)(v—t) —

                                        xnc(s,v)dv




          The consumer's instantaneous flow budgt identity is given by

         a is the consumer's financial or non—human weaLth. r is the

instantaneous real interest rate, w the real wage and r lump—sum taxes net of

transfers.

         The term Xa on the r.h.s of (3) reflects the operation of efficient

life insurance or annuities markets. Each consumer makes the following

contract with an insurance company: as long as he (she) lives, (s)he receives

a rate of return p on his (her) total financial asset holdings at each

instant. When (s)he dies, the entire estate accrues to the insurance

company. (If a is negative, the consumer pays the insurance company a

premium rate p, with his (her) debt cancelled when (s)he dies). The

insurance industry is competitive with free entry. There is a large number of

people (or 'cohort') born at each instant, and A is both the instantaneous

probability of death for an individual and the fraction of each cohort (and

therefore of the total population) which dies at each instant. The

competitive (zero expected) profit) rate of return paid by or to the insurance

company is therefore p = A.      (Note, not p = n + A, where ri is the

instantaneous proportional population growth rate. A fraction A of each

cohort dies each instant, so a fraction A of the economy's non—human wealth

accrues to the insurance companies each instant. It is this that gets paid

out by the insurance companies to the surviving agents).

         Integrating (3) forward in time and imposing the terminal boundary

condition (4), we obtain the individual househc:ld's intertemporal budget

constraint or solvency constraint given in (5a.b)

h is the consumer's human capital, the present discounted value (using the

"risk—adjusted" discount rate r + A) of expected future ater—tax labor

           The consumption function generated by this maximization program is

well—known to be:



(6)        (s,t) =       ('S   +   x)( (s,t) + (s,t))

           Equations (3.), (5b') and (6) imply

      B.   Aggregation.

           At each instant a new age cohort composed of many agents is born.

The size of the cohort born at time t is (n                          X)ert, n     0. Since A, the

(constant) instantaneous probability of death of an agent, is also the

fraction of agents in each cohort which die at each instant, the size of the

surviving cohort at time t which was born at time s                             t is (n+X) ens e(t9).

Total population at any instant t is given by (n+X) et £te                              +n)sds =   etlt
           For any individual agent's stock or flow variable                           (s,t) we define

the corresponding population aggregate V(t) to be

           Each agent, regardless of age, earns the same wage income and pays

the same taxes, i.e.




(8a)        (s,t) =




(8b)       (s,t) =    t)
           It   follows that each surviving agent has the same human capital.



(8c)        (s,t) =




           By straightforward direct computation, and using the notational

convention given in (7), aggregate consumption is given by:



(9a)       C(t) =   (+x)   (A(t) +   H(t))


(9b)       A(t)     r(t) ACt) +   W(t)   —   T(t)   —   C(t)


(9c)       H(t)     (r+X+n) H(t) +   T(t)    —   W(t)   V

      assets or liabilities.

2/ We use (t,t)e =         (t)e1t
SUD/wb—1/08—27—86                               — 7 —




         The absence of a XA term in (9b), unlike in (3), reflects the fact

that the insurance companies' activities involve a transfer from those who die

to those who survive, which does not alter the rate of return on aggregate

non—human wealth. The presence of the nH term in (9c) reflects the fact that

all surviving agents, even the newborn, have the same human capital.

         There is a constant instantaneous proportional rate of growth of

productivity r. Technical change is labor—augmenting or Harrod—rieutral. By

choice of units, the level of productivity at t = 0 is set equal to unity.

         For each population aggregate stock or flow variable V, the

corresponding quantity "per unit of labor measured in efficiency units," v, is

defined by:



(10)     v(t)




         Using-this notational convention, consunption per unit of efficiency

labor is governed by:



(ha) .   c =



(hib)           (r—(n+ir))a   + w —   r   — c




(llc)    i      (r+X—i)h + t — w



         These last three equations imply:



(12)          = Cr —   (S+it+X))c — (t5+X)na + (o+x)xh

           C.   Production, the public sector and market equilibrium

         Production is governed by a smooth twice—continuously differentiable

neoclassical constant returns to scale production function. Capital and

efficiency units of Labor are the two inputs. Let y denote output per unit of

efficiency labor and k capital per unit of efficiency labor, then:



(13a)    y = f(k); f'>O; f">O; f(O)=O; urn f'=co; urn f'O.
                                       k-O


Competitive labor and financial markets ensure that:




(13b)    r =




(13c)    w = f(k) -   kf'(k).

         Note that w is the wage rate per unit of efficiency labor. When w is

constait, each worker's wage grows at the proportional rate ir.

         The government spends on goods and services g, levies lump—sum taxes

t and borrows by issuing government debt. (g, r and b are per unit of

efficiency labor)




if   I am assuming that government spending on goods and services is neither
     useful as public sector capital formation nor as public consumption in the
     private utility function. g could be entered additively into the
     intantaneous private utility function withoi.t affecting any of the results
     (except of course the welfare economics of variations in g). For the
     issue of debt neutrality, the role of g is not relevant.
SUD/wb—1/08—27—86                           — 9 —




         The government's instantaneous budget identity is:



(14)     b   g —   t + (r —   (n+n))b


         Integrating the government's budget identity forward in time and

imposing the terminal, boundary condition given in (15) we obtain the familiar

government intertemporal or present value budget constraint, or its solvency

constraint, given in (16).

         Equilibrium in the goods market requires that:

debt, it follows that:

III. Debt (non—) Neutrality: A General Statement

         It is evident from equations (11) to (18) that., given a path of gt),

variations in the government's paths or rules fcr lump—sum taxes, 'r, can only

affect current and/or future values of c, k, y, w and r by influencing private

consumption. The conditions for debt neutrality are therefore simply the
SUD/wb—1/082786                            — 10 —




conditions   for c to be independent of the current and future vaLues of r, as

long as the path of g is left unchanged. In what follows, the analysis is

restricted to paths or ruLes for r consistent with government solvency, as

defined in (16): the present discounted value of future primary (i.e. net of

interest) government surpluses should be equal to (and therefore sufficient to

service) the initial debt. The.relevant discount rate is the real interest

rate net of the rate of growth of labor in efficiency units r—(n+ir).

Population growth and productivity growth both expand the future resource base

on which the government éan Levy taxes to serve the debt.

         Integrating (lic) forward in time and imposing the terminal boundary

condition (19), we obtain human capital per unit of labor measured in

efficiency units, h, as given in (20).



(19)     Urn h(Z)e                     0


                                 rv

(20)     h(t) =   f(w(v)—r(v)e                      dv



         Substitute for h(t) in the consumption function (ha) using (20) and

for a(t) using (18). Then add and subtract the term



                                 )+X-)du
         (+x) fg(v)et


and rearrange. This yields:



(21)     c(t)     (+x) (k(t) +        w(v)e1t              dv)




                —(+x) fg(v)e1t

                                                                                       +X-du

                      The last term on the r.h.s. of (21) is the crucial one for debt

neutrality. Comparing it with the government solvency constraint (16) shows

that this last term on the r.h.s. of (21) will vanish i.f.f. X + n =                                         0.
If A +.n *              0,   i.e. in practice (ignoring the case of negative population

growth) if X + n >                  0, debt neutrality will not hold. This is the most
general statement of the conditions for debt neutrality. What follows becomes

more specific by putting some restrictions on the paths of taxes.

                      Consider two economies identical in all respects except for the

initial stock of debt, which is greater in economy I, and for current and

future lump—sum taxes which differ between the two economies in such a way as

to ensure government solvency for, both economy I and economy II, in spite of

the larger initial stock of debt in economy I. I.e.                                      =           =

government solvency with b'(t) >                          b(t) we require, from (16) that

(22)               b'(t) -       b(t) = S(itI(v)_T(v))e_1tfr_1 dv >                                      0




                  Adding and subtracting the term 1(rI(v)_t (v))e1t dv
in (22) and rearrtnging yields:

            It   is clear that the higher initiaL debt in economy I could be

serviced by tax policies that have r1(v)                  () for

all v     t and t1(v) > t11(v) for at least one finite interval of time beyond

t. For all such policies, the second term on the r.h.s. of (23) is strictly

positive for X +      n > 0. It equ4ls zero for A + n = 0.

           Let us call this term (t), i.e.



(24)       (t) =



           It    is the excess of the present discounted value of the differences

in future taxes using the government's effective discount rate r—(n+-IT) over

the present discounted vaLue of the differences in future taxes using the

private sector's effective discount rate r+X—.

           TFe difference in private consumption between the two economies is

given by


(25)       c1(t) —    cH(t)     (cS+X) Q(t).



           For the strictly higher path of taxes in economy I (i.e.

with r (v)       -r   (v) for all v and t   (v)   > -r   (v) for some finite

interval), 2(t) is strictly positive if and only if A + n > 0, because in that

case the household sector discounts a positive stream of differences using a

higher effective discount rate than the government.




1/ This result will alo hold for many policies for which J() < rtt(v) for
    some finite interval(s), but the proofs be:ome very case—specific. The
       behavior of taxes in the model studied in Section IV is characterized by
       r1(v) < r(v) for smalL v and t1(v) > (v) for large v.

          To establish absence of debt neutrality, we only have to show

that c (t)       c (t) if b (t) * b         Ct) and only lump—sum taxes differ between

economies I andil to maintain government solvency. In fact we have shown

more, by establishing a strong presumption of "financial crowding out":

b1(t) >   b(t) was seen to imply c'(t) > cU(t)                     if and only if A + n > 0 for

the class of tax policies considered. How this incipient increase in private

consumption is translated into actual behavior is very model—specific, as it

depends on the behavior of current and future expected interest rates and wage

rates. Some degree of financial crowding out seems likely, however, and the

closed economy example solved in the next section confirms this. In a small

open economy with an exogenous interest rate, the crowding out would take the

form of public debt displacing net foreign assets rather than real capital

(see Blanchard (1985) and Buiter (1986a)).

          The findings of this section can be summarized as follows:

          Proposition:.          A +   n   = 0 is necessary and sufficient for debt

                                 neutrality

          Corollary:             if A + n =    0,   ir       *0   does not invalidate debt

                                 neutrality.

          Finally note that Blanchard's measure of fiscal stance F(t) becomes

(see Blanchard (1935)).



(26)      F(t)     g(t) -   (6   + A) fg(v)et'du dv

                                                         t
                 + (5+X)(b(t)—f(t(v)—g(v))e                              dv)




          We have aLready discussed the third term on the r.h.s. of (26), the

financing term. The first and second term given the effect of public spending
SUD/wb—1/082786                                         — 14   —




on aggregate (private pLus public) consumption demand, at given current and

expected future interest rates and wage rates. Demand is boosted by public

consumption spending to the extent that its current value exceeds the

"permanent" value defined by the second term on the r.h.s. of (26).



IV.      Financial    Crowding Out and Fiscal Policy: An Example

               In this section, I complete the model of Section II by adding a

behavioral relationship for taxes which has the following properties: (1) it

almost certainly stabilizes the public debt process; (2) it pins down very

transparently the change in the long—run level of taxes and (3) a long—run

increase in taxation is preceded by a short—run cut in taxes and vice versa.

As shown in (27) r feeds back from the deficit.



(27)             =   t + 8b             0<    —1




              Under this rule, the debt dynamics is governed by:



(28)          b = (1 +    )1     (g -
                                        r0)
                                              +    (1 +            Cr - (n +   r))   b



              In the long run (b =        0),      taxes are given by r0. An increase

in
      it0,
             however, implies in the short run a reduction in it which disappears

gradually and changes into an eventual increase:



(29)          it =       it0 +      g +            (r   —   (n + it))b


              I have assumed, as I shall in .ihat follows, that r > n +                  ii, i.e.   ti-at


the "intrinsic" debt—deficit dynamics is expLosive, because the real interest

rate    r exceeds the long—run growth rate of the tax base, n +                  r.   Assigning the

value —2 to 8 as was done in Buiter (1986a) results in the debt—deficit

process becoming the exact mirror image of what it would be under exogenous

taxes (e =     0) since with 8 =          —2   we have



(29')      t   =          + 2g +   2(r—(n+r))b
           and

         The dy-nami        system in (31)           has two predetermined state variables (k

(Locally)    unique continuously convergent solution to (21), the characteristic

equation (32a) should have two stable characteristic roots,                    and p2 say,

with negative real parts and one unstable (positive) characteristic

root, P3    say.

            A necessary condition for there to be the desired saddlepoint

configuration is b0       det(S) > 0.    Since 8 < —1, the term inside the curly

brackets in (32d) should be negative. In open economy versions of this model

with perfect capital mobility, r and therefore k is fixed exogenously and the

second term inside the curly brackets of (32d) is absent. In these models the

saddlepoint condition becomes (see Blanchard (1985) and Buiter (1986a).):



(34)        (r—(is+x+n+lr))(r+x—1T)(r—(n+1T)) <       0



            This will be satisfied if

b) hold. 1"

            A positive value of b0      det(S) could have been generated by three

unstable roots rather than two stable and one unstable root. Given det(S) 0,

the desired saddlepoint configuration. It is clear from (32c) and (35a, b)
that r   S+1T is sufficient for b1 < 0.          It can also be checked easily

that with 8 = —2, the first two terms on the r.h.s. of (32c) sum to

—[X(X++n)+n+(r—(n+r))2}. This will be negative if r >                  n+i.   Since the last

term on the r.h.s. of (32c) is also negative, the conditions given in (35a,b)

are sufficient for the desired saddlepoint configuration if 0 = —2.

          In long—run steady—state equilibrium, a = b = k                0 and



          c =     (S+X)(a+h)


          c =     (r—(n+rr))a +       w—t0

          r =     f'(k)

         w =      f(k)    —   kf(k)

         These seven equations determine the long—run equilibrium values of c,

a, h, b, k, w and r as functions of g,                , X,   n and .     The key long—run

values of k and           can be solved conveniently from (36a, b).

           From (35a, b) it follows that N < 0.

           The remaining long—run multipliers will be discussed in the next

section.

           Since the assumption that r > n+lr and r < n+X+rr+5 implies N < 0, it

follows that a higher long—run level of lump—sum taxes is associated with a

lower long—run capital stock (4,                   < 0) unless n + A =       0 in which case debt

neutrality prevails and the long—run capital stock is unaffected. I!

           A higher long—run level of public consumption is associated with a

higher long—run capital stock when A + a > 0. Consider the case where X+n=G.

From equation (11') it follows that stationary equilibria with a non—zero

vaLue of c are characterized by r6+r. In that case, changes in g will not be

associated with any long—run changes in k but will simply displace an equal

amount of private consumption (see equation 36b'. Whether these are short—run

effects   on capital. formation from an increase in g when X+n=0 depends on

whether the current change in public spending is equal to or differs from the

"permanent" level fg(v)et(_dUdv (see equation 26).
          Note that (37b) confirms our Proposition and its Corollary: debt

neutrality (1 = 0) requires n+X0; if n+X0, rO does not destroy debt
               to
neutrality. It is the difference between the public sector's future tax base

(the resources of individuals alive today or yet to be born) and the future

tax base of the individuals that are alive today (the resources owned by those

individuals only, and not the resources of individuals yet to be born) that

accounts for the non—neutrality of variations over time in the pattern of

lump—sum taxation. The individual's expected future flow of resources grows

at •a rate g—X. The government's expected future flow of resources grows at a

rate iv+n. Unless an individual is linked, through intergenerational gift and

bequest motives to all those born after himself (herself), the resources of

these future generations are not integrated into his (her) intertemporal

budget constraint. An infinite lifetime (X = 0) is not the same as

intergenerational concern, nor does it imply the ability to effect the desired

intergenerational transfers of resources. Productivity growth, when n+X0,

augments the individual's resources over time in the same way as it augments

the government's tax base.

          The specific "crowding out" story associated with an increase

in    in our model is some intrinsic interest. Take for concreteness the case

where O=—2. From (29') it is clear'that, since rf'(k) is given at a point .n

time, an increase in long—run lump—sum taxes      implies an equal and

oppositive reductioi in taxes at the initial date t0. From (28') this

generates a government deficit which is financed by borrowing. As the debt

increases taxes are raised until they exceed their initial vaLue and rise
SUD/wb—l/08—27—86                             — 21 —




beyond it to the new higher level of           r.    Capital will be decumulated inthe
process, which will raise the interest rate. Taxes, however, respond to such

debt—service increases (see 29'). The higher taxes in the long run are

required to service the increased stock of debt due to the early deficits

associated with the early tax cut. Since the stable roots may be complex—

conjugate, the approach to the steady state may involve oscillatory

behavior. The details of the dynamic adjustment will depend on whether and

when the change in             was anticipated.

         The higher volume of 1-ong—run debt is associated with a long—run

capital stock (            < 0 in (37b)) and thus a higher interest rate. That the

long—run stock of debt is indeed higher can be seen from



         db —          1       —        b
                    r—n—ii)        r—(n+)

        At given izterest rates, a higher value of           will raise a

if +rr>r, lower a otherwise. The decline in w as k declines reinforces

this. The endogeneityof r does, however, leave the total effect ambiguous:

                                   (r+A—ir) (r—(n+Tr+S+X))



            The dynamic story for the increase in g is also quite intuitive.

Spending is raised at tt0 and is kept at its new higher level. From (29'),

however, taxes are increased immediately by twice the amount of the increase

in g. A budget surplus results and debt is retired. As debt is retired,

taxes gradually (possibly in an oscillating manner) go back to their initial

value t0.     The lower debt and lower debt service (note that since k increases

in the long run, r falls) permit the higher long—run level of public spending

with unchanged long—run taxes. The exact time pattern of consumption and

capital accumulation will of couse depend on whether or not the increase in g

was anticipated, when it was anticipated etc.

            Even though the population growth rate n an the probability of

death X enter the criterion for debt neutrality symmetrically, i.e. as n+X,

change in n will not affect any endogenous variable of the system in the same

way as a change in X, unless (1) these changes are evaLuated at kn0 (and

endogerious variables (k, r and w but not c, h, b and a) are considered. This

can be shown by solving for the remaining long—run reduced form derivatives of

             Not surprisingly, an increase in the rate of time preference, an

increase in the population growth rate and an increase in the rate of labor—

augmenting technical change all reducethe long—run capital—Labor ratio

a reduction in life expectancy will also reduce long—run k unless r is very

much below ir+.

If   r >   it + S and b > 0, the sign of -           depends on the specific values of

the parameters.

            When A = n = 0 and r =         it + tS (37e to h) become

            Thus when there is debt neutrality, a small increase in A or in n

will have the same effect on k. A smaLl increase in 6 will have the same

effect on kas small increase in it.             The effects on c of small changes

in A and n around zero will of course be quite different from each other since

in that case

VI. Conclusion

            The Yaar—Blanchard model of consumer behavior has been generalized

to allow for popuLation growth and productivity growth. Blanchard's finding,

in models without population growth and produc:ivity growth, that uncertain

lifetimes destroy debt neutrality and Weil's finding that, in a model without

uncertain lifetimes and productivity growth, population growth alone destroys

debt neutraLity, are special cases of the genetal model. If and only if the
SUD/wb—1/08—2786                     — 25 —




sum of the population growth rate and the individual's probability of death is

zero will there be debt neutrality. Non—zero productivity growth by itself

does, not destroy debt neutrality.

          Note that debt neutrality, when X+n0, occurs because the government

satisfies its intertemporal present value budget constraint, i.e. because the

government is solvent in the sense defined by equation (16).   It is therefore

not correct to say, if X+n0, that debt neutrality implies that the

government's tax program doesn't matter. The correct statement is that any

tax   program that maintains solvency doesn't matter. If solvency is
threatened, i.e. if the terminal condition that the present discounted value

(using r—(n+ir) to discount) of the debt burden (debt per unit of efficiency

labor or debt—GDP ratio) goes to zero does not hold, there will not be debt

neutrality, regardless of the value of n+X.

          The analysis has been deliberately restricted to the case of lump—

sum, non—dI-stortionary taxes. Non lump—sum taxes have (dis)incentive effects

that will destroy debt neutrality even when n+X0 and the government remains

solvent. Here too, however, the Yaari—Blanchard model contributes something

new. As shown in Buiter (1986b), when there is a single "conventional"

distortion such as a non—lump—sum tax, changes in the distortionary tax rate

may have first—order income effects even when they are evaluated at a zero

value of the distortionary tax rate. This result occurs when r6+r, which can

be the case in well—behaved stationary equilibria of the Yaari—BLanchard model

if n+X*O. The discrepancy between the interest rate and the pure rate of time

preference plus :he rate of labor augmentatior. acts like a second, "intrinsic"

distortion and lands us in the realm of second—best even when there is but oie

conventional, distortion.

         Finally,   the Yaari—Blanchard model     may well become the workhorse

of the late eighties for analytical macroeconomic research and teaching,

because of its simplicity and flexibility.
