This paper reviews the basic theoretical models that are appropriate for analyzing different types
of welfare reforms, and the related empirical literature. We first present the canonical labor
supply model of a classical welfare program, and then extend this basic framework to include in-
kind transfers, incomplete take-up, human capital, preference persistence, and borrowing and
saving. The empirical literature on these models is presented. The negative income tax, earnings
subsidies, US welfare reforms with features that differ from those in other countries, and child
care reforms are then surveyed both in terms of the theoretical model and the empirical literature
surrounding each.

    I. Introduction

    The relationship between welfare programs and the labor market is one of the oldest topics

of interest in modern labor economics. Also termed means-tested transfer programs because

they condition eligibility on current income and, possibly, assets, welfare programs potentially

have effects on labor supply and work effort, the outcome which has been studied the most.

This literature began in the 1960s and early 1970s, when the static model of labor supply was

applied to the work incentives of a negative income tax (NIT). Since that time, the static model

has been extended in many directions, to dynamic models in general and to models of life cycle

labor supply, human capital, marriage and child bearing, migration, and other outcomes in

particular.

    It is an international literature which has been closely tied to policy developments and to

proposed welfare reforms in different countries. Even the initial research interest in an NIT was

motivated by proposals by policy-makers for that particular reform which suggested that

reductions in the implicit marginal tax rate on earnings in a welfare program could increase labor

supply. Since that time, many countries have enacted significant changes in their programs,

introduced new types of programs, and have proposed others which have attracted research

attention even if not enacted. Across the countries, these new reforms include programs which

subsidize earnings or wage rates for low-income workers, provide in-kind benefits (food,

housing, or medical care), subsidize child care, impose job training or work requirements, and

impose time limits. Very commonly, an economics literature develops in the years after a major

reform in a country is enacted or proposed, developing new models appropriate to the policy in

question and analyzing its effects, often in new ways.




                                                1
    The close relationship between policy developments and labor market effects is well

illustrated by the history of earnings subsidies, traditional welfare programs, and child care

subsidies in the U.S. and the U.K. In the U.S., attempts were made in the 1960s to provide work

incentives in its main welfare program which set off the modern labor economics literature on

the labor supply effects of those reforms. But opposition to the NIT led to the very different

earnings subsidy, the 1975 Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which provided much stronger

earnings incentives but less support for nonworkers. Expanded in later years, the EITC has been

studied in economic research and has been shown to increase the labor force participation of

single mothers. Further concerns with disincentives of traditional welfare programs led to

reductions in benefits for nonworkers in 1996, but coupled with expansions in subsidies for child

care expenses while working and further increases in the EITC, creating what is known in the

U.S. as the “work-based safety net”. That combination of reforms has also been heavily studied

and, as we report below, has resulted in further increases in employment and hours although not

always increases in family income.

    In the UK, the situation has been different because benefits for nonworkers are much higher

than those in the US and there has been no movement to reduce them, so most reforms have been

to provide more work incentives in the presence of such high base benefits. From the Family

Income Supplement in 1971 to the Family Credit in 1988 to the Working Families Tax Credit in

1999 to the Working Tax Credit in 2003 to the Universal Credit in 2013, work incentives have

been reformed repeatedly, usually in a positive direction. Different from the U.S., some of these

programs have had minimum hours requirements (which have also changed over time) which

effectively create an earnings subsidy not dissimilar to the EITC (because tax rates can be

negative over a range). Much research in the UK has shown work-increasing effects of many of



                                                 2
the reforms. But some of these reforms, most prominently the most recent Universal Credit,

have attempted to simplify tax rates more than reducing them overall, with the result that work

incentives have gone up for some families and down for others. Many of these reforms have

also changed the relationship between child tax credits and welfare payments, and expenditures

for child care subsidies have also risen over time.

     This paper provides a review of the models appropriate to an analysis of these and other

types of reforms and provides a relatively brief summary of the empirical literature on each

reform type. Because the amount of work done over the past 50 years is vast, we mostly

concentrate on recent developments in the literature, although we provide select citations to the

older literature as well.1 For space reasons, we also do not spend a great deal of time discussing

econometric methods per se, although we will refer to them in our review of past studies and

what types of estimation methods have been used.

     The next section of the paper outlines the types of welfare reforms we will cover and their

policy history in different countries. Following that, we have a section on “basic” labor supply

models in the presence of welfare programs and the empirical evidence surrounding them, then

we have a section on the models and empirical evidence on four different types of reforms--

reductions in marginal tax rates as in an NIT, earnings subsidies, US-style reforms, and child

care reforms.

       II. Outline of Types of Welfare Reforms To Be Covered

       A welfare program, by definition, offers some kind of benefit or service to individuals or

families with income and, possibly, assets below some cutoff values. By definition, then, the

benefit or service must be eliminated at a high enough level of income or assets. We present the

basic static model of the labor supply effects of a standard welfare program in the first section

below and we show how it can be extended to include the analysis of in-kind transfers and of

incomplete takeup by eligibles, as well as extensions to dynamic models of the effect of welfare

programs in models of life cycle labor supply, human capital and preference persistence.

       The first type of reform we discuss is a change in the financial incentives in a standard

welfare program. The rate of elimination of benefits as income rises, usually termed the tax rate,

or benefit-reduction rate, varies widely across programs. Many welfare programs in

industrialized countries offer the largest benefit to those with the lowest incomes and then phase

out the benefit at a fairly high rate.        The main U.S. cash program for single mothers had a 100

percent tax rate for most of its history and many other OECD countries have programs with tax

rates exceeding 60 or 70 percent in their social assistance systems.2 Friedman (1962) was the

first economist to publicly criticize high tax rates in welfare programs for their potential work

disincentives, and advocated a reduction of the tax rate to increase work incentives. Because

Friedman proposed that it be operated through the U.S. tax system, the program was dubbed the

Negative Income Tax (NIT), which has come to be associated with the general idea of simply

reducing the tax rate on benefits in a welfare program.

       The second type of reform we will cover is that of earnings subsidies. Earnings subsidies

are a rather different type of welfare program that have become popular in several countries in

recent decades. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the U.S. is one example, as are several

programs in the UK which have evolved in form over the years but which all gave a substantial

benefit bonus if the recipient worked at least some minimum hours per week (those programs

have now been replaced). Several other countries have earnings tax credits in their tax code.

While the exact form of the subsidy differs across countries and programs, a common structure is

a simple one in which the individual or family receives a cash benefit from the government

which is positively related to the level of earnings. The subsidy rate in this case, which is

effectively a negative tax rate, determines the increase in the benefit per dollar of additional

earnings. Because it is a welfare program, eventually the benefit has to be phased out and, in

that range, the effect of the rate of phaseout is similar to that of a tax rate in a more conventional

welfare program. There are variations in the structure across countries but, whatever its exact

form, its work disincentives are quite different from those of more conventional welfare

programs.

     The third type of reform we discuss are more heavily associated with particular reforms in

the U.S. The most prominent examples are reforms which impose restrictions on the recipient

individual or family in the form of work requirements or time limits. In their strictest form, a

recipient is required to work a minimum number of hours in order to receive any benefit at all.3

A time limit rule allows the recipient to receive benefits for only a maximum period of time,

such as 5 years in the well known Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program in

the U.S. While work requirements have been implemented in mild forms in the UK, Canada,




3
  A milder form of requirement is a job training or job search requirement, rather than a requirement for an actual
job. We do not cover these requirements because they are an extension of the strict work requirement (although
they may have effects on human capital, which strict work requirements are usually assumed not to have).

                                                          5
and some other countries, they have been adopted in their strictest form in the U.S. Time limited

welfare has also been implemented in the most extensive way in the U.S.

    The final type of reform we cover are those which create or change subsidies for child care

costs. While child care subsidies are, formally, in-kind programs like those previously

discussed, they have a more direct relationship to work because they are most often offered only

to low income individuals who wish to use the child care while working rather than while at

home or in some other activity. Many countries offer subsidized child care to low income

families (Canada, UK, US, and other countries) and have implemented reforms in recent years.

    We should note that there are many important transfer programs we do not have the space to

cover. Social insurance programs such as Unemployment Insurance, Disability Insurance, and

retirement benefits have important labor market effects, as do means-tested programs for the

disabled. Child support programs are another important set of government policies with labor

market implications in many countries. Government health insurance programs, while touched

upon briefly in our review, have special features which make their labor market implications

rather different than those of most of the reforms we review.



    III. Basic Theoretical Framework

    III.A. Basic Models and Extensions

       Classic Static Labor Supply Model. The utility function is 𝑈(𝐻, 𝑌; 𝜃) where 𝐻 is hours

of work, 𝑌 is take-home income (equivalent to consumption in the static model), 𝜃 is a vector of

preference parameters varying in the population, and with 𝑈 assumed to satisfy the usual

concavity conditions and with leisure (the time residual from 𝐻) assumed to be a normal good.

The budget constraint is


                                                6
                                         𝑌 = 𝑊𝐻 + 𝑁 + 𝐵                                                   (1)

where 𝑊 is the hourly wage rate, 𝑁 is private nonlabor income, and 𝐵 is the welfare benefit.4

Assuming the benefit formula is 𝐵 = 𝑀𝑎𝑥{0, 𝐺 − 𝜏𝑊𝐻 − 𝑟𝑁}, where 𝐺 is the guaranteed

benefit for those with no income and where 𝜏 and 𝑟 are the tax rates on earned and nonlabor

income, respectively, the budget constraint can be rewritten as
                                                                                        𝐺−𝑟𝑁
                 𝑌 = 𝑊(1 − 𝜏)𝐻 + [𝑁(1 − 𝑟) + 𝐺]                              if   𝐻≤                      (2)
                                                                                         𝑊𝜏

                                                                                        𝐺−𝑟𝑁
                                     𝑌 = 𝑊𝐻 + 𝑁                              if   𝐻>                      (3)
                                                                                         𝑊𝜏

           ̃𝑁
     Let 𝐻(𝑊, ̃; 𝜃) be the labor supply function denoting optimal 𝐻 for an individual with

                                                                          ̃ and nonlabor
preferences 𝜃 who faces a linear budget constraint with net wage equal to 𝑊

                ̃ . Then optimal labor supply if 𝐵 > 0 can be written as 𝐻[𝑊(1 − 𝜏), 𝑁(1 −
income equal to 𝑁

𝑟) + 𝐺; 𝜃] and as 𝐻[𝑊, 𝑁; 𝜃] if 𝐵 = 0. The individual will choose the one which yields

maximum utility, which is most easily represented by use of the indirect utility function giving

the maximum utility obtainable for an individual facing a linear budget constraint with net wage

̃ and nonlabor income 𝑁
𝑊                     ̃ , denoted as 𝑉(𝑊
                                       ̃,𝑁
                                         ̃ ; 𝜃). Letting 𝑃 denote a welfare participation

indicator variable equal to 1 if the individual maximizes utility on welfare and equal to 0 if she

maximizes utility off welfare, the final labor supply function can be succinctly written as

                            𝐻 = 𝐻[𝑊(1 − 𝜏𝑃), 𝑁 + 𝑃(𝐺 − 𝑟𝑁); 𝜃]                                            (4)

                                          𝑃 = 1[𝑃 ∗ ≥ 0]                                                  (5)

                      𝑃∗ = 𝑉[𝑊(1 − 𝜏), 𝑁(1 − 𝑟) + 𝐺; 𝜃] − 𝑉[𝑊, 𝑁; 𝜃]                                      (6)

  For notational convenience, we suppress preference and wage shocks in the static model. Otherwise, the optimal
decision can be expressed as a function of preference parameters and realizations of shocks. See the dynamic model
for more details.

                                                        7
where 1[·] is the indicator function. It can be easily shown that the introduction of a welfare

program will either leave 𝐻 unchanged (if she does not go onto the welfare program) or reduce

𝐻 (if she does go onto welfare) since, in the latter case, both substitution and income effects

operate in a negative direction. Estimation of the model, given data on the budget constraint

variables, yields estimates of the parameters of 𝜃.5

        It can be shown formally with equation (6) but is intuitive that an increase in 𝑊 will

lower the probability of being on welfare. Equation (6) can likewise be used to define a

reservation wage 𝑊 ∗ as the value of 𝑊 that makes that equation equal to 0. Wages above that

value result in non-participation in welfare and wages below it result in participation.

        Three variations should be mentioned. First, the corner solution of 𝐻 = 0 is ignored in

this model. Allowing it requires the addition of utility at the corner, 𝑈(0, 𝑁 + 𝑃(𝐺 − 𝑟𝑁); 𝜃),

where 𝑃 = 1 if 𝑁 < 𝐺/𝑟. The individual chooses 𝐻 = 0 if this utility is greater than both values

of 𝑉 in their feasible ranges. Second, empirical work on labor supply has also often modelled

labor supply choice from among a discrete set of hours values 𝐻𝑗 , j=1,…,J, which has

computational advantages when the budget constraint is more complex than in this simple model.

A typical case is J=3 with the three hours choices of nonwork, part-time work, and full-time

work. In this case, the indirect utility function is not needed and the individual is just assumed to

choose the maximal 𝑈(𝐻𝑗 , 𝑌𝑗 ; 𝜃), where 𝑌𝑗 is the value of 𝑌 at 𝐻 = 𝐻𝑗 . 6 Third, many labor

supply models assume the existence of fixed costs of work, which implies that individuals will

not work at low values of 𝐻 and which typically fits the data better since such low values are

rarely observed. Since those costs are usually not measured in the available data, they must be

  The vector 𝜃 typically is also made a function of exogenous observables. A term for measurement or optimization
error is also usually tacked on to the end of the 𝐻 equation.

  Blundell and MaCurdy (1999, Section 6.7).

                                                        8
treated as an unknown parameter (or distribution) to be estimated. A term 𝛾1[𝐻 > 0] is usually

introduced, either in the utility function or the budget constraint, with the parameter 𝛾 to be

estimated simultaneously with the other parameters of the model.

       Non-participation of eligibles. In most means-tested transfer programs, a fraction of

those individuals who appear to be eligible for the program are not participating and receiving

benefits. While it could be that eligibility rules are complex and a researcher’s calculation of

who is eligible could have error, most non-participation rates are too large for that to be plausible

(e.g., up to 40 percent for the main U.S. food subsidy program). Three possible reasons which

have been put forth for low takeup of eligibles are (1) social stigma from being a welfare

recipient, (2) lack of information on eligibility, and (3) costs of participation, including time and

money costs as well as utility costs (“hassle”). Whatever the reason, their existence poses

problems for model estimation. If non-participants are simply assigned the non-welfare budget

constraint and participants are assigned the welfare budget constraint, parameter estimates will

be biased and inconsistent if participation is endogenous (i.e., correlated with work preferences).

If non-participation is ignored and all eligible individuals are assigned the welfare budget

constraint, then there is a danger of misspecification because some sample individuals (i.e.,

nonparticipants) do not, in fact, face that constraint.

    An alternative is to model non-participation directly. While some of the possible reasons for

non-participation should go into the budget constraint (time and money costs, for example),

others should go into the utility function (stigma, hassle). The literature has, by and large,

followed the latter interpretation, hoping that the factors in the former category can also be

picked up by a fixed cost of participation in the utility function, e.g., 𝑈(𝐻, 𝑌; 𝜃) − 𝜓𝑃, where 𝜓

represents the fixed cost (which can vary across the population and possibly be correlated with



                                                   9
𝜃). This specification can rationalize the data because it implies that some individuals who are

eligible for a positive benefit will not participate because the gains in 𝑈 from decreased 𝐻 and

increased 𝐶 are smaller than 𝜓. The labor supply function in this case consists of (4) to (6)

above but with (6) replaced by:

                   𝑃∗ = 𝑉[𝑊(1 − 𝜏), 𝑁(1 − 𝑟) + 𝐺; 𝜃] − 𝑉[𝑊, 𝑁; 𝜃] − 𝜓                        (7)

    There are no particularly interesting new theoretical results from this model for the effects of

welfare programs on labor supply. The existence of non-participating eligibles only means that

the aggregate labor supply reduction will be smaller than it would be if the takeup rate were 100

percent.

       In-Kind Transfers. Most countries have some means-tested transfer programs that

provide free or subsidized quantities of specific goods like housing, food, or medical care. These

programs can have different effects on labor supply than cash transfers, with the key issue being

whether leisure and the subsidized good are substitutes or complements. This can be easily

illustrated by imagining a program which simply reduces the price of a particular good by a

straightforward price subsidy. If the utility function is 𝑈(𝐿, 𝐶, 𝑋), where 𝐿 is leisure (the time

residual from H), 𝑋 is the quantity of the subsidized good and 𝐶 is other consumption, and if the

market price of X is q and the subsidy rate is s, then the Marshallian demand function for L is

                                  𝐿 = 𝑓[𝑊, 𝑞(1 − 𝑠), 𝑊𝑇 + 𝑁]                                 (8)

                                        𝜕𝑓
The effect of the price subsidy on 𝐿 is 𝜕𝑠 = −𝑞𝑓2 where 𝑓2 is the second partial of 𝑓. The term

𝑓2 > 0 if 𝐿 and 𝑋 are gross substitutes and 𝑓2 < 0 if they are gross complements. Hence an

increase in 𝑠 can decrease 𝐿 and hence increase 𝐻 in the former case.

    While this example provides a certain level of intuition, the model does not capture the

income conditioning of the subsidy, nor does it represent the form of most in-kind transfer


                                                 10
programs, which offer the individual a fixed quantity of the good. In some programs, it is

possible for the individual to top the quantity up and consume be more than the fixed quantity,

while in other programs that is not possible and the individual simply has to accept the fixed

quantity or not (“take it or leave it”). If the fixed quantity of the subsidized good is 𝑋̅, and the

government makes the recipient pay 𝜏(𝑊𝐻 + 𝑁) for it, then the individual maximizes 𝑈(𝐿, 𝐶, 𝑋̅)

w.r.t. L and C subject to 𝐶 = (𝑊𝐻 + 𝑁)(1 − 𝜏) and the MRS between L and C at the optimum

is
                                              𝑈𝐿
                                                 | ̅    = 𝑊(1 − 𝜏).                                            (9)
                                              𝑈𝐶 𝑋=𝑋


While this familiar MRS may seem to imply that the subsidy to leisure will unambiguously

increase L and decrease H, that is not the case if the individual would prefer to consume less X

than 𝑋̅. In that case, the individual is constrained and L is pushed upward by the increase in X if

they are complements and pushed down by the increase in X if they are substitutes, similar to the

case described earlier.7

         Figure 1 illustrates the possible choices between X and C, holding L fixed for the moment

at its initial value. The budget constraint AA’B’B holds before the program is offered, while the

constraint CDE holds for a program allowing top-up while the single point D holds for a program

in which top-up is not possible. When top-up is allowed, unconstrained individuals such as

person 1 will increase consumption of both goods while constrained individuals such 2 or 3 will

accept the program but consume more X than they would for an equivalent cash transfer (budget

constraint shown by the constraint E’DE) because they are constrained (indifference curves are



7
  As stated, this result only applies if the individual is constrained. If instead the program allows the individual to
top-up the program by purchasing additional X and hence would consume more than 𝑋̅ in the presence of the
subsidy, the consumer is unconstrained and the subsidy is inframarginal and equivalent to a cash transfer (Murray
(1980), Leonesio (1988), Gahvari (1994), Currie and Gahvari (2008)). If there is a black market and the individual
can sell the good on the market, that would move it closer to a cash program.

not drawn for simplicity). When top-up is not allowed, there may also be individuals such as 1’

who reduce their consumption of X to accept the program offer at D. For either program, there

will be individuals who do not accept the program at all, either because they wish to consume too

low a value of X or, in the case of a take-it-or-leave-it program, do not wish to reduce their X by

the amount required for participation.8

        Dynamic Models.9 We first consider dynamic models which include human capital and

preference persistence. We include both in the same model because they have some similar

implications for welfare programs and labor supply. We allow uncertainty in preferences and

wage rates. A basic starting point is an illustrative model in which the individuals’ instantaneous

utility function can be written as 𝑈(𝐻𝑡 , 𝑌𝑡 , 𝑃𝑡 ; 𝜃, 𝜓, 𝐻𝑡−1 , 𝑃𝑡−1 , 𝜖𝜃𝑡 , 𝜖𝜓𝑡 ), where 𝐻𝑡−1 and 𝑃𝑡−1

represent the individual’s decisions the previous period, θ and ψ are the time-invariant

components of her leisure and welfare preference parameters, respectively, as defined in

equation (7), and 𝜖𝜃𝑡 and 𝜖𝜓𝑡 are the time-varying components of her preferences arising from

shocks to her leisure and welfare preferences, respectively. The lagged values of labor supply

and participation represent preference persistence. Let the wage function be 𝑤𝑡 = 𝑔(𝐾𝑡 , 𝜖𝑤𝑡 ),

where 𝐾𝑡 is her human capital stock and 𝜖𝑤𝑡 is her wage shock. Assume that the human capital

stock evolves according to the learning-by-doing process 𝐾𝑡 = 𝑓(𝐾𝑡−1 , 𝐻𝑡−1 ), which is net of

                                   𝜕𝑓           𝜕𝑓
any depreciation and where 𝜕𝐾             > 0, 𝜕𝐻      > 0. Denote the discount factor by 𝛽 and assume
                                    𝑡−1          𝑡−1


there is no borrowing or saving, so that the static budget constraint above holds. Assume as well

  The diagram shows the possible changes in X and C holding L fixed. As described in the previous paragraph, L
may rise or fall, shifting the budget constraint outward or inward. In addition, because L is now being subsidized,
further substitutions between C and L, and between X and L, may take place.

that all three shocks are serially independent.10 The individual’s intertemporal optimization

problem can be written in a recursive form as follows:

                                 𝑉𝑡 (𝐻𝑡−1 , 𝑃𝑡−1 , 𝐾𝑡−1 ; 𝜃, 𝜓, 𝜖𝜃𝑡 , 𝜖𝜓𝑡 , 𝜖𝑤𝑡 ) ≡

          max [𝑈(𝐻𝑡 , 𝑌𝑡 , 𝑃𝑡 ; 𝜃, 𝜓, 𝐻𝑡−1 , 𝑃𝑡−1 , 𝜖𝜃𝑡 , 𝜖𝜓𝑡 ) + 𝛽𝐸𝑡 𝑉𝑡+1 (𝐻𝑡 , 𝑃𝑡 , 𝐾𝑡 ; 𝜃, 𝜓)]           (10)
         Ht ,Yt ,Pt


where the expectation is taken over the distribution of the three shocks at time t+1. The value

function 𝑉𝑡 (. ) depends on time-invariant preference parameters θ and ψ as well as six state

variables, three of which have already been determined in period t-1 (𝐻𝑡−1 , 𝑃𝑡−1 , 𝐾𝑡−1 ) and the

rest are shocks unknown prior to period t (𝜖𝜃𝑡 , 𝜖𝜓𝑡 , 𝜖𝑤𝑡 ). In this model, the individual’s labor

supply decision will affect her utility next period directly via lagged H and also indirectly via K,

which changes her wage next period. Her welfare participation decision will only affect her

utility next period via lagged P.

         A common example for preference persistence is that current labor supply reduces the

                                                    𝜕2 𝑈𝑡+1
disutility of labor supply next period, i.e., 𝜕𝐻               > 0. This can reflect habit formation or large
                                                     𝑡+1 𝜕𝐻𝑡


initial utility costs of engaging in an activity. In such a case the individual’s labor supply will

exhibit persistence over time and she will respond only gradually to policy changes. The same

case can be demonstrated for preference persistence in welfare participation.

     The welfare participation and labor supply effects in the dynamic case are different than in

the static case. Preference persistence implies larger utility gains from going onto welfare and

reducing labor supply than in the static model, because the gain in leisure from doing so will

increase the utility value of future leisure and hence being on welfare. Human capital effects, on


10
  Otherwise, EtVt+1 will also depend on the realization of the period-t shocks. When shocks are serially independent,
then individuals who experience a negative wage shock may know, in expectation, that their wage will return to
being higher tomorrow and hence may expect to be on welfare for only a short period. Negative autocorrelation of
shocks exacerbates it and positive autocorrelation of shocks ameliorates it, which are capable of generating frequent
entries and exits of welfare and long periods of welfare with declining wages, respectively.

the other hand, will reduce the utility value of going onto welfare and reducing labor supply

because future wages are now reduced and the budget set contracts, reducing future utility. But

those who do go onto welfare and reduce labor supply will have lower future wages and hence

lower labor supply and higher welfare participation rates than would occur in the static model.

The presence of uncertainty in future wages adds an additional insurance element that would not

be present in a static model which will work toward increasing the value of the welfare program.

Preference persistence and human capital dynamics can be distinguished because the latter works

through the wage rate and the former does not.11

     A number of additional general issues should be mentioned. First, in a general human capital

model, working may not represent human capital investment per se and may even crowd out

such activities. This has implications for the long-term effects of welfare programs (e.g.,

Heckman, Lochner and Cossa, 2003). For example, suppose education (or training) and

employment are both in the choice set and human capital can only improve via the former

activity. In this case, introducing a welfare program creates an incentive to reduce human capital

investment, but whether that translates to a further reduction in H (than in the static model)

depends on the substitutability between education and labor supply. Second, the model so far

assumes that individuals receive a wage offer each period; employment is determined

exclusively by choice. The model can be modified to incorporate “frictions” in which the

individual may receive no offers. Human capital may increase the probability of receiving a job

offer, in addition to increasing the wage level. Finally, the opportunity cost of leisure consists of

not only forgone wage (or the discounted marginal value of financial wealth, if saving is

allowed) but also human capital accumulation. When the latter component is substantial, the


11
  Wages are unobserved for nonworkers, so selection effects will change over time and the greater percent of
nonworkers may cause the conditional wage mean to rise. Grogger (2009) illustrates this effect.

                                                        14
labor supply decision will be dominated by the incentive to build human capital rather than

financial incentives.

       Other extensions. In most means-tested transfer programs, the benefit amount increases

with the number of dependent children. Some programs are only available to unmarried

individuals. These features will generate indirect effects on labor supply if individuals respond

by having more children or reducing marriage. Having additional children will typically reduce

labor supply, but the effect of reduced marriage is less clear. For example, individuals may

increase H due to the loss of their spouse’s income; they may reduce H if they need to stay home

and take care of their children (e.g., child care is no longer affordable). If individuals are

heterogeneous, the compositional effect may create an econometric issue; the labor supply effect

may be biased when the researcher only focuses on a particular demographic group (e.g., single

mothers) for analysis.

       Another extension allows borrowing and saving and allows welfare programs to impose

an assets test. For illustration purposes, ignore preference persistence and human capital, and

suppose the individual makes consumption and leisure (the time residual from H) decisions each

period given the asset level A, with the resulting intertemporal value function:

                                      𝑉𝑡 (𝐴𝑡 ; 𝜃, 𝜓, 𝜖𝜃𝑡 , 𝜖𝜓𝑡 , 𝜖𝑤𝑡 ) ≡

                 𝑀𝑎𝑥𝐶𝑡,𝐿𝑡,𝑃𝑡 [𝑈(𝐶𝑡 , 𝐿𝑡 , 𝑃𝑡 ; 𝜃, 𝜓, 𝜖𝜃𝑡 , 𝜖𝜓𝑡 ) + 𝛽𝐸𝑡 𝑉𝑡+1 (𝐴𝑡+1 ; 𝜃, 𝜓)]       (11)

    The intertemporal budget constraint is 𝐴𝑡+1 = 𝑅𝐴𝑡 + 𝑤𝑡 𝐻𝑡 + 𝐵𝑡 − 𝐶𝑡 where R is the gross

interest rate. The asset test becomes a salient constraint, forthe benefit formula is 𝐵𝑡 =

max{𝐺 − 𝜏𝑤𝑡 𝐻𝑡 − 𝑟[(𝑅 − 1)𝐴𝑡 + 𝑁𝑡 ] , 0} if 𝐴𝑡 < 𝐴̅, and the individual is ineligible for welfare

if the asset level exceeds 𝐴̅. Without the welfare program, the first order conditions are

                                                                                𝜕𝑉
𝑈𝐶 (𝐶𝑡 , 𝐿𝑡 ) = 𝛽𝐸𝑡 (𝜆𝑡+1 ) and 𝑈𝐿 (𝐶𝑡 , 𝐿𝑡 ) ≥ 𝛽𝐸𝑡 (𝜆𝑡+1 )𝑤𝑡 where 𝜆𝑡+1 ≡ 𝜕𝐴𝑡+1 denotes the marginal
                                                                                   𝑡+1

value of wealth in period t+1. The envelope theorem yields the Euler equation 𝜆𝑡 = 𝛽𝑅𝐸𝑡 (𝜆𝑡+1 ).

When the welfare program is present, there is another set of first order conditions, 𝑈𝐶 (𝐶𝑡 , 𝐿𝑡 ) =

𝛽𝐸𝑡 (𝜆′𝑡+1 ) and 𝑈𝐿 (𝐶𝑡 , 𝐿𝑡 ) ≥ 𝛽𝐸𝑡 (𝜆′𝑡+1 )𝑤𝑡 (1 − 𝜏), that characterizes the solution along the

welfare segment of the budget constraint. The global solution is obtained by comparing the

solution from each segment.12 The usual implication of this model remains similar to that of the

static model: the individual works less (and is more likely to go on welfare) when the wage is

low and works more when the wage is high. The welfare program generates a substitution effect

and a wealth effect (which reduces λ) which tend to reduce H. However, it is theoretically

ambiguous as to whether introducing a welfare program will reduce H beyond what is implied by

the static model because the magnitude depends on the degree of nonseparability between C and

L. The asset test may further reduce H, although individuals may respond by simply increasing C

to remain asset-eligible. When earnings are exogenous, C would increase and A would decrease

(e.g., Hubbard et al. (1995) and Ziliak (2016)). Finally, when the model contains a precautionary

saving motive, the welfare program reduces the need to self-insure by building a buffer stock and

this may again reduce H.



     III.B. Empirical Literature

         We review the empirical literature on the effect of a welfare program—relative to no

program—on labor supply using models described in the previous section.

         General Models. The development of models for the effect of welfare programs began in

the late 1960s and early 1970s with the static labor supply model and was well worked out by the

1980s. Killingsworth (1983) provides a comprehensive overview of the early literature, both of


12
  Not discussed is the corner solution of no savings, which is empirically relevant as a significant group in the US
population have virtually no wealth. See Hubbard et al. (1995) for details.

                                                          16
the models used, econometric issues, and empirical results. His review showed that literature

had produced a wide range of income and substitution elasticities, which together imply labor

supply reductions from a standard welfare program. In later reviews, Danziger et al. (1981) and

Moffitt (1992) tried to narrow the range of estimates, concluding that the hours reductions from

the then-existing U.S. program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) were in the

range of 1 to 10 hours per week. A later review article by Blundell and MaCurdy (1999) also

outlined the basic static labor supply model with welfare programs, with an extended discussion

of econometric issues as well as reviewing in detail the specifications and results of each of the

major papers in the empirical literature, most of which were published subsequent to the prior

reviews.13

     All the reviews showed a significant range of elasticities from the nonexperimental

literature. Possibly more reliable evidence comes from the U.S. NIT experiments of the 1960s

and 1970s, reviewed by Killingsworth (1983) and Moffitt and Kehrer (1981) and well

summarized by Burtless (1987). Burtless summarized the overall effects of an NIT relative to no

program at all and found that married men reduced their hours by about 7 percent and that

married women and single mothers had hours reductions of about 17 percent. Burtless also

showed that these reductions were actually quite large relative to the benefits provided, even for

men, and that the earnings “leakage” from the program was non-trivial—for example, a $1

increase in the benefit led to as high as a $.80 reduction in earnings, thereby raising income only

by $.20.




13
  We have not had the space to cover family labor supply models of welfare programs. Hoynes (1996) developed a
model of husband and wife choice of discrete hours points and how they responded to a welfare program in the U.S.
called the AFDC-UP program which offered benefits to two-parent families.

                                                       17
         From a modeling standpoint, a breakthrough by Burtless and Hausman (1978) solved the

econometric problem posed by the existence of the two-segment budget constraint created by the

basic welfare program (a segment below the eligibility point for those on welfare and a segment

above the eligibility point for those off) and the non-convexity of the constraint. The authors

show that the choice of hours along each segment is made jointly with the choice of which

segment to locate on and that the two choices have to be estimated simultaneously. They assume

a particular functional form for the indirect utility function and model the choice of segment as

described in our model section above, and specify a particular stochastic structure with both

preference heterogeneity and optimization errors. Estimating their model with maximum

likelihood on data on single mothers from one of the U.S. NIT experiments, they found a range

of disincentive effects that depended on wage rates and parameters of the welfare program.

While the subsequent literature has used different specifications for the utility function, different

sources of preference heterogeneity, often discreteness of the H distribution, and different

parametric assumptions on unobservables, the basic Burtless-Hausman model underlies all

structural models of the effect of simple welfare programs on labor supply.14

         Non-Participation. Moffitt (1983) estimated a formal structural model with non-

participation, assuming that it was generated by stigma, although his estimates presumably

picked up the influence of all factors (money and time costs, hassle costs, etc.).15 He assumed

that there might be “variable” stigma as well as “flat” stigma, where the former increases with

the level of benefits received while the latter is of the fixed type discussed above. He assumed a


14
  There have been relatively few papers using the basic static model of labor supply in recent years, with most
papers addressing more innovative models or features. See Bargain et al. (2014) for an exception.
15
  Moffitt assumed that stigma was internal to the individual and not generated by how many other people are on
welfare. A different assumption is that stigma is a function of how many other people are on welfare (Besley and
Coate, 1992; Lindbeck et al., 1999; Nechyba, 1999). Currie (2006) has an in-depth investigation of the reasons for
non-takeup of welfare programs.

                                                         18
utility function with preference heterogeneity, allowed optimization errors, and estimated the

joint choice of segment, hours of work, and participation with maximum likelihood assuming

joint normality for the errors. His estimates showed that there was strong selection bias in who

participated and who did not, and that participation was positively affected by the potential

benefit as well as by observable socioeconomic characteristics.

         Many structural papers in the subsequent literature have taken non-participation into

account. Hoynes (1996) adopted a specification similar to that of Moffitt (1983) but with only

flat stigma, equivalent to fixed costs, which is the approach most often taken. Miller and

Sanders (1997), in a dynamic discrete choice model discussed further below, also allowed

nonparticipation of eligibles and argued that it could partly be the result of human capital effects,

as eligible participants may choose to work to increase human capital and be off welfare later.16

Keane and Moffitt (1998) extended the approach to multiple program participation with a static

model, allowing individuals to participate in combinations of programs, each of which had its

own fixed cost. The choice of the combination in which to participate is a function not only of

the utility gain but also of the combination of fixed costs. The estimates showed strong

evidence of participation costs and that individuals often do not locate on the boundary of their

budget sets. Swann (2005) allowed stigma in a dynamic discrete choice model and Keane and

Wolpin (2010), whose model is discussed further below, also allowed welfare participation to be

in the utility function with a negative sign, therefore allowing nonparticipation of eligibles. Chan




16
  However, it is unclear why an eligible could not accept the welfare benefit and maintain the same level of labor
supply after doing so.

(2013) allows welfare participation to affect utility and to interact with the disutility of

employment.17

        In-Kind Transfers. Estimation of a structural model of in-kind transfers requires the

modeling of consumption of the good being subsidized, and lack of data sets with sufficient

consumption together with labor supply data has limited research. Structural models of this kind

have therefore not been estimated. Keane and Moffitt (1998) took an approximate approach to

the problem by putting a parameter to be estimated in front of the subsidy amount of the in-kind

good in the budget constraint, allowing its effect to differ from that of cash. Their estimates

showed that the coefficients on several in-kind transfers were far below one, implying a much

smaller disincentive effect on labor supply than for cash benefits.

     Although there have been few structural models incorporating in-kind transfers, there is a

large reduced form literature estimating the overall effects of various in-kind transfers in the U.S.

Surveys of the results of studies of the U.S. Food Stamp program (Currie, 2003; Hoynes and

Schanzenbach, 2016) show, with some exceptions, very small if any work disincentives of that

program (e.g., Fraker and Moffitt 1988, Hagstrom 1996). An exception is Hoynes and

Schanzenbach (2012), who found that the rollout of Food Stamps in the 1970s had modest

negative effects on the work effort of single mothers. A smaller literature on the work

disincentives of the U.S. Medicaid program (see Gruber, 2003; Buchmueller et al., 2016) has

also shown very small if any work disincentives, although some recent work has generated larger

effects (see the Buchmueller review). There have been a handful of studies of the effects of U.S.

housing programs on labor supply, with one study using quasi-randomization from waiting lists



17
  In the 2000s, the U.S. government allowed many states to reduce participation costs directly in its Food Stamp
program. Hoynes and Schanzenbach (2016) have a brief review of the reforms; there is a separate literature showing
that they increased takeup in the program. The effects on labor supply are theoretically ambiguous.

showing non-trivial work disincentives of the program (Jacob and Ludwig, 2012; see Collinson

et al. (2016) for a review of other studies).

       Dynamic Models. Dynamic structural models that incorporate welfare programs were

first developed in the 1990s. Traditionally, estimating these models was computationally

cumbersome because of the large state space involved in the dynamic programming problem;

different states had different welfare benefit levels, and the welfare rule parameters evolved over

time. Miller and Sanders (1997) estimated a discrete choice dynamic programming model of

female employment and welfare participation decisions, featuring welfare stigma, habit

formation (via duration dependence) and human capital accumulation but without borrowing or

saving. They did not discuss the implications of the estimates for work disincentives of welfare

but reported that habit persistence in welfare overwhelms human capital considerations in the

sense that lagged work levels do not much affect future work once intertemporal dependence of

welfare participation is accounted for. Extending this framework, Swann (2005) incorporated

marriage decisions and richer dynamics, took into account the evolution of state-year welfare

benefit rules, again did not allow saving or borrowing, and estimated the choice model jointly

with the wage equation by maximum likelihood. He did not simulate the effect on labor supply

of welfare versus no welfare, but only simulated effects of U.S. welfare reforms, which we will

report in Section VI. Fang and Silverman (2009) estimated a hyperbolic discounting model of

labor supply and welfare participation for single mothers. Individuals’ time preference exhibited

present bias creating a misalignment between short-run and long-run goals, which led to

problems of commitment and self-control. The authors found evidence for time-inconsistency

but also found ambiguous effects of that inconsistency on labor supply. Keane and Wolpin

(2010) estimated a dynamic structural model of labor supply, welfare participation, education,



                                                21
marriage and fertility decisions for women.18 Their model incorporated various dynamics such

as preference persistence, work experience accumulation, years of completed schooling, family

size, job offer arrivals, and match-specific offers in the marriage market but assumed no saving

or borrowing. Individuals started making decisions as early as age 14, with the choice set

depending on the stage of the life cycle. While they only reported the behavioral responses of

individuals with the lowest initial human capital endowment, who constituted about 25% of the

sample, they found that reducing/eliminating welfare benefits and imposing time limits had large

labor supply effects. Ferrall (2012) and Chan (2013, 2017) estimated their dynamic structural

models incorporating welfare programs as well as features that were important to specific policy

reforms or experiments. They did not study the effects of eliminating welfare but simulated the

effects of reforms (see Sections V and VI). Blundell, Costas Dias, Meghir and Shaw (2016))

estimate a dynamic structural model of education, labor supply, and consumption for women. In

their life-cycle model, individuals first choose their level of education and, upon completion of

education, make choices in each year subject to exogeneous stochastic evolution of marriage and

fertility. Their model incorporates both human capital and borrowing and saving.19 In addition,

their budget set captures the complexity of the UK transfer system. Their estimates show that

human capital and asset accumulation are important. The authors do not simulate the effects of

welfare versus no welfare, but only effects of tax-transfer reforms, which we report in Section V.




18
   Keane and Wolpin (2002, 2007) reported labor supply effects of welfare from models consistent with forward-
looking behavior.
19
   Imai and Keane (2004), who study both dynamics among men, consider neither transfer programs nor the
extensive margin of labor supply but they fully estimate the utility function. The authors incorporate the extensive
margin but the risk aversion coefficient is calibrated.

    IV. Classical Reform: The Negative Income Tax

    IV.A. Models

        This section takes the basic models of welfare and labor supply exposited in Section III.A

and presents their implications for perhaps the oldest welfare reform proposed by economists: a

reduction in the tax rate, 𝜏. This is the reform that most economists think of when they think of

a negative income tax. Its attraction lies in increasing the reward to working more by reducing

the rate at which benefits fall as earnings increase.

    The basic models in III.A, however, do not imply that 𝐻 will necessarily rise with a

reduction in 𝜏. The static model illustrates the issues most transparently. Consider the labor

supply function in equations (4)-(6) and consider the effect on labor supply of a discrete

reduction in the tax rate from 𝜏 to 𝜏′:

                                          𝐻(𝜏 ′ ) − 𝐻(𝜏) = 𝐴 + 𝐵                                 (12)

𝐴 = 𝐻[𝑊(1 − 𝜏 ′ 𝑃(𝜏 ′ )), 𝑁 + 𝑃(𝜏 ′ )(𝐺 − 𝑟𝑁); 𝜃] − 𝐻[𝑊(1 − 𝜏𝑃(𝜏 ′ )), 𝑁 + 𝑃(𝜏 ′ )(𝐺 − 𝑟𝑁); 𝜃]   (13)

𝐵 = 𝐻[𝑊(1 − 𝜏𝑃(𝜏 ′ )), 𝑁 + 𝑃(𝜏′)(𝐺 − 𝑟𝑁); 𝜃] − 𝐻[𝑊(1 − 𝜏𝑃(𝜏)), 𝑁 + 𝑃(𝜏)(𝐺 − 𝑟𝑁); 𝜃]              (14)

where 𝐻(𝜏) and 𝑃(𝜏) denote their values for any given 𝜏. Expression 𝐴 gives the change in 𝐻

arising the increase in the net wage, measured over those on welfare after the tax rate reduction.

Assuming that the substitution effects of an increase in the wage dominate its income effects, 𝐴

will be positive. Expression 𝐵 gives the change in 𝐻 that results from a possible change in

welfare participation. As can be seen from equation (14), only two cases can arise: (1) there is

no change in P, implying B=0, and (2) P changes from 0 to 1 (because the reduction in the net

wage if on welfare makes it more attractive), which unambiguously reduces 𝐻 and hence B<0.

If there are any individuals in the latter category, the net effect of the reduction in 𝜏 is ambiguous




                                                   23
in sign.20 Note that due to entry (component B), the effect of an NIT on H cannot be ascertained

merely from knowledge of the substitution and income elasticities of labor supply.

         The ambiguity is illustrated in the familiar Figure 2, where line ACDE is the no-program

budget constraint, ABCDE is the budget constraint with the initial welfare program, and ABDE

is the constraint after the reduction in 𝜏 (the vertical distance between A and B equals G). The

reduction in the tax rate causes increases in hours worked for persons 1 and 2 but reductions for

persons 3 and 4.

         No ambiguity arises if the probability of working any hours is considered. In the model

with corner solutions outlined in Section III.A, utility at 𝐻 = 0, 𝑈(0, 𝑁(1 − 𝑟) + 𝐺; 𝜃)

(assuming 𝑁 < 𝐺/𝑟) is unchanged by the reduction in 𝜏. Since utility over some ranges of 𝐻 >

0 are increased, the only direction 𝐻 can change is in a positive direction.

         These effects of a reduction in 𝜏 take a different form, but with the same ambiguity of

effects, for programs which restrict eligibility to those with private income below some upper

limit, independent of the normal benefit formula. With a modified benefit formula 𝐵 =

𝑀𝑎𝑥{0,1[𝑊𝐻 + 𝑁 < 𝐸](𝐺 − 𝜏𝑊𝐻 − 𝑟𝑁)}, where E is the upper limit on eligibility, a “notch”

is created at 𝐻 = (𝐸 − 𝑁)/𝑊 at which point the tax rate on an extra dollar of earnings exceeds

100 percent because all benefits are lost.21 A reform which smooths out the notch by simply

eliminating the upper income limit results in a reduction in 𝜏 at the notch point but increases 𝜏




20
   While a change in 𝐺 is not ordinarily considered a “reform,” we note in passing that the comparative statics of an
increase in its levels has, contrary to a reduction in 𝜏, an unambiguously negative effect on 𝐻 since the
corresponding components A and B are both negative.
21
   The U.S. has several programs of this type with 𝜏 = 0, the most well-known being the Medicaid program
(Buchmueller et al., 2016).

                                                         24
for a range of 𝐻 above it, inducing some reductions in 𝐻 of the same type discussed above for

the more typical welfare program.22

         As discussed in Section III.A, both preference persistence and (learning by doing) human

capital accumulation considerations magnify the labor supply disincentives of a welfare program

(relative to no welfare program) compared to the static model. A reduction in 𝜏 does not change

this result in the sense that, at the new lower level of 𝜏, all individuals on welfare still will have

lower levels of labor supply than they would have off welfare and the magnitudes of those

differences are greater in the dynamic models than in the static model. But it is also true that the

incentives to increase H for those at lower levels and the incentives to decrease H for those at

higher levels are greater in the dynamic models than in the static models as well because of the

future wage implications of increasing or decreasing H in the dynamic models. Thus the positive

and negative effects are both magnified, with the net effect remaining ambiguous in sign.



     IV.B. Empirical Literature

         We consider in this section studies in the literature which have focused on the effects of a

reduction in the tax rate in a welfare program, or at least have presented estimates of those

effects even if the focus of the study was elsewhere. The original empirical work attempting to

estimate the effects of an NIT were those in Cain and Watts (1973) but were merely attempts to

estimate wage and income elasticities of labor supply which are, for reasons clear from the last

section, inadequate by themselves to predict the effects of a reduction in a welfare program tax

rate. The first direct evidence stemmed from the NIT experiments in the U.S. in the late 1960s

and 1970s, which were referred to in Section III.B for what they revealed about the effect of


22
  The same ambiguity arises if the notch is removed by eliminating the income eligibility rule but also increasing 𝜏
over all ranges of 𝜏 in an attempt, say, to hold expenditures constant.

                                                         25
welfare programs on labor supply relative to nothing. But they estimated the effects of changes

in 𝜏 as well, mostly in reduced form regressions of labor supply on the values of 𝐺 and 𝜏

randomly assigned to different groups of experimentals (controls were assigned 0 values for the

two parameters ). The interpretation of the coefficient on 𝜏 is as the net effect of the effects on 𝐻

going in different directions as described in the last section. Many of the OLS coefficients on 𝜏

were statistically insignificant, implying that the positive and negative effects cancelled out (or

that all elasticities were zero!). But looking at raw means across individuals who had been

assigned different 𝜏 but the same 𝐺 showed that reductions in 𝜏 increased labor supply for some

groups and decreased it for others, which could simply be a result of a different fraction of the

group’s families at lower and higher levels of income. Burtless (1987, Table 4) argued that the

evidence showed, in fact, lower levels of 𝐻 in plans with lower levels of 𝜏.

       The first structural model applied to the NIT experiments by Burtless and Hausman

(1978), also referenced above, also found very modest changes in 𝐻 in response to reductions in

𝜏 simulated from their estimated model, with essentially no change at all for individuals at low

wages or high levels of 𝐺, but small increases for individuals with high wages and low 𝐺.

However, the experiment they examined only varied 𝜏 in a narrow range, from .40 to .60. A

later structural study by Moffitt (1983), using instead data from the AFDC program in the U.S.,

showed that a reduction in 𝜏 of 10 percentage points increased 𝐻 by only a third of an hour.

Keane and Moffitt (1998), in the multiple program participation study referred to earlier,

simulated a much larger reduction in 𝜏 but found an increase in 𝐻 of only one-fifth of an hour.

Hoynes (1996) simulated a large reduction in the implicit tax rate of the AFDC-UP program,

which targeted two-parent households, and found a very small reduction of H among husbands

but virtually no effect among wives. Moffitt (1992, 2003a) examined the robustness of these


                                                 26
results by simulating the effect on labor supply of plans with different levels of 𝐺 and 𝜏, using a

U.S. nationally representative database and drawing a range of elasticities from the experimental

and nonexperimental literature, and also found a very weak response of average labor supply to

reductions in 𝜏 (but with effects varying by the size of the elasticities). Nevertheless, these basic

results all point to net changes in labor supply from a reduction in 𝜏 that are modest at best if not

in the opposite direction intended.

       Much of the literature over the last decade or so has not had a focus on the labor supply

effects of reductions in 𝜏 but rather on other issues (possibly excepting some U.S. reforms

discussed in Section VI). An exception is Swann (2005), who simulated the effects of a reduction

in 𝜏 in a dynamic discrete choice model and found its effects on labor supply to be very small.



    V. Earnings Subsidies

    V.A. Models

       Many earnings subsidies consist of a “phase-in” region where the individual receives a

subsidy 𝑆 = 𝑠𝑊𝐻 for earnings (WH) up to a threshold level 𝐶1 , a “ceiling” region where the

subsidy remains fixed at 𝑆 = 𝑠𝐶1 for earnings between 𝐶1 and 𝐶2 , and a “phase-out” region

where the subsidy is 𝑆 = max{𝑠𝐶1 − 𝑟(𝑊𝐻 − 𝐶2 ), 0} for earnings beyond the threshold level 𝐶2 .

The net wage is therefore W(1+s) for earnings under C1, W for earnings between C1 and C2, and

W(1-r) for earnings higher than C2 (up to the point where the subsidy reduces to zero). Two

features set an earnings subsidy apart from a welfare program. First, individuals receive no

benefit when they do not work. Second, the benefit amount is an increasing function of earnings

at the lower range, whereas in a welfare program, the benefit amount always falls when earnings

increase. For the same reason as an NIT, an earnings subsidy unambiguously increases the


                                                 27
probability of working any hours but the overall effect on H is ambiguous (Figure 3). The

increase in H occurs in the phase-in region where the net wage is higher than the gross wage. In

the ceiling region there is only a negative income effect and, in the phase-out region, the income

and substitution effects have the same direction and cause a reduction in H.

                                                                                ̅ . Upon
    Some earnings subsidies have a minimum work hour requirement, so S=0 if 𝐻 < 𝐻

satisfying the requirement, the subsidy is fixed for earnings below a threshold level, then falls as

earnings rise beyond the threshold. In some cases, there is no ceiling region and earnings are

immediately phased out. A simple version of the formulas in the UK program and in Canada’s

welfare reform experiment is 𝑆 = 𝑟(𝐶 − max{𝑊𝐻, 𝐷}) where C is the “income standard”, r is

                                                                           ̅, the subsidy is fixed
the taper/withdrawal rate, and D is an earnings threshold . Given that 𝐻 ≥ 𝐻

at 𝑆̅ = 𝑟(𝐶 − 𝐷) for earnings up to threshold D, it is 𝑆 = 𝑆̅ − 𝑟(𝑊𝐻 − 𝐷) for earnings between

D and C, and 𝑆 = 0 when earnings reach C. Although this type of program has no phase-in

                                              ̅ ), it also increases the probability of working any
region (the subsidy increases abruptly at 𝐻 = 𝐻

hours and reduces H in the ceiling and phase-out regions. Unlike the welfare program, imposing

a work requirement in the form of a minimum hours requirement to an earnings subsidy does not

always increase labor supply (Figure 4). This is because the work requirement removes the

phase-in region, which causes some individuals to quit working or reduce H even if it causes

                                 ̅.
others to increase their H up to 𝐻

    Another feature is that the work requirement may reduce the incentive to build human

capital. This is because the requirement makes the subsidy rate a decreasing function of the wage

                                                                                 ̅ ≪ 𝐷. When

                                                                           ̅

rate reduces as W increases. By contrast, in the absence of the work requirement she would lie in

the phase-in region where the subsidy rate remain fixed as W increases.



     V.B. Empirical Literature

     The U.S. Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) began in 1975 as a small earnings subsidy

program for families with dependent children. It underwent major expansions in the tax reform

acts of 1986, 1990 and 1993, with the 1993-96 expansion being most notable.23 There is a large

literature on the EITC, mostly reduced form in nature but with a few structural models. We refer

readers to Hotz and Scholz (2003) and Nichols and Rothstein (2016) for detailed reviews. We

will note only a few of the studies.

     Eissa and Liebman (1996) examine the effect of the 1986 increase with a difference-in-

difference (DD) strategy comparing single women with children to those without, since the latter

were not affected by the reform. They find an increase in labor force participation rates of 2.8

percentage points (ppt) but no change in hours worked conditional on working. But more work

has been done on the larger 1993-96 expansions. Meyer and Rosenbaum (2001) estimate a

quasi-structural labor supply model by exploiting the nonlinear budget sets created by EITC and

other programs, including single mothers with and without children. In their preferred

specification, they find that the expansion increased single mothers’ employment rates by 2 to 3

ppt. Estimates with single mothers only produce a smaller policy effect of about 1.2 ppt. Using a

sample of single mothers and exploiting time- and family-size-variations in the generosity of

EITC benefits, Grogger (2003) finds that the EITC increased single mothers’ employment by 4.7

ppt between 1993 and 1999. Using a similar approach but with a richer specification, Fang and


23
  For a minimum-wage single parent, the 93-96 expansion increased her net wage by 8 to 20 percent depending on
the number of children and work hours.

                                                      29
Keane (2004) find that the EITC increased single mothers’ employment rate by 0.7 ppt in 1997,

which widened to 3.6 ppt in 2002.

     Eissa and Hoynes (2004) examine married couples with children. Their preferred

specification exploits the nonlinear budget sets created by the EITC, as in Meyer and

Rosenbaum, but the sample includes married mothers only. They find that the 1993-96 EITC

expansion reduced married mothers’ employment by 0.6 ppt.24 In a DD model similar to Eissa

and Liebman (1996), using married women without children as the control group, they find that

the estimate is roughly 4 times as large. They find very small effects among married fathers.

     Keane and Wolpin (2010), whose dynamic structural model was described in III.B, use their

model to simulate the life-cycle effects of the EITC system as of 2004. They find that it increases

the short-run employment among women who have the lowest skill endowments and are most

susceptible to poverty by about 1 ppt but reduces their long-run employment by about 4 ppt.25

     Chan (2013) uses a dynamic structural model of labor supply, welfare participation and food

stamp participation to estimate EITC’s effects on single mothers along both the extensive and

intensive margins. When implementing an EITC program as of 1999, while holding everything

else as in 1992, he finds that the employment rate increases by 0.6 ppt initially due to preference

persistence and a low probability of non-workers finding a job. In year 5 the effect widens to 2.4

ppt but the average work hour among workers increases by merely 0.7% relative to no reform.26




24
   The full effect of the 1984-96 expansions was 1.1 ppt.
25
   They explain this from the perspective of increased fertility (the EITC increases fertility which reduces labor
supply).
26
   Based on the modelling assumption that part-time work is 20 hours/week and full-time work is 40 hours/week.
When simulating a wage increase, his model yields an intensive margin that is roughly half of the extensive margin.
This comparison can be misleading, however, due to similar reasons to those described in Section IV. More
generally, he finds that individuals tend to work whenever an opportunity is available because there is a strong
incentive to maintain human capital (hard to find a job once nonemployed).

                                                        30
He also simulates an earnings subsidy with an hour requirement, and finds that its labor supply

effect is smaller than that of an EITC with similar expenditure.

     More recent advances have been made regarding the EITC’s effect along the intensive

margin.27 Consistent with a small intensive margin, Saez (2010) finds limited evidence of

bunching around the kink points of the EITC schedule, except for the self-employed. In a field

experiment, Chetty and Saez (2013) find that increased knowledge of the EITC rules had a small

impact on EITC payment. Chetty, Friedman and Saez (2013) exploit geographical variations in

the knowledge of EITC rules and find a larger intensive margin compared to the previous two

studies. They also find that the earnings elasticity is larger in the phase-in region than the phase-

out region.

     The UK introduced an earnings subsidy program in 1971 for families with dependent

children, with a minimum work hour requirement (24+ hours/week) and phasing-out of benefits

as income increased.28 There were several subsequent changes, most notably changes in the hour

requirement in 1992 and 1995, and the replacement of the program by Working Families’ Tax

Credit (WFTC) in late 1999. The WFTC increased the benefit, reduced the phase-out rate from

70% to 55%, and provided more credit for families that used child care. In 2003, the WFTC was

replaced by two programs which, amongst other changes, further reduced the phase-out rate and

extended entitlement to families without children. Unlike the US, the WFTC reform was

accompanied by an increase of Income Support (IS) benefits, a cash welfare program for

nonworking families and those working below the minimum hours. This dampened the net




27
   These studies focus on earnings, not labor supply, responses so the elasticities are not directly comparable with
those reported in earlier studies.
28
   Labor supply effects of earnings subsidies have also received attention in other European countries although they
have not been as extensively studied as in the UK. See for instance Bargain and Orsini (2006), Stancanelli (2008)
and Haan and Prowse (2010) for examples of different approaches on the topic.

                                                         31
financial incentive to work (Brewer, 2001; Blundell and Hoynes, 2004).29 The official take-up

rates in IS and WFTC are about 90% and 70%, respectively (Brewer, Duncan, Shephard and

Suarez, 2006).

     Several studies have used static structural models to estimate or simulate the effects of UK

in-work benefit reforms. Bingley and Walker (1997) estimate a structural model of labor supply

and in-work benefit participation for single mothers and find that a 25-percent increase in the

maximum in-work benefit will increase employment by 2.5 ppt. Using separate samples for

single mothers and married couples with children, Blundell, Duncan, McCrae and Meghir (2000)

estimate a structural labor supply model with a nonlinear budget set and simulate the WFTC

reform. They find that it increases single mothers’ employment by 2.2 ppt, reduces married

mothers’ (with employed partners) employment by 0.6 ppt, and increases married fathers’

employment by 0.1 ppt. Brewer, Duncan, Shephard and Suarez (2006) extend their work by

incorporating in-work benefit participation decisions and using pre- and post-reform data. They

find that for single mothers, the participation cost (“stigma”) of the in-work benefit program fell

after the WFTC reform, which magnified WFTC’s effect. They also find that other post-reform

tax/transfer changes (including the IS expansion) partially offset WFTC’s effect.

     Francesconi and van der Klaauw (2007) and Gregg, Harkness and Smith (2009) use a

differences-in-differences (DD) strategy by comparing single women with and without children

and find that the combined policy changes (including the WFTC reform) during 1999-02

increased single mothers’ employment by 5 ppt. Using a similar approach, Francesconi, Rainer

and van der Klaauw (2009) find an insignificant employment effect among married mothers with

a working partner and a positive effect among those with a non-working partner. Focusing on a


29
  In addition, unlike EITC, the FC/WFTC benefit is counted toward income in the calculation of benefits from other
programs such as Housing Benefit.

                                                       32
shorter (15-month) time window during 1999-00, Leigh (2007) finds that the 1999 reform alone

increased parents’ employment by 1 ppt relative to non-parents. Using a DD strategy on a sample

of workers who are single mothers or single women without children, Blundell, Brewer and

Francesconi (2008) find that the 1992 and 1995 reforms have no significant impact on the

weekly hours of work among workers, while 1999-02 reform has a large positive effect.

    Blundell, Costas Dias, Meghir and Shaw (2016), whose dynamic structural model was

described in III.B, simulate the effect of a revenue-neutral reform that includes the WFTC as of

2002 and a 0.9-ppt increase of the Income Tax basic rate. They find that the reform increases

single mothers’ employment by between 8.5 ppt (university) and 20.4 ppt (secondary); among

married mothers, employment falls by between 1.0 ppt (university) and 6.6 ppt (secondary).

There are no long-term effects on employment and wage rates once the children become adults.

These result from a complex combination of different mechanisms throughout the life cycle. For

example, many single mothers remain so for a limited period and many become married

eventually. WFTC induce single mothers to work more, but mainly part-time hours that avoids

depreciation but does not build experience. After they become married, WFTC induces them to

work less, which reduces experience and results in no net effect on wages when their children

become adults.

    Shephard (2017) estimates an equilibrium job search model with wage posting in part-time

and full-time jobs. In his model, individuals receive job offers (and accept or decline them) when

employed and unemployed, and firms set the wage rate and recruiting intensity (which affects

job offer arrival) to maximize their profits. In a simulation of the tax and benefit system

(including WFTC) as of 2002 with his estimated model from pre-reform data, he finds that the

general equilibrium effects on labor supply are modest.



                                                 33
    In the early 1990s Canada implemented the “Self-Sufficiency Project” (SSP), a welfare

reform experiment offering an experimental group of welfare recipients a generous subsidy for

working more than 30 hours/week, compared to a control group of welfare recipients facing a

100% tax rate. The experiment had an unusual dynamic feature because the experimentals had to

first quit welfare within 12 months after random assignment to be offered the subsidy at all.

Upon quitting welfare, the experimentals were offered the work subsidy for the next 36 months.

This created a difficult selection problem because welfare exit was no doubt endogenous. Card

and Hyslop (2005) and Ferrall (2012) analyzed the experiment, the first estimating reduced form

models of welfare participation and employment and the second estimating a structural dynamic

model of welfare participation, labor supply and job search. Although neither study reported the

subsidy’s effect on labor supply, Ferrall’s model estimates revealed evidence of myopia and

labor market barriers, which partly explained why two-thirds of the experimentals did not quit

welfare within the specified period to become eligible for the subsidy.



    VI. US Welfare Reforms

    The U.S. enacted several reforms of its welfare system in the 1990s and 2000s which

differed in kind and/or magnitude from prior reforms and from those in other countries. These

include major reforms in the 1990s introducing time limits, work requirements, and lower tax

rates on benefits in its AFDC-TANF program. Each of these reforms, possibly excepting the

last, requires new or modified models from the ones we have considered.




                                                34
     VI.A. Models

     A1. Time Limits

        In a typical welfare time limit, an individual loses eligibility for welfare when her

cumulative periods of welfare participation since the time limit was introduced, St, reaches the

specified limit 𝑆̅. Its effects can be analyzed in a dynamic model of labor supply and welfare

participation.30 Consider a dynamic labor supply model simpler than that in Section III.A,

without welfare participation preference parameters and without preference persistence or human

capital, but still without borrowing or saving. Suppose a time limit is introduced in period 1

(S1=0) and let 𝑆̅ < 𝑇, where T is the length of the time horizon. The decision problem in period t

is

              𝑉𝑡 (𝑆𝑡 ; 𝜃, 𝜖𝜃𝑡 , 𝜖𝑤𝑡 ) ≡ max[𝑈(𝐻𝑡 , 𝑌𝑡 ; 𝜃, 𝜖𝜃𝑡 ) + 𝛽𝐸𝑡 𝑉𝑡+1 (𝑆𝑡+1 ; 𝜃)]                 (15)
                                      𝐻𝑡 ,𝑌𝑡


where 𝜃 is a time-invariant preference parameter, 𝜖𝜃𝑡 is a preference shock, 𝜖𝑤𝑡 is a wage shock,

the expectation is taken over the distribution of the two shocks, and where 𝐻𝑡 and 𝑌𝑡 are as

defined in III.A. The time limit introduces a new state variable S, which evolves according to

𝑆𝑡+1 = 𝑆𝑡 + 𝑃𝑡 , where 𝑃𝑡 is again a welfare participation indicator. Thus the intertemporal

tradeoff is that the individual loses one period of stock of welfare eligibility when she

participates in welfare now. The utility function does not depend on S when 𝑆 < 𝑆̅. When 𝑆 = 𝑆̅,

the individual becomes ineligible for welfare and the utility falls indirectly through the budget

constraint.

     For a myopic individual (𝛽 = 0), the time limit has no effect when 𝑆 < 𝑆̅ and it increases

labor supply when 𝑆 = 𝑆̅ (a “mechanical” effect). For a forward-looking individual (𝛽 > 0), she



30
  Grogger and Michalopoulos (1999) were the first to write down a dynamic theoretical model to demonstrate the
result given in this section.

                                                       35
may change her decision pre-emptively (a “behavioral” effect), which allows her to “smooth out”

the reduction in welfare generosity due to the time limit. Let 𝑉̅ [. ] be the indirect utility function

conditional on welfare participation status as defined in the static model of III.A. Denote the

        ̃𝑡 , which reflects the wage shock in t. The individual chooses 𝑃𝑡 = 1 when
wage by 𝑊

                  𝑉̅ [𝑊
                      ̃𝑡 (1 − 𝜏), 𝑁(1 − 𝑟) + 𝐺; 𝜃, 𝜖𝜃𝑡 ] − 𝑉̅ [𝑊
                                                               ̃𝑡 , 𝑁; 𝜃, 𝜖𝜃𝑡 ]

                                 −𝛽[𝐸𝑡 𝑉𝑡+1 (𝑆𝑡 ; 𝜃) − 𝐸𝑡 𝑉𝑡+1 (𝑆𝑡 + 1; 𝜃)] ≥ 0                                 (16)

     The last term inside the brackets is positive and reflects the option value of refraining from

participating in welfare now and “banking” the stock of benefits for which the individual is

eligible. As a consequence, because the term in brackets enters with a negative sign, the

individual is less likely to choose Pt=1 than in the static model. This is akin to an increase in the

fixed cost of welfare participation (see Section III.A), which results in non-participation of

eligibles and an indirect increase in labor supply.31 The magnitude of this “banking” effect

depends on the anticipated levels and distributions of future wages, for lower values of future

wages and/or a greater probability of a low wage in the future will increase the option value of

saving a period of welfare eligibility for later and not using it today.32

     A2. Work Requirements

         In its strictest form, a work requirement simply makes benefit receipt conditional on

working some minimum numbers of hours. In the static labor supply model, the utility function

is the same as in III.A but the budget constraint is:



31
   Note that this result remains qualitatively similar in a model without uncertainty. Suppose the individual knows
the wage in every period, and the number of periods that she participates in welfare in the absence of a time limit
exceeds 𝑆̅. Then, in the presence of the time limit, she participates in welfare in the 𝑆̅ periods that have the lowest
wage. This implies that she quits welfare in some periods, which increases labor supply.
32
   This could also be formulated in terms of the reservation wage for welfare participation, which was defined in
III.A, by showing that, under time limits, the welfare participation reservation wage increases (Grogger and
Michalopoulos, 1999). Also, we have not illustrated the point with preference shocks, which are in the model, but
an analogous set of results follow for them.

Participation in welfare now occurs if the maximum utility obtainable along the segment implied

by the second line of the budget constraint exceeds maximum utility elsewhere.33 Compared to

the situation without work requirements, only those individuals whose utility-maximizing𝐻 was

below 𝐻𝑚𝑖𝑛 are affected. Some of those will choose to increase 𝐻 up to 𝐻𝑚𝑖𝑛 exactly, while

others will simply go off welfare and locate on the nonwelfare constraint (Figure 5). In either

case, 𝐻 will rise (or possibly remain at zero) and utility will fall.

     In actual practice, work rules in U.S. welfare reform are much more complicated than this

simple model (Ziliak, 2016). Work requirements are typically not imposed on all participants

but only on those who are presumed to be able to work; those presumed not able to work are

exempted from the requirement. Ability to work is often proxied by health and disability, or by

the presence of young children (the latter is not really “ability” per se). Using observed variables

which are only a partial proxy for true ability to work means that Type I and Type II errors will

be made (some individuals who can work will not be required to and some who “cannot” work

will be required to).34 Violations of a work requirement usually are initially met with sanctions

(i.e., benefit reductions) rather than expulsion from welfare, although most often continued

violation will result in such expulsion. Most states allow individuals to reenter the welfare

system at some later date. There are also work requirement “time limits” that are separate from



33
  If the benefit is zero at 𝐻𝑚𝑖𝑛 , the individual cannot be on welfare and hence 𝑃 = 0.
34
  There is a separate literature which considers work requirements and other requirements as a screening device
working to ensure that only the most needy individuals apply. See Moffitt (2002, pp.2412-13; 2003b, pp.130-131)
for short reviews.

                                                       37
overall limits, which give the individual some period of time (e.g., two years) after first entering

welfare before the requirement must be met, although other states are “Work First” states which

require work immediately. Other states initially require a period of job search rather than actual

work, although requiring work after some period of time. Some states require applicants to

register with the local Unemployment Insurance office and begin job search before benefit

application can proceed. There has been little attempt to model these complexities in the

literature.35

     A3. Reductions in Tax Rates

     At the same time states were required to impose time limits and work requirements, they

were given the option to set the tax rate (i.e., percent earnings disregards) at their preferred level.

Prior to the reform, states were required to allow a deduction of $90 per month and were required

to have a 67 percent tax rate for any earnings above the deduction for 3 months, followed by a

100 percent tax rate. After the reform, many states reduced the tax rates and extended them

beyond 3 months. Section IV above reviewed the models and empirical evidence for such

reductions in 𝜏, so we have covered that topic already (although there probably are interactions

between such reductions and time limits and work requirements). We will review the evidence

on tax rate reductions that occurred specifically as part of this U.S. reform below. But many

states also increased the $90 deduction to higher amounts. An increase in a deduction has the

effects shown in Figure 6, illustrating that there should be both positive and negative labor

supply effects of such a change, and therefore also with a net effect ambiguous in sign.

    VI.B. Empirical Literature

    B1. Time Limits

    The most well-known form of time limit is the TANF federal limit, which restricted female-

headed families to a maximum of 5 years of federally funded cash benefits. Prior to TANF,

benefits were an entitlement for low-income female-headed families with children under 18

years of age. Overall, the literature finds that time limits reduced welfare use and increased labor

supply by a smaller degree. The literature’s development is complicated by two issues: (1)

Unlike most other policies, time limits generate an inherently dynamic effect; in particular,

whether individuals respond pre-emptively has important behavioral, policy and estimation

implications. (2) There is mixed success in disentangling the effects of welfare reform

components using policy variations across state and time, and in separating the effects of time

limits from the many other components of the same reform (e.g., Figlio and Ziliak (1999),

Moffitt (1999), Ziliak et al. (2000), Blank (2001), Ziliak (2016)).

    Building on reduced-form implications from the model in VI.A, Grogger and Michalopoulos

(2003) show that the incentive to conserve welfare benefits for future use depends negatively on

the age of the youngest child (A) and they use it to estimate the effect of a time limit in a welfare

reform experiment. Their empirical specification is adapted by subsequent reduced form studies

that examine time limits at a national scale (e.g., Grogger (2003, 2004), Fang and Keane (2004),

Mazzolari (2007)). Mazzolari (2007) also incorporates proxies for S; she finds limited pre-

emptive response along S, and the mechanical effect plays a large role in reducing welfare use.

In a competing-risk hazard model estimated from administrative data in South Carolina, which

implemented a stringent time limit, Ribar, Edelhoch and Liu (2008) find substantial pre-emptive

response via S as well as direct evidence of mechanical effects. Chan (2018) shows that some



                                                 39
existing reduced-form evidence likely understates the effect of time limits due to an implicit

modelling assumption. He also compares the pre-emptive responses along S and A and finds that

the former channel is important. All of the above studies estimate the welfare use effects of time

limits and only a handful estimate labor supply effects. Grogger (2003) finds that time limits

increased employment by an average of 0.9 ppt between 1993 and 1999. In Fang and Keane

(2004), the effect is between 0.3 and 1.1 ppt from 1997 to 2003.

     There have been three estimated structural models of time limits. Swann (2005) and Keane

and Wolpin (2010) estimate structural dynamic models on the pre-1996 AFDC program and use

their estimated models to simulate what the effect of time limits would be, while Chan (2013) is

the first to estimate a dynamic structural model on the post-reform data themselves.36 Swann

(2005) forecasts that a 5-year time limit would increase the employment rate of all women by

about 2.3 ppt.37 Chan (2013) finds that a 5-year time limit increases employment among single

mothers by 2.2 ppt by the end of year 5, just prior to anyone reaching the limit, and it increases

the average weekly work hour among workers from 32.4 to 32.8 (+1.1%).

     B2. Work Requirements

     There have been few structural models of work requirements estimated in the literature,

possibly because of the complexity of the content and implementation of work requirements

mentioned above. Instead, the empirical work has mostly estimated reduced form models which

typically use cross-state variation in some aspect of work requirements that differed across states

or else use evidence from experiments that tested different types of work requirements that



36
   He incorporates differences in the time horizon as well as variations in the implementation dates, lengths and
types of time limits across states.
37
   Keane and Wolpin (2010) also forecast that a time limit increases employment for those with the highest
propensities to be on welfare, by different degrees by race. But they find that the effects differ by age, with only
small effects on employment at young ages but larger effects at higher ages because women usually hit the time
limit and go off welfare altogether.

                                                          40
usually did not exactly replicate those implemented by states after the reform. Blank (2002) and

Grogger and Karoly (2005) review evidence from welfare reform experiments that involve

mandatory work-related requirements or services. The experimental evidence overwhelmingly

shows positive effects on employment, although the magnitude of the effect varies with the type

of mandatory work required (e.g., simple job search, some of kind of human capital training, or a

combination of both).38 . Fang and Keane (2004) characterize the various types of work

requirements for different states (including exemptions) in a detailed reduced-form specification.

They find that these policies as a whole increased the work participation of single mothers by 0.8

to 1.8 ppts between 1997 and 2003. Using information from Grogger and Karoly (2005) who

classify states into three levels of sanction severity for noncompliance of work requirements,

Chan (2013) allows sanctions to reduce the welfare benefit among nonworkers in the budget

constraint (except among those who are exempt due to having a young child). He finds that an

intermediate/severe sanction policy is roughly equivalent to a one-third reduction in the benefit

among non-workers, and it increases employment by 1.9 ppt in year 5 following implementation.

As in Fang and Keane, he finds that many individuals simply quit welfare. Similarly, the limited

evidence on work requirement time limits suggests that they tend to move nonworking welfare

recipients off welfare (Swann (2005), Keane and Wolpin (2010)).39 In a related reform on Food

Stamps, Ribar, Edelhoch and Liu (2010) use time and county-by-county variability in the

applicability of work requirement time limits to able-bodied adult-only households in South



38
   However, Blank and Grogger-Karoly also show that benefit reductions, including exits from welfare, reduced
income by either the same amount or more than earnings increased. Consequently, family income generally fell
after the implementation of these work requirement programs. See also Greenberg (2009) for more detail on this
issue. These average effects presumably reflect a combination of income gains and losses, as shown in Figure 5.
Other evidence consistent with the existence of both income losers as well as income gainers from work
requirements has shown a growth after these reforms in the number of so-called “disconnected” families who have
neither cash welfare benefits nor earnings (Ziliak, 2016, p.367).
39
   See Ziliak (2016) for an additional review of this literature.

Carolina to find that these rules reduced Food Stamp participation by about 10%. The rules led to

some program exits into employment but many other exits into non-employment.

     Fang and Silverman (2009) examine whether work requirements (and time limits) can

alleviate individuals’ work commitment problem. Present-biased individuals may be “trapped” in

a status of suboptimal employment as they systematically underestimate the future value of

human capital accumulation. They find that these policies are generally ineffective as a

commitment device. Chan (2017) estimates a dynamic structural model with heterogeneous

discount and present-bias factors, which are identified via a welfare reform experiment with a

time limit. He finds that some sanctions are effective in that they magnify the labor supply

response due to commitment-related incentives. He also finds that such incentives are larger

among the most present-biased individuals, who also tend to prefer a sanction policy over no

sanctions.

     B3. Tax Rate Reductions

     Major reductions in welfare tax rates were part of the same reforms of the US AFDC

program that enacted time limits and work requirements.40 Structural models estimated from

pre-reform data have examined this issue one way or another, typically finding small effects of

reductions in 𝜏 on average labor supply (e.g., Keane and Moffitt (1998), Swann (2005), as noted

in Section IV.B). Also, very few studies have attempted to use cross-state variation to identify

the effects of reductions in 𝜏 separate from the effects of time limits, work requirements, and

other reform features, again primarily because of the difficulty in separating their effects. One




40
   This and other reforms in this period also increased the income eligibility in the Medicaid program, moving the
“notch” upward (see IV.A). As noted previously, this has ambiguous effects on labor supply. See Buchmueller et
al. (2016) for a survey of empirical results.

                                                        42
exception is Chan (2013), who finds a small effect of the reductions in 𝜏 (as well as increases in

the deduction) on average labor supply.

     Most of the literature on the effects of reductions in 𝜏 on labor supply in 1990s-style reforms

comes instead from experimental evidence. Unfortunately, one problem with these studies is

that most of the experiments tested combinations of tax rate reductions with other reforms (time

limits, work requirements) and hence inferences about the effects of tax rate reductions per se are

problematic. But a more basic problem with most of the experiments is that they randomized tax

rates (and other reform features) on a sample of current welfare recipients, which means that they

could not estimate the effects of the reform on entry into welfare. Yet the simple model in IV.A

makes clear that the total effect on labor supply will depend on entry. Indeed, that model implies

that tax-rate reductions will only have positive effects on labor supply of those initially on

welfare, and the negative effects arising from entry will be missed altogether. In fact, most of

the experimental evidence shows increases in average labor supply and earnings from tax-rate

reductions, probably for this reason.41

      Bitler, Gelbach and Hoynes (2006), unlike virtually all of the rest of the literature, attempt

to estimate the distribution of labor supply effects of welfare reform and to identify both the

positive and negative effects of a reduction in 𝜏. Using earnings data from a welfare reform

experiment in Connecticut that tested the effect of a zero-percent tax rate combined with a

maximum income limit (creating a notch in the budget constraint), they show that the average

effect masks heterogeneous responses that are consistent with the simple labor supply theory.

While the experiment also tested time limits, work requirements, sanctions, and other policies,


41
  Grogger and Karoly (2005, Figure 6.1) find that virtually all experiments showed positive effects on employment
from increasing financial work incentives, although sometimes combined with work requirements. However,
reductions in 𝜏 should always increase employment; it is their effects on hours of work and earnings that are
ambiguous in sign.

                                                       43
the authors argue that the effects of those components did not affect their results.42 In a follow-up

paper, Kline and Tartari (2016) use revealed preference to estimate the effects of the experiment

on earnings and welfare participation, assuming that the time limit has no effect. They find that

at least 20% of control group women whose earnings are above the notch will reduce their

earnings below the notch (but remain working) and receive welfare under the experiment. While

more individuals work in the treatment group, they find that it is more difficult to disentangle the

response into specific channels.



     VII. Child Care Reforms

     VII.A. Models

     Child care subsidies from governments take a variety of forms—free center-based care,

subsidized center-based care, subsidized care for multiple types of child care arrangements and

modes, lump sum cash payments, and so on. Often aimed at the low income population (but not

always; they are sometimes universal), they also sometimes come with minimum hours

restrictions, earnings requirements, and other rules. Nevertheless, modelling their effects on

labor supply can be most easily illustrated by assuming that they take the form of a simple open-

ended subsidy of s per hour of paid child care given to a parent who works.43 Assuming that paid

care is required for all workers, such a subsidy simply raises the net wage (compared to no




42
   As noted above, experiments on recipients necessarily miss entry effects and hence it is likely that there were
more negative effects than were captured by the data. The authors note this drawback but also note that they could
capture reentry and exit effects.
43
   Paid care which is provided unrelated to employment or hours simply can be viewed in terms of income effects
which shift the budget constraint outward but also has a substitution effect that induces people to use paid care rather
than unpaid care. Blau (2003) presents several simple static labor supply models with different types of child care
subsidies.

                                                          44
subsidy) from W to W+s, which has the same effect on labor supply as any increase in the wage

rate (Heckman (1974)).44

        Almost all of the models of child care do not adopt the simple consumption-leisure model of

child care, with the only effect of subsidization to affect the net wage. Instead, the models

introduce child quality into the parental utility function, usually as 𝑈(𝐿, 𝑄, 𝐶) where L is leisure

hours, Q is child quality (assume one child), and C is consumption. A child quality production

function is specified, most often as 𝑄 = 𝑄(𝑀, 𝐹, 𝐶) where M is the parent’s hours spent in child

care and F is hours spent in paid child care with an associated market price per hour.45 Using the

household production framework of Becker (1965), it can be shown that M and F are optimally

allocated so that the ratio of their factor prices (wage and paid care price, respectively) equals the

ratio of their marginal products in child quality production. A child care subsidy shifts this

optimal allocation by increasing F and reducing M, which in turn increases H. Therefore, the

subsidy’s effect on labor supply remains qualitatively similar to that in the simple consumption-

leisure model, although the underlying mechanism is different.

        The literature has also long noted that the subsidy’s effect on Q is ambiguous because it

depends on the shape of Q(.), or the “relative quality” of M and F. Some empirical work has

shown, in fact, negative effects of the use of formal child care on child outcomes, presumably

because the child care is low in quality. This has led to debates in the U.S. of whether the

government should only subsidize high-quality care, even if that were to have a smaller positive

effect on employment. The simple models like the one above used in the literature are not well-

suited to addressing this issue because the choice of different child care arrangements with

different qualities and different prices is not modelled.


44
     If a parent was already incurring costs c per hour, then the net wage rises from W-c to W-c+s.
45
     Some papers add ‘free’ relative care to the production function.

                                                           45
     The static model also cannot capture many important dynamics which are no doubt

important to the parental decision to work and use paid care or to stay home and use parental

care. For example, parents may feel that their own time has a higher marginal product relative to

paid care when the child is young than when the child is older, which will generate age-

dependent patterns of labor supply and child care use. Human capital considerations may play a

role if the foregone future earnings from devoting home time differs by age of the child. Child

care subsidy programs could therefore have different effects at different child and parental ages.



     VII.B. Empirical Literature

     There is a large literature on the labor supply effects of child care in the U.S. which uses the

market child care price as a variable in an empirically-estimated labor supply equation rather

than any direct measurement of government subsidy.46 This literature usually uses the child

production function model described above but only estimates reduced form regressions of labor

supply on wages and child care prices, interpreting the coefficients as an amalgam of preference

and production function parameters (and not attempting estimation of the child production

function). The child care price is often predicted from a first-stage regression using a variety of

instruments, sometimes geographic and sometimes indicators of child care quality in an area. To

the extent that government child care programs can be modelled as a simple reduction in the

market price of average quality care, these estimates can be used to estimate the impacts of

government care.




46
  We limit our scope to narrowly defined definitions of child care subsidies. Some related programs, such as Head
Start, are means-tested but they place the key emphasis on child development. The evidence on labor supply effects
of Head Start remain mixed (Griffen and Todd, 2017). For a general review of programs related to early childhood
education and their effects on child outcomes, see for instance Elango, Garcia, Heckman and Hojman (2016).

                                                        46
       Blau (2003) reviewed the early literature, finding that a higher child care price reduces

labor supply among both single and married mothers. While the elasticities range widely across

studies, those that adopt a multinomial specification (combinations of labor supply and paid care)

tend to have a smaller elasticity (-0.07 to -0.34). Several structural or quasi-structural studies

have used their estimated models to simulate reforms on the non-refundable Child and

Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC), which covers up to 30% of child care expenditure for

low-income families. While Michalopoulos, Robins and Garfinkel (1992) and Ribar (1995) find

very small labor supply effects (but larger effects on paid care use), a larger labor supply effect is

found in Averett, Peters and Waldman (1997), who treat paid care utilization as exogenous.

       There have been more U.S. studies of female labor supply in response to child care price

since these early studies. In a study which focuses more on the effect of child care on child

outcomes than on labor supply, Bernal (2008) estimates a dynamic discrete choice structural

model of employment and child care usage jointly with a child cognitive ability production

function. Her data did not have information on child care price, so she estimated it from the

utility cost of using child care. Overall, she finds that a 35% child care subsidy (implemented as

a reduction of child care price) increases the employment rate of married mothers by about 1 ppt.

       There have also been a number of studies which instead use some kind of child care

reform to estimate employment effects although, again, in most cases not modeling the quality of

the child care directly or modeling the price-quality choice tradeoff and its effects on labor

supply. Blau (2003) and Blau and Tekin (2007) review a few evaluations of local-area reforms

in the 1980s and early 1990s, either from direct comparisons of recipients to a comparison group,

from an experiment, or from using variation in reform offerings to instrument a child-care receipt




                                                 47
variable in an employment equation. Most of these studies found increases in employment from

the reforms.

     A major reform in the U.S. in 1996 increased total child care subsidies to states,

consolidated four programs into the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF), allowed states

great flexibility in designing eligibility and subsidy levels, and formed eligibility rules that

required parents to only be employed (or engaged in work-related activities) and not to have to

be recipients of cash welfare (TANF). Studies of this reform include Fang and Keane (2004),

who note that states shifted funds into child care from other grants to maintain overall spending

out of their own funds at a required minimum level. The authors used the resulting cross-state

variation in state CCDF expenditure per single mother as a measure of the availability and

generosity of child care subsidies (as well as some age differentiation in eligibility). In a reduced

form regression of employment on this CCDF variable and a variety of other state policy

variables and individual demographics and their interactions, the authors find that the CCDF

increased the employment of single mothers by 0.1 to 1.3 ppt between 1997 and 2002. Blau and

Tekin (2007) and Tekin (2007) use a post-reform cross-sectional survey to estimate the effect of

cross-state variation in child care prices to estimate effects of the reform on labor supply. Blau

and Tekin find that the reform increased employment by 13 ppt while Tekin finds that the

subsidy has a only a small employment effect, although he also simulates a more lenient

eligibility limit and finds that it increases full-time work by a larger degree (in absolute and

relative terms) than part-time work.47 Griffen (forthcoming) uses post-reform data to estimate a

dynamic structural model of maternal labor supply and child care usage with built-in features of


47
  Bernal and Keane (2010, 2011) use the same data set used by Bernal (2008) but use the child-care reform
variables used in Fang and Keane (2004) to estimate the effect of child-care reform on child test scores with
reduced-form equations derived from a structural discrete choice dynamic model. However, they do not examine
labor supply per se.

                                                      48
child quality production, price-quality relationship of child care, and the income-conditioning of

child care subsidies. He finds that the subsidy program increases maternal employment by 6.38

ppt but has virtually no impact on cognitive skills, which is partly driven by shifts in child care

quality choices.

     There is a significant literature on the effect of child care subsidies on labor supply in other

countries. Child care subsidies in Europe are quite different than those in the U.S., often

provided through supply-side subsidies to child care providers. Direct subsidies are often on top

of subsidized private or public care. Child care subsidies in other countries also typically place

less emphasis on promoting employment and more on promoting child development (some

subsidies are not linked to employment at all, which is likely to reduce any positive impact on

employment).48

     Blau and Tekin (2007) reviewed some early European studies from the 1990s and early

2000s which generally show positive effects of child care programs on labor supply. But the

empirical evidence remains mixed. Baker, Gruber and Milligan (2008) and Lefebvre and

Merrigan (2008) studied a reform that reduced the price of subsidized child care to CAD$5 per

day in Québec using a DD strategy, finding that it increased the employment rate of mothers

with young children by 7 ppt. Lundin, Mork and Ockert (2008) studied a reform that placed a

cap on childcare prices in Sweden using a DD strategy and find that the effect is close to zero.

Havnes and Mogstad (2011) studied the expansion of subsidized child care in Norway in the

1970s using a DD strategy and they find that it has a very small labor supply effect.

Bauernschuster and Schlotter (2015) studied a reform that removed child care rations in



48
  There are exceptions such as Australia, where some subsidies require work and others do not. The labor supply
effects of that system were analyzed in Doiron and Kalb (2005), Apps, Kabatek, Rees and van Soest (2016) and
Gong and Breunig (2017).

Bettendorf et al. (2015) studied the effects of an expansion of the generosity of child care

subsidies in the Netherlands using a DD strategy and find only modest impacts on maternal

employment. Nollenberger and Rodriguex-Planas (2015) studied a reform that expanded

subsidized child care in Spain and find a large effect in some specifications.50

     Some child care reforms tend to discourage employment. In the late 1990s Norway

implemented a reform which provided cash benefits to parents with children aged 1-3 who did

not use formal child care. Parents could substitute cash benefits for formal care, which was

heavily subsidized. Benefit receipt did not involve employment restrictions, and its amount (per

child) was similar to the state subsidy in formal care. Schøne (2004) and Drange and Rege

(2013) use a DD approach by comparing mothers of age-5 children and age-2 children and find

that the reform reduced maternal employment by 2 to 3 ppt and full-time work by 4 to 5 ppt.

Similar effects are found in Kornstad and Thoresen (2007) who simulate the reform using a static

discrete choice model of labor supply child care estimated from pre-reform data. Chan and Liu

(forthcoming) estimate a dynamic structural model of labor supply, child care use and fertility,

and use it to examine the reform’s life-cycle effects (not just mothers with young children) and

effects on the long-run cognitive outcomes of children. Their model incorporates the variations

in reform exposure across women and child cohorts. They find that the effects differ

substantially by the stage of the life cycle and are partly driven by increased fertility.51 If the

50
   We should note that Blundell et al. (2016) incorporated policy changes in the amount of childcare cost tax credits
given in the UK welfare system when estimating their structural model. However, they did not simulate the effects
of those changes in credits independent of other policy changes that occurred at the same time.
51
   They find that formal care use among mothers with young children reduced considerably, but formal care use
among all women reduced slightly partly because more women became mothers.

program is introduced when a low-education woman is aged 19, then it will reduce her

employment by 1.9 and 2.4 ppt in the 6th and 12th year, respectively, due to a decrease in full-

time work and a small increase in part-time work.



    VIII. Summary and Future Research

    This brief review of the models and empirical literature on welfare reform and the labor

market reveals an area of research that is both old and voluminous yet still producing new and

interesting research. The development of dynamic models which incorporate life cycle and

human capital effects, models to capture the effects of U.S. reforms like time limits, and models

to capture the wide variety of earnings subsidies are among the most recent contributions.

Empirically, there has been a large volume of new research on earnings subsidies, U.S. reforms,

and child care reforms.

       For future research, we can confidently predict that research in this area will continue to

follow the lead of policy developments in the various countries where welfare reform has been

occurring. In most countries, welfare programs are periodically reformed and changed in

response to shifting social and political preferences as to the purpose and goals of those

programs, whom they are intended to serve, and what their incentive effects should be. Earnings

subsidies, U.S.-style welfare reforms, and child care subsidies are continuing to be modified.

This by itself should provide a continued source of fresh inspiration for research and evaluation.

    But in addition to future research as programs continue to be modified, there are many areas

we have reviewed where more modelling and empirical work are needed. Speaking generally,

there has been far too little work on the dynamic aspects of labor supply choices in the presence

of different kinds of programs (traditional welfare versus earnings subsidies, for example) where



                                                51
human capital, family structure, migration, occupational choice, and other important life cycle

decisions are important. Relatedly, while the insurance motive for transfer programs has been

examined on and off in the literature, dynamic models with uncertainty are needed to fully

understand those insurance effects and how they relate to labor market issues. While not exactly

the same as insurance in steady state periods, the role of programs in providing a type of

insurance during downturns, while often discussed informally, has rarely been modeled, even

though it has strong implications for macroeconomic models as well as microeconomic ones.

Finally, in a more methodological vein, more structural models are needed in almost every area

of research we have covered. A healthy mix of reduced form and structural estimation would be

optimal in this field, with both contributing in complementary ways, but only models with at

least some structure are capable of delivering the kinds of counterfactual analyses that are needed

to predict the effects of reforms the government is considering but which have not been tried.

These, and no doubt many other topics we have not mentioned, furnish a rich menu of research

questions that will move the field forward in the future.
