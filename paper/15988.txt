This paper studies a quantitative general equilibriummodel of the housing market where a large number
of overlapping generations of homeowners face both idiosyncratic and aggregate risks but have limited
opportunities to insure against these risks due to incomplete financial markets and collateralized borrowing
constraints. Interest rates in the model, like housing and equity returns, are determined endogenously
from a market clearing condition. The model has two key elements not previously considered in existing
quantitative macro studies of housing finance: aggregate business cycle risk, and a realistic wealth
distribution driven in the model by bequest heterogeneity in preferences. These features of the model
play a crucial role in the following results. First, a relaxation of financing constraints leads to a large
boom in house prices. Second, the boom in house prices is entirely the result of a decline in the housing
risk premium. Third, low interest rates cannot explain high home values.

1     Introduction
Residential real estate is a large and volatile component of household wealth. Moreover,
volatility in housing wealth is often characterized by large swings in house prices relative to
housing fundamentals. For example, Figure 1 shows that national house price-rent ratios
climbed to unusual heights by the end of 2006, but have since exhibited sharp declines. What
lies behind such volatility in housing markets?
    It is well understood that the period leading up to the peak of the housing boom was
characterized by two systemic changes in housing …nance. First, the period was character-
ized by a widespread relaxation of underwriting standards that reduced housing …nancing
constraints in both U.S. and international mortgage markets. Conversely, the housing bust
that followed was associated with a subsequent reversal of these standards. Second, the
entire period was characterized by a sharp increase in foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury
and Agency debt, and steady declines in U.S. real interest rates.
    Yet despite broad agreement on these historical facts, there is little academic consensus on
the degree to which such changes can explain large ‡uctuations in home prices in quantitative
macroeconomic models. Indeed, there is quite a bit of disagreement on these points (see
literature review below). At the same time, the extant literature is largely silent on the extent
to which economy-wide changes in housing …nance might cause ‡uctuations in a number
of pivotal endogenous variables that could serve as transmission channels for generating
volatility in house prices. These include risk premia in housing and equity markets, measures
of cross-sectional risk-sharing, and life-cycle patterns in wealth accumulation and savings.
    The objective of this paper is to study a quantitative macroeconomic model that is gen-
eral enough to address these questions. To do so, we specify a two-sector general equilibrium
model of housing and non-housing production, where heterogenous homeowners face both
idiosyncratic and aggregate risks but have limited opportunities to insure against these risks
due to incomplete …nancial markets and collateralized borrowing constraints. A house in
our model is a residential durable asset that provides utility to the household, is illiquid
(expensive to trade), and can be used as collateral in debt obligations. The model econ-
omy is populated by a large number of overlapping generations of homeowners who receive
utility from both housing and nonhousing consumption and who face a stochastic life-cycle
earnings pro…le. Interest rates in the model, like housing and equity returns, are determined
endogenously from a market clearing condition.
    The model we study has two key elements not previously considered in existing quanti-


                                               1
tative macro studies of housing …nance, but that we …nd play a crucial role in the results.
First, the model includes aggregate business cycle risk, in addition to idiosyncratic income
risk. Second, the model includes a mechanism for generating a realistic wealth distribution.
Speci…cally, the model matches the highly skewed U.S. wealth distribution by presuming the
presence of two types of households: a small minority who are born wealthy as a result of
receiving a deliberate bequest (and who themselves leave bequests upon death), and a much
larger majority who receive small or zero bequests and start working life with little wealth.
We refer to this element of the model as bequest heterogeneity. The signi…cance of both of
these features of the model is discussed below.
   Within the context of this model, we focus our theoretical investigation on the macroeco-
nomic consequences of the two systemic changes in housing …nance described above. First,
we investigate the impact of an economy-wide change in housing collateral constraints, a
phenomenon we refer to hereafter as a …nancial market liberalization. Second, we investigate
the impact of a sustained in‡ux of foreign capital into the domestic bond market. We use
our framework as a laboratory for studying the impact of ‡uctuations in either direction of
these features of housing …nance.
   The model economy is populated entirely by homeowners. It delivers a measure of aggre-
gate house prices relative to fundamental value equal to the endogenous national house price
index divided by the aggregate (across homeowners) housing service ‡ow value, where the
latter is measured for an individual as the ratio of the marginal utility of housing services to
that of the non-housing consumption ‡ow. We aggregate this marginal utility ratio across
households and divide it into the model’s house price index, a quantity we refer to as the
price-marginal utility ratio, or P/MU ratio for short. The P/MU ratio implicitly de…nes
an aggregate housing return, equal to the house price index (less depreciation) plus MU,
expressed as a fraction of last period’s house price index. Since the model parameters satisfy
a transversality condition that would e¤ectively rule out a bubble in this non-traded asset,
a standard …rst-order approximation implies that the log P/MU ratio can ‡uctuate only
through one of three channels: (i) positively with increases in expected future MU growth,
(ii) negatively with increases in expected future interest rates, or (iii) negatively with in-
creases in the expected future housing return in excess of the interest rate, an endogenous
quantity we refer to as the national housing risk premium. Note that if the housing risk
premium is sizable enough, variation in it can create large movements in P/MU. We study
how the systemic changes in housing …nance described above a¤ect the P/MU ratio through
each of these three channels.


                                               2
   We summarize four key …ndings from the model.
   An economy-wide relaxation of collateral requirements generates a large boom
in house prices relative to housing fundamentals. Existing studies of quantitative
macro models with housing typically …nd that changes in …nancing constraints have surpris-
ingly small e¤ects on house prices. By contrast, when we consider an empirically plausible
relaxation of credit constraints for the period 2000-2006, this change alone generates an in-
crease in the P/MU ratio equal to more than 60 percent of the increase in observed price-rent
ratios over this period from two di¤erent U.S. data sources, and 40 percent of that from a
third data source. When we combine this with a plausible sequence of business cycle shocks,
the model P/MU ratio increases by an amount equal to virtually all of the increase of two
of the price-rent ratios over the course of a dynamic transition. The model also predicts a
sharp decline in home prices starting in 2007, driven by the economic contraction and by a
presumed reversal of the …nancial market liberalization (but not the foreign capital in‡ow).
   The model studied here has two key elements that are missing from quantitative macro
models that predict small e¤ects on house prices from changing …nancing constraints. The
…rst is aggregate business cycle risk (in addition to idiosyncratic income risk). The second is
bequest heterogeneity (or a plausible wealth distribution). We …nd that both are important
for generating large changes in house prices from economy-wide movements in collateral
requirements. Aggregate business cycle risk is important because it contributes to sizable
risk premia in housing (and equity) markets. Business cycle shocks lead to endogenous
changes in …nancing constraints through their equilibrium e¤ects on collateral values. Since
…nancing constraints directly alter a household’s ability to insure against risks, any given
change in constraints will have greater in‡uence on risk premia in a model where business
cycle risk is present rather than absent. By considering a special case of our model without
business cycle risk, we can show that the presence of such risk ampli…es the impact of
changing …nancing constraints on the P/MU ratio.
   But the second element of the model responsible for this result is bequest heterogeneity.
By calibrating the model to match the high degree of wealth inequality in the data, along
with a plausible value for the mean real interest rate, we are naturally led to a speci…cation
in which a substantial fraction of housing demand is attributable to households who are
constrained or close to constrained. Under these circumstances, an unanticipated economy-
wide change in collateral requirements is itself an important source of aggregate risk that
cannot be insured away. In a special case of the model without bequest heterogeneity, too
few households are constrained and changing …nancing constraints have only a small impact


                                              3
on national home values. But this special case also generates a wealth distribution with far
too little inequality. Note that in the full model with bequest heterogeneity, the number
of constrained households is not speci…ed exogenously, but is instead disciplined by the
requirement that we match the wealth distribution.
   A relaxation of collateral constraints drives up the housing P/MU ratio be-
cause it drives down the housing risk premium. Risk premia on both housing and
equity in the model economy ‡uctuate with an aggregate productivity shock that drives the
business cycle. But business cycle risk is not the only source of sizable risk premia in the
model. When a non-trivial fraction of households operate close to their collateral constraints,
any economy-wide ‡uctuation that alters these constraints is itself an important source of
aggregate risk. This can be seen in the model by observing that economies with lower collat-
eral requirements but the same level of business cycle risk exhibit less volatile consumption,
more risk sharing, less precautionary saving, and lower housing and equity risk premia. A
relaxation of constraints improves households’ability to insure against risks and generates
an endogenous decline in the housing risk premium. At the same time, less binding …nancing
constraints increase housing demand. We show that a …nancial market liberalization drives
up the P/MU ratio precisely because it drives down the housing risk premium.
   In fact, in the general equilibrium of the model, the only way to generate a housing
boom from a relaxation in …nancing constraints is through a decline in the housing risk
premium. Speci…cally, the boom can’t be explained by a decline in interest rates; nor can it
be explained by an expectation of faster growth in housing fundamentals. The reason is that
the increase in aggregate housing demand that results from a …nancial market liberalization
leads to an endogenous increase in residential investment and an expected decline in MU
growth. And although lower collateral requirements generate a housing boom, they also cause
households to endogenously respond to the improved risk-sharing opportunities by reducing
precautionary saving, which leads to an increase in the equilibrium real interest rate. Both
of these adjustments have the e¤ect of reducing P/MU. It follows that the only way the
P/MU ratio can rise in response to a relaxation of …nancing constraints is if the decrease
in the housing risk premium more than o¤sets the combined e¤ects of faster expected MU
growth and a higher real interest rate.
   Lower interest rates cannot explain a large boom in house prices. The housing
boom that occurred in the …rst part of the 21st century was characterized by both lower col-
lateral requirements and lower real interest rates. Since a relaxation of …nancing constraints
cannot by itself generate lower equilibrium interest rates (indeed it generates the opposite),


                                              4
the model implies that some other factor must have been at work to explain the decline
in observed interest rates over this period. This underscores the importance of including
foreign capital ‡ows in our model. Once we allow for a quantitatively plausible in‡ux of
foreign capital into the domestic bond market, the model generates a large decline in the
equilibrium real interest rate even in an economy with lower collateral requirements. But
while a large foreign capital in‡ow can explain why interest rates declined, it cannot explain
why house prices rose. This is because the in‡ux of foreign capital that drives interest rates
down in the …rst place crowds domestic savers out of the safe bond market, exposing them to
greater systematic risk in equity and housing markets. In endogenous response, risk premia
on housing (and equity) assets rise, substantially o¤setting the e¤ects of lower interest rates
on home prices.
   A …nancial market liberalization plus a foreign capital in‡ow lead to a shift in
the composition of wealth towards housing, increase …nancial wealth inequality,
but reduce housing and consumption inequality. A …nancial market liberalization plus
an in‡ow of foreign capital into the domestic bond market lead households of all ages and
incomes to shift the composition of their wealth towards housing, consistent with observed
changes in household-level data from 2000 to 2007. These factors also have implications
for inequality and risk-sharing. We show that a …nancial market liberalization and foreign
capital infusion reduce consumption and housing wealth inequality, but increase …nancial
wealth inequality.
   The model we explore is a rich quantitative paradigm that produces a large number
of testable implications. We …nd that it does a good job of matching a range of stylized
facts of …nancial markets, housing markets, and business cycle data. For example, the
baseline model produces a sizable equity premium and empirically accurate Sharpe ratio
along with a low and stable real interest rate. But the framework is limited in its ability to
explain several important aspects of the data. In particular, the model understates empirical
estimates of housing return volatility derived from data on individual house returns (Flavin
and Yamashita (2002), Landvoigt, Piazzesi, and Schneider (2013)). In the robustness section
of the paper, we report the results of one attempt to address this limitation by adding
idiosyncratic depreciation risk to the model, but …nd that such a modi…cation has only a small
quantitative impact on the result. The model also generates half of the observed volatility
in equity returns, too much predictability in dividend growth, and too little predictability
in excess returns at long horizons but too much at short horizons. It will be of interest to
explore theoretical modi…cations in future work that might bring these aspects of the theory


                                              5
more in line with the data, such as considering di¤erent forms of idiosyncratic housing risk
and additional aggregate shocks, (e.g., investment speci…c technology shocks).
        The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses related literature.
Section 3 describes recent changes in the key aspects of housing …nance discussed above:
collateral constraints, and foreign capital in U.S. debt markets. Section 4 presents the
theoretical model. Section 5 presents our main …ndings. Section 6 concludes. The Appendix
contains a large amount of additional information, including evidence on changing housing
…nance conditions, a detailed explanation of the model’s calibration and model solution
technique, the results of several checks on the numerical accuracy of the model solution, and
the results of an additional case in which the …nancial market liberalization is accompanied
by a decline in borrowing costs as well as a relaxation of …nancing constraints.


2         Related Literature
Our paper is related to a growing body of literature in …nance that studies the asset pricing
implications of incomplete markets models. The focus of much of this literature has been
on the equity market implications of pure exchange economies with exogenous endowments,
with less work specifying a role for housing or the production side of the economy.1
        But several important papers study questions related to housing and/or consumer durables.
We are aware of only one other paper (at the time of the …rst draft of this paper) that solves
for equilibrium asset prices in a model where the portfolio choice problem involves three
assets (housing, stocks and bonds). Piazzesi and Schneider (2008) do so, as here. Other
papers typically either do not model production (instead studying a pure exchange econ-
omy), and/or the portfolio choice problem underlying asset allocation between a risky and a
risk-free asset, or are analyses of partial equilibrium environments. See for example, the gen-
eral equilibrium exchange-economy analyses that embed bond, stock and housing markets of
Ríos-Rull and Sánchez-Marcos (2006), Lustig and Van Nieuwerburgh (2007, 2008), and the
partial equilibrium analyses of Peterson (2006), Ortalo-Magné and Rady (2006), and Corbae
and Quintin (2009). Fernández-Villaverde and Krueger (2005) study how consumption over

Basak and Cuoco (1998), Luttmer (1999)), for a study of single sector exchange economies, or Lustig and
Van Nieuwerburgh (2005) for a two-sector exchange economy model. Storesletten, Telmer, and Yaron (2007),
Gomes and Michaelides (2008), and Favilukis (2013) explicitly model the production side of the economy,
but focus on single-sector economies without housing.

the life-cycle is in‡uenced by consumer durables, but limit their focus to equilibria in which
prices, wages and interest rates are constant over time. We add to this literature by consid-
ering each of these general equilibrium features. We add to Piazzesi and Schneider (2008)
by modeling the production side, in two sectors. Generally speaking, these papers are not
focused on the role of housing …nance in driving house price movements, as here.
   Two papers that study the relation between debt and the macro economy are Iacoviello
and Pavan (2013) and Campbell and Hercowitz (2006). Iacoviello and Pavan (2013) study
the role of housing and debt for the volatility of the aggregate economy in an incomplete
markets model with aggregate risk. Because there is no risk-free asset in their model, their
investigation is silent about the role of risk premia in the economy. Campbell and Hercowitz
(2006) study the e¤ects of changing collateral constraints in a general equilibrium model that
combines collateralized household debt with heterogeneity of time preference. This model
contains aggregate risk but the only security traded is one-period collateralized debt, thus
this setup is also silent on the role of risk premia in aggregate ‡uctuations. The importance
of aggregate risk and ‡uctuating risk premia is a central focus of this paper. To the best of
our knowledge, this paper is the …rst to investigate the role of time-varying risk premia as a
primary channel for generating and propagating ‡uctuations in housing markets.
   Our paper is linked to a literature that studies ‡uctuations in home prices relative to
housing fundamentals. Some researchers have argued that increases in national house-price
rent ratios re‡ect an expected increase in future housing fundamentals, such as rental growth.
In partial equilibrium analyses where discount rates are held constant, this is the only out-
come possible (e.g., Sinai and Souleles (2005), Campbell and Cocco (2007)). But partial
equilibrium analyses overlook the general equilibrium response of both residential invest-
ment and discount rates to economic growth. In the model here, positive economic shocks
stimulate greater housing demand and greater residential investment, which causes marginal
utility growth to decline rather than increase, as the housing stock expands. In the gen-
eral equilibrium here, high house prices relative to housing fundamentals can only re‡ect
expectations of future house price depreciation (lower housing returns).
   Outside of the incomplete markets environment, a strand of the macroeconomic literature
studies housing behavior in a two-sector, general equilibrium business cycle framework either
with production (e.g., Davis and Heathcote (2005), Kahn (2008)) or without production
(e.g., Piazzesi, Schneider, and Tuzel (2007)). The focus in these papers is on environments
with complete markets for idiosyncratic risks and a representative agent representation.
Kahn (2008) …nds that long-term growth trends in house prices and output can generate


                                              7
house prices that are substantially more volatile than output. But this model abstracts
from heterogeneity and …nancial frictions, both of which lie at the heart of movements in
risk premia in our framework. We argue here that ‡uctuations in housing risk premia are
essential for understanding the large observed boom-bust patterns in aggregate house prices
relative to housing fundamentals, which cannot be readily attributed empirically to either
sharp swings in expected growth in housing fundamentals or expected real interest rates.
       The two papers closest to ours in subject matter are Kiyotaki, Michaelides, and Nikolov
(2011) (KMN) and Sommer, Sullivan, and Verbrugge (2013) (SSV). Both of these papers
study quantitative macroeconomic models with housing, idiosyncratic risk, and …nancing
constraints. And like this study, both papers are focused on the subject of how changes
in …nancing constraints and interest rates e¤ect equilibrium home prices. Unlike this study,
however, these models predict that a relaxation of …nancing constraints has only small e¤ects
on house prices, while movements in real interest rates have large e¤ects. Both results
contrast sharply with the implications of our model.
       A virtue of the models considered in KMN and SSV relative to the one studied here is
that they specify endogenous rental markets. But this discrepancy does not appear to be the
source of our contrasting results. Our analysis instead indicates that the crucial discrepancies
are three-fold. First, both the KMN and the SSV models are partial equilibrium analyses
where the risk-free real interest rate is an exogenous parameter rather than an equilibrium
variable. Second, the models have no quantitatively important sources of aggregate risk, so
risk premia are negligible. Third, the models have no mechanism for matching the wealth
distribution.2 The …rst and second of these di¤erences are directly related to the question
of whether lower interest rates can theoretically lead to large housing booms. If the interest
rate is exogenous and risk premia are negligible, decreasing the interest rate parameter can
lead to a large housing boom because doing so does not elicit an o¤setting adjustment of the
housing risk premium as explained above. In the general equilibrium model here, we cannot
hold the housing risk premium …xed when interest rates change due to some exogenous
impetus (such as an in‡ux of foreign capital). Of course, the question of whether falling
interest rates cause housing booms is ultimately an empirical one. Econometric evidence
from the U.S. and other developed nations …nds that declining real interest rates do not
   2
       Although KMN and SSV do not emphasize the implications of their models for the wealth distribution, it
is well known that Bewley-style economies they study (as well as almost all macro models) do not generate an
empirically plausible degree of inequality unless some additional mechanism such as preference heterogeneity
is adopted (Krusell and Smith (1999); Iacoviello (2005)). The same is true in our model without bequest
heterogeneity.


                                                       8
provide a plausible explanation for the housing boom that occurred at the dawn of the 21st
century (Favilukis, Kohn, Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2013), Glaeser, Gottlieb, and
Gyourko (2013)). The model here, which generates the boom from a decline in risk premia
rather than interest rates, provides a theoretical rationale for these …ndings.
   The second and third di¤erences are of paramount importance for the question of whether
economy-wide changes in …nancing constraints (such as the minimum amount of collateral
required to take out a mortgage) have large or small e¤ects on house prices. We …nd that
both aggregate business cycle risk and a realistic wealth distribution are important here.
When we shut o¤ business cycle risk in our model, we …nd a smaller increase in the P/MU
ratio in response to a decline in collateral requirements as compared to the benchmark case
that includes such risk. When we shut o¤ bequest heterogeneity so that the model has only
a single type of agent (where nobody leaves bequests), we …nd that a reduction in collateral
requirements leads to a relatively small increase in house prices and the P/MU ratio. An
economy-wide decrease in collateral requirements can be an important source of aggregate
risk only if constrained households account for a su¢ ciently large component of aggregate
housing demand. In the speci…cation without bequest heterogeneity, constrained households
are simply too small a fraction for this to occur. This is the same reason KMN and SSV
give for their …ndings on this question. Note that a version of our model without preference
heterogeneity could have a large number of constrained households if the subjective time-
discount factor were calibrated so that everyone were su¢ ciently impatient. But with such
impatient households, this model would imply a value for the endogenous mean real interest
rate that is much too high to match the data.
   It is important to emphasize that our paper does not address the question of why credit
market conditions changed so markedly in recent decades (we discuss this in the conclusion).
It is widely understood that the …nancial market liberalization we study was preceded by
a number of revolutionary changes in housing …nance, notably by the rise in securitization.
These changes initially decreased the risk of individual home mortgages and home equity
loans, allowing for a more e¢ cient allocation of risk and, some have argued, making it opti-
mal for lending contracts to feature lower collateral requirements and housing transactions
fees (e.g. Green and Wachter (2008); Piskorski and Tchistyi (2011); Strongin, O’Neill, Him-
melberg, Hindian, and Lawson (2009)). As these researchers note, however, these initially
risk-reducing changes in housing …nance were accompanied by government deregulation of
…nancial institutions that ultimately increased risk, by permitting such institutions to al-
ter the composition of their assets towards more high-risk securities, by permitting higher


                                              9
leverage ratios, and by presiding over the spread of complex …nancial holding companies
that replaced the long-standing separation between investment bank, commercial bank and
insurance company. Industry analysis suggests that the market’s subsequent revised ex-
pectation upward of the riskiness of the underlying mortgage assets since 2007 has led to
a reversal in collateral requirements and transactions fees. It is precisely these changes in
credit conditions that are the focus of this study.


3         Changes in Housing Finance
A detailed documentation of changes in the key aspects of housing …nance we study, collateral
constraints and foreign capital in U.S. debt markets, is given in the Appendix. Here we
summarize this evidence as follows. There was a widespread relaxation of underwriting
standards in the U.S. mortgage market during the period leading up to the credit crisis of
2007. By the end of 2006, households routinely bought homes with 100% …nancing using a
piggyback second mortgage or home equity loan. In the aftermath of the credit crisis that
began in 2007, the erosion in credit standards has been reversed.3 Industry analysts indicate
that maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios for combined (…rst and second) mortgages have,
since 2006, returned to previously normal levels of no greater than 75-80% of the appraised
value of the home. There was also a signi…cant decline in transactions costs for buying
homes and for home equity extraction: pecuniary costs (such as mortgage and home equity
closing costs) fell by up to 90%, but non-pecuniary costs also declined. In the aftermath of
the credit crisis, these costs have increased. In the appendix to this paper we report results
where we include a decline in borrowing costs in the …nancial market liberalization. These
results are mentioned in the Robustness Section below. Favilukis, Kohn, Ludvigson, and
Van Nieuwerburgh (2013) provide an extensive discussion of the evidence for these changes.
        The period was also characterized by a secular decline in real interest rates that coincided
with a surge in foreign ownership of U.S. Treasury and Agency securities. The real annual
interest rate on the 10-year Treasury bond fell from 3.87% at the start of 2000 to 2.04%
by the end of 2006, while the 10-year Treasury In‡ation Protected (TIPS) rate fell from
4.32% to 2.25% over this period. Real rates fell further to all time lows during the housing
bust. The real 10-year Treasury bond rate declined from 2.04% to -0.04% from the end
of 2006 to end of 2012, while the TIPS rate declined from 2.25% to -0.76%. At the same
    3
        Some analysts have argued that, since the credit crisis, borrowing restrictions and credit constraints
have become even more stringent than historical norms in the pre-boom period (e.g., Streitfeld (2009)).

time, foreign ownership of U.S. Treasuries (T-bonds and T-notes) increased from 13.5% of
marketable Treasuries outstanding in 1984 to 61% of marketable Treasuries by 2008. By
June 2012, foreign holdings represented 52.5% of marketable Treasuries, driven by a large
increase in foreign purchases between 2008 and 2012 and an even larger increase in the supply
of marketable Treasuries. But foreign holdings of long-term and short-term U.S. Treasury
and Agency debt as a fraction of GDP continued to increase in the 2008 to 2012 period,
from 31% to 40.6% of GDP by 2012. By pushing real interest rates lower, the rise in foreign
capital has been directly linked to the surge in mortgage originations over this period (e.g.,
Strongin, O’Neill, Himmelberg, Hindian, and Lawson (2009)). Economic policymakers, such
as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, have also emphasized the role of foreign capital
in driving interest rates lower and in fueling house price in‡ation.4
       It is important to emphasize that, while foreign ownership of U.S. Treasuries surged from
2000-2007, there was no corresponding increase in Treasury supply over this period. The
fraction of marketable Treasuries relative to GDP was stable between 1999 and 2007 at
around 30%.
       We consider one speci…cation of the model in which we introduce foreign demand for
domestic bonds into the market clearing condition, referred to hereafter as foreign capital.
This foreign capital is modeled as owned by governmental holders who place all of their funds
in domestic riskless bonds. We do this for two reasons. First, by the end of 2008, Foreign
O¢ cial Institutions (FOI) held 70% of all foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries. Moreover, as
explained in Kohn (2002), government entities have speci…c regulatory and reserve currency
motives for holding U.S. Treasuries and face both legal and political restrictions on the
type of assets that can be held, forcing them into safe securities. As of June 2010, the
bond market portfolio composition of FOI consists of U.S. Treasuries (78%) and Agency
mortgage backed securities (MBS) and U.S. Agency debt (19.5%). They hold only a tiny
position in risky corporate debt of any kind (2.5%). Second, Krishnamurthy and Vissing-
Jorgensen (2007) show that demand for U.S. Treasury securities by governmental holders is
completely inelastic, implying that when these holders receive funds to invest they buy safe
U.S. securities such as Treasuries or Agencies, regardless of their price relative to other U.S.
assets. Foreign governmental holders have very deep pockets and will pay whatever price
necessary to push non-governmental holders out of the safe U.S. bond market when their

ation of Economics, Richmond, Virginia, March 10, 2005, and by Chairman Bernanke, at the International
Monetary Conference, Barcelona, Spain (via satellite), June 3, 2008.

demand is not met with an equal increase in supply. U.S. Agency MBS and U.S. Agency debt
are pools of conforming mortgages, guaranteed by the Government Sponsored Enterprises
(GSEs), and the corporate bonds the GSEs issue to …nance their portfolio investment (mostly
in Agency MBS), respectively. The safe mortgages our model features–we abstract from
default risk–resemble well the Agency MBS in the real world, in practice treated as equivalent
to Treasuries. The equivalence of Treasury and Agency securities was made formal by the
Conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in September 2008.


4       The Model

4.1        Firms
The production side of the economy consists of two sectors. One sector produces the non-
housing consumption good, and the other sector produces the housing good. We refer to the
…rst as the “consumption sector” and the second as the “housing sector.” Time is discrete
and each period corresponds to a year. In each period, a representative …rm in each sector
chooses labor (which it rents) and investment in capital (which it owns) to maximize the
value of the …rm to its owners.

4.1.1      Consumption Sector

Denote output in the consumption sector as
                                      YC;t    KC;t (ZC;t NC;t )1                           (1)
where ZC;t is the stochastic productivity level at time t, KC is the capital stock in the
consumption sector,        is the share of capital, and NC is the quantity of labor input in
the consumption sector. Let IC denote investment in the consumption sector. The …rm’s
capital stock KC;t accumulates over time subject to proportional, quadratic adjustment costs,

shareholders are equal to

where wt is the wage rate (equal across sectors in equilibrium). The …rm maximizes the
present discounted value VC;t of a stream of earnings:

where       t
                  is a stochastic discount factor discussed below. The evolution equation for the
…rm’s capital stock is
                                    KC;t+1 = (1          ) KC;t + IC;t ;

where   is the depreciation rate of the capital stock.
   The …rm does not issue new shares and …nances its capital stock entirely through retained
earnings.

4.1.2   Housing Sector

The housing …rm’s problem is analogous to the problem solved by the representative …rm in
the consumption sector, except that housing production utilizes an additional …xed factor of
production, Lt , representing a combination of land and government permits for residential
construction. This is important because Glaeser, Gyourko, and Saks (2005) argue that the
increasing value of land for residential development is tied to government-issued construction
permits, rather than to the acreage itself. Denote output in the residential housing sector as

                               YH;t = (ZH;t Lt )1          1

                                                               NH;t        ;                      (3)

YH;t represents construction of new housing (residential investment), 1                 is the share
of land/permits in housing production, and                is the share of capital in the construction
                1    1
component KH;t ZH;t NH;t         of housing production. Variables denoted with an “H”subscript
are de…ned exactly as above for the consumption sector, but now pertain to the housing
sector, e.g., ZH;t denotes the stochastic productivity level in the housing sector.
   Following Davis and Heathcote (2005), we assume that a constant quantity L of new
land/permits suitable for residential development is available each period. Under this speci-
…cation it is the ‡ow of land/permits that is presumed to be a …xed, constant amount each
period, not the stock of these. We assume that this constant supply L of land/permits is
made available for residential construction by the government who rents the land/permits
to home developers at the competitive rental rate equal to the marginal product of Lt .
The proceeds from land rentals are used by the government to …nance (wasteful) govern-
ment spending Gt . When a house is sold, the government issues a transferable lease for
the land/permits in perpetuity at no charge to the homeowner. The assumption is that the
buyer of the home is the e¤ective owner, even though (by eminent domain) the government
retains the legal right to the land/permits.

where pH
       t is the relative price of one unit of housing in units of the non-housing consumption
good and pLt is the price of land/permits. Note that pH
                                                      t is the time t price of a unit of housing
of …xed quality and quantity.
       The housing …rm maximizes

Capital in the housing sector evolves:

                                      KH;t+1 = (1           ) KH;t + IH;t :

Note that YH;t represents residential construction; thus the law of motion for the aggregate
residential housing stock Ht is

                                       Ht+1 = (1        H ) Ht    + YH;t ;

where      H   denotes the depreciation rate of the housing stock.
       The shocks ZC;t and ZH;t are sources of aggregate risk in the economy. The presence
of aggregate risk is crucial for generating risk premia in housing and equity markets. ZC;t
and ZH;t are calibrated to follow two-state Markov chain, as described in the Appendix. In
addition, with ZC;t labor augmenting, and ZH;t labor and land augmenting, as written in (1)
and (3), we may allow for balanced (deterministic) growth in each productivity level in an
economy where land/permits L and labor supply N are non-growing. Under this assumption,
the price of land grows deterministically at the same rate as technology and the rest of the
aggregate economy.5


4.2        Risky Asset Returns
The …rms’values VH;t and VC;t are the cum dividend values, measured before the dividend
is paid out. The cum dividend returns to shareholders in the housing sector and the con-
sumption sector are de…ned, respectively, as
                                 VH;t+1                                        VC;t+1
                   RYH ;t+1 =                               RYC ;t+1 =                   :
                              (VH;t DH;t )                                  (VC;t DC;t )
   5
       This assumption is essentially the same as the one made in Davis and Heathcote (2005), where land in
their model was presumed to grow at the same rate as the population. Our model has no population growth,
so the analogous assumption is that land is not growing.

4.3          Individuals
The economy is populated by A overlapping generations of individuals, indexed by a =
1; :::; A; with a continuum of individuals born each period. There are two types of individuals:
A small minority are bequesters (those who have a bequest motive in their value functions),
while the others are non-bequesters (those who do not have a bequest motive). Each will be
described below. Whether one is a bequester or not, individuals live through two stages of
life, a working stage and a retirement stage. Adult age begins at age 21, so a equals this
e¤ective age minus 20. Agents live for a maximum of A = 80 (100 years). Workers live from
age 21 (a = 1) to 65 (a = 45) and then retire. Retired workers die with an age-dependent
probability calibrated from life expectancy data. The probability that an agent is alive at
age a + 1 conditional on being alive at age a is denoted                   a+1ja .   Upon death, any remaining
net worth of an individual is transferred to a newborn who replaces her. Non-bequesters
leave only accidental bequests, while bequesters leave deliberate bequests. (In practice,
accidental bequests are unintentional and will therefore be quite small.) We assume that
newborns who receive a deliberate bequest are themselves born with a bequest motive, while
those who receive only accidental bequests have no bequest motive. Thus bequesters form
dynasties and the fraction of each type in the economy remains constant over time.7
         Both bequesters and non-bequester individuals have an intraperiod utility function given
by
                                                        1

consumption in utility. Implicit in this speci…cation is the assumption that the service ‡ow
from houses is proportional to the stock Ha;t . The only distinction between bequesters and
non-bequesters is that the former receive additional utility from their net worth holdings at
the time of death. This additional utility appears in the value function.

life.

Recalling that       a+1ja   is the probability of being alive next year given an individual is alive
this year, equation (6) says that bequesters receive additional utility as a function of their
net worth in the year that they die. The parameter                                governs the strength of the bequest
motive.

and a variable component proportional to the value of the house. These costs encompass
any expense associated with changing housing consumption regardless of how it is …nanced,
e.g., they include moving costs (both pecuniary and non-pecuniary).
   An additional component of the transactions cost in illiquid housing is the cost directly
associated with housing …nance, speci…cally the borrowing costs incurred for loans backed
by housing collateral. We use direct evidence to calibrate a transactions cost per dollar

FB is a cost that implies borrowers pay a higher interest rate than lenders receive. FH;t
is the housing transactions cost which contains both a …xed and variable component and
                             i
depends on age only through Ha;t . Equation (9) says that the amount spent on non-housing
consumption, on housing maintenance, and on bond and equity purchases must be less than
or equal to the sum of the individual’s gross …nancial wealth and after-tax labor income, less
the cost of purchasing any additional housing, less all asset market transactions costs.
      An additional important constraint in the model is

                                   i
                                  Ba+1;t+1           (1    $) pH  i

Equation (10) is the collateral constraint, where 0                        $   1. It says that households may
borrow no more than a fraction (1                $) of the value of housing, implying that they must post
collateral equal to a fraction $ of the value of the house. This constraint can be thought of
as a down-payment constraint for new home purchases, but it also applies to any borrowing
against home equity, not just to …rst lien mortgages. It should be emphasized that 1 $ gives
the maximum combined (…rst and additional mortgages) LTV ratio. This will di¤er from the
average LTV ratio because not everyone borrows up to the credit limit. Notice that if the
price pH
       t of the house rises and nothing else changes, the individual can …nance a greater level
of consumption of both housing and nonhousing goods and services. Borrowing takes place
using one-period debt. Thus, an individual’s borrowing capacity ‡uctuates period-by-period
with the value of the house.

4.4     Stochastic Discount Factor
                                                  t+1
The stochastic discount factor (SDF),             t
                                                        , appears in the dynamic value maximization
problem (2) and (4) undertaken by each representative …rm. As a consequence of our in-
                                                                                     t+1
complete markets setting, a question arises about how to model                       t
                                                                                           . The intertemporal
marginal rates of substitution (MRS) of any shareholder in this setting is a valid stochastic
discount factor. Much of the existing literature has avoided this ambiguity by assuming that
…rms rent capital from households on a period-by-period basis, thereby solving a series of
static optimization problems. Since the problem is static, the question of discounting is then
mute. In this static case, however, one needs to impose some other form of exogenous shock,
for example stochastic depreciation in the rented capital stocks (e.g., Storesletten, Telmer,
and Yaron (2007), Gomes and Michaelides (2008)), in order to generate non-trivial volatility
of the equity return. Here we instead keep depreciation deterministic and model dynamic
…rms that own capital and face adjustment costs when changing their capital stocks, re-
quiring us to take a stand on the SDF. We do this for several reasons. First, in our own
experimentation we found that the amount of stochastic depreciation required to achieve
reasonable levels of stock market volatility produced excessive volatility in investment. Sec-
ond, it is di¢ cult to know what amount of stochastic depreciation, if any, is reasonable.
Third, an economy populated entirely of static …rms is unrealistic. In the real world, …rms
own their own capital stocks and must think dynamically about shareholder value.

For non-bequesters, the marginal rate of substitution is simply the MRS in non-housing

Recalling that the total number of shares in the risky portfolio is normalized to unity, we
therefore model the stochastic discount factor as
                                 Z                         i
                          t+1        i
                                             @Va+1 ( ) =@Wa+1;t+1
                                     a+1;t+1             i
                                                                  d ;                                           (11)

                 i
        @Va+1 =@Wa+1;t+1
where            i
           @U=@Ca;t
                           takes the appropriate value for each individual, as described above.
Since we weight each individual’s MRS by its proportional ownership (and since short-sales
in the risky asset are prohibited), only those households who have taken a positive position
in the risky asset (shareholders) will receive non-zero weight in the SDF.
   Although this speci…cation leads to an equilibrium that depends on the control of the
…rm being …xed according to the proportional ownership structure described above, it is not
necessarily quantitatively sensitive to this assumption on ownership control. For example,
Carceles Poveda and Coen-Pirani (2009) show that, given the …rm’s objective of value maxi-
mization, the equilibrium allocations in their incomplete markets models are invariant to the
choice of stochastic discount factor within the set that includes the MRS of any household

                                                 20
(or any weighted average of these) for whom the Euler equation for the risky asset return is
satis…ed. They show in addition that the equilibrium allocations of such economies are the
same as the allocations obtained in otherwise identical economies with “static” …rms that
rent capital from households on a period-by-period basis. They also prove this for a case
with adjustment costs. Our calibration of adjustment costs implies that they quantitatively
small, amounting to less than one percent of investment per year.We have checked that our
results are not a¤ected by the following variants of the SDF above: (i) equally weighting the
MRS of shareholders (gives proportionally more weight to small stakeholders), (ii) weighting
                                                                               i       2
the MRS of shareholders by the squares of their ownership stakes,              a+1;t+1 ,   (gives pro-
portionally more weight to big stakeholders), (iii) using the MRS of the largest shareholder.
This completes the description of the model economy. We now turn to the de…nition of
housing and equity returns.

   It is tempting to use (12) to conclude that the e¤ects of …nancing constraints on house
prices can be cleanly separated from the e¤ects of risk-sharing and risk premia. A common
assumption is that …nancing constraints operate through the second term on the right-hand-
side, while risk premia operate through the …rst term. In the general equilibrium of the
model, however, there is no such economic separation. Indeed, the two terms on the right-
hand-side of (12) will in general be correlated because independent movements in …nancing
constraints not only a¤ect the maximum loan-to-value ratio, they also alter a household’s
ability to insure against risks, which changes the …rst term by altering the covariance of
housing returns with the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution UCa+1;t+1
                                                                       i          i . Con-

versely, business cycle shocks directly in‡uence the …rst term but also a¤ect the tightness
of constraints via the endogenous response of collateral values to such shocks. Thus the

                                                 21
housing risk premium is not an exogenous variable that changes independently of …nanc-
ing constraints. It is an equilibrium quantity that responds to both business cycle shocks
and the tightness of …nancing constraints, as these two driving forces alter the landscape
for risk-sharing and insurance. This can be seen in the results below by observing that
economies with lower collateral requirements but the same level of business cycle risk exhibit
less volatile consumption, more risk sharing, less precautionary saving, and lower housing
and equity risk premia.

The valuation ratio pH
                     t+1 =MU t+1 is the national “house price-marginal utility”ratio, denoted
P/MU for short. Since the model parameters satisfy a transversality condition that would
e¤ectively rule out a bubble in this non-traded asset, a standard …rst order approximation
(Campbell and Shiller (1989)) implies that the ln pH
                                                   t+1 =MU t+1 ratio can ‡uctuate only
through one of three channels: (i) positively with increases in expected future MU growth, (ii)
negatively with increases in expected future interest rates, or (iii) negatively with increases
in the expected future housing return in excess of the interest rate, an endogenous quantity
we refer to as the national housing risk premium:

where Et is the expectation operator conditional on time t information, k is a linearization
constant, and lower case letters refer to log variables, i.e., rH                        ln (RH ). This implication
follows only from the de…nition of returns and the imposition of a transversality condition
that rules out bubbles. In the model explored here, 100% of the variability in ln pH

ln MU t+1 on the left hand side is explained (to very close approximation) by variability in
the three terms in square brackets on the right hand side, thus any movement in the P/MU
ratio must be attributable one of the above channels. Note that the log housing risk premium

Et (rH;t+1+j         rf;t+1+j ) will be highly correlated with the housing risk premium for gross
returns, Et [RH         Rf ] ; and the implications for the unconditional risk premium in stochastic
steady states will be very similar regardless of whether we look at E (rH;t+1+j                   rf;t+1+j ) or
E [RH        Rf ].
       For the results reported below, we compare our model implications for pH
                                                                              t+1 =MU t+1 with
three di¤erent empirical measures of aggregate house price valuation ratios. These are based
on three di¤erent measures of national house prices for single family residences, one from
the Flow of Funds that measures aggregate housing wealth, FoF, one based on the Freddie
Mac Conventional Mortgage House Price index, Freddie Mac, and one based on the Core
Logic house price index, CL. Each of these are then combined with a an aggregate housing
service ‡ow expenditure estimate to compute a measure of national home prices relative to
housing fundamentals. The Appendix details our construction of these variables from data.
A complicating factor is that the measures of the housing service ‡ow are aggregates of
both rent for renters and imputed rent for owner-occupiers, whereas our model only applies
to the latter. But census data show that two-thirds of housing is owner-occupied, so that
most of what is in these measures is an imputed service ‡ow for owner-occupiers. Moreover,
the correlation between “rent of primary residence”for renters and owners equivalent rent is
extremely high (94% between 2000 and 2012), so whether we compute these ratios for renters
or for owners we get the same facts in terms of run-up, volatility, and comovements. We
refer to these measures of the aggregate housing service ‡ow in the data simply as “rent,”
denoted Rt , and use it to construct empirical observations on a national house “price-rent”
ratio pH
       t+1 =Rt+1 . It should be kept in mind, however, that Rt in the data is not actually a
measure of aggregate rent, but rather an estimate of the housing service ‡ow for both renters
and homeowners combined.
       We do not attempt to match our model to the levels of the price-rent ratios, which are
unidenti…ed from the data, instead focusing on the changes in these ratios over time.10
       In addition to these statistics based on national house price and housing service ‡ow
aggregates, in our model we compute housing return statistics at the individual level. These
  10
       For Freddie Mac and CL, the price-rent ratio cannot be inferred at all, since both price in the numerator
and rent in the denominator are given by indexes. For FoF, we observe the stock of housing wealth and
the ‡ow of housing services from NIPA, both in dollar units. But it is notoriously di¢ cult to impute rents
for owner-occupiers from the rental data of non-homeowners, a potentially serious problem since owners
represent two-thirds of the population. Because owners are on average wealthier than non-homeowners, the
NIPA imputed rent measure for owner-occupiers is likely to be biased down, implying that the level of the
price-rent ratio is likely to be biased up.

      Flavin and Yamashita (2002) report summary statistics from individual housing returns
from the Survey of Consumer Finance for the period from 1968-1992. More recently, Land-
voigt, Piazzesi, and Schneider (2013) obtain high quality housing transaction data at the
individual level and measure capital gains in individual returns. We can compare the model
implications for EN [RH ] and StdN [RH ] with their …ndings. We do so below in the Results
subsection.
      Returning to the model, the risky capital return RK;t in (7) is the return on a value-
weighted portfolio of assets. This is not the same as the return on equity, which is a levered
claim on the assets. To obtain an equity return, RE;t , the return on assets, RK;t , must be
adjusted for leverage:
                                RE;t      Rf ;t + (1 + B=E) (RK;t       Rf;t ) ;

where B=E is the …xed debt-equity ratio and where RK;t is the portfolio return for risky
capital given in (7).11 Note that this calculation explicitly assumes that corporate debt in

…nancing decision.) For the results reported below, we set B=E = 2=3 to match aggregate
debt-equity ratios computed in Benninga and Protopapadakis (1990). As above we de…ne

Also, the aggregate resource constraint for the economy must take into account the hous-

spending, which reduce consumption, the adjustment costs in productive capital, which re-

domestic consumption and investment. Thus, non-housing output equals non-housing con-
sumption (inclusive of costs Ft ) plus government spending plus aggregate investment (gross

sional. To solve the model, it is necessary to approximate the in…nite dimensional object
  with a …nite dimensional object. The appendix explains the solution procedure and how
we specify a …nite dimensional vector to represent the law of motion for : We also present
the results of various numerical checks, designed to quantify the degree of departure along
speci…c dimensions from the fully rational equilibrium.


4.7    Model Calibration
The model’s parameters and their numerical calibration are reported in Table 1. A detailed
explanation of this calibration is given in the Appendix. The calibration corresponds to four
alternative parameterizations.
   Model 1 is our benchmark calibration, with “normal”collateral requirements and housing
transactions costs calibrated to roughly match the data prior to the housing boom of 2000-
2006. Model 1 has $ = 0:25 and borrowing costs         set to match direct estimates of the
percentage of amount borrowed lending costs in the year 2000, equal to        = 5:5% of the
amount borrowed. A detailed justi…cation of this value is given in the Appendix section on
Changes in Housing Finance.
   Model 2 is identical to Model 1 except that it has undergone a …nancial market liberal-
ization with lower collateral requirements. The Appendix also provides a detailed discussion
of the evidence for changes in collateral requirements. Based on this evidence, the down-
payment declines from $ = 25% in Model 1, to $ = 1% in Model 2. Comparisons between
Model 1 and Model 2 therefore isolate the e¤ects of changing collateral constraints on the
housing market.
   In both Model 1 and Model 2, trade in the risk-free asset is entirely conducted between
domestic residents: BtF = 0. The Model 3 calibration is identical to that of Model 2 except
that we add an exogenous foreign demand for the risk-free bond: BtF > 0 equal to 18%
of average total output, Y , an amount that is approximately equal to the rise in foreign
ownership of U.S. Treasuries and agency debt over the period 2000-2008.
   Finally, we consider a Model 4 calibration, studied below in a simulated transition, uses
the collateral requirements and transactions costs of Model 1 ($ = 25% and      = 5:5%) but
keeps the foreign ‡ows   BtF   > 0 as in Model 3.
   The share of land/permits in the housing production function is set to 10%, to match
evidence used in Davis and Heathcote (2005), requiring     = 0:9. The technology shocks ZC


                                               27
and ZH are assumed to follow two-state independent Markov chains. Their calibration, as
well as that of the idiosyncratic productivity shocks, is described in the Appendix.


5       Results
This section presents some of the model’s main implications. Much of our analysis consists
of a comparison of stochastic steady states across Models, 1, 2 and 3, where we compare
the average equilibrium allocations over a very long simulated sample path. We then study
a dynamic transition path for house prices and the P/MU ratio, where the shocks in this
transition are designed to mimic the state of the economy and housing market conditions
over the period 2000-2012. We start by presenting a set of benchmark business cycle and
life-cycle statistics and then turn to the house price implications of changing housing …nance.


5.1       Benchmark Results
5.1.1     Business Cycle Variables

Table 2 presents benchmark results for Hodrick-Prescott (Hodrick and Prescott (1997), HP)
detrended aggregate quantities. Panel A of Table 2 presents business cycle moments from
U.S. annual data over the period 1953 to 2012. Panels B through D of Table 2 presents
simulated data to summarize the implications for these same moments for the Models 1, 2
and 3. We report statistics for total output, or GDP       YC + pH YH + CH , for non-housing
consumption (inclusive of expenditures on …nancial services), equal to C + F , for housing
consumption CH;t , de…ned as price per unit of housing services times quantity of housing
or CH;t     Rt Ht , for total (housing and non-housing) consumption CT = C + F + CH , for
non-housing investment (inclusive of adjustment costs) I, for residential investment pH
                                                                                      t YH;t
and for total investment IT = I +pH YH . The recorded statistics are similar across all models,
so we mainly discuss them with reference to Model 1.
    Table 2 shows that, in both the model and the data, consumption is less volatile than
GDP. The standard deviation of total aggregate consumption divided by the standard de-
viation of GDP is 0.76 in Model 1, comparable to the 0.63 value found in the data. The
level of GDP volatility in the model is very close to that in the data. Total investment
is more volatile than output, both in the model and in the data, but the model produces
too little relative volatility: the ratio of the standard deviation of investment to that of
output is 1.64 in Model 1 but is 2.95 in the data. One simple way to increase investment


                                              28
volatility in the model is to reduce adjustment costs for changing capital. Unfortunately,
this drives equity market volatility to an unrealistically low level. This trade-o¤ is a com-
mon problem in production-based asset pricing models (e.g., see Jermann (1998); Boldrin,
Christiano, and Fisher (2001)). Alternatives that could potentially circumvent this tradeo¤
are to increase volatility of investment by adding stochastic depreciation in capital as in
Storesletten, Telmer, and Yaron (2007) and Gomes and Michaelides (2008), or by adding
investment speci…c technology shocks. On the other hand, the model does a good job of
matching the relative volatility of residential investment to output: in the data the ratio of
these volatilities is 4.65, while it is 4.63 in Model 1. Finally, both in the model and the
data, residential investment is less correlated with output than is consumption and total
investment.

5.1.2      Correlations of House and Stock Prices with Real Activity

Table 3 presents correlations of house and stock prices with real activity. The housing price
index is procyclical, both in the data and in the model. Table 3 shows that the correlation
between HP-detrended GDP and HP-detrended house prices range from 0.42 to 0.52 in the
data depending on the sample and data source; it is 0.93 in our various models. In the data,
the correlation between GDP and the price-rent ratio ranges from 0.46 to 0.56, while in the
model the correlation between output and the P/MU ratio ranges from 0.50 to 0.75. And
the correlation between the national price-rent ratio and price-dividend ratio ranges from
0.23 to 0.48 in the data, while the model implies that the correlation between P/MU and
the price-dividend ratio ranges between 0.12 and 0.71.
   In Model 1, the full-sample correlation between P/MU and GDP is very close to the
empirical correlation between the price-rent ratio and GDP. But note that the model does not
imply that equity and house prices are highly correlated. If anything, the model understates
the correlation between the the price-rent (P/MU in the model) ratio and the price-dividend
ratio on stocks. Models 2 and 3 imply higher correlations for both, but the recent boom-bust
in housing markets, stock markets, and output has increased those correlations in the data
as well.
   The correlation between residential investment and GDP in the model is quite high
(60-76%) and not far from the data (77-87%) (column 3 of Table 3). This is true despite
the fact that the correlation between the productivity shocks ZC;t and ZH;t shocks is zero,
and arises because house prices are strongly pro-cyclical. We could (slightly) increase the
correlation between the two productivity shocks to exactly match the correlation between

                                             29
residential investment and GDP, but this would (slightly) worsen the model’s implications
for the correlation between the price-dividend and price-rent (P/MU) ratio.
       In each of the three models, the one-period lagged value of residential investment and
GDP have a statistically signi…cant and positive correlation of 0.11, 0.12, and 0.18, respec-
tively. Davis and Heathcote (2005) have noted that real business cycle models with housing
have di¢ culty delivering a positive correlation between one-period lagged residential invest-
ment and GDP. The model here produces such a positive correlation, but the magnitude is
lower than that found in historical data (where this correlation is 0.57). Both in the data
and the model correlations with residential investment at greater lags are statistically zero.
       In separate results not reported in the Table, we note that the model also produces a
strong positive correlation between land price and total investment, equal to 55% in Model
1, 53% in Model 2 and 59% in Model 3, consistent with evidence in Liu, Wang, and Zha
(2011) that these variables are positively correlated.
       Many models with housing have di¢ culty matching the volatility of house prices relative
to that of GDP volatility. For example, Davis and Heathcote (2005) report that the ratio of
standard deviations of these HP …ltered quantities is 0.52 in their model, whereas it is well
above one in the data. We computed the standard deviation of our HP …ltered aggregate
house price relative to HP …ltered GDP. The ratio of these standard deviations is 1.77, 1.72,
and 2.11 in Models 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The corresponding numbers in the data from
1953-2012 are 2.32 using the FoF measure of housing wealth. From 1975-2012 the ratio of
these standard deviations is 2.65 using the FoF index and 2.06 using the Freddie Mac index.
Thus the model generates a volatile house price index relative to the volatility of economic
fundamentals, consistent with the data.

5.1.3       Life Cycle Age-Income Pro…les

Turning to individual-level implications, Figure 2 presents the age and income distribution
of wealth, both in the model and in the historical data as given by the Survey of Consumer
Finance (SCF).13 The …gure shows wealth, by age, divided by average wealth across all
households, for three income groups (low, medium and high earners). In both the model
and the data, …nancial wealth is hump-shaped over the life-cycle, and is slightly negative
  13
       We average the data over ten waves of the SCF from 1983 to 2010. Since the model has no renters, we
compute all wealth statistics in the data for the subsample of homeowners. Homeowners are de…ned as those
with strictly positive housing wealth. Housing wealth is the sum of primary housing and other property.
Total wealth, or net worth, is the sum of housing wealth and net …nancial wealth.



                                                     30
or close to zero early in life when households borrow to …nance home purchases. As agents
age, wealth accumulates. In the data, …nancial (nonhousing) wealth peaks between 60 and
70 years old (depending on the income level). In the model, the peak for all three income
groups is 65 years. For most individuals who are not bequesters, …nancial wealth is drawn
down after retirement until death. Households in the model continue to hold some net worth
in the …nal years of life to insure against the possibility of living long into old age. A similar
observation holds in the data. For low and medium earners, the model gets the average
amount of wealth about right, but it somewhat under-predicts the wealth of high earners
early in the life-cycle.
   The right-hand panels in Figure 2 plot the age distribution of housing wealth. Up to age
65, the model produces about the right level of housing wealth for each income group, as
compared to the data. In the data, however, housing wealth peaks around age 60 for high
earners and age 67 for low and medium earners. By contrast, in the model housing wealth
remains high until death. In the absence of an explicit rental market, owning a home is the
only way to generate housing consumption, an argument in the utility function. For this
reason, agents in the model continue to maintain a high level of housing wealth later in life
even as they drawn down …nancial wealth.
   We now turn to results that focus on how key variables in the model are in‡uenced by a
…nancial market liberalization and foreign capital in‡ux.


5.2    Portfolio Shares
What is the e¤ect of a …nancial market liberalization and foreign capital in‡ux on the optimal
portfolio decisions of individuals? Table 4 exhibits the age and income distribution of housing
wealth relative to total net worth, both over time in the SCF data and in Models, 1, 2 and 3.
The data …gures are restricted to households who are homeowners. The benchmark model
captures an empirical stylized fact emphasized by Fernández-Villaverde and Krueger (2005),
namely that young households hold most of their wealth in consumer durables (primarily
housing) and very little in …nancial assets. Houses are 75% of the value of net worth in the
data in 2001 for young individuals (35 years an under); the analogous …gures in Model 1 is
63%. The model somewhat overstates the housing wealth share of the “old”(individuals 35
year or older), and therefore of all agents.
   Double sorting on age and net worth, the data imply that young poor individuals and
young medium-wealth individuals hold a much larger fraction of their wealth as housing,


                                               31
something the model replicates well. For example, the young medium-wealth households
in the data have housing wealth that is between 1.3 and 2.3 times net worth in data from
2001-2010. In the model, young medium-wealth households have housing wealth that is
between 2.0 and 2.6 across the various models. By contrast, young rich households have a
much smaller ratio of housing wealth to net worth, both in the model and in the data.
   By comparing the stochastic steady states of Model 1 and Model 3, we see that the
model also predicts that a …nancial market liberalization plus an in‡ow of foreign capital
leads households of all ages and income groups to shift the composition of their wealth
towards housing. A corresponding increase occurs in the data from 2001-2010 for all these
groups. This occurs in the model because the combination of lower interest rates and lower
collateral constraints in Model 3 makes possible greater housing investment by the young,
whose incomes are growing and who rely on borrowing to expand their housing consumption.
Table 4, Panel B, shows that the housing wealth-total wealth ratio rises by 13% for the young
between Model 1 and Model 3, and by 27% for the young-middle-wealth individuals. The
rich and old-rich agents in the model see virtually no increase in their housing wealth share.
In the data, the increase is much smaller for these rich agents, but still larger than in the
model. In the Appendix, we report results from a model where housing borrowing costs
also fall in a …nancial market liberalization. Consistent with Stokey (2009), such a decline
makes housing relatively less risky as compared to equity, which causes even unconstrained
individuals (primarily older, higher income individuals) to shift the composition of their
wealth towards housing.


5.3     Asset Pricing
5.3.1   Return Moments

Table 5 presents asset pricing implications of the model, for the calibrations represented
by Models 1, 2 and 3. The statistics reported are averages over 1000 periods. Analogous
empirical statistics computed from historical data for short-term real interest and equity
returns are also presented. We also report the percent change in three di¤erent measures of
the empirical price-rent ratio between 2000-2006 and compare it to the percent change in our
P/MU ratio in Model 2 and Model 3 relative to the baseline Model 1. We could also use these
empirical price-rent ratios to construct di¤erent estimates of a national housing price index
return, but the results are sensitive to data used and the time frame over which the data
are measured so statistics on these measures are omitted. We …rst discuss the implications


                                             32
of the benchmark Model 1 and then move on to discuss how the statistics change with a
…nancial market liberalization and in‡ow of foreign money.
   The benchmark model roughly matches the mean of the risk-free rate, which usually is
a challenge in production-based asset pricing models. The model also produces a sizable
equity return of 4.5% per annum and thus an equity risk premium of 2.8%. These values are
lower than the 8.3% per annum and 6.9% per annum equity premium, but the model pro-
duces an annual Sharpe ratio (de…ned here as the mean excess return divided by its standard
deviation) of 0.37 compared to 0.38 in the data. The model’s substantial Sharpe ratio arises
because house prices and therefore collateral values are procyclical, making borrowing con-
straints countercyclical. This implies that insurance/risk-sharing opportunities are reduced
when households need them most–in recessions–resulting in a substantial risk premium and
Sharpe ratio. A limitation of the model is that equity returns are not volatile enough (by
about half). This could be addressed by increasing adjustment costs in investment, but at
the cost of lower investment volatility, which is already too low. Further modi…cations of the
model such as adding stochastic capital depreciation or an additional aggregate investment
speci…c shock might help address this limitation.
   Turning to the implications for housing assets, the average house price index return in
Model 1 is 11.44% per annum and the unconditional housing risk premium in Model 1 is
9.7% per annum. If we look instead at the individual housing return statistics, we see
that, in Model 1 the average (across households) individual housing return EN [RH ] is 9.33%
                              ex
and housing risk premium EN [RH  ] is 7.63%, while the average standard deviation of the
individual housing return is StdN [RH ] = 9:30. The latter is lower still in Model’s 2 and
3, equal to 7.35 and 8.78 respectively. These values could be compared to estimates in the
data using individual housing returns. Flavin and Yamashita (2002) report an estimate of
EN [RH ] equal to 6.59 and an estimate of StdN [RH ] equal to 14.29. More recently, Landvoigt,
Piazzesi, and Schneider (2013) obtain high quality data from the housing markets of San
Diego, and report a range of values for StdN [RH ] from 8 to 13.8%. Thus the model overstates
the average mean returns and understates the volatility of individual housing returns. These
studies …nd an important role for idiosyncratic housing risk, which is absent from our model.
The Robustness section reports one attempt to address this with a speci…cation that adds
idiosyncratic depreciation risk.

   Financial Market Liberalization and the Housing Boom We now analyze how
these statistics in the model are a¤ected by a …nancial market liberalization. Table 5 shows


                                             33
that both the equity premium and the equity Sharpe ratio fall in an economy that has
undergone a …nancial market liberalization (moving from Model 1 to Model 2). The lower
collateral requirements of Model 2 reduce measures of risk in equity markets. These forces
lower the housing risk premium even more. The risk premium on the house price index
return falls from 9.74 in Model 1 to 7.41 in Model 2, while the average individual housing
risk premium falls from 7.63. to 5.51.
   Table 5 also reports the percentage di¤erence in the P/MU ratio between Models 2 or 3
relative to Model 1 (Panel B). In the model, the average national P/MU ratio pH
                                                                              t =MU t is
20.1% higher in Model 2 (relaxed constraints) than it is in the benchmark Model 1 (tighter
constraints). This di¤erence isolates the e¤ect of a …nancial market liberalization, since it
compares stochastic steady states only; thus all e¤ects from cyclical dynamics are averaged
out. (Below we study a dynamic transition that includes cyclical shocks.) By comparison,
observed price-rent ratios on housing indexes in the data rose by 31%, 32%, or 49% from 2000-
2006, depending on the measure. At the same time, Table 5 also shows that a …nancial market
liberalization leads to an increase in the equilibrium real interest rate. The endogenous risk-
free interest rate is 2.04% per annum Model 2, whereas it is 1.70% in Model 1. This occurs
because the relaxation of borrowing constraints reduces precautionary savings, as households
endogenously respond to the improved risk-sharing/insurance opportunities. And note that,
because we are comparing stochastic steady states, there is no di¤erence in expected MU
growth between Models 1, 2, or 3 in this Table. (They each equal the steady state growth
of technology.) This demonstrates that the housing boom caused by a …nancial market
liberalization is entirely attributable in the model to the decline in the housing risk premium,
which is large enough to more than o¤set the rise in equilibrium interest rates and drive the
P/MU ratio up.

   The Role of Foreign Capital in the Housing Boom Model 3 adds to Model 2
an in‡ow of foreign capital calibrated to match the increase in foreign ownership of U.S.
Treasuries and U.S. agency debt over the period 2000-2006. Table 5 shows that such an
increase has a large downward impact on the equilibrium interest rate, which falls from
2.04% in Model 2 to 1.60% in Model 3. The last column of Table 5 shows that the average
price-rent ratio is 20.5% higher in the stochastic steady state of Model 3 than in it is in the
benchmark Model 1. This increase is a half a percentage point higher than the increase from
Model 1 to Model 2, which omits the large capital in‡ow. Thus, the rise in the price-rent
ratio over the benchmark Model 1 comes not from the foreign-capital-driven lower interest


                                              34
rates, but rather from the …nancial market liberalization. The reason foreign ‡ows have such
a small in‡uence on the P/MU ratio has to do with the endogenous response of the housing
(and equity) risk premium to an increase in foreign demand for the safe asset. Foreign
purchases reduce the e¤ective supply of the safe asset to domestic households and make
investing in both equity and housing assets more risky. Domestic savers are crowded out of
the bond market by foreign governmental holders who are willing to hold the safe asset at
any price, forcing domestic residents as a whole to take a leveraged position in risky assets.
For this reason, both housing and equity risk premia rise from Model 2 to Model 3. The
housing risk premium rises from 7.41% to 7.98% and the equity risk premium rises from
2.58% to 3.50%.
   Thus the risk premium in Model 3 re‡ects two o¤setting forces. On the one hand, a …nan-
cial market liberalization improves insurance opportunities for many constrained households,
and this lowers risk premia. One the other, foreign purchases of the safe asset force domestic
savers to be more exposed to systematic risk in equity and housing markets, and this in-
creases risk premia. For housing, the …rst e¤ect is dominant and the housing risk premium
is still lower in Model 3 than in the baseline Model 1. Still, the rise from Model 2 to Model 3
means that the endogenous response of risk premia to foreign purchases of U.S. government
bonds substantially limits the extent to which foreign capital in‡ows into the bond market
can in‡uence home prices. These …ndings underscore the importance of general equilibrium
e¤ects on risk premia for understanding the scope for low interest rates to cause a housing
boom. In partial equilibrium models of the housing market (e.g., Titman (1982)), or in
small open-economy models without aggregate risk (e.g., KMN and SSV), the risk premium
is tiny or held exogenously …xed. As a consequence, a decline in the interest rate equal in
magnitude to that generated by the large in‡ux of foreign money considered here would be
su¢ cient–by itself–to explain most of the rise in price-rent ratios observed from 2000-2006.
In general equilibrium this is not possible because a foreign capital in‡ow has an endogenous
e¤ect on the housing risk premium, substantially o¤setting the e¤ect of lower interest rates
on home prices.


5.4    Transition Dynamics: Housing Boom to Bust
The steady state comparisons of the previous section show long-run changes only and do
not account for business cycle ‡uctuations. In this section we study a dynamic transition
path for house prices, land prices, and the P/MU ratio in response to a series of shocks


                                              35
designed to mimic both the state of the economy and housing market conditions over the
period 2000-2012, as follows. At time 0 (taken to be the year 2000), the economy begins in
the stochastic steady state of Model 1. In 2001, the economy undergoes an unanticipated
shift to Model 3 (…nancial market liberalization and foreign holdings of U.S. bonds equal to
18% of GDP), at which time the policy functions and beliefs of Model 3 are applied. Along
the transition path, foreign holdings of bonds are increased linearly from 0% to 18% of GDP
from 2000 to 2006 and held constant at 18% from 2006 to 2012. The adjustment to the new
stochastic steady state of Model 3 is then traced out over the seven year period from 2001
to 2006, as the state variables evolve. Starting in 2007 and continuing through 2012, the
economy is presumed to undergo a surprise reversal of the …nancial market liberalization but
not the foreign capital in‡ow, at which time it unexpectedly shifts to a new state in which
all the parameters of Model 1 again apply except those governing the foreign capital in‡ow,
which remains equal to 18% of GDP annually, as in Model 3. This hybrid of Models 1 and
3 is referred to as Model 4.
   In addition, we feed in a speci…c sequence of aggregate shocks designed to mimic the
business cycle over this period. The aggregate technology shock processes ZC and ZH follow
Markov chains, with two possible values for each shock, “low”and “high”(see the Appendix).
Denote these possibilities with the subscripts “l”and “h”:

                               ZC = fZCl ; ZCh g ; ZH = fZHl ; ZHh g :

As the general economy began to decline in 2000, construction relative to GDP in U.S. data
continued to expand, and did so in every quarter until the end of 2005. Thus, the recession
of 2001 was a nonhousing recession. Starting in 2006, construction relative to GDP fell
and has done so in every quarter through 2009. Thus, in contrast to the 2001 recession,
housing led the recession of 2007-2009. To capture these cyclical dynamics, we feed in the
following sequence of shocks for the period 2000-2009: fZCl ; ZHh gt=2000 ; fZCl ; ZHh gt=2001 ;
fZCh ; ZHh gt=2002 ; fZCh ; ZHh gt=2003 ; fZCh ; ZHh gt=2004 ; fZCh ; ZHh gt=2005 ; fZCh ; ZHl gt=2006 ;
fZCl ; ZHl gt=2007 , fZCl ; ZHl gt=2008 , fZCl ; ZHl gt=2009 . Although the transition is designed to
focus on the boom from 2000-2006 and recession-associated bust from 2007-2009, we extend
the graph out to 2012 by assuming that the economy remains in the low state in both sectors
in 2010 and transitions back to the high state in both sectors in 2011 and 2012. This appears
reasonable given that the end of the recession was in 2009 but the economy, and especially
the housing market, continued to be weak throughout 2010. Since 2011, the broader economy



                                                  36
and the housing markets have started to recover.14
       The top left panel of Figure 3 shows the transition dynamics of the P/MU ratio. In the
transition, the P/MU ratio rises by 27.5% over the period 2000-2006, boosted by economic
growth and lower …nancing constraints. There is a small initial dip in the …rst period so the
trough-to-peak increase along the transition path is larger from 2001-2006, equal to 32.1%.
Interest rates, while lower, contribute little to increase, as explained above. Comparing the
32% rise in the P/MU ratio over this transition with the 20.5% rise between the stochastic
steady states of M1 and M3, we see how the presence of business cycle risk ampli…es the re-
sponse of the P/MU ratio to shocks. We discuss this further below when we redo the analysis
shutting o¤ all business cycle risk. In the economic contraction over the period from 2007
to 2010, the model generates a decline of 17.8% in the P/MU ratio, driven by the negative
business cycle shocks and by a presumed reversal of the …nancial market liberalization.
       The top right panel of Figure 3 shows that house prices themselves (left scale) rise 20.0%
from 2000-2006, and 21.4% from 2001-2006. The increase in pH
                                                           t =MU t from 2000-2006 is
larger than the increase in pH
                             t because, in the model, MU t growth decrease modestly over
this period as the expected housing stock expands with the endogenous increase in residential
investment. In the economic contraction over the period from 2007 to 2010, the model
generates a decline of 14.9% in home prices pH                              L
                                             t . The price of land/permits pt , plotted against
the right axis, rises and falls over the transition with the price of housing. The expansion
not only drives a construction and housing boom; it also raises the price of this …xed factor
of housing production by 10.4% from 2000-2005. Land/permits prices subsequently fall
from 2006 to 2010 by 34.7%, as the economy contracts and collateral constraints revert to
previously higher levels.
       The bottom two panels of Figure 3 consider several alternative transitions that correspond
to special cases of the model and transition shocks where particular features are shut down.
The results for the special cases are based on a full resolving of the model where some
particular feature of our full model is shut down.

       We abstract from one aspect of the economic environment that changed after 2009, namely that there
was an increase in the supply of Treasury debt as a fraction of marketable Treasuries outstanding that
occurred as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. But while this lead outstanding
debt/GDP to rise from 2009-2012, so did foreign holdings. In fact, the latter rise by even more over this
period (the fraction of foreign holdings/GDP rises from 30% to 40%). The transition simply assumes a
constant ‡ow of foreign funds as a fraction of GDP after 2009, but we are slightly understating the e¤ect of
these ‡ows for those last three years. As explained above, these ‡ows have little impact on the transition
dynamics of home prices.



                                                    37
   First consider the bottom left panel. The line marked “No FML reversal, no ‡ows” is
a hypothetical transition in which there is a …nancial market liberalization (FML) starting
in 2001, but no foreign ‡ows into the safe bond market at any time and no reversal of the
FML in 2007 (credit constraints remain lax after 2007 as in Model 3). This can be compared
with our baseline transition, the line marked “FML reversal, ‡ows” (identical to the full
model transition reported in the top left panel). We can see that this case generates almost
all of the run-up in the price-rent ratio generated by the baseline transition, but captures
very little of the bust. This reinforces the point that, despite its depressing in‡uence on
interest rates, the vast in‡ux of foreign funds into safe assets has little e¤ect on home values
in the general equilibrium of the model. It also shows that a reversal of the …nancial market
liberalization is crucial for generating a housing bust: negative productivity shocks alone
are not enough. The line marked “No FML reversal, ‡ows” shows a transition without a
FML reversal but adds the constant capital ‡ows that are part of the benchmark transition.
This line is by de…nition identical to the baseline transition until 2007, then looks much like
the counterfactual without a FML reversal and without foreign ‡ows after 2007. As just
noted, this is to be expected because the ‡ows have little e¤ect on the P/MU ratio. The
line marked “Business cycle only”is a transition produced by assuming that the only source
of ‡uctuation in the economy are the changes in the productivity shocks described above
(all idiosyncratic shocks are set to zero and there are no changes in …nancing constraints or
foreign ‡ows). Under this scenario there is no FML, no reversal of the FML, and no foreign
‡ows (the economy stays in Model 1). It is clear that this line generates a much smaller boom
in the P/MU ratio, and a much smaller bust. This reinforces the conclusion that business
cycle variation alone–even in a model with incomplete markets and idiosyncratic risk–is not
enough to generate sizable ‡uctuations in the P/MU ratio. However, such shocks interact in
important ways with idiosyncratic risk and changes in …nancing constraints, which is evident
form the bottom right panel of Figure 3.
   In the bottom right panel we compare our baseline transition to one that would occur in
a model without aggregate productivity shocks, labeled “No business cycle.”·Speci…cally, we
resolve all of our models (1,2,3,4) but without aggregate business cycle risk (i.e., ZC = ZH =
1) and the simulate a transition. This economy still undergoes a FML in 2001, receives
foreign in‡ows from 2001 to 2012, and experiences a reversal of the FML in 2007. This
experiment is identical as in our benchmark model except that the aggregate productivity
shocks are turned o¤. The dotted line shows that this model experiences a boom and a
bust that are similar to but much smaller than in the baseline model. Even without business


                                              38
cycle shocks, the unanticipated change in …nancing constraints is itself an aggregate economic
shock that a¤ects risk premia the P/MU ratio. But the maximum trough-to-peak increase
in the price/MU ratio in this case is 22.2% compared to 32% in the baseline model with
business cycle risk. Moreover, over much of the transition, the increase in the P/MU ratio is
substantially lower in the model with out business cycle shocks than in the full model. This
shows that the presence of business cycle risk ampli…es the impact of changing …nancing
constraints on the housing market.
   The last line in the bottom right panel of Figure 3 is labeled “No business cycle, no
bequest.” It is identical to the economy with no productivity shocks except that there
is only one type of households rather than having bequesters and non-bequesters. These
households have no bequest motive and their rate of time preference is recalibrated to match
the average interest rate level to that in the baseline model. This model features only a small
8.5% increase in the price/MU ratio and virtually no bust, despite experiencing the same
FML, foreign ‡ows, and subsequent FML reversal. This shows that bequest heterogeneity
is crucial in the model for obtaining a large housing boom from a reduction in …nancing
constraints. But this economy without bequest heterogeneity has only half the level of wealth
inequality as the baseline model or the model with no business cycle risk but two types of
agents (wealth Gini of .38 versus .76). Absent enough poor agents who are constrained or
close to their borrowing constraint, a FML will have only small e¤ects. These …ndings are
consistent with those of KMN and SSV who …nd small e¤ects from a relaxation of credit
constraints in a model without aggregate productivity shocks and without enough wealth
inequality.
   Note that, in the model here, a relaxation generates an endogenous increase in residential
investment that results in a decline in expected MU growth. Moreover, without an in‡ux
of foreign capital, relaxed …nancing constraints would lead to an endogenous increase in
interest rates as precautionary saving declines. Absent movements in risk premia, both of
these equilibrium e¤ects would, absent other changes, cause a decline in the P/MU ratio. At
the same time, the in‡ux in foreign capital drives down interest rates but has very little e¤ect
on home prices. These results show that generating a house price boom from a decline in
collateral requirements is in many ways more challenging in general equilibrium models than
it is in partial equilibrium models where interest rates and housing supply are held …xed.
They also underscore the central role of risk premia for explaining house price volatility.

5.5    Cyclical Dynamics of Housing and Equity
In this section we ask to what extent cyclical changes in the P/MU ratio in the model re‡ect
changing expectations of future MU growth, changing expectations of future home price
appreciation (housing returns), or both. As mentioned, in the model, 100% of the variability
in the log P/MU ratio is attributable to variation in the expected present discounted value
of future MU growth rates. This variability can itself be divided into two parts: that
attributable to variation in expected future MU growth, and that attributable to variation
in expected future housing returns (discount rates). We look within Model 1 at the relation
between purely cyclical changes (driven only by business cycle shocks) in P/MU ratios and
subsequent movements in housing return and marginal utility growth. The left panels of
Table 6 show regression results (coe¢ cient, t-stat, R2 ) from both the model and the data for
predicting long-horizon future housing returns and long-horizon future MU growth (model)
or “rent”growth (data) using today’s P/MU ratio (model) or today’s price-rent ratio (data).
   As Table 6 shows, when home prices are high relative to fundamental value, this forecasts
a decline in future home prices, not quicker growth in housing fundamentals. This is true in
both the model and the data (see also Campbell, Davis, Gallin, and Martin (2010), Cochrane
(2011)). In the model, this occurs in part because high P/MU ratios in an expansion forecast
lower future excess returns to housing assets, driven by a lower housing risk premium. The
housing risk premium falls as the economy grows because the endogenous increase in house
prices raises collateral values and relaxes borrowing restrictions, a¤ording households more
insurance against remaining income risk. The data results are even stronger in this regard at
long horizons, suggesting that an even larger fraction of the variability in price-rent ratios is
attributable to changing risk premia. Thus the model under predicts the degree of variation
in housing risk premia at long horizons (and over predicts at short horizons). One note on
this is the results reported in Table 6 for the model include only business cycle shocks. We
expect from the …ndings reported above that shocks to …nancing constraints themselves have
large e¤ects on housing risk premia. Since the historical data include these shocks but the
model does not, a better comparison with the data would introduce …nancing shocks into
the model-based sample, in addition to business cycle shocks.
   Table 6 also shows that a high P/MU ratio forecasts lower future MU growth in the model,
though not as strongly as they forecast lower future returns to housing. It is often suggested
that increases in price-rent ratios re‡ect an expected increase in rental growth. For example,
in a partial equilibrium setting where discount rates are constant, higher house prices relative
to fundamentals can only be generated by higher implicit rental growth rates in the future

                                               40
(Sinai and Souleles (2005), Campbell and Cocco (2007)). The partial equilibrium setting,
however, ignores the endogenous response of both discount rates and residential investment to
economic growth. In general equilibrium, positive economic shocks can simultaneously drive
discount rates down and residential investment up, leading high P/MU ratios to re‡ect an
expected decline in rental growth. As the housing supply expands, the cost of future housing
services (rent) is forecast to be lower. It follows that high price-rent ratios in expansions
must entirely re‡ect expectations of future home price depreciation (lower future returns).
Although future MU growth is expected to be lower, the P/MU ratio still rises in response to
positive economic shocks because the expected decline in future housing returns more than
o¤sets the expected fall in future rental growth.15
       For completeness, Table 6 also reports predictability results for equity returns. In model
generated data, both the raw equity return and the excess return are forecastable by the
price-dividend ratio over long horizons, consistent with evidence from U.S. stock market re-
turns (e.g., see the empirical literature reviews on this evidence in Cochrane (2005), Chapter
20, Lettau and Ludvigson (2010), and Lettau and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008).). High price-
dividend ratios forecast low future equity returns and low excess returns (low equity risk
premia) over horizons ranging from 1 to 30 years. But compared to the data, the model pro-
duces too much forecastability of dividend growth, too little predictability in excess returns
at long horizons, but too much at short. Dividend growth is highly predictable in the model
because, unlike an endowment/exchange economy where dividends can be set exogenously,
here both pro…ts and the value of the …rm respond endogenously to aggregate shocks. For
this same reason, the model also produces too much predictability in raw returns driven by
too much predictability in interest rates. Positive economic shocks increase consumption but
not as much as income, thus saving and the capital stock rise, pushing down expected rates
of return to saving and interest rates.


5.6        Risk Sharing and Inequality
We now evaluate the model’s implications for direct risk-sharing measures and inequality.
Table 7 presents four types of measures of inequality or risk-sharing: (i) the Gini coe¢ cient
for net worth, housing wealth, and …nancial wealth, (ii) the cross-sectional standard devia-
tion in the individual consumption share in aggregate consumption, (iii) the Gini coe¢ cient
of individual consumption, and (iv) the cross-sectional standard deviation of the individual
  15
       Predictable variation in housing returns must therefore account for more than 100 percent of the vari-
ability in price-rent ratios.

                                                      41
                                                                        i
                                                                   @U=@Ca+1;t+1
intertemporal marginal rates of substitution (IMRS),                      i
                                                                    @U=@Ca;t
                                                                                .   The …rst of these are
measures of inequality in wealth; the next two are measures of inequality in the numeraire
consumption good. The last is a measure of risk-sharing. Under perfect risk-sharing (com-
plete markets) individuals equate their marginal rates of substitution state by state. Thus,
the cross-sectional standard deviation of the marginal rates of substitution is a quantitative
measure of market incompleteness, with higher values indicating less risk-sharing.
       Table 7 shows that the model essentially matches overall wealth inequality. For example,
the Gini coe¢ cient for total wealth (net worth) in the data is 74.0 in 2001 (Gini multiplied
by 100) while it is 76.1 in Model 1. The Gini of …nancial wealth in Model 1 is 124.7, close
to the average of 2004-2010 values but higher than the 2001 value.16 The model understates
inequality in housing (Gini equal to 46.1 in Model 1 versus 55.6 in 2001 data. But, like the
data, the model generates large inequality in …nancial wealth and much smaller degrees of
inequality in housing wealth.
       In the data, …nancial wealth inequality rises sharply from 2001 to 2010. During the
housing boom of 2001 to 2007, the Gini of …nancial wealth increases by 20%. Interpreting
this period as a transition from Model 1 to Model 3, the model generates a 10% rise in
inequality, or half of the observed amount.
       Table 7 shows that the decline in risk premia from Model 1 to Model 2 (documented in
Table 5) coincides with an increase in risk-sharing (lower cross-sectional standard deviation
of the IMRS) and a decline in consumption and housing wealth inequality. Risk-sharing
improves because a …nancial liberalization increases access to credit, which allows heteroge-
neous households to insure more of their risks. When a non-trivial fraction of households
operate close to their collateral constraints, any economy-wide ‡uctuation that alters these
constraints is itself an important source of aggregate risk. This can evident in these results
by observing that Model 2 is an economy with lower collateral requirements than Model 1
but the same level of business cycle risk. Yet it exhibits less volatile consumption, more risk
sharing, less precautionary saving, and lower housing and equity risk premia.
       On the other hand, these same measures of risk-sharing and consumption inequality fall
further from Model 2 to Model 3, a comparison that isolates the in‡uence of the foreign
capital in‡ow, despite the fact that housing and equity risk premia rise from Model 2 to
Model 3 (Table 5). To understand this result, it must be kept in mind that not everyone is
constrained, and there are at least two factors that a¤ect …nancial market risk premia. In
  16
       Note that the Gini index can exceed one when negative values for …nancial wealth (negative net worth
for people with debt).


                                                     42
particular, there is a tradeo¤: foreign ‡ows make borrowing less costly for constrained house-
holds and improve their ability to insure against risks, but wealthier savers are forced into a
leveraged position in risky asset markets and exposed to more systematic risk. (Additional
results not reported in the table show that the cross-sectional standard deviation of the MRS
of shareholders rises from Model 2 to Model 3, even though it declines slightly for the entire
population.) Thus, the cross-sectional standard deviation of marginal rates of substitution
across all individuals re‡ects a tradeo¤ between these two groups and can therefore go up or
down, depending on which group’s experience dominates. Moreover, there are also o¤setting
e¤ects on housing and equity risk premia. The improved insurance opportunities of con-
strained households pushes …nancial market risk premia down, while the greater exposure of
wealthy savers to systematic risk pushes these premia up. Here too the overall e¤ect depends
on which e¤ect dominates. In the equilibrium reported here, the second e¤ect dominates the
…rst so that …nancial market risk premia rise from Model 1 to Model 3 even though measures
of risk sharing across all households actually improve.
   Turning to …nancial wealth inequality, we …nd that a …nancial market liberalization and
foreign demand for the risk-free asset have reinforcing e¤ects on …nancial wealth inequality:
…nancial wealth inequality increases from Model 1 to Model 2, and again from Model 2
to Model 3. Financial wealth inequality rises by 7.7 points from a relaxation of credit
constraints. Foreign in‡ows add another 4.7 points, or just over one-third of the overall
e¤ect.
   Why does a …nancial market liberalization have an upward e¤ects on …nancial wealth
inequality while reducing consumption and housing inequality? A …nancial market liber-
alization relaxes …nancial frictions, making it easier to borrow against home equity. This
improves risk-sharing and reduces consumption inequality and housing inequality. But …-
nancial wealth inequality rises because domestic borrowers take advantage of lower collateral
requirements to increase current consumption, leading to a deterioration of their net worth
position. This explains why …nancial wealth inequality rises from Model 1 to Model 3. But
it further rises from Model 2 to Model 3 because domestic savers as a whole are forced to
shift the composition of their wealth toward risky securities as a result of the foreign capi-
tal in‡ow. With more risky securities in their portfolio, they earn a higher return on their
savings, driving their net worth more positive at the same time that constrained households
are taking advantage of lower interest rates and driving their net worth more negative. This
explains why …nancial wealth inequality rises further from Model 2 to Model 3. These model
predictions are consistent with changes in the data from 2001-2010 presented in Table 7, and


                                              43
with evidence that …nancial wealth inequality has risen more than consumption inequality
in recent decades.17


5.7       Robustness
This section discusses robustness of our results to di¤erent assumptions for the model cal-
ibration. Tables 8 and 9 present the model’s implications for the same statistics reported
in Table 2 (business cycle statistics) and Table 5 (asset pricing moments) for a number of
di¤erent calibrations of the model. For ease of comparison, the …rst panel of each table
reproduces our benchmark results. Panel A of Table 8 reproduces the results from Model 1
reported in Table 2. Panel A of Table 9 reproduces the results from Models 1 and 3 that are
reported in Table 5.

Higher Land Share We studied a model with a higher land share of production, equal
to 25% instead of 10% . Overall the results are similar to the benchmark model, with
business cycle statistics almost identical (Table 8). One di¤erence is the lower residential
investment volatility, due to the lower implied housing supply elasticity. Another interesting
di¤erence shown in Table 9 is that the housing risk premium falls by less, percentage-wise,
when moving from Model 1 to Model 3 than it does in the benchmark case with land share
equal to 10%. For this reason the P/MU ratio rises by less from Model 1 to Model 3 (17.4%
rather than 20.5%). Although a higher land share makes housing returns more volatile,
the greater inelasticity of housing also makes these returns less correlated with individuals’
housing-consumption expenditure shares, and therefore their marginal rates of substitution.
The result is a smaller decline in risk premia and lesser increase in P/MU form Model 1 to
Model 3.

Idiosyncratic House Price Depreciation Risk We solved a case of our model with
idiosyncratic housing depreciation shocks in order to assess the potential impact of idio-
syncratic house price risk. Idiosyncratic housing risk could help the model better match
evidence for a large idiosyncratic component in individual housing return volatility (Flavin
and Yamashita (2002), Landvoigt, Piazzesi, and Schneider (2013)). For this case, we change
  17
       Krueger and Perri (2006) and Heathcote, Perri, and Violante (2010) study income and consumption
inequality directly, and show that consumption inequality has risen less than income inequality. Their
results for saving and income inequality suggest that wealth inequality has risen more than consumption
inequality over time.


                                                   44
the individual’s house deprecation rate,   H;   to be stochastic, equal to 0 with probability 0.5
and 5% with probability 0.5. The mean is the same as the benchmark value, 2.5%. This
amount of idiosyncratic risk causes swings of 100% in either direction around estimates of the
mean, which implies substantial idiosyncratic housing risk. Importantly, these shocks have
the potential to a¤ect the volatility of individual housing returns StdN [RH ]. The aggregate
business cycle moments for this case are similar to the benchmark case without idiosyncratic
depreciation shocks (Table 8 Panel C). The additional idiosyncratic volatility in house prices
does make the average (across households) individual housing return slightly more volatile.
                                                                         i
It is StdN [RH ] = 9:3 in Model 1 without depreciation shocks, but Std [RH ] = 9:72 with de-
preciation shocks, but the di¤erence is quite small. Thus while depreciation shocks add risk
to individual housing returns, they generate only a modest amount of additional variability
in housing returns. Individual housing returns are more volatile than returns on the house
price index, but these mechanisms are not enough in the model to capture the magnitude
of estimated idiosyncratic volatility in housing returns found in local housing markets. For
example, Landvoigt, Piazzesi, and Schneider (2013) estimate a standard deviation of the
idiosyncratic component of individual housing returns for households in San Diego to be
close to 9% but argue that total volatility is likely to be on the order of 14%. Flavin and
Yamashita (2002) …nd a standard deviation of 14.29%.

Income Disasters As a …nal variation on our model, we solved a case with a form of
idiosyncratic shocks more akin to “unemployment” shocks, modeled as rare but very large
declines in income. The modeling approach follows Krusell and Smith (1999), whereby
“unemployment” is characterized by an event that happens rarely but results in a large
decline in income. Income shocks are therefore asymmetric, in the sense that good shocks
are smaller but more frequent, while bad shocks are infrequent and very bad. The exact
parametrization is such that income grows by roughly 1.9% per year 95 percent of the time,
but falls by 36% per year …ve percent of the time. Mean labor income growth is unchanged
from the benchmark model. Note that the “unemployment”states do not imply that income
declines all the way to zero; this is a simple way of capturing some basic exogenous level
of insurance against employment shocks. Table 8, Panel D shows that, as for the case with
depreciation shocks, this case has implications for real business cycle moments that are very
similar to the benchmark Model 1. But there are some notable di¤erences for housing and
equity assets. Table 9, Panel D shows that much more severe down-side risk generates slightly
higher equity and housing index return risk premia, and the increase in the P/MU ratio from


                                                45
Model 1 to Model 3 is considerably less than in the benchmark model. The more extreme
idiosyncratic income risk of this case generates more precautionary saving in both Model 1
and Model 3, so that the same …nancial market liberalization leads to less of an increase in
borrowing, less of an increase in risk-sharing, and less of an impact on asset prices.


6     Conclusion
In this paper we have studied the macroeconomic and household-level consequences of ‡uc-
tuations in housing wealth and housing …nance. The framework endogenizes the interaction
among …nancial and housing wealth, housing output and investment, rates of return and
risk premia in both housing and equity assets, and consumption and wealth inequality. In-
terest rates in this environment are determined by a market clearing condition, rather than
modeled as an exogenous parameter. We have focused our investigation on studying the
macroeconomic impact of systemic changes in housing …nance that were a key characteristic
of housing markets during the housing boom period from 2000-2006 and its aftermath. A
theme of this analysis is the importance of time-varying housing risk premia that occur in
general equilibrium environments with aggregate risk for transmitting and amplifying the
e¤ects of economy-wide shocks that shift risk-sharing opportunities in housing markets.
    The model has two key elements not previously considered in existing quantitative macro
studies of housing …nance that …nd small e¤ects on house prices from a decline in …nancing
constraints and large e¤ects from a decline in interest rates. The …rst is aggregate business
cycle risk, and the second is a realistic wealth distribution, achieved in the model by bequest
heterogeneity in preferences. In contrast to models without these features, the framework
here implies that national house prices may ‡uctuate considerably in response to changing
…nancing constraints, but not in response to changing real interest rates. In the model here,
both aggregate business cycle risk and economy-wide shifts in …nancing constraints in‡uence
households’ opportunities for risk-sharing and insurance. As these opportunities change,
the housing risk premium ‡uctuates, and it is through this channel that house prices rise
following a relaxation of constraints. In a simulated transition for the period 2000-2012, the
model captures a large fraction of the run-up observed in U.S. national house prices relative
to housing fundamentals from 2000-2006 and predicts a sharp decline in housing markets
starting in 2007. By contrast, mechanisms that help explain the low and declining interest
rates over this period (such as borrowed funds from the rest of the world), play virtually
no role in generating a housing boom. This occurs because the foreign ‡ows, which reduce


                                              46
interest rates but also reduce the e¤ective supply of safe assets, generate an endogenous
o¤setting increase in the housing risk premium. This latter result runs contrary to the
perception that, by driving interest rates lower, the vast in‡ow of foreign money into U.S.
bond markets from 2000 to 2006 was a major factor in the housing boom.18
       These …ndings illustrate two fundamental principles. First, an economy-wide shift in
…nancing constraints is itself an important source of aggregate risk that can have sizable
e¤ects on housing risk premia. The housing risk premium is an equilibrium quantity that
responds both to business cycle shocks and to the tightness of …nancing constraints, as
these two driving forces alter the landscape for risk-sharing and insurance. Second, the
model’s implications for the wealth distribution are of critical importance for the questions
addressed here. In speci…cations of our model that deliver too little inequality, too few
households operate near binding constraints, so changing those constraints has little in‡uence
on national home values.
       The model takes no stand on whether the changes in housing …nance we’ve documented
can be characterized as a rational response to economic conditions and/or regulatory changes.
Focusing on features of the recent housing boom, Piskorski and Tchistyi (2011) study the
mortgage contracting problem in a partial equilibrium setting with stochastic (exogenous)
home price appreciation. They …nd that many elements of the housing boom, such as the
relaxation of credit limits, the subsidization of risky (subprime) borrowers, and the clustering
of defaults among riskier borrowers, can be explained as the outcome of an optimal dynamic
mortgage contracting problem in which both borrowers and lenders are fully rational. Com-
bining the partial-equilibrium mortgage contracting problem with the general equilibrium
model of limited risk-sharing is a formidable challenge for future research.
       Future work could also address the role of regional heterogeneity in house price-rent ra-
tios. The framework in this paper provides a model of the national price-rent ratio. But
other researchers have emphasized that price-rent ratios varied widely across the U.S. dur-
ing the boom-bust period (e.g., Gyourko, Mayer, and Sinai (2006)). An extension of the
model here could account for this heterogeneity, at least in part, if di¤erent regions were
di¤erentially exposed to the …nancial market liberalization, perhaps because of di¤erences
in demographics that implied some regions were more a¤ected by the changes in credit con-
straints and mortgage transactions costs than others. Mian and Su… (2009) provide evidence
of the existence of such regional heterogeneity. For example, they …nd that zip codes with

       This perception has been voiced by policymakers, academics, and industry analysts. See for example,
Bernanke (2005, 2008), and Stiglitz (2010).


                                                     47
a high prevalence of subprime debt experienced an unprecedented relative growth in mort-
gage credit from 2002 to 2005 despite sharply declining relative (and in some cases absolute)
income growth in those zip codes.
   The model explored here has some notable limitations with regard to housing implica-
tions. It generates too high a correlation between home values and GDP and too little idio-
syncratic house return volatility, and abstracts from important real-world features of housing
markets such as rental markets, long-term home mortgages, and default. This leaves room
for much important additional work in determining the relative role of various economic
factors in driving home values over the business cycle.

Changes in Housing Finance
This section documents the empirical evidence for changes in three features of housing …-
nance.

6.0.1      Changes is Collateral Requirements

First are changes in collateralized borrowing requirements, broadly de…ned. Collateralized
borrowing constraints can take the form of an explicit down payment requirement for new
home purchases, but they also apply to home equity borrowing. Recent data suggests that
down payment requirements for a range of mortgage categories declined during or preceding
the period of rapid home price appreciation from 2000 to 2006. Loan-to-value (LTV) ratios
on subprime loans rose from 79% to 86% over the period 2001-2005, while debt-income ratios
rose (Demyanyk and Hemert (2008)). For the top 50 percent of leveraged homeowners, the
average down payment on securitized subprime and Alt-A loans went from 14% in 2000:Q1
to 2.7% in 2006:Q2 (Geanakoplos (2011)). Other reports suggest that the increase LTV
ratios for prime mortgages was even greater, with one industry analysis …nding that LTV
ratios for conforming …rst and second mortgages rose from 60.4% in 2002 to 75.2% in 2006.19
These changes coincided with a surge in borrowing against existing home equity between
2002 and 2006 (Mian and Su… (2009)).
       By the end of 2006 households routinely were able to buy homes with 100% or higher
…nancing using a piggyback second mortgage or home equity loan. The fraction of households
with second liens rose dramatically during the boom. For subprime loans, that fraction rose
from 3% in 2002 to 30% by then end of 2006; for Alt-A loans it rose from 3% to 44%.20 In

Zimmerman, page 5.

     An indirect indicator of the prevalence of the use of second mortgages is the fraction of …rst liens with LTV
exactly equal to 80%. This fraction rose substantially between 2002 and 2006, as shown by Krainer, LeRoy,
and Munpyung (2009). They also show that the fraction of FRMs with LTV greater than 80% decreased



                                                       49
addition, second or third liens were often the way in which existing home owners tapped into
their home equity, often several quarters after they took out the original mortgage. This
equity extraction through second liens is in addition to extraction via cash-out re…nancing,
another innovation of the boom which became increasingly prevalent. Lee, Mayer, and Tracy
(2011) show that second lien balances grew from about $200 billion at the start of 2002 to
over $1 trillion by the end of 2007. It also shows that the prevalence of second mortgages rose
in every U.S. region from below 10% at the start of the boom (bit higher in coastal cyclical
markets) to around 40% in 2006 (except for the Midwest declining region which peaks at a
20% share).
    More generally, there was a widespread relaxation of underwriting standards in the U.S.
mortgage market during the period leading up to the credit crisis of 2007, which provide a
back-door means of reducing collateral requirements for home purchases. The loosening of
standards can be observed in the marked rise in simultaneous second-lien mortgages and in
no-documentation or low-documentation loans.21 By the end of 2006 households routinely
bought homes with 100% …nancing using a piggyback second mortgage or home equity loan.
See also Mian and Su… (2009). Loans for 125% of the home value were even available if the
borrower used the top 25% to pay o¤ existing debt. Industry analysts indicate that LTV
ratios for combined (…rst and second) mortgages have since returned to more normal levels
of no greater than 75-80% of the appraised value of the home. We assess the impact of these
changes collectively by modeling them as a reduction in collateralized borrowing constraints
and subsequent rise.

6.0.2    Housing Transactions Costs

This section explains how we calibrate our housing transactions costs to empirical observa-
tions. In addition, below in this Appendix, we study a model in which the …nancial market
from 22% to 6% over this period. Their hypothesis is that mortgage lending underwent a shift from a practice
of achieving greater home-buyer leverage by simply increasing the LTV on the …rst lien (common prior to
the housing boom), to a practice of achieving such greater leverage by combining an exactly 80% LTV …rst
lien with a second lien taken out simultaneously (common during the housing boom). In short, during the
housing boom high LTV ratios were achieved by taking out "piggyback" second mortgages rather than by
loading all leverage onto the …rst lien, as was previous practice. Consistent with this hypothesis, Krainer,
LeRoy, and Munpyung (2009) …nd that the default rate on …rst lien mortgages with exactly 80% LTV ratios
was higher than that on …rst lien mortgages that had either 79% or 81% LTV ratios.

liberalization was characterized by a decline in housing transactions costs, as well as a decline
in …nancing constraints. (In the models of the main text, these costs are kept …xed.) We
therefore also explain how we calibrate the change in transactions costs for this case.
       The period of rapid home price appreciation was marked by a decline in the cost of
conducting housing transactions; houses, in e¤ect, became more liquid. Closing costs for
mortgages, mortgage re…nancing, and home equity extraction all fell sharply in the years
during and preceding the housing boom that ended in 2006. The Federal Housing Financing
Board reports monthly data on mortgage and mortgage re…nancing closing costs (based on
a survey of the largest lenders). Closing costs on …rst mortgages and mortgage re…nancings
combined for Freddie Mac 30-year conforming mortgages declined 40% from the end of 2000
to end of 2006. These costs began moving back up in the aftermath of the credit crisis of
2007/2008. From 2007 to 2009, closing costs on Freddie Mac 30-year conforming mortgages
surged back up 56%.
       The most speci…c estimates in the reduction in borrowing costs are from Berndt, Holli-
…eld, and Sandas (2010). They study subprime mortgage loans originated by New Century
Financial Corp. Total broker compensation decreased form 5.0% of the loan amount in
1997 to 4.3% in 2000 to 2.8% in 2006. Broker compensation includes direct fees and the
yield spread premium, a fee the broker receives for steering the borrower towards a speci…c
mortgage product. They also show that fees decreased after controlling for other loan char-
acteristics. Corroborating evidence comes from a measure of total amount of dollars spent
on real-estate related …nancial services divided by total dollars in real estate loans made. A
reduction in that fraction signi…es that these services become cheaper per unit. The data
available on fees are “Financial service charges, fees, and commissions”from National Income
and Product Accounts (NIPA) table 2.4.5. While this measure of fees includes all …nancial
fees and is therefore a bit too broad, a substantial portion of the fees that are earned in this
period are known to be real estate related. No …ner breakdown of fees is available. For the
denominator, the FDIC has information on real estate loans for all FDIC-insured commercial
and savings banks. Fees per real estate dollar lent rise until 2000 and then fall from 7.3% in
2000 to 5.1% in 2006.
       Finally, transactions costs associated with home equity extraction declined signi…cantly
and coincided with a surge of 350% in mortgage equity withdrawal rates from 2000-2006.22
Kennedy and Greenspan (2007) compiled data on closing costs for home equity loans (HEL)
  22
       Figures based on updated estimates provided by James Kennedy of the mortgage analysis in Kennedy
and Greenspan (2005).


                                                   51
and home equity lines of credit (HELOC) from periodic releases of the Home Equity Survey
Report, published by the American Bankers Association. The data indicate that these costs
trended down signi…cantly: for HELOCs, they were 76% lower in 2004 than they were in
1988. For closed-end HELs, the costs declined 41% from 1998 to 2004. The surveys in-
dicate that non-pecuniary costs, in the form of required documentation, time lapsed from
loan application to loan closing, and familiarity with available opportunities for re…nancing
and home-equity extraction, also declined substantially. Mortgage closing costs for …rst and
second (home equity) mortgages, home equity lines of credit, and re…nancing eroded consid-
erably in the period during or preceding the housing boom, by 90% in some cases. Although
some of these costs began to decline in the late 1980s and early 1990s, industry analysts
report that there was a delay in public recognition. Mortgage servicers only gradually im-
plemented marketing tools designed to inform customers of lower costs for re…nancing and
home equity withdrawal. Likewise, news that borrowers could expect a reduction in …nancial
documentation and shortened time periods from application to approval and from approval
to closing also spread slowly (Peristiani, Bennett, Monsen, Peach, and Rai¤ (1997)).
   Taken together, we use the above evidence and estimates to calibrate the lending cost
parameter, . The data collected by Berndt, Holli…eld, and Sandas (2010) and the aggregate
data on fees per dollar of real estate loan speak directly to the value of this parameter. As
a compromise between the level and changes of these two measures of fees between 2000
and 2006, we choose     = 5:5%. In the speci…cation below where we consider a decline in
borrowing costs, we change this parameter to      = 3:5% of the amount lent.
   In summary, the decline in both transaction costs and collateral constraints that we
study in the model is designed to capture the broader empirical phenomenon that subprime
mortgages, second mortgages, and home equity lines of credit all became much more widely
available between 2000 and 2006. For example, subprime constituted less that 10% of all
mortgages in 2000, but it accounted for 40% of all originations in 2006.

6.0.3   Changes in Real Interest Rates

A key development in the housing market in recent years is the secular decline in interest
rates, which coincided with a surge in foreign ownership of U.S. bonds. Figure A.1 shows
that both 30-year FRMs and the 10-year Treasury bond yield have trended downward, with
mortgage rates declining from around 18 percent in the early 1980s to below 3.5 percent by
the end of 2012. This was not merely attributable to a decline in in‡ation: the real annual
interest rate on the ten-year Treasury bond fell from 3.6% in December 1999 to 0.93% in

                                             52
June 2006 using the consumer price index as a measure of in‡ation. Alternatively, the 10-
year TIPS yield declined from 4.32% to 2.53% over this same period, or 180bp. The 10yr
TIPS rate reached a prior low of 1.64% in September 2005, which represents a decline of
270bp, the same decline observed for the 10-year Treasury from December 1999 to June
2006. In the post-crisis period, both measures of the 10-year real rate continue to decline
and are in negative territory at the end of our sample. At the same time, foreign ownership
of U.S. Treasuries (T-bonds and T-notes) increased from $118 billion in 1984, or 13.5% of
marketable Treasuries outstanding, to $2.2 trillion in 2008, or 61% of marketable Treasuries
(Figure A.2, Panel A). Dollar holdings continue to rise to $4.7 trillion in 2012, but the share
declines to 52.5%. Foreign holdings of long-term U.S. Agency and Government Sponsored
Enterprise-backed agency securities quintupled between 2000 and 2008, rising from $261
billion to $1.46 trillion, or from 7% to 21% of total agency debt. Agency holdings fall to
$991 billion or 14% of the amount outstanding by 2012. Foreign holdings of long-term and
short-term U.S. Treasury and Agency debt as a fraction of GDP doubled from 14.6% to
29.3% over the period 2000-2008 (Figure A.2, Panel B). Over this period, the fraction of
marketable Treasuries relative to GDP was stable between 2000 and 2008 at around 31%.
In the post-2008 period, foreign holdings continue to rise to 40.6% of GDP by 2012. Over
the 2008-2012 period, the supply of marketable Treasuries rises to 67% of GDP, so that
foreign holdings fall as a share of Treasuries outstanding but rise relative to GDP. We study
a model where foreign purchases of U.S. debt equal 18% of GDP, which is close to the
observed average for the period 1974-2012.


Calibration of Shocks
The aggregate technology shock processes ZC and ZH are calibrated following a two-state
Markov chain, with two possible values for each shock, fZC = ZCl ; ZC = ZCh g ;
fZH = ZHl ; ZH = ZHh g ; implying four possible combinations:

                                ZC = ZCl;          ZH = ZHl
                                ZC = ZCh;          ZH = ZHl
                                ZC = ZCl;          ZH = ZHh
                                ZC = ZCh;          ZH = ZHh:




                                              53
Each shock is modeled as,

                                   ZCl = 1           eC ;         ZCh = 1 + eC
                               ZHl = 1               eH ;         ZCh = 1 + eH ;

where the volatilities of eC and eH are calibrated to match the volatilities of GDP and
residential investment in the data.
   We assume that ZC and ZH are independent of one another. Let PC be the transition
matrix for ZC and PH be the transition matrix for ZH . The full transition matrix equals

With these parameter values, we match the average length of expansions divided by the
average length of recessions (equal to 5.7 in NBER data from over the period 1945-2001).
We de…ne a recession as the event fZCl; ; ZHl; g ; so that the probability of staying in a recession
is pH   C
    ll pll = 0:36; implying that a recession persists on average for 1= (1                          :36) = 1:56 years.
We de…ne an expansion as either the event fZCh; ZHl; g or fZCl ; ZHh g or fZCh; ZHh; g : Thus,
there are four possible states (one recession, three expansion). The average amount of time
spent in each state is given by the stationary distribution (4                          1) vector   , where

                                                     P = :

That is,       is the eigenvector for P with corresponding eigenvalue equal to 1. The …rst
element of      , denoted       1;   multiplies the probabilities in P for transitioning to any of the
four states tomorrow conditional on being in a recession state today.                           1   therefore gives the
average amount of time spent in the recession state, while                      2;   3;   and       4   give the average
amount of time spent in the other three (expansion) states. Given the matrix P above, the

This implies the chain spends 14.79% of the time in a recession state and 85.21% of the
time in expansion states, so the average length of expansions relative to that of recessions is
85:21= (14:79) = 5:76 years.

The standard deviation in the unit root process in idiosyncratic earnings is calibrated to be
equal to        = :125. This represents the average of the recession and expansion estimates
for this parameter given in Storesletten, Telmer, and Yaron (2004b) and very close to the
   = :129 Storesletten, Telmer, and Yaron (2004a) estimate in a homoskedastic model. Thus,
                          i
in our benchmark models, Ea;t takes on one of two values in each aggregate state:
                                (
                          i        0:125       with Pr = 0:5

Thus, E Za;t =Za;t      1     = 1. For the case of the model designed to mimic unemployment
                         i
shocks (see text),     Ea;t   takes on:
                                            (

Where again, E Za;t =Za;t            1   = 1.


Calibration of Parameters
Parameters pertaining to the …rms’ decisions are set as follows. The capital depreciation
rate, , is set to 0.12, which corresponds to the average Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)

                                                              55
depreciation rates for equipment and structures. The housing depreciation rate                           H,   is set to
0.025 following Tuzel (2009). Following Kydland and Prescott (1982) and Hansen (1985),
the capital share for the non-housing sector is set to                 = 0:36: For the residential investment
sector, the value of the capital share in production is taken from a BEA study of gross product
originating, by industry. The study …nds that the capital share in the construction sector
ranges from 29.4% and 31.0% over the period 1992-1996. We therefore set the capital share in
the housing sector to      = 0:30.23 The adjustment costs for capital in both sectors are assumed
                                                                                           I         2

constant ' is chosen to represent a tradeo¤ between the desire to match aggregate investment
volatility simultaneously with the volatility of asset returns. Under this calibration, …rms
pay a cost only for net new investment; there is no cost to replace depreciated capital. This

implies that the total adjustment cost '          K
                                                                   Kt under our calibration is quite small: on
average less than one percent of investment, It . The …xed quantity of land/permits available
each period, L, is set to a level that permits the model to approximately match the housing
investment-GDP ratio. In post-war data this ratio is 4.8%; under our calibration of L, the
ratio ranges from 5.4% to 5.9% across Model, 1, 2 and 3.
       Parameters of the individual’s problem are set as follows. The survival probability
 a+1ja    = 1 for a + 1    65. For a + 1 > 65, we set               a+1ja   equal to the fraction of households
over 65 born in a particular year alive at age a + 1; as measured by the U.S. Census Bureau.
From these numbers, we obtain the stationary age distribution in the model, and use it to
match the average earnings over the life-cycle, Ga , to that observed from the Survey of Con-
                                                      1
sumer Finances. Risk aversion is set to                   = 8; to help the model match the high Sharpe
ratio for equity observed in the data. Low values for this parameter imply unrealistically
low risk premia and Sharpe ratios. The static elasticity of substitution between C and H
is set to unity (Cobb-Douglas utility), following evidence in Davis and Ortalo-Magne (2010)
that expenditure shares on housing are approximately constant over time and across U.S.
metropolitan statistical areas. The weight,                    on C in the utility function is set to 0.70,
corresponding to a housing expenditure share of 0.30.
       It is not immediately obvious how to set the parameter & (the fraction of bequesters).

  Gross Product Originating is equal to gross domestic income, whose components can be grouped into
categories that approximate shares of labor and capital. Under a Cobb-Douglas production function, these
equal shares of capital and labor in output.

We use the results of Skinner and Zeldes (2002), who report that, in the 1998 Survey of
Consumer Finances, saving for one’s estate or children was mentioned as a reason for saving
by 8% of all households and 12% of all retirees. We take the midpoint of these numbers
as our value for the fraction of bequesters in the economy      = 0:10. Given this value, we
completely pin down values for the time discount parameter        and    (strength of bequest
motive) jointly to match the average level of real interest rates and the degree of wealth
inequality (Gini coe¢ cient) in the data. For this we set     = 0:7;    = 0:10 and      = 1016 :
While    = 0:7 is low compared to models where no agents have a bequest motive, note that
the saving rate in this economy is equivalent to one with a much higher           because of the
bequest motives. In fact, a low   for most of the population combined with a strong bequest
motive for a small fraction of the population allows us to roughly match the high level of
wealth inequality in the data. We assume that the bequest motive is passed from parents to
o¤spring so that a dynasty with a bequest motive never switches to one without, and vice
versa.
   The other parameters of the individual’s problem are less precisely pinned down from
empirical observation. The costs of stock market participation could include non-pecuniary
costs as well as explicit transactions fees. Vissing-Jorgensen (2002) …nds support for the
presence of a …xed, per period participation cost, but not for the hypothesis of variable
costs. She estimates the size of these costs and …nds that they are small, less than 50 dollars
per year in year 2000 dollars. These …ndings motivate our calibration of these costs so that
                                                                              i
they are no greater than 1% of per capita, average consumption, denoted C in Table 1.
   We are aware of no publicly available time series on collateral requirements for mortgages
and home equity loans. However, our own conversations with government economists and in-
dustry analysts who follow the housing sector indicated that, prior to the housing boom that
ended in 2006, the combined LTV for …rst and second conventional mortgages (mortgages
without mortgage insurance) was rarely if ever allowed to exceed 75 to 80% of the appraised
value of the home. In addition, home equity lines of credit were not widely available until
relatively recently (McCarthy and Steindel (2007)). By contrast, during the boom years
households routinely bought homes with 100% …nancing using a piggyback second or home
equity loan. Our Model 1 sets the maximum combined LTV (…rst and second mortgages)
to be 75%, corresponding to $ = 25%: In Model 2, we lower this to $ = 1%: It should be
emphasized that 1    $ gives the maximum combined (…rst and second mortgage) LTV ratio.
This will di¤er from the average LTV ratio because not everyone borrows up to the credit
limit.


                                              57
   The …xed and variable “moving” component of the housing transactions costs are gov-
erned by the parameters     0   and   1.   These costs are more comprehensive than the costs of
buying and selling existing homes. They include costs of any change in housing consumption,
such as home improvements and additions, as well as non-pecuniary psychological costs. To
anchor the baseline level of these costs, in Model 1 we set …xed costs       0   and variable costs   1

to match the average number of years individuals in the model go without changing housing
consumption equal to the average length of residency (in years) for home owners in the Sur-
vey of Consumer Finances across the 1989-2001 waves of the survey. In the equilibrium of
our model, this amount corresponds to a value for          0   that is approximately 3.2% of annual
per capita consumption, and a value for         1   that is approximately 5.5% of the value of the
house pH  i
       t Ha;t . These costs are maintained between M1, M2 and M3.
   As discussed above in the Appendix section on Changes in Housing Finance, we use
direct estimates to calibrate the lending cost parameter, . As a compromise between the
two di¤erent measures of fees and their reduction between 2000 and 2006, we set               = 5:5%
in M1.
   Finally, we calibrate foreign ownership of U.S. debt, BtF , by targeting a value for foreign
bond holdings relative to GDP. Speci…cally, when we add foreign capital to the economy in
Model 3, we experiment with several constant values for BtF            B F until the model solution
implies a value equal to 18% of average total output, Y , an amount that is approximately
equal to the rise in foreign ownership of U.S. Treasuries and agency debt over the period
2000-2008. Figure 4, Panel B shows that, as of the middle of 2008, foreign holdings of
long-term Treasuries alone represent 15% of GDP. Higher values are obtained if one includes
foreign holdings of U.S. agency debt and/or short-term Treasuries. Depending on how many
of these categories are included, the fraction of foreign holdings in 2008 ranges from 15-30%.


Additional Results: Changing Borrowing Costs
This section considers a model where we rede…ne a …nancial market liberalization (FML)
as a simultaneous increase in the maximum loan to value ratio and a decline in the cost of
borrowing . Thus the new Model 2 is one that is identical to Model 1 above, but has both
lower …nancing constraints and lower borrowing costs. The available data discussed above
suggests that a decline in borrowing costs          from 5.5% to 3.5% of the amount borrowed is
warranted. The decrease in maximum LTV ratio is kept the same as in the text (75% to
99%). Model 3 in this case then adds foreign ‡ows to the new Model 2. In this model,


                                                    58
a …nancial market liberalization improves risk sharing not only because it increases access
to credit (the LTV e¤ect), but also because lower transactions costs reduce the expense of
acquiring additional collateral, which increases borrowing capacity that can be used to insure
against shocks. The results are reported in Table A.1.
   Since the borrowing costs are speci…c to housing, house prices and stock prices become
more di¤erent from one another. This is re‡ected in a lower correlation of house P/MU and
stock price/dividend ratios in Model 2 (0.40 versus 0.59 in baseline, unreported). We …nd
that a FML lowers risk premia more than in the benchmark, but disproportionately so for
housing. Table 9 shows that the housing risk premium declines by 2.9% points from Model
1 to Model 3 versus a decline of 1.8% points in the baseline; the decline in the equity risk
premium is 0.04% versus an increase of 0.69% in the baseline. As a result, the increase in
the P/MU ratio due to a FML and foreign in‡ows is 27.7%, substantially higher than the
20.5% in the baseline model results. This 27.7% increase comes close to matching the 32%
increase in the Flow of Funds and Freddie Mac data, even though business cycle shocks
are averaged out. This exercise also produces larger shifts in housing wealth shares than
the baseline model, as housing becomes increasingly attractive with lower transaction costs.
Finally, this version of the model generates a larger increase in …nancial wealth inequality;
the Gini coe¢ cient goes from 124.7 in Model 1 to 141.0 in Model 2 (compared to 132.5 in the
baseline). This is due the lower borrowing costs making borrowing against housing wealth
more attractive to all agents, not only the …nancially constrained, and due to the larger
e¤ects of a FML on risk premia and asset valuations.


6.1    Numerical Solution Procedure
The numerical solution strategy consists of solving the individual’s problem taking as given
her beliefs about the evolution of the aggregate state variables. With this solution in hand,
the economy is simulated for many individuals and the simulation is used to compute the
equilibrium evolution of the aggregate state variables, given the assumed beliefs. If the
equilibrium evolution di¤ers from the beliefs individuals had about that evolution, a new
set of beliefs are assumed and the process is repeated. Individuals’expectations are rational
once this process converges and individual beliefs coincide with the resulting equilibrium
evolution. One important note: we have no results on uniqueness. We are unaware of any
such results in the literature concerning models with the degree of complexity considered
here, as is typically the case.


                                             59
   The state of the economy is a pair, (Zt ;          t) ;   where     t   is a measure de…ned over

                                     S = (A         Z        W    H) ;

where A = f1; 2; :::Ag is the set of ages, where Z is the set of all possible idiosyncratic shocks,
where W is the set of all possible beginning-of-period …nancial wealth realizations, and where
H is the set of all possible beginning-of-period housing wealth realizations. That is,                t   is a
distribution of agents across ages, idiosyncratic shocks, …nancial, and housing wealth. Given
a …nite dimensional vector to approximate             t,   and a vector of individual state variables

                                           i
                                           t   = (Zti ; Wti ; Hti );

the individual’s problem is solved using dynamic programming.
   An important step in the numerical strategy is approximating the joint distribution of
individuals,   t,   with a …nite dimensional object. The resulting approximation, or “bounded
rationality” equilibrium has been used elsewhere to solve overlapping generations models
with heterogenous agents and aggregate risk, including Krusell and Smith (1998a); Ríos-Rull
and Sánchez-Marcos (2006); Storesletten, Telmer, and Yaron (2007); Gomes and Michaelides
(2008); Favilukis (2013), among others. For our application, we approximate this space with
a vector of aggregate state variables given by

                                    AG
                                    t    = (Zt ; Kt ; St ; Ht ; pH
                                                                 t ; qt );


where
                                          Kt = KC;t + KH;t

and
                                                     KC;t
                                          St =                :
                                                  KC;t + KH;t
The state variables are the observable aggregate technology shocks, the …rst moment of the
aggregate capital stock, the share of aggregate capital used in production of the consumption
good, the aggregate stock of housing, and the relative house price and bond price, respec-
tively. The bond and the house price are natural state variables because the joint distribution
of all individuals only matters for the individual’s problem in so far as it a¤ects asset prices.
Note that knowledge of Kt and St is tantamount to knowledge of KC;t and KH;t separately,
and vice versa (KC;t = Kt St ; KH;t = Kt (1          St )).
   Because of the large number of state variables and because the problem requires that
prices in two asset markets (housing and bond) must be determined by clearing markets every

period, the proposed problem is highly numerically intensive. To make the problem tractable,
we obviate the need to solve the dynamic programming problem of …rms numerically by
instead solving analytically for a recursive solution to value function taking the form V (Kt ) =
Qt Kt , where Qt (Tobin’s q) is a recursive function. We discuss this below.
     In order to solve the individual’s dynamic programming problem, the individual must
           AG                 i                        AG               i
know       t+1     and        t+1   as a function of   t    and         t   and aggregate shocks Zt+1 . Here we show
that this can be achieved by specifying individuals’ beliefs for the laws of motion of four
quantities:

A1 Kt+1 ,

A2 pH
    t+1 ,


A3 qt+1 , and

        t+1       t+1

state variables as follows:

We initialize the law of motion (28) with a guess for the matrix A(n) (Zt ; Zt+1 ), given by
A(0) (Zt ; Zt+1 ) : The initial guess is updated in an iterative procedure (described below) to
insure that individuals’beliefs are consistent with the resulting equilibrium.
                                                                                AG           i                        AG
     Given (28), individuals can form expectations of                           t+1   and    t+1   as a function of   t    and
 i
 t   and aggregate shocks Zt+1 . To see this, we employ the following equilibrium relation (as
shown below) linking the investment-capital ratios of the two production sectors:

                                      IH;t   IC;t   1

Moreover, note that Et [Mt+1 (QC;t+1                     QH;t+1 )] can be computed from (28) by integrating
                                                        e t and Zt :

Rearranging terms, it can be shown that Qs;t is a recursion:

Since Qs;t is a function only of Xs;t and the expected discounted value of Qs;t+1 , it does not
depend on the …rm’s own Ks;t+1 or Is;t . Hence we verify that V (Ks;t ) = Qs;t Ks;t . Although
Qs;t does not depend on the …rm’s individual Ks;t+1 or Is;t , in equilibrium it will be related
to the …rm’s investment-capital ratio via:

   The individual’s problem, as approximated above, may be summarized as follows (where
we drop age subscripts when no confusion arises). The problem is illustrated for the non-
bequesters; the problem for the bequesters is analogous using (6) in place of (5).

The above problem is solved subject to (9), (10) if the individual of working age, and subject
to the analogous versions of (9), (10), (using pension income in place of wage income), if
the individual is retired. The problem is also solved subject to an evolution equation for the
state space:
                                      AG        (n)       AG
                                      t+1   =         (   t ; Zt+1 ):

 (n)
       is the system of forecasting equations that is obtained by stacking all the beliefs from
(28) and accumulation equations into a single system. This step requires us to make an initial
guess for A(0) in equations (A1)-(A4). This dynamic programming problem is quite complex
numerically because of a large number of state variables but is otherwise straightforward.
Its implementation is described below.
   We next simulate the economy for a large number of individuals using the policy func-
tions from the dynamic programming problem. Using data from the simulation, we calculate
                                 e t and the initial guess A(0) . In particular, for every Zt and
(A1)-(A4) as linear functions of {
Zt+1 combination we regress (A1)-(A4) on Kt , St , Ht , pH
                                                         t , and qt . This is used to calculate a
new A(n) = A(1) which is used to re-solve for the entire equilibrium. We continue repeating
this procedure, updating the sequence A(n) ; n = 0; 1; 2; ::: until (1) the coe¢ cients in A(n)
between successive iterations is arbitrarily small, (2) the regressions have high R2 statis-
tics, and (3) the equilibrium is invariant to the inclusion of additional state variables such
as additional lags and/or higher order moments of the cross-sectional wealth and housing
distribution. We discuss numerical accuracy below.
   During the simulation step, an additional numerical complication is that two markets
(the housing and bond market) must clear each period. This makes pH
                                                                  t and qt convenient
state variables: the individual’s policy functions are a response to a menu of prices pH
                                                                                       t and qt ,
                         i          i      i
Given values for YH;t , Ha+1;t+1 , Ha;t , Ba;t and BtF form the simulation, and given the menu
of prices pH                                                         H
           t and qt and the beliefs (28), we then choose values for pt+1 and qt+1 that clear
markets in t + 1. The initial allocations of wealth and housing are set arbitrarily to insure
that prices in the initial period of the simulation, pH
                                                      1 and q1 , clear markets. However, these
values are not used since each simulation includes an initial burn-in period of 150 years that
we discard for the …nal results.
   The procedure just described requires a numerical solution to the individual’s problem,
a simulation using that solution for a large number of agents, and then a repetition (many
times) of this procedure using the updated coe¢ cients in A(n) . The continuum of individuals
born each period in this solution step is approximated by a number large enough to insure
that the mean and volatility of aggregate variables is not a¤ected by idiosyncratic shocks.

                                                  65
We check this by simulating the model for successively larger numbers of individuals in each
age cohort and checking whether the mean and volatility of aggregate variables changes.
In addition, we have solved particular cases of the model for di¤erent numbers of agents.
For numbers ranging from a total of 2,500 to 100,000 agents in the population we found
no signi…cant di¤erences in the aggregate allocations we report. But, because of the high
numbers of iterations required for convergence, larger numbers of agents drastically increase
the computational burden and solving time. Due to the number of cases with di¤erent
parameter con…gurations we solve, we therefore use 10,000 agents in this iterative-simulation
part of the model solution algorithm. We can, however, use a much larger number of agents
for the aggregate statistics we report as output of the model, since, once the model is solved,
computing these requires only a one-time simulation. Doing so insures that our reported
statistics are as free as possible of any small amount of remaining idiosyncratic (income and
death) risk. We therefore generate data for 100,000 agents when we perform the one-time
simulation used to report aggregate statistics for the …gures and tables of the paper. We
could not readily increase the number of agents in the one-time simulation beyond 100,000
because attempts to do so exceeded the available memory on a workstation computer.

Numerical Solution to Individual’s Dynamic Programming Problem

We now describe how the individual’s dynamic programming problem is solved.
   First we choose grids for the continuous variables in the state space. That is we pick
a set of values for W i , H i , K, H, S, pH , and q. Because of the large number of state
variables, it is necessary to limit the number of grid points for some of the state variables
given memory/storage limitations. We found that having a larger number of grid points for
the individual state variables was far more important than for the aggregate state variables,
in terms of the e¤ect it had on the resulting allocations. Thus we use a small number of grid
points for the aggregate state variables but compensate by judiciously choosing the grid point
locations after an extensive trial and error experimentation designed to use only those points
that lie in the immediate region where the state variables ultimately reside in the computed
equilibria. As such, a larger number of grid points for the aggregate state variables was
found to produce very similar results to those reported using only a small number of points.
We pick 35 points for W i , 16 points for H i , and four points for K, H, S, pH , and q. The grid
for W i starts at the borrowing constraint and ends far above the maximum wealth reached
in simulation. This grid is very dense around typical values of …nancial wealth and is sparser
for high values. The housing grid is constructed in the same way.

                                               66
    Given the grids for the state variables, we solve the individual’s problem by value function
iteration, starting for the oldest (age A) individual and solving backwards. The oldest
individual’s value function for the period after death is zero for all levels of wealth and
housing (alternately it could correspond to an exogenously speci…ed bequest motive). Hence
the value function in the …nal period of life is given by VA = maxHt+1
                                                                   i   ;     i     i
                                                                             t+1 ;Bt+1
                                                                                         U (CAi ; HAi )
subject to the constraints above for (38). Given VA (calculated for every point on the
state space), we then use this function to solve the problem for a younger individual (aged
A    1). We continue iterating backwards until we have solved the youngest individual’s
(age 1) problem. We use piecewise cubic splines (Fortran methods PCHIM and CHFEV) to
interpolate points on the value function. Any points that violate a constraint are assigned a
large negative value.


Numerical Checks
This section presents some numerical checks designed to quantify departures from a fully
rational equilibrium. At the end of this section, we discuss an important caution about
these tests, namely that their appropriateness for our bounded rationality equilibrium is
open to question, and there is no consensus on the acceptable degree of departure from full
rationality.
    Table A.2 begins with standard R2 statistics. The one-step-ahead R2 statistics for the
four equations (A1)-(A4) are reported in column 1 Table A.2, with the lowest being 0.994
for the Q forecasting equation (A4). These statistics are all quite high and suggest a high
degree of accuracy.
    These R2 statistics amount to a one-period-ahead test of the forecasting equations. Al-
though most studies using the Krusell and Smith (1998b) approach report just these one-
period-ahead tests, Den Haan (2010) argues that even very accurate one-period ahead fore-
casts can result in inaccurate multi-period forecasts as the errors build up over time.
    Krusell and Smith (1998b) suggest also looking at forecasting errors several periods ahead.
In particular, for a given sequence of aggregate shocks from t to t + k, they suggest using the
forecasting equations (A1)-(A4) to iteratively forecast the state variables k periods ahead.
This forecast would use actual state variables at t, the aggregate shocks from t to t + k,
and equations (A1)-(A4), but it would not use actual state variable realizations between t
and t + k. The forecasted state variables at t + k are then compared to the realized state
variables from simulating the actual model (with heterogenous agents) for the same sequence


                                              67
of shocks. Den Haan (2010) extends this idea by simulating the model over the full sample
(in our case 1,750 periods), then taking the same sequence of aggregate shocks and using the
forecasting equations to simulate the state variables for the same sample. Note that since
this is done for a large sample (furthermore, the …rst 250 periods are thrown out), this is
tantamount to Krusell and Smith (1998b)’s suggestion for a very large (or in…nite) k. We
will refer to this test as k = 1 for short. Indeed, we have also con…rmed that as k rises
in Krusell and Smith (1998b)’s test, the forecast errors approach the errors in Den Haan
(2010)’s test. (This is also consistent with results reported in Den Haan (2010)).
                                           bt , Den Haan (2010) suggests reporting the stan-
   For each state variable xt and forecast x
dard deviation of the forecast error (xt          bt ) scaled by the standard deviation of the state
                                                  x
variable (xt ). Note that this measure is equivalent to reporting the R2 , because the R2 is
                (xt xbt )2
de…ned as 1       (xt )2
                           .   This de…nition of R2 works for any k, including the one period ahead
R2 discussed above, and reported in column 1 of Table A.2. In column 2 we report the R2
statistics from the procedure suggested by Den Haan (2010) (k = 1). These R2 statistics
are somewhat lower, but still relatively high, with the lowest occurring for the equation for
the aggregate capital (A1), equal to 0.947.
   Note that the results above are all based on in-sample calculations because the forecasting
coe¢ cients, and the forecast errors are computed on time-series with the same sequence of
aggregate shocks. Den Haan (2010) suggests doing the same experiments on simulated data
with an alternative sequence of aggregate shocks. To do so, we start with the coe¢ cients
computed from simulating our actual model. We then simulate an alternative sequence of
                                                                          bt using these forecast
aggregate shocks to construct a time-series of forecasted state variables x
coe¢ cients (A1-A4). We use the same alternative sequence of aggregate shocks to simulate
our actual model with 100,000 agents to construct a time-series of state variables xt . We
report these errors in column 3. The R2 statistics do fall some, but are still relatively close
to column 3. The lowest is again for the capital equation, now equal to 0.931 when using
out-of-sample data.
   Because we are computing a bounded rationality equilibrium, it is expected that forecasts
are imperfect. It is not surprising therefore that the R2 are not unity. There is no accepted
cuto¤ in the literature. For example Den Haan (2010) writes “accuracy tests can also be
too strong in the sense that solutions that are close to the true solution in most important
aspects are still rejected by the accuracy test.”
   The forecasting tests discussed above check how close our bounded rational equilibrium
is to a fully rational equilibrium, along the forecasting dimensions described. As another

test of numerical accuracy, one can check whether the Euler equation errors are close to
zero. This test is inappropriate for most of the agents in our model, since these agents are
constrained often over their lifetime, and by de…nition their Euler equations do not hold
with equality. (Recall that households face …xed stock market participation costs, moving
costs, a collateral constraint, and a wedge between the lending and borrowing rate.) We can,
however, identify a subset of agents in our model who are likely to be unconstrained, namely
the wealthy bequesters who have a strong preference for saving. For these agents, the stock
market participation and moving costs are relatively small, while the collateral constraint
is rarely binding. The wedge between borrowing and lending rates may still be binding, in
which case households will invest 100% of their portfolio in the stock market, but will not
lever up. Under these conditions, it can be shown that the Euler equation should hold for
these households with the equity return, as well as with their net portfolio return (but not
for the risk free rate). These Euler equation errors are reported in Table A.3. They are all
su¢ ciently small.
   We have also experimented extensively with grid sizes to con…rm that our results are not
sensitive to grid size. Unfortunately, due to the size of the state space, we are unable to
simultaneously raise all grid sizes. However, we have resolved the model with (i) the grids
for individual …nancial wealth and housing both doubled in size from 35 and 16 to 70 and
32 points respectively, (ii) the grids for aggregate capital and aggregate housing increased
from 4 to 5 points, and for house prices from 4 to 6 points, while at the same time the upper
and lower bounds of the grids are brought closer to the model’s simulated data so that the
intervals in the capital, housing, and house price grids are reduced to 28%, 28%, and 60%
of the original size respectively. In all cases the aggregate quantities and prices look very
similar to those reported in the text.
   We close this section by noting an important caution about these numerical checks. The
model we are solving has a bounded rationality equilibrium, while the numerical checks are
aimed at evaluating whether the model solution is consistent with the fully rational one. This
incongruity between the numerical checks and the model environment is compounded by the
complexity of the framework: when a very large number of agents face an in…nite-dimensional
state space, the fully rational equilibrium is not computable and the degree of departure from
the fully rational equilibrium is unknowable. The fully rational equilibrium may not be a
reasonable one with which to compare a model. The cost in terms of the agent’s objectives
of computing the fully rational policy could in principle be in…nite, so that no expenditure of
resources on computing better policies would be economically optimal for an agent. Although


                                              69
the numerical checks conducted here suggest that–for the aspects of the model evaluated by
the checks–our equilibrium is close to what would be implied by a fully rational one, the
fundamental question of how closely our equilibrium policies and prices correspond to those
of the fully rational one cannot ultimately be answered. We simply conclude with a caution.
As we address issues of contemporary economic importance, we would do well to acknowledge
the enormous complexity of real-world problems economic players face, and the possibility
that the fully rational outcome is an unattainable theoretical construct appropriate only in
unrealistically simplistic environments.

The figure compares three measures of the price-rent ratio. The first measure (“Flow of Funds”) is the ratio of residential real estate
wealth of the household sector from the Flow of Funds to aggregate housing services consumption from NIPA. The second measure
(“Freddie Mac”) is the ratio of the Freddie Mac Conventional Mortgage Home Price Index for purchases to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics’s price index of shelter (which measures rent of renters and imputed rent of owners). The third series (“Core Logic”) is the
ratio of the Core Logic national house price index (SFC) to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’s price index of shelter. The data are quarterly
from 1970.Q1 until 2012.Q4 (or whenever first available). All price-rent series are normalized to a value of 100 in 2000.Q4.

The figure plots total wealth (“Wealth”) by age in the left columns and housing wealth (“Housing”) by age in the right columns. The
top panels are for the Data, the middle panels for Model 1, and the bottom panels for Model 2. We use ten waves of the Survey of
Consumer Finance (1983-2010, every 3 years) and average across them. We include only homeowners, defined as those with positive
housing wealth. We construct housing wealth as the sum of primary housing and other property. We construct total wealth as the
sum of housing wealth and net financial wealth. Net financial wealth is the sum of all other assets (bank accounts, bonds, IRA, stocks,
mutual funds, other financial wealth, private business wealth, and cars) minus all liabilities (credit card debt, home loans, mortgage on
primary home, mortgage on other properties, and other debt). We express wealth on a per capital basis by taking into account the
household size, using the Oxford equivalence scale for income. For each age between 22 and 81, we construct average total wealth and
housing wealth using the SCF weights. To make information in the different waves comparable to each other and to the model, we
divide housing wealth and total wealth in a given wave by average net worth (the sum of housing wealth and net financial wealth) across
all respondents for that wave. We do the same in the model. The Low Earner label refers to those in the bottom 25% of the income
distribution, where income is wage plus private business income. The Medium Earner group refers to the 25-75 percentile of the income
distribution, and the High Earner is the top 25%. The model computations are obtained from a 1,500 year simulation.The “Model 1”
is the model with normal collateral constraints and borrowing costs; “Model 2” reports on the model with looser collateral constraints.
In particular, the down-payment goes from 25% to 1%.

      Figure 3: Transition Dynamics in Model: Price-Rent Ratio, House Price, and Land Price
The top left panel of the figure plots the the price/MU ratio pH /MU (solid thick line) for a transition generated from the baseline
model. The top right panel plots the house price pH , plotted against the left axis (solid line, circles), and the price of land pL , plotted
against the right axis (dashed line, crosses) from the same transition exercise. The bottom left panel plots the baseline price/MU ratio
dynamics (solid thick line) alongside the price/MU dynamics under several counter-factual scenarios. The baseline transition path begins
in the year 2000 in the stochastic steady state of Model 1, the model with tight borrowing constraints. In 2001, the world undergoes an
unanticipated change to Model 3, the model with looser borrowing constraints and foreign holdings of U.S. bonds equal to 18% of GDP.
The figure traces the first 6 years of the transition from the stochastic steady state of Model 1 to the stochastic steady state of Model
3. Along the transition path, agents use the policy functions from Model 3 evaluated at state variables that begin at the stochastic
steady state values of Model 1, and gradually adjust to their stochastic steady state values of Model 3. Along the transition path,
foreign holdings of U.S. bonds increase linearly from 0% in 2000 to 18% of GDP by 2006 (“flows”), and remain constant thereafter.
In 2007, the world unexpectedly changes to Model 4. Model 4 is the same as Model 1 but with foreign holdings of U.S. bonds equal
to 18% of GDP, as in Model 3 (“Reversal of FML”). The transition path is drawn for a particular sequence of aggregate productivity
shocks in the housing and non-housing sectors, as explained in the text. The line “No FML reversal, no flows” considers a transition
from Model 1 to Model 2, but has no foreign flows and no reversal of the FML. The line “No FML reversal, flows” shows a transition
from Model 1 to Model 3, but no reversal of the FML. The bottom right panel plots the baseline price-rent ratio dynamics (solid thick
line) as well as the price/MU dynamics in two different models that undergo the same structural changes as the baseline model (FML,
flows, FML reversal). The first alternative model is one where there are no aggregate productivity shocks (“No business cycle”), and
the second model is one without aggregate productivity shocks and only one type of agent without bequest motive (“No business cycle,
no bequest”).

This table reports the parameter values of our model. The baseline “Model 1” is the model with normal collateral constraints and
borrowing costs; “Model 2” reports on the model with looser collateral constraints and lower borrowing costs. In particular, the down-
payment goes from 25% to 1% and the borrowing premium goes from 5.5 to 3.5%. Finally, “Model 3” is the same as Model 2 except
with a positive demand for bonds from foreigners, equal to 18% of GDP. The model is simulated for N = 40, 000 agents.

Panel A denotes business cycle statistics in annual post-war U.S. data (1953-2012). The data combine information from NIPA Tables
1.1.5, 2.1, and 2.3.5. Output (Y = YC +pH YH +CH ) is gross domestic product minus net exports minus government expenditures. Total
consumption (CT ) is total private sector consumption (housing and non-housing). Housing consumption (CH = R ∗ H) is consumption
of housing services. Non-housing consumption (C) is total private sector consumption minus housing services. Housing investment
(pH YH ) is residential investment. Non-housing investment (I) is the sum of private sector non-residential structures, equipment and
software, and changes in inventory. Total investment is denoted IT (residential and non-housing). For each series in the data, we first
deflate by the disposable personal income deflator. We then construct the trend with a Hodrick-Prescott (1980) filter with parameter
λ = 100. Finally, we construct detrended data as the log difference between the raw data and the HP trend, multiplied by 100. The
standard deviation (first column), correlation with GDP (second column), and the first-order autocorrelation are all based on these
detrended series. The autocorrelation AC is a one-year correlation in data and model. The share of GDP (fourth column) is based on
the raw data. Panel B denotes the same statistics for the Model 1 with normal transaction costs and costs of borrowing. Panel C reports
on Model 2 which has looser collateral constraints than Model 1 and the same borrowing costs: the down-payment goes from 25% to
1%. Panel D reports on Model 3 which has the same borrowing costs and collateral constraints as Model 2 but has foreign capital of
18% of GDP.

The table reports the correlations between house prices pH , house price-rent ratios pH /R, and residential investment pH YH with GDP
Y . It also reports the correlation of house price-to-rent ratios with the price-dividend ratio on stocks in the last column. Panel A is
for the data. The house price and price-rent ratio are measured three different ways. In the first row (Data 1), the housing price is
the aggregate value of residential real estate wealth in the fourth quarter of the year (Flow of Funds). The price-rent ratio divides this
housing wealth by the consumption of housing services summed over the four quarters of the year (NIPA). In Data 2, the housing price
is the repeat-sale Core Logic National House Price Index (series SFD). The price-rent ratio divides this price by the rental price index for
shelter (BLS). It assumes a price rent ratio in 1975.Q4, equal to the one in Data 1. The price and price-rent ratio values in a given year
are the fourth quarter values. The annual price indices, GDP, and residential investment are first deflated by the disposable personal
income price deflator and then expressed as log deviations from their Hodrick-Prescott trend. Panel B is for the Model. Model 1 has
benchmark collateral constraints and costs of borrowing. Model 2 has looser collateral constraints and the same borrowing costs as in
Model 1: the down-payment goes from 25% to 1% . Model 3 which has the same borrowing costs and collateral constraints as Model 2
but has foreign capital of 18% of GDP.

                                Table 4: Housing Wealth Relative to Total Wealth
The first column reports average housing wealth divided by average net worth. The second column reports average housing wealth
of the young (head of household is aged 35 or less) divided by average net worth of the young. The third column reports average
housing wealth of the old (those above 35 years old) divided by average net worth of the old. The fourth (fifth) [sixth] column reports
average housing wealth of the low (medium) [high] net worth households divided by average net worth of the low (medium) [high] net
worth households. Low (medium) [high] net worth households are those in the bottom 25% (middle 50%) [top 25%] of the net worth
distribution, relative to the cross-sectional net worth distribution at each age. The data in Panel A are from the Survey of Consumer
Finance for 2001-2010. We only consider home owners and exclude those with negative net worth. Panel B is for the model. Model 1
has benchmark collateral constraints and costs of borrowing. Model 2 has looser collateral constraints than Model 1: the down-payment
goes from 25% to 1% . Model 3 has the same collateral constraints as Model 2, but has foreign capital of 18% of GDP. In the model,
housing wealth is PH ∗ H and total wealth is W + PH ∗ H.

The table reports the mean and standard deviation of the return of the equity index, a levered claim to physical capital (Columns 1 and 2), the mean return on the housing index
(Column 3), the mean and standard deviation of the risk-free rate (Columns 4 and 5), the excess returns on equity and the housing index (Columns 6 and 7), and the ratio of
the average excess return on the equity index divided by the standard deviation of the return (Column 8). Column (9) reports the change in the price-rent ratio, measured as the
percentage change between 2000 and 2006 in the data and the percentage change relative to Model 1 in the model. Columns (10) and (11) report the average (across households)
of individual housing returns and excess returns, while column (12) denotes the average (across households) of the standard deviation of the individual housing return. Panel A
reports the data. The housing price-rent ratio is measured three different ways. In the first row (Data 1), the housing return is the aggregate value of residential real estate wealth
in the fourth quarter of the year (Flow of Funds) plus the consumption of housing services summed over the four quarters of the year (NIPA) divided by the value of residential
real estate in the fourth quarter of the preceding year. In Data 2 (Data 3), the house price index is the repeat-sale Core Logic National (Freddie Mac) House Price Index and
the BLS rental price index for shelter. It assumes a price rent ratio in 1975 equal to the one in Data 1 in 1975. The equity index return in the data is measured as the CRSP
value-weighted stock return. We subtract realized annual CPI inflation from realized annual stock returns between 1953 and 2012 to form real annual stock returns. The risk-free
rate is measured as the yield on a one-year government bond at the start of the year minus the realized inflation rate over the course of the year. The data are from the Fama-Bliss
data set and available from 1953 until 2012. Panel B is for the model. The leverage ratio (debt divided by equity) we use in the model is 2/3: RE = Rf + (1 + B/E)(RK − Rf ),
where RK is the return on physical capital.

Panel A reports the coefficients, t-stats, and R2 of real return and real dividend growth predictability regressions. The return regression
                    P
specification is: k1 kj=1 rt+j
                           i    = α + κr pdit + εt+k , where k is the horizon in years, r i is the log housing return (left panel) or log
stock return (right panel), and pdit is the log price-rent ratio (left panel) or price-dividend ratio on equity (right panel). The dividend
                                                  P
growth predictability specification is similar: k1 kj=1 ∆dit+j = α + κd pdit + εt+k , where ∆di is the log rental growth rate (left panel)
or log dividend growth rate on equity (right panel). Panel B reports the the coefficients, t-stats, and R2 of excess return predictability
                                                       P      i,e
regressions. The return regression specification is: k1 kj=1 rt+j = α + κr,e pdit + εt+k , where k is the horizon in years, r i,e is the log real
housing return in excess of a real short-term bond yield (left panel) or the log real stock return in excess of a real short-term bond yield
(right panel), and pdit is the log price-rent ratio (left panel) or price-dividend ratio on equity (right panel). In the model, we use the
return on physical capital for the real return on equity and the return on the one-year bond as the real bond yield. The model objects
are obtained from a 1750-year simulation, where the first 250 periods are discarded as burn-in. The model is the benchmark Model 1.
The housing return is the aggregate housing return defined in the main text. In the data, we use the CRSP value-weighted stock return,
annual data for 1953-2012. The housing return in the data is based on the annual Flow of Funds data for 1953-2012 (Data 1). We
subtract CPI inflation to obtain the real returns and real dividend or rental growth rates. The real bond yield is the 1-year Fama-Bliss
yield in excess of CPI inflation.

This table reports various measures of cross-sectional risk sharing: the cross-sectional standard deviation of the consumption share
 i
CT,a,t /CT,t , the cross-sectional standard deviation of the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution, and the Gini coefficients of
consumption, total wealth, housing wealth, and financial wealth. We simulate the model for N = 2400 households and for T = 1150
periods (the first 150 years are burn-in and discarded). The data are from the Survey of Consumer Finances for the sample of home
owners (positive housing wealth). All numbers are multiplied by 100.

The table reports the same moments as Table 2. Panel A repeats the benchmark results. Panel B considers an alternative economy
with a higher land share of 25% instead of 10%. Panel C contains results for a model where housing depreciation contains an additive
idiosyncratic component which is 0% or 5% with equal probability. Panel D contains results for a model with idiosyncratic unemployment
risk: the income state is 1.01895% with 95% probability and 0.74% with 5% probability.

The table reports the same moments as Table 5. Panel A repeats the benchmark results. Panel B features a model with a higher land share of 25% instead of 10%. Panel C
contains results for a model where housing depreciation contains an additive idiosyncratic component which is 0% or 5% with equal probability. Panel D contains results for a
model with idiosyncratic unemployment risk: the income state is 1.01895% with 95% probability and 0.74% with 5% probability.

The solid line plots the 30-year Fixed-Rate Mortgage rate (FRM); the dashed line plots the ten-year Constant Maturity Treasury Yield
(CMT). The FRM data are from Freddie Mac’s Primary Mortgage Market Survey. They are average contract rates on conventional
conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. The CMT yield data are from the St.-Louis Federal Reserve Bank (FRED II). The data are
monthly from January 1971 until December 2012.

                                   Figure A.2: Foreign Holdings of US Treasuries
Panel A plots foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries. The bars, measured against the left axis, plot foreign holdings of long-term U.S.
Treasury securities (T-notes, and T-bonds). It excludes (short-term) T-bills, measured in millions of nominal U.S. dollars. The solid
line, measured against the right axis, plots those same holdings as a percent of total marketable U.S. Treasuries. Marketable U.S.
Treasuries are available from the Office of Public Debt, and are measured as total marketable held by the public less T-bills. Panel B
plots foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury securities (T-bills, T-notes, and T-bonds) and the sum of U.S. treasuries and U.S. Agency debt
(e.g., debt issued by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae), relative to GDP. The first two series report only long-term debt holdings, while
the other two series add in short-term debt holdings. Since no short-term debt holdings are available before 2002, we assume that total
holdings grow at the same rate as long-term holdings before 2002. The foreign holdings data from the Treasury International Capital
System of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The foreign holdings data are available for December 1974, 1978, 1984, 1989, 1994,
1997, March 2000, and annually for June 2002 through June 2012. Nominal GDP is from the National Income and Product Accounts,

The table reports the same asset pricing moments as Table 5. Panel A repeats the benchmark results. Panel B features a model with a different Financial Market Liberalization.
Model 1 is identical to the benchmark. In Model 2 we not only increase the maximum loan-to-value ratio from 75% to 99%, but also lower the cost of borrowing, λ, from 5.5% of
the amount borrowed to 3.5%. Model 3 adds the benchmark foreign capital inflows to this new Model 2.

sequence of aggregate shocks as the simulation used to compute the original coefficients (in-sample) or with a new sequence of aggregate
shocks (out-of-sample). The R2 statistics are computed either one period ahead (k = 1), or using the full sample procedure described
