                                             ABSTRACT

Bayesian prior predictive analysis of five nested DSGE models suggests that model specifications
and prior distributions tightly circumscribe the range of possible government spending multipliers.
Multipliers are decomposed into wealth and substitution effects, yielding uniform comparisons across
models. By constraining the multiplier to tight ranges, model and prior selections bias results, revealing
less about fiscal effects in data than about the lenses through which researchers choose to interpret
data. When monetary policy actively targets inflation, output multipliers can exceed one, but investment
multipliers are likely to be negative. Passive monetary policy produces consistently strong multipliers
for output, consumption, and investment.

1 Introduction
Quantitative estimates of ﬁscal multipliers are the nub of the policy and academic debate about
the eﬃcacy of the ﬁscal stimulus packages implemented in response to the recent recession and
ﬁnancial crisis. Estimates vary widely. Government spending multipliers for output range from
−0.26 to well over 1.0 on impact and from below −1.0 to about 1.40 in the very long run [Davig
and Leeper (2011), Drautzburg and Uhlig (2011), Uhlig (2009, 2010)]. Ranges like these make it
diﬃcult for economists to formulate ﬁscal policy advice.
   One active area of research seeks to understand the economic mechanisms underlying the size
of multipliers for unproductive government spending. That work uncovers a long list of important
model features. Galı́, López-Salido, and Vallés (2007) and Forni, Monteforte, and Sessa (2009) point
to both the fraction of hand-to-mouth (liquidity-constrained or rule-of-thumb) consumers and the
degree of real rigidities. Monacelli and Perotti (2008) highlight wealth eﬀects and nominal rigidi-
ties. Bilbiie (2011) and Monacelli and Perotti (2008) suggest non-separability in preferences over
consumption and leisure. Leeper, Plante, and Traum (2010) and Uhlig (2010) emphasize distorting
ﬁscal ﬁnancing. And many studies show that monetary policy behavior matters [Kim (2003), Bil-
biie, Meier, and Müller (2008), Eggertsson (2009), Zubairy (2010), Christiano, Eichenbaum, and
Rebelo (2011), and Davig and Leeper (2011)].
      Two recent meta-studies illustrate the state of the ﬁscal multiplier literature. The meta-studies
employ suites of models that embed a variety of ﬁscal transmission mechanisms and confront sim-
ilar time series data, but draw strikingly diﬀerent conclusions. One study calculates government
spending multipliers for seven structural models and concludes that sizeable short-run output mul-

tipliers are a robust feature across models [Coenen, Erceg, Freedman, Furceri, Kumhof, Lalonde,
Laxton, Lindé, Mourougane, Muir, Mursula, de Resende, Roberts, Roeger, Snudden, Trabandt,
and in’t Veld (2010), hereafter referred to as IMF10/73]. A second study considers a set of models
with many of the same mechanisms as in IMF10/73, but concludes that impact multipliers are sub-
stantially below unity [Cogan, Cwik, Taylor, and Wieland (2010) and Cwik and Wieland (2011)].
Within the same class of models, Drautzburg and Uhlig (2011) estimate short-run multipliers of
one-half and long-run multipliers of about negative one-half.
      When closely-related economic models are ﬁt to similar data but yield very diﬀerent estimates
of multipliers, the literature has entered a morass. This paper aims to clear up the morass.
      To begin the clariﬁcation process, we examine ﬁscal multipliers from ﬁve nested models: (1)
a simple real business cycle (RBC) model; (2) the RBC model with real frictions added; (3) the
RBC model with nominal rigidities included (a basic new Keynesian model); (4) the new Keynesian
model with hand-to-mouth agents; and (5) the new Keynesian model extended to an open economy.
Our work, like the research cited above, limits attention to unproductive government spending.
      In all but the simplest versions of these models, the government spending multiplier is a com-
plicated object: an unknown non-linear function of all the model parameters. Bayesian prior
predictive analysis is a powerful tool to shed light on complicated objects of interest—like the
spending multiplier—that depend on both the joint prior distribution of parameters and the model
speciﬁcation.1
      We apply prior predictive analysis sequentially to the nested models to systematically isolate the
aspects of each model speciﬁcation that are important for determining the size of the government
spending multiplier. The analysis yields precise statements about how particular mechanisms
trigger wealth and substitution eﬀects that change the multiplier in models—like those in the
meta-studies—that are rich enough to be empirically relevant.
      Model features like wage rigidities, which can ﬂip the sign of the substitution eﬀect created by
higher government spending—from negative to positive—contribute to producing a large multiplier.
Analogously, the presence of rule-of-thumb consumers, who do not factor in the higher future
taxes associated with higher government spending, attenuate negative wealth eﬀects to increase
the multiplier. Although the models can produce output multipliers greater than one, it is diﬃcult
for any of the model speciﬁcations to produce very large multipliers.
      The bulk of our results, like most of the existing literature, conditions on a policy regime in
which monetary policy is actively targeting inﬂation and ﬁscal policy is passively adjusting surpluses
to stabilize government debt. Active monetary policy reacts to a persistent ﬁscal expansion and the
attendant increase in inﬂation by sharply raising the nominal policy interest rate. This raises the
real interest rate, which reduces consumption and investment demand to attenuate the stimulative
eﬀects of the ﬁscal expansion. It is not too surprising that in this monetary-ﬁscal regime, very large
ﬁscal multipliers are unlikely.
      Since the 2007–2009 recession, many central banks have shifted their emphasis from stabilizing

inﬂation to stimulating demand by maintaining low and constant policy interest rates—near zero
in some economies. When monetary policy makes the interest rate unresponsive to inﬂation, a
“passive” stance, it ampliﬁes ﬁscal policy’s impacts. By ﬁxing the interest rate, monetary policy
allows higher current and expected inﬂation to transmit into lower real interest rates. Instead of
attenuating the demand stimulus of a ﬁscal expansion, monetary policy ampliﬁes it: lower real
rates encourage greater consumption and investment demand. Lower real rates induce a positive
substitution eﬀect from higher government spending, substantially raising output, consumption,
and investment multipliers. In sharp contrast to the active monetary/passive ﬁscal regime, it is
very diﬃcult to obtain small spending multipliers from the mix of passive monetary/active ﬁscal
policy.
    Of course, DSGE models impose economic structure and, therefore, restrictions on data. But
when the model and the prior constrain the ﬁscal multiplier to exceptionally narrow ranges—
even before confronting data—then the studies bias results. Such studies reveal less about the
ﬁscal eﬀects that are embedded in time series data than they do about the lenses through which
researchers choose to interpret the data.


2 The Models
Our models share several details with the class of models used to evaluate the size of ﬁscal multi-
pliers: (1) forward-looking, optimizing agents; (2) households who receive utility from consumption
and leisure; (3) production sectors that use capital and labor inputs; (4) monopolistic competition
in the goods and labor sectors; (5) empirically relevant nominal and real frictions; (6) ﬁscal and
monetary authorities who set their instruments using simple feedback rules; and (7) the economy
is at its cashless limit.
    Our broadest model, an open economy new Keynesian model similar to Adolfson, Laseen, Lindé,
and Villani (2007), nests four models that are commonly used to study ﬁscal multipliers—a basic
Real Business Cycle (RBC) model, an RBC model with real frictions, a standard new Keynesian
(NK) model, and a NK model with nonsavers. We now describe the main model and the restrictions
that deliver the nested models.
    The world economy consists of two large countries, Home (H) and Foreign (F), with symmetric
preferences. Public and private consumption and investment consist of domestically produced and
imported goods. In the short run, the pass-through of the nominal exchange rate to export and
import prices is incomplete due to local currency pricing.

2.1 Households           The economy is populated by a continuum of households on the interval [0, 1],
of which a fraction μ are non-savers and a fraction 1 − μ are savers. The superscript S indicates a
variable associated with savers and N with non-savers.

2.1.1 Savers         An optimizing representative saver household j derives utility from consumption,
cSt (j),                                                                                          S
           relative to a habit stock deﬁned in terms of lagged aggregate consumption of savers (θCt−1
where θ ∈ [0, 1)), and derives disutility from hours worked, ltS (j):

where β is the discount rate, γ is the household’s risk aversion, and ξ is the inverse of the Frisch
labor elasticity. Savers receive interest income from domestic and international one-period risk free
nominal bond holdings, after tax wage income, after tax rental income from capital, lump sum
transfers from the government Z S , and proﬁts from ﬁrms D. Savers spend income on consumption,
investment in future capital iS , and the domestic and international bonds, B S and F S respectively.

Nominal consumption, P C C, is subject to a sales tax τ C . P I denotes the price of investment goods,
which potentially diﬀers from consumption goods as they may consist of diﬀerent bundles of traded

2.1.2 Wage Setting and Labor Aggregation                                    Households supply diﬀerentiated labor ser-
vices to the intermediate goods producing ﬁrms. Each diﬀerentiated labor service is supplied by
both savers and non-savers, and demand is uniformly allocated among households. A perfectly
competitive labor packer purchases the diﬀerentiated labor inputs and assembles them to produce
a composite labor service, Lt , according to

                                                       1                          1+ηw

where η w is the wage markup. The competitive labor packer’s demand function comes from solving
its proﬁt maximization problem subject to (1), to yield

                                                                            − 1+ηww

where Ldt is the demand for composite labor services, and Wt is the aggregate nominal wage.
      Substantial variation in modeling wage-setting decisions exists in the literature.2 We follow the
approach of assuming savers optimally set their wage while non-savers simply set their wage to
be the average wage of the savers [examples include Erceg, Guerrieri, and Gust (2006) and Forni,
Monteforte, and Sessa (2009)]. Since non-savers face the same labor demand schedule as savers,
they work the same number of hours as the average for savers.
      Every period, saver households receive signals to reset their nominal wages for each diﬀerentiated
labor service with probability (1 − ωw ). Those who cannot reoptimize partially index their wages to

past inﬂation according to the rule, Wt (l) = Wt−1 (l) πt−1 , where χw ∈ [0, 1] measures the degree
of backward indexation. Savers that receive the signal choose the nominal wage rate Wt (l) to
maximize their utility. Finally, the nominal aggregate wage evolves according to

2.1.3 Non-savers          Non-savers have the same preferences as savers. Non-savers are rule-of-
thumb agents who each period must consume their entire disposable income, which consists of after
tax labor income and lump-sum transfers from the government Z N . The budget constraint for a
non-saver j ∈ (μ, 1] is

                                          t (j) = (1 − τt )Wt Lt (j) + Pt Zt (j)

Non-savers nominal consumption P C C N is subject to the same tax rate as savers, τ C . Non-savers
nominal wage income, Wt LN                                                  l
                         t also is subject to the same tax rate as savers, τ . Since non-savers
work the same number of hours as the average for savers, and nominal wages are determined by
savers, non-savers consumption is determined by the budget constraint (4).

2.2 Firms and Price Setting

2.2.1 Intermediate Goods Firms                     Each country consists of a continuum of monopolistically
competitive intermediate goods ﬁrms (indexed by i ∈ [0, 1]). These ﬁrms charge diﬀerent prices at
home and abroad, as in Betts and Devereux (1996). In the home market, the demand for ﬁrm i’s
output ytH (i) is given by
                                                                              − 1+ηp

                                                                      t (i)
                                                                                  ηp
                                             ytH (i)   =   YtH                                                        (5)

               t (i) is the output price in the home market charged by ﬁrm i, Yt is aggregate
domestic demand, and PtH is the aggregate domestic price index. Likewise, in the foreign market,
the demand for ﬁrm i’s output is

                                            mt (i) = Mt∗                                                              (6)
                                                                  PtH∗

where mt (i) denotes the foreign quantity demanded of home good i, pH∗t (i) is the price that ﬁrm
i charges in the foreign market, Pt is the foreign import price index, and Mt∗ denotes aggregate
                                   H∗

foreign imports.
   Each individual ﬁrm i produces with a Cobb-Douglas technology, yt (i) = At kt (i)α lt (i)1−α ,
where α ∈ [0, 1]. There are no ﬁxed costs of production, as in Del Negro, Schorfheide, Smets,
and Wouters (2004). Firms face perfectly competitive factor markets for capital and labor. Cost
minimization implies that the ﬁrms have identical nominal marginal costs per unit of output, given
by M Ct = (1 − α)α−1 α−α (Rtk )α Wt1−α A−1
                                        t .
   Home and foreign prices evolve by a Calvo (1983) mechanism. An intermediate ﬁrm has a
probability of (1 − ωp ) each period to reoptimize its price at home and a probability of (1 − ωp,x )
each period to reoptimize its price abroad. Firms that cannot reoptimize partially index their prices
to past inﬂation according to the rules

2.2.2 Final Goods Firms                                 Three distinct types of ﬁnal-good ﬁrms combine the domestically
produced and imported intermediate goods to produce the three ﬁnal non-tradable goods: a private
consumption good, a private investment good, and a public consumption good.
      The ﬁnal private consumption good QC
                                         t is produced by combining a bundle of domestically-
produced intermediate goods CtH with a bundle of imported foreign intermediate goods, CtF via
the technology

where μC > 0 is the elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods, νC ∈ [0, 1] determines
the relative preference a country has for domestic and foreign goods. Home and foreign intermediate
goods bundles combine diﬀerentiated output from each domestic ﬁrm i and foreign ﬁrm i∗ via

where ηp , ηp,x > 0 are related to the intratemporal elasticities of substitution between the diﬀeren-
tiated outputs supplied by the home and foreign intermediate ﬁrms. The consumption ﬁnal good
ﬁrm ﬁrst chooses optimal amounts of each diﬀerentiated output from ﬁrms i and i∗ via cost min-
imization, and then chooses the optimal bundles to maximize proﬁts. Similarly, the ﬁnal private
investment good QIt and the public consumption good QG      t are produced via the technologies

2.3 Monetary Policy                           The monetary authority follows a Taylor-type rule, in which the domes-
tic nominal interest rate Rt responds to its lagged value, the current consumption inﬂation rate,
and current output. We denote a variable in percentage deviations from steady state by a hat. The

2.4 Fiscal Policy           Each period the government collects tax revenues from capital, labor, and
consumption taxes, and issues one-period nominal bonds, Bt , to ﬁnance its interest payments and
expenditures, Gt , ZtS , ZtN . The nominal ﬂow government budget constraint is

           Bt + τtK RtK vt Kt−1 + τtL Wt Lt + PtC τtC Ct = Rt−1 Bt−1 + PtG Gt + PtC (ZtS + ZtN )                 (13)

    Fiscal rules are simple. They include a response of ﬁscal instruments to the debt-GDP ratio—
to ensure that policies are sustainable—and an autoregressive term to allow for serial correlation.
Fiscal instruments evolve according to the following rules:

2.6 Nested Models            The open-economy model is suﬃciently rich to nest a wide range of models
that are commonly used to examine the size of the ﬁscal multiplier. Table 1 lists the speciﬁc
parameter restrictions that deliver each of the ﬁve nested models. Model 1 eliminates all real and
nominal frictions to reduce to a standard RBC closed-economy model. Model 2 allows for real
frictions (investment adjustment costs, habit formation, and capacity utilization) but eliminates
the nominal frictions and the open economy aspects. Model 3 is a standard NK model with sticky
prices and wages, which introduces a role for monetary-ﬁscal policy interactions. Model 4 adds
non-savers to the standard NK model. And model 5 allows for an open-economy structure.3
   3
     We restrict the open-economy model in the text so that the economy does not have access to international ﬁnancial
markets and government spending is completely home-biased. Ours is the open-economy version of the model that
delivers the largest output multipliers. Results from alternative setups with fewer model restrictions appear in the

3 Prior Predictive Analysis
While simple DSGE models that permit analytical calculations of the multiplier are important for
building economic intuition (e.g., Woodford (2011), Uhlig (2010)), they cannot be taken to data in
a serious way. Conversely, models that include real and nominal frictions have been shown to ﬁt
data well but are suﬃciently complicated that clean analytics are not available. We echo Geweke
(2010) and Faust and Gupta (2010) in arguing for the use of prior predictive analysis to shed light
on the black-box nature of empirically validated DSGE models. Prior predictive analysis pinpoints
precisely which elements of the model are most important in determining the ﬁscal multiplier
and it delivers the possible range of the multiplier conditional on a speciﬁc model. Most of the
DSGE models that have played a role in the ﬁscal policy debate impose a tight range on the ﬁscal
multiplier, as section 4 shows.
   Before describing the prior predictive methodology, we establish some notation. Using the
notation and language of Geweke (2010), a complete model contains four elements:

 i. A probability density of observables conditional on unobservables p(yT |θAj , Aj ) where j =
    1, ..., n denotes the number of models under consideration, Aj denotes model j, yT denotes
    the vector of random ex ante observable, and θAj are the unobservables. Evaluating this den-
    sity at the ex post realized observables (i.e., data) yields the likelihood function L(θAj ; yTo ) =
    p(yTo |θAj , Aj ). For our purposes, this density is given by the log-linearized DSGE model de-
    scribed in section 2 and the nested models listed in table 1. The vector θAj denotes the
    parameters of the various DSGE models.

 ii. A prior density function p(θA,j |Aj ), which speciﬁes the range of values and the probabilities
    the unobserved parameters take those values. Calibration, which is well known in the macroe-
    conomics literature, is an example of a degenerate or dogmatic prior density.

iii. A vector of interest, ω, and its corresponding distribution p(ωT |yT , θA,j , Aj ). Our vector of
    interest is the ﬁscal multiplier, which we deﬁne formally below. As the conditional distribution
    makes explicit, the ﬁscal multiplier will depend on the choice of model (Aj ), observables (yT ),
    and unobservable parameters (θA,j ).

iv. A Bayes action or decision, dˆT = argmaxdT E[U (ωT , dT |yTo , Aj )], which determines the optimal
       action and can be cast into the expected utility framework of von Neumann and Morgenstern.

    The four model elements are straightforwardly related. The ﬁrst two elements yield the posterior
distribution p(θA,j |yto , Aj ) = p(θA,j |Aj )p(yTo |θAj , Aj )/p(yTo ), which is then used to obtain the poste-
                                                                   
rior of the vector of interest according to p(ωT |yTo , Aj ) = ΘA,j p(ωT |yTo , θA,j , Aj ) p(θA,j |yTo , Aj )dθA,j .
This distribution is then used to calculate the conditional expectation associated with the Bayes
action, dˆT .
    In the context of ﬁscal multipliers, a Bayes decision might be whether or not to implement
expansionary ﬁscal policy. Debate surrounding the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act was
couched in terms of ﬁscal multipliers. Romer and Bernstein (2009) argued that sizeable multipliers
favor a large stimulus. Conditioning on similar data, Cogan, Cwik, Taylor, and Wieland (2010)
took the opposite view, citing a much smaller multiplier. This paper takes a step back: we ﬁx the
vector of interest to focus exclusively on multipliers but we do not formulate/evaluate a decision
rule. We focus on the importance of steps [i] and [ii] of the model building process, and advocate
using a prior predictive analysis to illuminate how these initial steps may inﬂuence the vector of
interest and, ultimately, the Bayes action that is being considered.
    Elements [i] and [ii] of a complete model imply an ex-ante predictive distribution for the ob-
servables

                                p(yT |Aj ) =             p(θA,j |Aj )p(yT |θA,j Aj )dθA,j                          (14)
                                                   ΘAj


This distribution gives the prior distribution of observables before data is collected. Computation-
ally, it is straightforward and nearly costless to simulate from (14). The algorithm draws from
 (m)                         (m)             (m)
θAj ∼ p(θA,j |Aj ), and yT         ∼ p(yT |θAj , Aj ). Drawing sequentially from these distributions deliv-
ers (14) and any function of yT including the vector of interest, ω (m) . We use the model speciﬁcation
and a prior distribution to obtain the range of values of the ﬁscal multiplier that the DSGE models
deliver. Because prior predictive analysis gives the entire range of possible multipliers produced by
the model and prior, we can evaluate the model before taking it to data. In the limiting case of
totally uninformative data, the prior predictive becomes the posterior distribution.
    In all model speciﬁcations we ﬁx a few parameters whose values are standard in the literature.
The discount factor, β, is set to 0.99 to imply an annual steady-state real interest rate of 4 percent.
The capital income share of total output, α, is set to 0.36, implying a labor income share of 0.64.
The quarterly depreciation rate for private capital, δ, is set to 0.025 so that the annual depreciation
rate is 10 percent. The steady-state inﬂation rate, π, is 1.
    Steady-state ﬁscal variables are calibrated to the values in Traum and Yang (2010), which are
mean values from U.S. data over the period 1983Q1-2008Q1.4 The federal government consumption
   4
     We also adopted priors for these steady-state values and repeated the prior predictive analysis while allowing the
ﬁscal steady-state values to vary. Results in the appendix show that short-run ﬁscal multipliers are largely insensitive
to variations in steady-state ﬁscal parameters, but long-run multipliers are more sensitive.

to output share is 0.074, the federal debt to annualized output share is 0.386, the average marginal
federal labor tax rate is 0.209, the capital tax rate is 0.196, and ﬁnally, the consumption tax rate
is 0.015.
    Table 2 lists the priors used in our analysis and ﬁgure 1 plots the prior distributions for each
parameter. The priors were chosen to cover the range of parameter values considered in the cal-
ibrated exercises of IMF10/73 and Cwik and Wieland (2011). In addition, our priors are similar
to those employed for Bayesian estimation of similar models [examples include Coenen and Straub
(2004), Forni, Monteforte, and Sessa (2009), Lopez-Salido and Rabanal (2006), Leeper, Plante, and
Traum (2010), and Traum and Yang (2010)].
    Parameters related to openness are less common in the literature. The prior means of the
substitution elasticity between foreign and domestic private consumption, investment, and govern-
ment spending goods are set to 1.5, as in Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2002) and IMF10/73. The
standard deviations are set so that the priors reﬂect a range of values from calibration and estima-
tion exercises. The prior means for the share of imports in private consumption, investment, and
government spending bundles are set to 0.25. Although the risk premium parameter γf is typically
calibrated or a priori considered to be very low, posterior estimates in Adolfson, Laseen, Lindé,
and Villani (2007) range from 0.1 to above 0.4. Given the uncertainty around this parameter, we
adopt a uniform prior on the interval 0.0001 to 0.4.
    In new Keynesian versions of our model that incorporate both monetary and ﬁscal policies, two
distinct regions of the parameter subspace deliver unique bounded rational expectations equilibria—
an active monetary, passive ﬁscal policy (AM/PF) regime or a passive monetary, active ﬁscal
(PM/AF) policy regime.5 Policy parameter priors in the benchmark speciﬁcation are chosen to
impose the AM/PF regime: the monetary authority raises the interest rate more than one-for-one
with inﬂation to oﬀset inﬂation deviations from target; the ﬁscal authority adjusts expenditures and
tax rates to stabilize debt. The priors do assign a small, non-zero density outside the determinacy
region of the parameter space. However, we restrict the parameter space to the subspace in which
the log-linearized model has a unique bounded rational expectations solution by discarding draws
from the indeterminacy region.
   Section 5.2 reports robustness checks in which the distributions of table 2 are replaced with
uniform distributions. Section 6 studies how multipliers change when policies reside in the PM/AF
regime. We take 5,000 draws from our priors and calculate the resulting government spending
multipliers from the prior distributions.

   5
     An active authority is deﬁned as an authority who is not constrained by current budgetary conditions and freely
chooses the decision rule it wants. A passive authority is constrained by the consumers’ and ﬁrms’ optimizations and
by the actions of the active authority. Thus, the passive authority must guarantee that current budgetary conditions
are satisﬁed and, in particular, that the intertemporal government budget constraint holds. See Leeper (1991), Sims
(1994), Cochrane (1998), and Woodford (2003) for more discussion.

4 Fiscal Policy Multipliers
Present-value multipliers, which embody the full dynamics associated with exogenous ﬁscal actions
and properly discount future macroeconomic eﬀects, constitute our vector of interest. The present
value of additional output over a k-period horizon produced by an exogenous change in the present
value of government spending is

At k = 0 the present-value multiplier equals the impact multiplier. To compare multipliers across
models, we focus on prior predictive p-values. P -values are the probability of observing a multiplier
ω(θ) greater than a particular value in repeated sampling from the model and prior. Table 3
compares multiplier p-values at various horizons across the ﬁve model speciﬁcations.6 The top
panel of table 3 reports the probability that present-value multipliers for output exceed unity at
various horizons. Middle and lower panels report the probabilities that multipliers for consumption
and investment, respectively, are positive at various horizons. These particular probabilities address
the key issues in the multiplier debate.
      Although p-values allow easy comparisons across models, they do not summarize the entire prior
  6
      We approximate the inﬁnite horizon by calculating the present value multipliers over 200 quarters.


                                                                                 13

distribution. Figure 2 reveals the prior distribution through the median and 90-percent intervals
for present-value government spending multipliers for output and consumption at various horizons
for models 2, 3, and 4. Consumption multipliers are also decomposed into dynamic Hicksian wealth
and substitution eﬀects, following King (1991) and Baxter (1995).

4.1 Hicksian Decomposition                 To calculate the dynamic Hicksian wealth and substitution ef-
fects, we ﬁrst calculate the discounted lifetime utility associated with the initial steady-state allo-
cations (barred variables):7

                                              1  (C̄ − θ C̄)1−γ   L̄1+ξ
                                      Ū =                      −
                                             1−β     1−γ          1+ξ

Let the paths of consumption and labor following a one-percent government spending increase be
denoted by {Ĉt , L̂t }∞                                               k   k     C      c      I      ∞
                       t=0 with associated prices {(1 − τt )wt , (1 − τt )Rt , Pt (1 + τt ), Pt , Rt }t=0 and
                                                         l

deﬁne U total as the present discounted utility associated with this path, approximated as

                             1  t  1−γ                                                      
                                 ∞
                 U total =          β C̄ (1 − θ)−γ Ĉt − θ C̄ 1−γ (1 − θ)−γ Ĉt−1 − L̄1+ξ L̂t
                             Ū t=0

We then compute the wealth eﬀect as the constant values of consumption and labor such that, at
the initial steady-state prices, present discounted utility equals U total ; that is, the constant values
of consumption and labor that satisfy8

                                         1                                                   
                      U total =                  C̄ 1−γ (1 − θ)1−γ Ĉ wealth − L̄1+ξ L̂wealth                      (15)

                             0 = ξ L̂wealth − γ Ĉ wealth

The consumption substitution eﬀect is then Ĉtsub = Ĉt − Ĉ wealth . The substitution eﬀect cap-
tures the total value of consumption associated with the prices {(1 − τtl )wt , (1 − τtk )Rtk , PtC (1 +
τtc ), PtI , Rt }∞

    For models with two agents, we calculate the lifetime utility for each agent.
   8
    For models with sticky wages, we solve a similar set of equations for savers. In this case, we ﬁnd the constant
levels of consumption and wages that satisfy the present value utility constraint, at steady-state labor, and the savers’
ﬁrst-order condition for real wages.

4.2 Results          We start by examining the basic real business cycle model with ﬂexible prices and
complete asset markets (model 1 in table 3). This model is similar to Baxter and King (1993)
and Monacelli and Perotti (2008), with the addition of distortionary ﬁscal ﬁnancing, as in Leeper,
Plante, and Traum (2010). It is impossible for this model to generate output multipliers greater
than one or to produce positive consumption multipliers at any horizon. An unexpected increase in
government expenditures creates a negative wealth eﬀect, as taxes are expected to increase in the
future to ﬁnance the new spending. Agents decrease consumption and work more. These wealth
eﬀects are reinforced by negative substitution eﬀects. Real wages decrease with the increase in
work eﬀorts and the rental cost of capital increases with the rising marginal product of capital.
Consumption and investment are very likely to decrease. These declines in private demand oﬀset
most of the increased public demand, causing output to increase by less than the increase in
government consumption.

stems from a subset of very high draws for ρG , the serial correlation of government spending. As
ρG approaches one, agents view an exogenous change in government spending as approximately
permanent. Permanent increases in government consumption encourage households to save more,
raising investment, a pattern that is robust across model speciﬁcations. In the absence of large
value of ρG , investment would never rise across models.
       Model 2 introduces real frictions (habit formation, investment adjustment costs, and capacity
utilization), which substantially aﬀect the short- and long-run multipliers [solid lines in ﬁgure 2].
Now the possible range of multipliers is much larger, especially on the downside. Intuitively, after
government spending rises temporarily, agents are less willing to decrease consumption quickly with
habit formation because changes in consumption are costly and consumption must return to its
steady-state value in the long-run. This implies a more negative consumption multiplier on impact.
       Similarly, investment adjustment costs and capacity utilization costs deter large swings in in-
vestment, decreasing the negative investment multipliers.9 Although the multipliers change quan-
titatively relative to model 1, the policy implications from the two models are virtually the same,
as the probabilities reported in table 3 are unaltered.
       Model 3 introduces sticky prices and sticky wages, which increase multipliers at all horizons,
as Woodford (2011) shows analytically. Greater price stickiness means that more ﬁrms respond
to higher government spending by increasing production rather than prices, so markups respond
more strongly. In the long run, the 90-percent interval for present value output multipliers includes
positive values [dashed lines of panel 1 of ﬁgure 2]. RBC models cannot produce these positive long-
run multipliers; nominal rigidities, as in new Keynesian-style models, are necessary for spending
increases to persistently raise output.
       Wage rigidities have a strong eﬀect on consumption multipliers. Sticky wages can reverse the
sign of the substitution eﬀect on consumption [compare dashed to solid lines in ﬁgure 2]. Positive
substitution eﬀects can arise because real wages may increase to oﬀset other price eﬀects that
generate negative substitution eﬀects.
       Non-savers (model 4) raise ﬁscal multipliers substantially. The fraction of non-savers is the
most inﬂuential parameter for the output multiplier, as variations in this parameter are necessary
to get median impact output multipliers greater than one (the dotted-dashed lines of panel 1 of
ﬁgure 2). Unlike savers, non-savers ignore the wealth eﬀects of future taxes, so they increase their
consumption when government consumption rises. Non-savers consume their entire income each
period and do not take into account the negative wealth eﬀects that savers consider, reducing the
negative wealth eﬀect on consumption [panel 3]. If wages are sticky, so that real wages increase
on impact, then non-saver consumption increases as well. With enough non-savers in the economy,
the increase in non-saver consumption can be large enough to cause total consumption to increase
on impact (the dotted-dashed lines of panel 2 of ﬁgure 2), leading to larger output multipliers as
well.
   9
    See Monacelli and Perotti (2008) for a more detailed examination of the eﬀect of habit formation and investment
adjustment costs on multipliers in a simple RBC model.

       The open-economy framework (model 5), reduces the probabilities both of output multipliers
being greater than one and of positive consumption multipliers. In the open economy, increases
in government expenditures induce substitution away from domestically-produced goods towards
imported goods. Higher demand raises production costs, increasing prices of domestic goods and
of domestic goods in the foreign market. Domestic households, in turn, reduce their demand for
domestic production and increase demand for imports. Foreigners also reduce their demand for
domestic exports. This import-substitution eﬀect makes output multipliers smaller on average than
they are in the closed economy.
       Model 5 imposes ﬁnancial autarky, which tends to raise short-run multipliers in an open econ-
omy. Because trade in goods must be balanced each period, the import substitution eﬀect is
smaller, with nominal imports constrained to equal exports. Multipliers are smaller with interna-
tional ﬁnancial integration. Financial integration allows the domestic economy to run trade deﬁcits
and consume more imports, causing output to decrease more in the short run. Multipliers also are
smaller when government spending is a traded good, as part of the increase in government spending
goes directly to the foreign country.10 Impact consumption multipliers decrease by half in an open
economy with a traded government spending good, as compared to the closed-economy setting.
These results help explain some of the diﬀerences in multipliers between IMF10/73 and Cwik and
Wieland (2011), as the open-economy models in those meta-studies make diﬀerent assumptions
about the nature of openness.

4.3 Summary             Looking across the speciﬁcations, a few observations emerge. First, real and
nominal frictions, non-savers, and open economy considerations quantitatively alter multipliers.
Nominal rigidities and non-savers are critical to generate positive long-run output multipliers.
Although the broadest model can produce output multipliers greater than one, it is diﬃcult for
that model to produce substantially large multipliers. A closed economy with non-savers produces
the largest impact output multipliers, with a 90-percent interval from 0.84 to 1.75. This suggests
that it is hard, even for this model, to generate multipliers greater than 2.


5 Digging Deeper
We now turn to more detailed analyses. This section isolates the contributions of individual pa-
rameters to multipliers and examines the inﬂuence of priors.

5.1 Individual Parameter Contributions                          So far the analysis has largely ignored the eﬀect
a particular parameter has on present-value multipliers. To determine how much individual param-
eters aﬀect the multipliers, we calculate a measure of root mean square deviation (RMSD) for each
parameter. For each draw of parameters, θ̃ = [θ̃1 ... θ̃n ] from p(θ), we calculate multipliers ω̃(θ̃).
Redeﬁne the parameter vector when the ith parameter is ﬁxed at its prior mean, E[θi ]. Denote that
vector by θ̃ i = [θ̃1 ... E[θi ] ... θ̃n ] and calculate the multipliers, ω̃ i (θ̃ i ). Repeat this for each
  10
       Results for these cases are reported in the appendix.


                                                           18
                      Leeper, Traum & Walker: Fiscal Multiplier Morass


i = 1, 2, . . . n. The RMSD is the root mean square deviation between the two multipliers ω̃(θ̃) and
ω̃ i (θ̃ i ): it measures how much the multiplier varies on average due to parameter i. The RMSD is
largest for the parameters that are most inﬂuential for the multiplier. Tables 4 and 5 report the
fraction of total RMSDs of multipliers attributable to each parameter in the open economy new
Keynesian model (model 5) at various horizons.
    The fraction of non-savers, μ, is the most inﬂuential parameter on the output and consumption
impact multipliers. Non-savers consume their entire income each period and do not take into
account the negative wealth eﬀects that savers consider. If real wages increase on impact, then
non-saver consumption and, therefore, output increase as well.11 This fraction accounts for 19
percent of the output multiplier (table 4) and 28 percent of the consumption multiplier (table 5)
on impact. The fraction of non-savers is not particularly important for long-run multipliers.
    Persistence of the government spending process, governed by ρG , is the second most important
parameter for impact multipliers. The greater the persistence, the larger are the negative wealth
eﬀects because larger increases in taxes are required to ﬁnance the increase in the government
spending process. Persistence accounts for 19 and 16 percent of the output and consumption
multipliers on impact. The inﬂuence of ρG grows over time to explain about 30 percent of multipliers
in the long run.
    Habit formation, θ, and capacity utilization cost, ψ, parameters are also important for impact
multipliers. As habit formation increases, households value consumption smoothing more, which
dampens the variation in consumption (and thus output) over time. Capacity utilization costs
matter for output multipliers, as our measure of output depends directly on the utilization rate.
    Impact multipliers are increasing with risk aversion γ, as Monacelli and Perotti (2008) note.
Higher risk aversion (or smaller intertemporal elasticity of substitution), makes households less
willing to postpone consumption into the future. This decreases the variation of consumption
and output following government spending changes. Consumption multipliers are substantially
inﬂuenced by the risk aversion parameter in the short and long runs [table 5].
    Monetary policy also inﬂuences multipliers. As Woodford (2011) and IMF10/73 note, the more
accommodative monetary policy is, the larger the multipliers are. Multipliers are decreasing in
φπ and φy and increasing in ρr . Variation in ρr is particularly important, accounting for about
10 percent of impact multipliers. Changes in ρr directly aﬀect the persistence of real interest
rates following a government spending expansion. Real rates, in turn, have important impacts on
present-value calculations.

5.2 Influence of Priors                Our priors are informative and inﬂuence the distribution of mul-
tipliers implied by the model speciﬁcations. To show the sensitivity of multipliers to the priors,
we calculate multipliers conditional on diﬀuse, uniform priors [table 6]. Table 7 reports multiplier
p-values at various horizons for the model speciﬁcations when the uniform priors are employed.
   11
      As noted in Galı́, López-Salido, and Vallés (2007), non-savers are vital for multipliers when coupled with nominal
wage rigidities. The appendix details how non-savers have no substantial impact on multipliers when the labor market
is perfectly competitive.

   Uniform priors increase the probability of parameter draws from a larger region of the parameter
space. This, in turn, allows a larger range of multipliers and increases the probabilities of output
multipliers greater than one and of positive consumption and investment multipliers. Comparing
the probabilities under the two sets of prior distributions reveals that the prior speciﬁcation is most
informative about multipliers over longer horizons. However, model speciﬁcations often still imply
tight multiplier ranges, and the general conclusions reported above still hold. It remains diﬃcult
to generate positive investment multipliers over any horizon. In addition, nominal rigidities and
non-savers remain critical to achieving positive long-run output multipliers.


6 Alternative Fiscal-Monetary Regimes
All the work reported above maintains the assumption that monetary policy actively targets inﬂa-
tion. Prior distributions place either minuscule (table 2) or zero (table 6) probability on monetary
policy responding less than one-for-one to inﬂation (φπ < 1). With central banks operating at
or near the zero lower bound for nominal interest rates in recent years, it is useful to compute
ﬁscal multipliers in a regime with passive monetary policy and active ﬁscal policy. Christiano,
Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2011) and Davig and Leeper (2011) both ﬁnd that this alternative policy
regime can produce substantially larger government spending multipliers.
   To explore how the multipliers depend on the ﬁscal-monetary speciﬁcation, we calculate mul-
tipliers conditional on model 5 (the open economy new Keynesian model) in a passive monetary
and active ﬁscal (PM/AF) policy regime. In this speciﬁcation, the monetary authority raises the
interest rate less than one-for-one with inﬂation deviations from target, and the ﬁscal authority
does not adjust ﬁscal instruments suﬃciently to stabilize debt. To ensure this, we modify our priors
by assuming φπ has a uniform distribution on the unit interval, and γg , γk , γl , γzs , and γzn have
normal distributions with zero means and standard deviations of 0.03. As above, we ensure that
each parameter draw delivers a unique bounded rational expectations equilibrium.
   Table 8 reports multiplier p-values at various horizons conditional on the PM/AF regime. The
multiplier probabilities change drastically: it is impossible in the short run for output multipliers to
be less than one and for consumption multipliers to be negative [non-uniform prior lines in the table].
In addition, the probability of positive investment multipliers is substantial at all horizons. Figure
3 compares multipliers in the open economy model for the benchmark active monetary/passive
ﬁscal, AM/PF, (dotted lines) and the alternative PM/AF (solid lines) regimes.
   A persistent increase in government consumption raises current and future demand, as well as
current and expected inﬂation. Under passive monetary policy, the monetary authority responds to
the increase in inﬂation less than one-for-one, which allows the real interest rate to fall. Declining
real interest rates lower the return to saving, encouraging households to increase consumption and
leading to positive substitution eﬀects. Higher private demand, coupled with a lower rental cost of
capital, encourages ﬁrms to demand more capital and investment rises on impact in most cases.
   A uniform prior on all the parameters somewhat attenuates these large government spending
impacts. Although output multipliers are still likely to exceed unity and consumption multipliers

remain likely to be positive, there is now substantial probability mass on negative investment
multipliers [uniform prior lines in table].
   The results highlight the importance of ﬁscal-monetary interactions for policy conclusions. Al-
though the results diﬀer substantially from the benchmark policy regime speciﬁcation, it is impor-
tant to note that the PM/AF speciﬁcation also imposes a tight multiplier range. But in this case,
it is a tight range of large multipliers.


7 Conclusion
This paper has shown, through prior predictive analysis, that many model speciﬁcations impose a
very tight range for the multiplier even before the models are taken to data. Although multipliers
vary substantially across various monetary-ﬁscal policy speciﬁcations, conditional on a particular
policy regime, a model still imposes a tight range for multipliers. The results raise a warning ﬂag
for policymakers who base decisions on the ﬁscal multipliers from particular calibrated or estimated
models. The tight multiplier ranges that models and priors impose before conditioning on data
biases results and may shed little light on the size of multipliers in time series data.

                   Appendix for On-Line Publication
   This appendix gives details on the log-linear approximation of the model, additional details
on the calculations of the Hicksian decompositions, and some additional results not included in
the main text. In particular, the additional results include: 1) ranges of present value multipliers
from the non-uniform prior analysis under various model speciﬁcations, 2) ranges of present value
multipliers from the uniform prior analysis under various model speciﬁcations, 3) ranges of present
value multipliers from additional model speciﬁcations under the passive monetary, active ﬁscal
policy regime, 4) model comparison analysis, and 5) ranges of present value multipliers based on an
alternative ordering of the models presented in the main text. This appendix is not self-contained
and assumes the reader is familiar with the contents of the main text.

addition, we assume that π C = 1, implying R = 1/β and s = 1. We normalize the relative home
and foreign import price and set pF = pH∗ = 1. This implies that all other relative prices are equal
to one as well.

B.2 Two Household Models                   To calculate the dynamic Hicksian wealth and substitution
eﬀects when both savers and non-savers are present in the model, we ﬁrst calculate the wealth and
substitution eﬀects for savers as outlined above. Since non-savers do not have a wage rate or labor-
leisure decision,13 their consumption simply moves one-for-one with changes in their disposable
income. As such, any change in consumption is due entirely to per-period income (wealth) eﬀects,
so that ĈtN = (CtN )wealth and (CtN )sub = 0.
       Total consumption wealth and substitution eﬀects then are calculated as

                                               C̄ S S wealth      C̄ N N wealth
                          Ctwealth = (1 − μ)       (Ct )     +μ       (Ct )

                                               C̄ S S sub     C̄ N N sub
                             Ctsub   = (1 − μ)     (Ct ) + μ       (Ct )

C Additional Results
C.1 Various Model Multipliers                 Tables 9, 10, and 11 list the median and 95% intervals for
present value output, consumption, and investment multipliers, respectively, generated using the
non-uniform priors (Refer to table 2 in the main text for the prior distributions). Several additional
model speciﬁcations are considered in addition to the ﬁve models in the main text. Details of each
model speciﬁcation are listed below.

       • RBC Lump-Sum Finance: basic real business cycle model with ﬂexible prices, as in Baxter
         and King (1993).

       • RBC Labor Tax Finance: basic real business cycle model with ﬂexible prices and distortionary
         labor taxes adjusting to ﬁnance debt, similar to ?.

       • RBC Distortionary Finance: Model 1 in the main text. Basic real business cycle model with
         ﬂexible prices and government spending, lump-sum transfers, distortionary labor and capital
         taxes all adjusting to ﬁnance debt, similar to Leeper, Plante, and Traum (2010).

       • RBC   B
               Y   Varies: Same speciﬁcation as RBC Distortionary Finance, additionally allowing a
         prior on the value for the steady state debt to gdp ratio.
  13
    We assume non-savers simply set their wage to be the average wage of the savers. Since non-savers face the same
labor demand schedule as savers, they work the same number of hours as the average for savers.

      • RBC Fiscal Steady State Varies: Same speciﬁcation as RBC Distortionary Finance, addition-
        ally allowing priors on all steady state ﬁscal values.

      • RBC Real Frictions: Model 2 in the main text. Introduces real frictions (habit formation,
        investment adjustment costs, and capacity utilization) to the RBC Distortionary Finance
        model.

      • NK Sticky Price: basic New Keynesian model with sticky prices and ﬂexible wages.

      • NK Sticky Price & Wage: Model 3 in the main text. New Keynesian model with sticky prices
        and sticky wages.

      • NK Nonsavers: Model 4 in the main text. Introduces non-savers to the NK Sticky Price &
        Wage model.

      • Open NK Fin. Autarky: G NonTraded: Model 5 in the main text. Introduces open economy
        features by considering a two-country world economy and allowing consumption and invest-
        ment to consist of domestic and imported goods. Under ﬁnancial autarky, there is no trade
        in assets, and the home and foreign countries experiences balanced trade each period.

      • Open NK Fin. Autarky: G Traded: Allows government spending to consist of both domestic
        and imported goods in the ﬁnancial autarky version of the open economy model.

      • Open NK Fin. Integration: G NonTraded: Introduces open economy features by considering
        a two-country world economy and allowing consumption and investment to consist of domestic
        and imported goods. With ﬁnancial integration, we allow the home country to borrow/lend
        internationally with a risk-free bond, and subject the home country to a risk premium that
        depends on the net foreign asset position.

      • Open NK Fin. Integration: G Traded: Allows government spending to consist of both
        domestic and imported goods in the ﬁnancial integration version of the open economy model.

      Looking across model speciﬁcations, several trends emerge. Over time, distortionary ﬁnancing
creates costly disincentive eﬀects as labor and capital taxes increase, causing output multipliers
to double in the long run, compared to a model with only lump-sum tax adjustments (comparing
rows 1-3 in tables 9, 10, and 11). Allowing multiple distortionary instruments to adjust to debt
substantially increases the long run negative output multipliers. Most research on ﬁscal multipliers
only allows one ﬁscal instrument to adjust to debt at a time,14 suggesting these works might be
biased towards higher long run multipliers if multiple types of expenditures and taxes adjust to
debt in practice.
 14
    Indeed, following Uhlig (2010) and Coenen, Erceg, Freedman, Furceri, Kumhof, Lalonde, Laxton, Lindé,
Mourougane, Muir, Mursula, de Resende, Roberts, Roeger, Snudden, Trabandt, and in’t Veld (2010), a common
practice in the literature is to allow labor taxes to adjust to debt.




                                                     42

     Short-run ﬁscal multipliers are largely insensitive to variations in steady-state ﬁscal parameters
(rows 4 and 5 in tables 9, 10, and 11). However, long-run multipliers are more sensitive to the
steady-state ﬁscal values, suggesting long-run present value multipliers produced from the model
in IMF10/73 may vary from diﬀerences in steady state calibrations across models.
     Looking across the various open economy speciﬁcations (the last four rows in tables 9, 10,
and 11), it appears the open economy model in the main text (Model 5) delivers the largest
output multipliers. Multipliers are smaller with international ﬁnancial integration. Under ﬁnancial
autarky, trade in goods must be balanced each period. This decreases the import substitution
eﬀect, as nominal imports are constrained to equal exports. With ﬁnancial integration, the domestic
economy initially runs trade deﬁcits and consumes more imports, causing output to decrease more
in the short run. Multipliers also are smaller when government spending is a traded good, as part
of the increase in government spending goes directly to the foreign country.
     Tables 12, 13, and 14 list the median and 95% intervals for present value output, consumption,
and investment multipliers, respectively, generated using the uniform priors (Refer to table 6 in
the main text for the prior distributions). Looking across model speciﬁcations, we see that model
restrictions impose the same restrictions on multipliers generated with non-uniform or uniform
priors. The uniform priors increase the probability of parameter draws from a larger region of the
parameter space. This, in turn, allows a larger range of multipliers (relative to the counterparts
in tables 9, 10, and 11). The prior speciﬁcation appears to be most informative about multipliers
over longer horizons.
     Tables 15, 16, and 17 list the median and 95% intervals for present value output, consumption,
and investment multipliers, respectively, generated under the passive monetary, active ﬁscal policy
regime. In the baseline New Keynesian model without sticky wages (the ﬁrst row of tables 15,
16, and 17), there is a positive probability of short-run output multipliers being less than one
and short-run consumption and investment multipliers being negative. However, across all model
speciﬁcations, there is a substantial probability of large output multipliers, coupled with positive
consumption and investment multipliers.

C.2 Model Comparisons              We assume that the multipliers from data follow uniform distribu-
tions and use the distributions in Caldara (2011). Caldara (2011) shows the impact multiplier varies
dramatically with the output elasticity of spending. We restrict the range for the elasticity to be be-
tween -0.7 and 0.7, implying the following distributions for impact multipliers:   ΔY
                                                                                   ΔG   ∼ U [−0.7, 1.49],
ΔC
ΔG   ∼ U [−0.48, 0.26], and   ΔI
                              ΔG   ∼ U [−0.21, 0.1]. We calculate the mean impact multiplier implied
from these distributions and compare how likely our model speciﬁcations can reproduce these values
(that is, we calculate p(ω|Aj ) for each model Aj ). Tables 18 and 19 give the model comparisons
for the baseline and uniform priors, respectively. Various model speciﬁcations are better at match-
ing diﬀerent multipliers. For instance, although models 1 and 2 match the mean output impact
multiplier better than model 5, they are worse at producing the mean investment impact multiplier.

C.3 Alternative Model Ordering                    Table 20 lists the median and 95% intervals for present
value output multipliers generated using an alternative ordering of the ﬁve models presented in the
main text. As noted in Galı́, López-Salido, and Vallés (2007), non-savers are vital for multipliers
when coupled with nominal wage rigidities. To explore the eﬀects of non-savers, we consider an
alternative ordering of models. Model 1 is a standard RBC closed-economy model. Model 2 adds
non-savers to the standard RBC closed-economy framework15 . Model 3 additionally allows for
real frictions (investment adjustment costs, habit formation, and capacity utilization). Model 4
is a standard NK model with sticky prices and wages, which introduces a role for monetary-ﬁscal
policy interactions. And model 5 allows for an open-economy structure. Note that models 1 and 5
are the same as the models presented in the main text. Table 20 reveals that non-savers have no
substantial impact on multipliers when the labor market is perfectly competitive.




  15
    Since there are no sticky wages in this framework, both non-savers and savers make a intra-temporal labor-leisure
decision given the market wage rate
