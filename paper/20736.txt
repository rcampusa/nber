The world’s poor are seeing a rapid expansion in access to formal savings accounts. What is the
source of savings when households are connected to a formal account? We combine a high-
frequency panel survey spanning two and a half years with an experiment in which a Sri Lankan
bank used mobile Point-of-Service (POS) terminals to collect deposits directly from households
each week. We find that the headwaters of formal savings lie in sacrificed leisure time:
households work more, and improved savings options generate an increase in labor effort in both
self-employment and in the wage market. The results suggest that the labor allocation channel is
an important mechanism linking savings opportunities to income.

1. INTRODUCTION.

       There is currently a strong push - in developed and developing countries alike - to provide
financial services that bring the savings of the unbanked into formal institutions. The surge in
interest stems from a recognition of the potential of formal savings to improve the efficiency of the
overall economy by increasing the depth of financial markets, and from increased understanding of
the potential of formal savings to improve the lives of people, most of them poor, who do not use
banks. Half of adults worldwide remain unbanked, but 35 percent of the unbanked report obstacles
to saving that can be overcome by improvements to products and regulation (Demirguc-Kunt and
Klapper, 2012). Several recent studies suggest that overcoming the obstacles to savings can lead to
very large positive effects on household expenditures (Kast et al., 2012; Dupas and Robinson 2013;
Brune et al., 2016; Prina 2015; Schaner 2017).
       The reasons behind these substantial impacts of formal savings on the well-being of the
poor have been the subject of a great deal of theoretical and empirical work. Much attention has
been focused on understanding why individuals fail to achieve their own savings goals, and how
well-designed financial services help overcome these obstacles. Potential impediments to savings
include problems with self-control arising from time-inconsistent preferences (Laibson, 1997) and
other-control issues arising from pressure to make transfers to spouses or peers (Anderson and
Baland, 2002). Commitment products (Benartzi and Thaler, 2003; Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin, 2005)
and savings accounts that provide women greater autonomy over savings (Ashraf, 2009; Schaner
2017) may overcome these obstacles. Even those models that use a neo-classical framework to
explain the large effects of recent savings experiments (such as Dupas and Robinson, 2013) typically
invoke production function non-convexities that prevent individuals from making high-return
investments in productive inputs without savings instruments that allow them to accumulate enough
capital. Under this framework, tools that help entrepreneurs save can have transformative effects by
allowing people to make lumpy investments that provide higher steady-state returns and, thereby,
enable them to escape low-investment poverty traps (Banerjee and Newman, 1993).
       Studies of savings products targeting the poor have paid less attention to an older neo-
classical explanation for the impact of new savings technologies: even with time-consistent
preferences and a concave production function, savings interventions that generate an increase in
the effective real interest rate will encourage intertemporal substitution, increasing the incentive to
earn today so as to enjoy interest-driven consumption in the future. This logic is characteristic of
workhorse macroeconomic models such as Lucas and Rapping (1969) and Blanchard and Fischer

                                                  1
(1989), and places emphasis on labor rather than investment as the pathway that connects improved
savings options with increased incomes.
        In this paper, we present an experiment providing a powerful inducement to save. We
combine the experiment with detailed, high-frequency surveys to capture the time path of changes in
cash flows within households as money begins to flow into formal savings. Our experimental sample
comprises 389 treatment and 406 control households who we survey periodically over two and a
half years. We attempt to answer a simple question: what are the headwaters of formal savings?
Different potential explanations imply distinct signatures in terms of the timing and nature of intra-
household cash flows, allowing our high-frequency data to provide an informative account of the
causal pathways behind savings impacts. If overcoming self-control problems related to
contemporary consumption is key, we should find the headwaters of formal savings in decreased
consumption. If other-control is central, then formal savings will flow from decreased net intra-
household transfers and potentially from decreased use of collective informal savings products that
increase savers’ autonomy. If non-convexities in production are the driver, we will observe an initial
transition period during which consumption, net transfers, or other investments decrease so as to
generate savings balances, followed by lumpy investments in productive assets and then an increase
in income resulting from improved marginal returns on capital. If the intertemporal substitution
story is operative, we should instead see an immediate increase in labor as households respond to
the higher interest rate. Of course, more than one of these mechanisms may be relevant.
        We collaborated with a Sri Lankan bank to send staff door to door to offer households a
weekly savings deposit collection service using a mobile Point-of-Service (POS) handset that prints
out deposit receipts on the spot. The service was provided to randomly selected unbanked
individuals living at least 5 kilometers from their nearest bank branch. 1 Starting five months before
the collections began and continuing monthly for 13 months afterward, and again 19 and 25 months
afterward, we collected detailed survey data, including income, expenditures, transfers, and labor
market activity data. We use the detailed survey data to analyze changes in households’ cash flows
and labor allocations resulting from the savings treatment. The methodology we use is along the
lines of the analysis in Samphantharak and Townsend (2009).


1
  The intervention is designed to open new savings opportunity for unbanked individuals. We screened our
experimental sample such that participants satisfied three criteria: (i) they received income at least weekly, e.g.,
were self-employed or daily wage workers; (ii) they were accessible by a motorcycle and; (iii) they were unbanked,
i.e., they had no formal bank account or had not used a bank account in the previous month.


                                                         2
         The weekly POS deposit collection service led to large increases in formal savings. The
number of transactions with formal financial institutions per month quadrupled as a result of the
treatment; the flow of savings into bank accounts almost doubled; and overall savings increased by
more than 15 percent, or about US$7 per month. The treatment generates an immediate increase in
total household income, and in earned income, in particular. The increased income is used to fund
the increased savings and to pay off loans. We see no change in transfers to or from other
households, and no decrease in consumption.
         The suggestion that increases in income are a source of savings rather than a result of
savings leads us to examine labor market activity in more detail. The survey data for the main
respondents show that labor hours, and, particularly, hours worked on the wage market jump within
a month of the offering of the treatment. 2 Moreover, an immediate shift out of self-employment and
into wage work occurs, with the occupational shift persisting over time. In aggregate, we find an
increase in earnings from wage work, and no increase in self-employment income. The lack of any
lag in the savings and income effects implies that the saving-invest-earn channel highlighted in the
existing literature cannot be the only pathway through which savings accounts affect income.
Instead, our data are consistent with the neoclassical model in which new savings options represent
a change in intertemporal prices which affect the intertemporal allocation of consumption and,
correspondingly, of labor (Blanchard and Fischer, 1989). 3 Indeed, a calibration exercise suggests
that the labor response we observe in the data is in line with what should be expected from the 5
percentage-point increase in real interest rates that is part of the account offered in our treatment.
         This shift from self-employment to wage work, which ran counter to our initial expectations,
is, again, consistent with the neoclassical model if households wishing to expand labor hours
confront constant marginal returns on the wage market and diminishing marginal returns in self-
employed microenterprises. To examine this possibility further, we split the sample into three
subsamples based on activities reported during the baseline period: 1) individuals who are self-
employed in the retail and service sectors, where we posit the ability to expand is limited given the

2
  Nearly all wage jobs in this setting are day labor jobs, typically agricultural work that is paid daily in cash. Having a bank
account does not directly increase access to these jobs. It is therefore unlikely that the increase in wage market hours is a
mechanical consequence of having an account.
3 Banerjee et al. (2015) develop a model to structure an analysis of the effects of an expansion of a microcredit program

in India. They also show that the increase in credit can lead to an increase in labor. Intuitively, their effect comes from
the fact that credit makes the purchase of durable goods possible, and hence raises the marginal benefit of consumption.
In the Blanchard and Fischer framework, savings accounts increase the labor effort immediately because the higher
interest rate increases the benefit of future consumption.


                                                               3
very local markets typical in our rural setting; 2) those active in the manufacturing sector, where sales
are more easily made outside the local area; and 3) those not involved in any self-employment. We
find that those who were self-employed in retail and services are the source of all movement out of
self-employment into wage work, and those who were self-employed in the manufacturing sector are
the source of all increases in income and savings. The initial increase in income comes from an
increase in hours worked, but also, apparently, from an increase in intensity of work per hour. The
data provide evidence that the labor / leisure channel is an important piece of the answer to both
the question of the headwaters of savings and the question of the channel through which the
availability of savings services affects expenditures. Note that we are not the first to explore the
labor channel. Dupas and Robinson (2013a) examine the impact of providing a non-interest-bearing
account to self-employed workers in Kenya. The market vendors in their study make substantial use
of the savings product, and Dupas and Robinson show that their working hours increase by just
over five percent of the control group mean (p. 178, Table 3), an effect that is highly insignificant
given their standard errors. Additionally, Schaner (2017) examines the effects of providing a high-
powered savings subsidy on labor effort three to four years after the incentive expires. She finds a
positive though insignificant increase of about 15 percent above the control group mean in hours
worked in the business (Table 4). Bruhn and Love (2014) find that the opening of 800 Banco Azteca
branches in rural Mexican communities ̶ which substantially increased both formal borrowing and
savings opportunities ̶ increased employment by 1.4 percent over the pre-opening level (Table 4).
        Labor hours may have increased for reasons other than the increase in interest rates. We
examine the importance of several other channels. In a second experiment, we transitioned some of
the control zones to collection through local lockboxes rather than door-to-door collection. We use
this experiment to test whether the peer pressure and reminders that accompany door-to-door
collection play a role in increasing income and savings. The data show that the lockbox treatment
also led to increased labor market participation. These efforts, however, do not result in more
savings for this group. This suggests some potential role for either peer pressure or limited attention.
        The literature also points to savings accounts allowing participants to deal with other-control
or self-control issues. Our data show no significant role for other-control, but we do find some
evidence that the collection services disproportionately benefitted those most subject to self-control
issues. To explore self-control, we use individual information on the time consistency of preferences
at baseline, along with a list of experimental questions on the consumption of “sin goods.”
Regarding other-control, the product allows the saver to interact privately with a bank staffer to

                                                   4
make a deposit into the account solely in his or her own name, and thus may improve the ability of
the account holder to deny the demands of others for transfers. Baseline survey questions on
whether the participant has control over savings decisions in the household show that the treatment
effect is not significantly larger for those initially lacking control over savings decisions.
        Finally, we worried that the availability of formal savings mechanisms might crowd out
informal savings. Rotating savings and credit associations, referred to locally as seetus, are a common
means of informal savings in our sample. We exploit an experiment in which we randomized the
intensity of treatment (Crépon et al., 2013; Baird et al., 2017) within the seetus used by study
households at baseline to examine the interaction between formal and informal savings. We find
that, if anything, our collection services and seetus prove to be complements in this setting. Overall,
our results highlight the ability of savings to have a transformative effect on income even in an
environment in which non-convexities in production do not appear to play a dominant role.
        The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the background and
design of the experiment, and Section 3 develops a simple framework to organize the analysis.
Section 4 presents the impact of the program on savings, the “headwaters” of personal liquidity, and
on entrepreneurial activity. Section 5 investigates the extent to which increases in peer pressure or
improvements in self- and other-control may also be responsible for generating our results, and
Section 6 concludes.


2. SURVEY AND EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN.
This section describes the procedure used to create an experimental sample and the protocol used to
assign households to treatment. Our objective in sampling was to identify unbanked individuals who
lived in remote households (accessible by motorcycle), and who received income at frequent
intervals (and, as a result, were likely to benefit from weekly deposits). Figure 2 provides a complete
overview of our study design.


2.1. Sampling.
        In 2008, Sri Lanka’s National Savings Bank (NSB) began a program of remote deposit
collection targeted at business owners within 1 kilometer of NSB branches. The collections are made
using a wireless Point-of-Service (POS) terminal carried by a bank agent traveling by motorcycle.
The POS terminal allows deposits to be recorded in the bank’s accounts immediately; at the same



                                                     5
time, the depositor receives a deposit confirmation showing the new account balance. Agents
typically visit a given merchant once per week.
         For this project, NSB agreed to provide branches in the towns of Bandarawela and
Mahiyangana with an additional POS terminal and agent to make collections from more remotely
located rural areas. While NSB’s goal for the initial POS program was to reach highly liquid
merchants, the goal of this project was reaching lower-income, under-banked households.
         2.1.1. Sampling Criteria. We agreed on selecting areas by first going 5 kilometers to 15
kilometers from the branch along the main roads leading away from each of the two towns, and
then taking households within 1 kilometer of the main road. Figure 1 maps the study households
around Bandarawela and Mahiyangana and shows their proximity to the road network and their
distance to NSB branches; this confirms that nearly all households selected for the study lived
between 5 kilometers and 15 kilometers from the nearest NSB branch. 4 We began by conducting a
listing exercise, visiting every household in the sampling area, and listing all economically active
adults aged 18 to 65 in the households. The screening survey collected information on: the
frequency of pay from employment; whether the individual had a bank account, and, in the case of
individuals who did have a bank account, whether the individual had made any banking transaction
within the past month; and whether the individual participated in one or more seetus, the rotating
savings and credit associations that are common in Sri Lanka. A total of 5,081 individuals in 3,657
households were listed during this exercise.
         Before drawing the sample, we eliminated individuals whose profile made the weekly POS
collection either infeasible or inappropriate. The first group included those living in houses that
could not be reached by motorcycle. By this criterion, the house had to be within 500 feet of a point
accessible to the agent via motorcycle. We also eliminated those who received income payments less
frequently than once per week. The weekly collection is of most value where income streams are
either daily or weekly. In practice, this means the sample is largely made up of individuals who are
either self-employed or daily wage workers. This is important to keep in mind because the daily paid
workers may have more ability to change hours worked than, for example, monthly salary workers.
Finally, we eliminated those who had made a deposit in a bank account within the past month, since
we expected the behavior of those using the bank regularly would not be affected as much by the

traveling along the nearest road.

deposit collection services. Note that the last two criteria were applied at the individual level, so that
if any listed member of the household received income payments at least weekly and had not used a
bank account in the previous month, that individual remained eligible even if the criteria eliminated
other household members. We also only sampled prime-age working individuals, defined as being
between 18 and 65.
           2.1.2. Creating Zones. NSB quite reasonably felt that their agents could not refuse a
deposit from anyone approaching them while making their rounds. In the region of our experiment,
the households are scattered into small clusters rather than distinct villages. Therefore, we conducted
the randomization at the level of clusters of houses. We identified 156 distinct clusters of
households (hereafter referred to as “zones”), separated by at least a stretch of road long enough to
make spillovers between treatment and control zones unlikely. In addition, in this area, agriculture is
the primary activity in the sampled areas around both towns. Near Bandarawela, the main crops are
tea and vegetables; near Mahiyangana, the main crops are rice and vegetables.
           2.1.3 Sampling Within Zones. With these zones in mind, we selected the experimental
sample in several stages. Because we were particularly interested in the interaction between formal
and informal savings – specifically whether the introduction of deposit collection changes seetu
participation – we began by selecting a sample of individuals who participate in a seetu in which all of
the members reside within 1 kilometer of the initial respondent. We refer to these seetus as “close
seetus.” The first step was to select an individual in each cluster who is a member of a close seetu. 5
There were 93 zones with at least one member of a close seetu. We randomly selected one member
of a close seetu in each of these 93 zones, and then re-surveyed these 93 individuals to collect the list
of names of other participants in their seetu. We selected only one individual per zone to ensure that
seeds did not come from overlapping seetus. This list of names permitted us to “snowball” sample
other members of their seetu. If individuals brought in via the snowball did not meet the other
sampling requirements, we sampled them nonetheless.
           The second step of the sampling was aimed at achieving gender balance. The listing yielded a
much smaller number of women than men meeting the employment / earnings frequency criteria
explained in 2.1.1 above. We also required that women eligible for sampling at this stage were not a
member of a close seetu. We selected up to five women in each of the zones. There were more than
five women in only two of the 156 zones, implying that we had selected essentially all the women in

5   These individuals also satisfied the sampling requirements of being unbanked and being accessible by motorcycle.


                                                             7
the comprehensive listing who qualified according to the earning frequency and bank transaction
criteria. We then extended the sample by selecting an additional one or two men randomly from
each zone. 6 Finally, for each close seetu we then randomly selected 20 percent of its membership to
participate in the survey. The resulting intake sample of 829 has 432 women and 397 men.
         We sampled only one individual per household. Between August 2010, when the baseline
was conducted, and November 2010, when the randomization was carried out, 34 respondents
attrited from the survey, leading to an experimental sample of 795 who were included in the
randomization. Twelve households did not answer at least two post-treatment survey waves, our
criterion for inclusion in the panel analysis, leaving us with a final sample of 783 for analysis. In all,
44 percent of the sample (344) are members of close seetus, with the remainder (439) coming from
the broader random selection.


2.2. Treatment Assignment.
         The randomization of collection services was carried out at the zone level, stratifying and
balancing on data from the baseline survey. We stratified on quartiles of total savings balances,
above/below median of household expenditures and whether the zone included a close seetu. We
then re-randomized to achieve balance on a set of variables related to savings behavior and income
generation. 7 The study sample thus consists of 78 zones with 389 individuals for treatment and 78
zones with 406 individuals for control. 8
         In December 2010, we offered to open accounts at the local NSB branch for those selected
into treatment. 9 The account opening required that the individual come to the bank branch. During
the first two weeks of the month, project research assistants were at the bank branches to help
participants with the required paperwork. The minimum balance required to open an account is 500

6
  Because some zones have no males, we select up to two additional males per zone and use those to fill the remaining
sample.
7 Specifically, to achieve balance we randomize using the “big stick” approach, whereby randomizations are redrawn

until the minimum p-value among a pre-specified set of balance variables is greater than some threshold (see Bruhn and
McKenzie (2009) for a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of this approach. In our case we select a
threshold of 0.21. The variables on which we balanced were: agricultural employment, education, gender, present bias,
monthly income, whether the individual had a formal bank account, balances of formal and informal savings, total and
informal monthly savings amounts, and whether anyone in the household was either a grantor or recipient of an
outstanding informal loan. We also examine whether our core results are robust to using randomization inference, where
potential treatment assignments satisfy these conditions.
8
  Seetu members who were brought into the study through the listing of all seetu members received treatment based on
their zone of residence, not on the status of their respective seetu seed.
9 If individuals in treatment zones either had an existing account (and so were excluded during screening), or opened one

during the study, they were eligible to use the deposit collection service.


                                                           8
LKR (~ US$4.50); we paid this for all treated individuals who opened an account. 10 Of the 389
individuals selected for treatment, 347 (89 percent) opened an account. POS collection services
began December 13th, 2010, in both branches. One main road from town was serviced each day of
the week.
         2.2.1 Unbundling Experiment. Six months into the main experiment, we began a series of
unbundling experiments. In a randomly selected and well-balanced subset of the control and weekly
home visit treatment arms, we worked with participating households to establish locked collection
boxes in each selected cluster of houses. The lockboxes were visited by the NSB agent on a weekly
or bi-weekly basis. Participants were given envelopes and stickers with which to seal the envelopes.
On the stickers, they wrote their account name, account number and the amount of the deposit.
Initially the participants were given several stickers with their name and account number filled in by
project staff; all they had to do was fill in the amount. Participants placed deposits in envelopes and
dropped the envelope into the box. The NSB agent came, together with project staff, on a scheduled
day and time with a key to open the box to collect the deposits made by participants. The agent
carried his POS terminal with him, made the deposits on the spot, and then left the receipt for the
deposit in a sealed envelope in a compartment built onto the side of the box. Participants then
returned to collect the receipt. Thus, the deposits were made into the NSB exactly as in the door-to-
door collection, but in a manner that was more efficient for the agent. In practice, since the agent
arrived around the same time on the announced day, participants often came to the box at that time
and made the deposit in person. De Mel et al. (2013) describe the impact on savings of the
collection boxes by using the experiment to parse out the role of habit formation and salience in
savings. Here, we use the additional experiment introducing weekly box collection to the control to
try to adjudicate between mechanisms linking deposit collections to changes in labor supply, in a
manner we discuss in Section 5 below.
         2.2.2 Saturation Experiment. Finally, we exploited the additional listing of seetu members
described in Section 2.1.3. to introduce a randomized saturation experiment to investigate whether
the introduction of a formal savings account affected how individuals interacted with their informal
savings organizations. We began from the group of 39 close seetus that had been selected into the
treatment; in each of these seetus, 20 percent of the membership participated in the household

the course of the study was approximately 111 LKR per U.S. dollar.

survey. We then offered treatment to (but did not survey) an additional 20 percent of the members
in one-third of these groups, and to an additional 40 percent of members in another one-third of the
groups. With respect to treatment, 45 of the close seetus are untreated, 13 are treated at 20 percent,
13 are treated at 40 percent, and 13 at 60 percent saturation. The comparison of the fortunes of the
constant 20 percent of members studied across the randomized variation in the treatment saturation
allows us to isolate externality effects of formal financial services on the welfare of the membership
of informal savings networks.


2.3. Surveys and administrative data
       We conducted a baseline and three additional pre-treatment surveys for the full sample at
monthly frequency between August and November 2010. We randomly allocated 498 households to
a sample in which we continued to conduct monthly surveys, and 297 households to a sample in
which we conducted quarterly surveys. This both reduced survey costs and allowed us at least a
partial test of whether survey frequency affects deposit or aggregate savings behavior. For both
monthly and quarterly survey groups, we conducted surveys at the defined frequencies through
November 2011. We then conducted monthly surveys of everyone in December 2011 and January
2012, and longer-term follow-up surveys in July 2012 and January 2013. Thus, for the monthly
survey sample, we have five pre-treatment surveys and 15 post-treatment (13 monthly and two semi-
annual) surveys; for the quarterly survey sample, we have four pre-treatment and eight post-
treatment (four at quarterly intervals, two monthly, and two semi-annual) surveys. To avoid
confounding the primary results, in the initial analysis we drop the 192 treatment and 150 control
individuals involved in the unbundling exercise described above as soon as their treatment status
changes. That is, we retain them in the sample until the point when they change from their first
treatment designation (either control or in-person deposit collection) to lock box deposit collection.
       Appendix Table A1 details the timing of the surveys, and shows which surveys are included
in the sample we use here. The result is a full 30 months of data for the core sample (92 zones; 18
months at high frequency) and, for a subsample of 64 zones, data from the 12 months prior to the
beginning of the unbundling experiment. Results are very similar if we use only the sample of 92
zones, but the precision of the short-term estimates improves with the inclusion of the additional
group that receives the core treatment for six months. Our analyses use individual-level fixed
effects, and we cluster standard errors at both the zone and survey round using the method
developed by Cameron, Gelbach and Miller (2008) as a way of accounting for both the substantial

                                                  10
autocorrelation present in high-frequency household data and the effect of local and period-specific
shocks. For balance tests using pre-treatment data, however, we cluster only at the zone level.
         We undertook this project with the aim of answering the simple but vexing question: what is
the root source of money that is newly brought into the formal financial sector? When people begin
to use formal savings, what other behaviors in the household change to allow this liquidity to be
deposited in a bank? Candidate explanations are: (i) that saved capital is substituted from cash in the
mattress; (ii) that greater discipline from formal savings causes expenditures to decrease; (iii) that
formal savings come at the cost of informal mutual insurance networks; or (iv) that individuals work
more in order to save. The survey was designed with these sources in mind. The heart of the survey
instrument is a cash flow analysis (see Appendix B for the relevant survey questions) for both the
sampled household and the sampled individual, who was always the respondent. To unpack the
headwaters of formal finance, we need to be able to construct balances of financial flows at the
household level. Thus, our survey was designed to capture monthly inflows (earned income,
transfers from individuals and other transfers) and outflows (expenditures, transfers to other
individuals, savings and loan payments). While these modules are meant to comprehensively cover
sources and uses, this module does not capture expenditures related to business and agricultural
investment, which have their own detailed modules elsewhere in the survey. 11
         Because we expect individual members of a household to have better information about
their own earnings and transfers than those of other members of the household, we also ask about
the respondent’s individual cash flow. Questions asked of the individual respondent net out her/his
transfers to and from other members of the household to calculate personal income, and then
allocate this personal income to individual consumption items. Significantly, we ask the direct
questions on the amount saved through various means (in the NSB account, in other formal
accounts, in cash, in seetus, etc.) with regard to the individual respondent. Since savings decisions are
likely made at the household level in many households, we make use of the aggregate household
income and expenditure data. But we also use the more detailed individual data to focus on the
outcomes of the individual respondent. The enumerators were trained to check that the sources of


11
  Both the monthly and quarterly surveys asked respondents about income and expenditure flows during the previous
month. We asked about the previous month even in the quarterly survey to minimize recall issues. For investments,
including business investments and financial investments in jewelry, loans, etc., the questions were asked with reference
to the time since “the previous survey” (i.e., the previous month for the monthly sample and previous three months for
the quarterly sample).


                                                           11
cash matched the uses of cash for the individual. Where the initial responses yielded differences, the
enumerators pointed out the inconsistency and re-asked the income and expenditure questions. 12
          The decision to focus the detailed earnings questions on the activities of the participant
him/herself represents a tradeoff. On the one hand, we focus on data the participant knows best.
On the other hand, we will be somewhat limited in answering the “headwaters” question if the
changes in income, expenditure, or savings come from changes in the behavior of other members of
the household. That is, if we identify that increases in savings in banks are associated with increases
in transfers from the spouse, we know only indirectly whether the spouse increased his income (and
if so, we do not know how) or decreased his formal or informal savings. But the aggregate
household data allow us to identify the sources of changes in savings arising from income and
expenditure patterns of other household members up to a point.
         In addition to the detailed survey data, we have administrative data from NSB for the
accounts directly linked to the project. These detail each deposit and withdrawal, as well as other
transactions (e.g., interest payments). We use the institutional data in this paper to study the
determinants of uptake and account usage (Table A4) and institutional balances (Table 2); all
remaining impact tables rely exclusively on information from the household surveys. 13


2.3 Balance and attrition
         Table 1 examines the balance of the experiment. Treatment was assigned at the zone level
and stratified on whether a zone contained a close seetu (meaning that all the members of the seetu
were resident in that zone), as well as on average household expenditures and baseline average
savings in each zone. Stratification was done using baseline (round 1) data, and we test for balance
using the remaining pre-treatment rounds (2-5). Table 1 shows balance on a range of variables
measuring savings, income and expenditure. Only one of the 35 difference-in-means tests, for
monthly savings in cash, shows a statistically significant difference. However, while not significant at
conventional levels, some baseline differences are fairly large. For example, earned income over the
previous month is about 1787 LKR lower in the treatment group compared to the control, which is
12 Samphantharak and Townsend (2009) assign mismatches in monthly income and expenditure to changes in cash

holding. We measure cash holdings along with other financial assets. To the extent that individuals do not want to report
increases in cash holdings, they might be tempted to increase reported expenditures instead. However, over years of
conducting surveys in Sri Lanka, we have found respondents to be generally very willing to discuss financial matters
openly, and we do not detect any patterns in the data which suggest significantly misreported cash balances.
13 Our analysis of a subsequent unbundling experiment takes place within the treatment group, and hence makes

extensive use of the institutional data; see de Mel et al. (2013).


                                                          12
similar in absolute value to the earned income effect (after winsorizing) that we estimate below. We
use individual fixed effects throughout our analysis to help address potential imbalances.
         Appendix Table A2 examines correlates of survey attrition. Overall, the resurvey rates were
high. Ignoring attrition from the sample that occurred prior to the assignment of treatment, only 12
of 795 individuals were not surveyed at least twice pre-treatment and twice post-treatment (our
criteria for inclusion in the panel sample). We also examine the 20 individuals who did not complete
the last high-frequency survey (wave 18 in January of 2012). Most importantly, attrition does not
differ in the treatment and control groups whether we examine simple differences between the two
groups or whether we control for other covariates.
         Despite the overall balance of the experiment, the number of zones to which treatment was
assigned was relatively small (156), and, due to sampling rules intended to locate as many self-
employed females as possible, there is substantial cross-zone variation within the sample in variables
such as gender and seetu participation. For example, 28 zones contain all-male and 10 zones all-
female core respondents. Potentially, due to this clustering of gender by zone, the experiment is
imbalanced when we look among men only or among women only. 14 Appendix Figure A2 shows the
densities of one of the most severely imbalanced variables, the log of personal income. While the
imbalances are not visually severe, the figure illustrates how the problems within exclusively male
and exclusively female subsamples counteract each other to lead to a full treatment/control
comparison that is well balanced. 15
         Given this issue, we pursue several other approaches to test whether our experiment
provides clean identification. First, we test for subgroup balance using the three self-employment
classifications that are explored later in the analysis (self-employed in manufacturing, self-employed
in trade and services, and not self-employed). Appendix Table A3 demonstrates that the study is
well-balanced within subgroups. Second, we exploit our multiple pre-treatment survey waves to
subject the experiment to a test of parallel trends. Appendix Table A4 estimates intercept and time-

14
   To perform randomization inference, we re-ran our treatment assignment protocol 1,000 times to obtain a
corresponding number of artificial draws. This allows us to examine how the actual subgroup balance of our experiment
compares to the distribution of subgroup treatment/control differentials that could have been obtained given our
sample and randomization routine. This illustrates that we were simply unlucky in realizing a group of treatment females
(males) that are substantially richer (poorer) than the control (p-value < .01 for highly imbalanced variables such as
household income among males).
15
   Interestingly, if we use only the data from the round 1 survey (on which the stratification was conducted), no
significant signs of subgroup imbalance are observable. The imbalances result from a gap that opens between treatment
and control within men and within women in rounds 2-5, and hence is only observable because we collected multiple
high-frequency pre-treatment surveys as suggested by McKenzie (2012).


                                                          13
trend slope differentials between the treatment and the control prior to treatment. This table
presents the results of 68 tests; none of the intercept terms are significant, one slope term is
significant at 90 percent and one (total consumption) at 95 percent. This suggests that the pre-
treatment rates of change in the treatment and control were broadly comparable. Nonetheless,
because of the imbalance within gender, we avoid analysis by gender and discuss imbalance issues
carefully when we move to the analysis of the seetu experiment in Section 5.


3. THE INTERTEMPORAL SUPPLY OF LABOR
           A substantial literature in macroeconomics examines the role of interest rates in governing
the intertemporal allocation of labor (Lucas and Rapping, 1969). Central to these models is the idea
that increasing the real interest rate raises the relative return to working in the present relative to
working in the future. In this section, we provide a standard model to develop this point.
           Consider an agent who consumes 𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 and works ℎ𝑡𝑡 in period 𝑡𝑡 with utility
                                        1                      𝛾𝛾
           (1)      𝑢𝑢(𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 , 𝑙𝑙𝑡𝑡 ) = (1+𝜌𝜌)𝑡𝑡 �u(𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 ) − ℎ𝑡𝑡 � .

In period 𝑡𝑡 the agent has wealth 𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 , which is a function of the prior period’s assets and wage
income.
           (2)      𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 = (1 + 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 )𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡 ℎ𝑡𝑡 − 𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 .
Several simplifying assumptions are worth noting. First, we ignore the issue of risk in the income
stream. Increasing risk would lead to precautionary savings, but, because our experiment changes the
interest on savings in isolation, any effect of treatment on the level of precautionary savings is likely
to be second order. Second, we assume that utility from consumption and disutility of effort are
additively separable, implying that the marginal utility of consumption is independent of the disutility
of effort. We make the standard assumption of positive and concave consumption in utility. Finally,
we assume that wage rates are not affected by the experiment. Because the treatment group is a
small part of the regional population, we take the increase in the interest rate as isolated from any
effect on wages or prices. The Euler equation governing the intertemporal allocation of labor is:
                                                                     1
                      ℎ𝑡𝑡                        𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡      1       𝛾𝛾−1 16
           (3)              = �(1 + 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡+1 ) 𝑤𝑤                �       .
                    ℎ𝑡𝑡+1                         𝑡𝑡+1   (1+𝜌𝜌)




                                                                                            𝑢𝑢′(𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐)         (1+𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡+1 )
16
     The corresponding Euler equation for the intertemporal allocation of consumption is                  =             .
                                                                                           𝑢𝑢′(𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡+1 )        (1+𝜌𝜌)



                                                                       14
         If the POS savings treatment provides an improved savings option, 17 then for the
experimental treatment group, the increase in r, holding other parameters fixed, represents an
increase in lifetime wealth for those in the treatment group with positive savings balances. The
treatment thus implies an income effect in addition to the substitution effect. In this formulation,
                                                                                                      1
the elasticity of the labor ratio with respect to the gross interest rate 1 + 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡+1 is 𝛾𝛾−1 and so is a

function of the curvature of the disutility of effort function. The Euler equation communicates a
standard feature of these models: if the cost of effort function is convex ( 𝛾𝛾 > 1 ), then the
substitution effect will dominate the income effect such that an increase in the future interest rate
should lead to more work in the current period relative to the future period. 18 That is, holding the
period-specific wage rates constant, the increase in r will lead to an increase in hours in period t
relative to period t+1.


4. RESULTS.
         The changes in labor supply and intertemporal consumption that come from the model are
driven by an increase in the interest rate on savings. If the collection services did increase the
effective interest rate realized by program participants, then we should observe both a robust take-
up of the product, and an increase in total savings. These outcomes are the analogous to the first
stage in the experiment. We begin, then, by looking at these preliminary outcomes.


4.1. Uptake and Usage.
         Appendix Table A5 uses pre-treatment averages (data from rounds 1-5) to predict
subsequent uptake and usage of the accounts among the 389 individuals offered the treatment.
Account usage appears progressive in that those most likely to make any deposit are low-income
females who score poorly on the digitspan test. At the same time, a strong predictor of use of our
accounts is a history of formal savings prior to the initiation of the experiment. Low-expenditure
households use the accounts most frequently for both deposits and withdrawals, but none of our
determinants are significant in explaining the total number of transactions in program accounts.

17
   The NSB accounts paid an interest rate of 5 percent per year. Plausibly, the effective interest rate on cash held at
home (a common situation in our sample) is negative because money might be stolen or used by someone other than
the respondent.
18
   There are, similarly, income and substitution effects in consumption. The increase in r favors consuming
tomorrow over today, but the increase in wealth increases aggregate lifetime consumption.


                                                          15
Among those who make deposits, the two significant determinants of the log of deposits are having
more education and having higher formal savings at baseline. Those with high baseline savings also
make significantly more withdrawals from program accounts, however, leading to final savings
balances that are not significantly higher than those who had no formal savings at baseline. Final
savings balances are strongly progressive in expenditures (meaning that poor households save
significantly more through the program than wealthier households even in absolute terms), and
baseline seetu participation is also predictive of lower final savings balances. The progressivity of final
savings balances is encouraging, indicating that weekly home visits with the POS terminals are
particularly effective at generating deposits from low-income households.


4.2. Savings Impacts.
         The primary objective of the deposit collections is to increase bank savings. We estimate the
impact of deposit collections on banking activity running regressions of the form:
         (4)      𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽 ∙ 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧 + 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 + 𝜂𝜂𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .
         𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the individual savings outcome, where 𝑖𝑖 refers to individual, 𝑧𝑧 to the zone, and 𝑡𝑡 to
the month of the study; 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧 is a dummy variable equal to one for individuals in treatment
zones after month six of the study (January 2011), 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 are individual fixed effects and 𝜂𝜂𝑡𝑡 are month
fixed effects. 19 We note that all results presented in this paper, other than the results in Table 1, are
from regressions that include individual and month fixed effects. Table 2 provides estimates
corresponding to this specification. Panel A columns (1) – (3) uses administrative savings data as
outcomes and columns (4) – (7) uses survey data as outcomes. We note that, throughout the paper,
wherever we report control means, we do so for the untreated group pooling across all waves of
data collection. Estimates in column (1) indicate that monthly bank transactions increase by 1.73
from a base of 0.01 and, correspondingly, in column (2) we see that monthly deposits increase from
a base of 1.68 LKR by 1,143 LKR; column (3) shows that monthly deposits minus withdrawals
increase by 425 LKR from a base of 0.85 LKR. The administrative data, therefore, indicate a
substantial increase in program savings as a result of treatment. Turning to estimates based on


19 The specification therefore provides difference-in-difference estimates of the effect of treatment. Correspondingly we

omit a dummy variable equal to one for all subjects in the treatment group and a dummy variable equal to one for the
post-treatment period, as those are full accounted for by the individual and time fixed effects. Standard errors in all
regressions are clustered at the zone level (to account for the design effect) and at the survey wave level (to account for
contemporaneous shocks in outcomes) using the technique of Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller (2011).


                                                                      16
survey outcomes, column (4) indicates that treatment quadruples reported transactions from a
control average of 0.5 transactions per month to a treatment average of over two per month in the
treatment group. Column (5) indicates a near doubling of bank savings. Column (6) suggests no
corresponding reduction in informal and cash savings, and column (7) suggests indicates a 16.9
percent increase in total savings. The degree of the effect of deposit collections on monthly bank
transactions is also depicted in Figure 3. Despite a large increase over the control group, the data
show that treatment households only make deposits through the collectors during half of the weeks
in which visits occur. Comparing columns (3) and column (5) suggests that treatment might also lead
to an increase in deposits in other formal accounts. While we would be cautious about that
conclusion – both because the difference of 265 LKR per month is not significantly different from
zero and because the survey data may be noisier – the data suggest that the NSB savings are not
coming directly from other formal savings accounts.
            We re-randomized in this experiment to achieve balance. To address potential concerns for
inference, Appendix Table A6 repeats the estimates from Table 2, including p-values obtained using
randomization inference. 20 This approach tests a null of no treatment effect for any participant in
the study. Under this null, we can generate a sampling distribution for 𝛽𝛽 simply by estimating
specification (4) on any treatment assignment that satisfies our assignment protocol. 21 This approach
yields similar conclusions. In particular, we reject the null of no effect on total savings for any
participant at the 5 percent level.
            This preliminary look at savings therefore indicates that treatment leads to a statistically
significant and economically meaningful increase in total savings. There is no evidence that the
savings deposited in the NSB account are crowding out either other formal savings or informal
savings. The increase in savings suggests that participants viewed the collection services as a
substantial change in their portfolio of financial services, opening the possibility that the treatment
led to more fundamental changes in their behavior.


4.2.1 Savings Impacts by Time Period. After the introduction of treatment, we followed the
subjects for two years, allowing for an examination of whether participation fluctuated over time.
We estimate these effects using regressions of the form:


20   We point the interested reader to Gerber and Green (2011) for a full description of this approach to inference.
21   In practice, we obtain 1,000 potential treatment assignments.


                                                              17
(5)                          𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝜙𝜙1 ∙ 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑧𝑧,1−4 + ϕ2 ∙ 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑧𝑧,5−8 + ϕ3 ∙ 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑧𝑧,9−13 + ϕ4 ∙

Where variables and subscripts are defined similar to specification (4), except 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑧𝑧,1−4 is a
dummy variable equal to one for zones in the treatment group for months 1-4 of the post-treatment
period (January 2011 – April 2011), 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑧𝑧,5−8 is a dummy variable equal to one for zones in the
treatment group for months 5-8 of the post-treatment period (May 2011 – August 2011), and so on.
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃_𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑧𝑧,18 and 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃_𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑧𝑧,24 are dummies for the treated group six and 12 months
after the door-to-door treatment ended, and weekly home visits were replaced with weekly box
pickup at the zone center. These post-treatment coefficients measure the impact of weekly box
pickup when individuals have first been habituated to save by a year of weekly home collections.
           Examining the period-by-period impacts in Panel B of Table 2, we see that once the weekly
home visits end and the zone switches to weekly box pickup we continue to observe significantly
elevated financial transactions and NSB deposits relative to the control. The net flow of funds into
NSB accounts reverses, however, and the treatment group eventually withdraws money from
accounts at a higher rate than the control. Total savings flows drop back to the control level within
12 months, consistent either with households approaching a new steady state given a continued
decrease in effective savings interest rates or with boxes having a more modest impact on total
savings than deposit collection at the home. 22


4.3. Headwaters
           Having verified that the experiment had the intended effect of increasing the aggregate
savings of the participants, we can now ask the central question for which the experiment was
designed: where does the increase in savings come from? The three immediate possibilities are: 1) a
reduction in expenditures; 2) an increase in earned income; 3) and increase in net transfers from
others inside or outside the household. Previous research gives some support for at least the first
two possibilities. Banerjee et al. (2015) find that microfinance clients investing in microenterprises
reduce expenditures on “temptation goods” and increase the purchase of durable goods. And both
Dupas and Robinson (2013a) and Prina (2015) find that expenditures increase with the introduction

     Section 5.1 provides additional evidence as to the impact of the collection boxes on household behavior.


                                                                      18
of savings products that are similar to the one we examine. Both of these studies find incomes
increased by an economically meaningful but statistically insignificant amount among those offered
the savings accounts. 23 Our high-frequency data provide us with the statistical power to present a
detailed answer to the “headwaters” question. We take a “sources and uses” accounting approach to
analyzing the effect of the POS treatment on outcomes, beginning by examining the sources and
uses of funds at an aggregate household level. We estimate these impacts using a specification similar
to equation (1) above, except with the cross-sectional unit, indexed by the subscript 𝑖𝑖, being the
household rather than the individual. The first column of Table 3 shows the treatment effect on
total household income from all sources, including earnings, remittances from domestic and foreign
sources, and other flows (including loans, government program payments, and the like). Panel A
shows the effect of treatment using the raw data, and Panel B shows the treatment effects using data
winsorized at the 99th percentile. Treatment has a substantial positive effect, increasing total
household income by roughly 10 percent of the mean in the control group; the measured effect is of
similar magnitude using either the unwinsorized or winsorized data, though it is statistically
significant only with the winsorized data.
        Columns 2, 5, and 6 disaggregate the household income into three sources, which come
directly from survey responses: earned income (Column 2), remittances from domestic and foreign
sources (Column 5), and other household inflows, including loan receipts, seetu payments,
government program payments, and the like (Column 6). In the unwinsorized data, just over 90
percent of the increase in household income comes from earned sources. Winsorizing the data
reduces the effect of earned income somewhat. Combined with a larger estimated treatment effect
on total household income, this implies a larger role for other household inflows. However, even
though the measured flow from other sources is higher in the winsorized data (Column 6, Panel B),
the treatment effect on these flows remains insignificant.
        Columns 3 and 4 split the increase in household earnings into changes in income reported by
the respondent, and a residual, which we label changes in earnings from other household members. 24
Using either the unwinsorized or winsorized data, the change in the respondent’s income is about
twice that of other household members. We return to a further analysis of the respondent’s income
below. Understanding the source of these new (and fairly immediate) earnings is of key interest.

  The baseline survey included a household roster for which the respondent reported the occupation, hours worked,
and income for other household members.


                                                       19
        Columns 7-10 of Table 3 report the estimated treatment effect on uses of funds in the
household. Reasonably, inflows could be consumed, saved, or transferred outside the household,
and so we measure these dimensions of potential use. There are non-trivial measured effects on
savings in both the unwinsorized and winsorized data, but the estimated savings effect is statistically
significant only in the winsorized data. The unwinsorized data also show some evidence of an
increase in loan repayments. In aggregate, the treatment effects on the sources and uses of funds
balance reasonably well, with the changes in uses reflecting 70 percent of the increase in sources of
funds in both the winsorized and unwinsorized data. One possible explanation for this “leakage” is
that there are uses that are not categorized by respondents in any of these bins, as would be the case,
for example, with investment in livestock or business inventories.
        To present visual evidence of the distributional impact of the savings product, Figure 4
shows the un-winsorized cumulative density functions of the raw data for three of the main
outcomes in Table 3, namely monthly bank savings, monthly total savings, and household income.
The impacts on bank savings are clear throughout the distribution. For total savings, we see that the
impacts are only visually positive above the median. For household income the impacts are less
stark, and again the treatment effects are positive only above the median.
        Panel C of Table 3 allows the treatment effect to vary across time by estimating the
household-level analogue of specification (5) above. The save-invest-earn channel implies that
income should increase little if at all initially, with larger increases occurring later after treatment.
The labor reallocation effect should have the opposite pattern, with income rising immediately as
households increase effort today. The data show a pattern more consistent with the labor-
adjustment story, with very large immediate increases that do not grow over time, and may diminish
by the last survey round. Figure 5 shows that (along with a large shock caused by widespread
flooding), a treatment effect on business income is visible from the very first month of treatment.
While impacts largely attenuate once weekly home visits stop, this pattern of treatment effects across
time is the first piece of evidence in favor of labor reallocation as a mechanism linking new savings
opportunities to increases in income.
        Given that the savings increases we observe appear to be primarily driven by new income,
we turn in Table 4 to examining the individual-level income data in more detail. We perform this
analysis estimating regressions similar to specification (4) above, replacing the dependent variables
with measures of the sources of individual-level income. We shift our focus to the respondent’s



                                                   20
behavior because that is where we have the most detailed income data. In addition, the estimates in
Table 3 indicate that the majority of the increase in earned income is due to the respondent.
         Panel A of Table 4 shows the disaggregation of income for the full sample, with all income
data winsorized at the 99th percentile. We begin by examining the effect of treatment on
occupational choice. We find no evidence that the savings accounts operate by relaxing credit
constraints, and, thereby, increasing entry into self-employment. On the contrary, we find that self-
employment falls by 3.4 percentage points in the treatment group, relative to the control group.
Engagement in wage work increases by two percentage points, though the effect is not statistically
significant (p-value = 0.16). However, earnings from wage work (Column 4) and average hours in
wage work (Column 7) both increase with the increase in wage hours being statistically significant.
Note that all measures capture both intensive and extensive effects. Self-employment status, income,
and hours are coded as zeros for those not self-employed, and hence the treatment effects are
impacted by the entry into wage work and exit from self-employment reflected in Columns 1 and 3.
Appendix Table A7 uses Randomization Inference to calculate standard errors for Panel A of Table
4 and concurs with the two-way clustering in terms of the levels of significance of impacts on self-
employment and wage hours.
         We can also calculate an hourly treatment effect by comparing the increase in hours with the
increase in earnings. Hours worked is reported on a weekly basis, and the income on a monthly
basis. Thus, the increase of 1.5 hours per week in wage work is thus approximately 6.4 hours per
month. This implies a wage at the margin of 49.4 LKR per hour (315 LKR / 6.4 hours), an amount
very similar to the average hourly wage of 50.5 LKR per hour in the control group. This is
reassuring with regard to the consistency of the data.
         In sum, we find that earned income increases immediately after treatment, and the
magnitude of the treatment effect is either steady or decreasing across time. Treatment also leads to
a shift out of self-employment and into wage work. These results are not consistent with the save-
invest-earn channel of savings. They are consistent with an increase in labor effort when the deposit
collections are introduced. To explore this channel a bit further, we step outside the experiment, and
examine effects dividing the full sample into three subgroups. 25 We first split the sample into those


25
  The project started before the RCT registry was established. Hence, we have no public randomization plan.
However, the stratification indicates that our initial analysis was built around the informal-formal savings channel.
The data show little evidence for this channel in aggregate, though we return to this issue below. Though we
balanced on expenditures, indicating that we saw this as a key outcome, we did not expect to find an immediate


                                                         21
who are self-employed and those who are not. We do this using the activities reported in the four
baseline rounds, which took place before treatment status was known to the participants. This initial
split is justified by the fact that the save-invest-earn channel can work through either the intensive or
extensive (e.g., lower exit rates) channel among those self-employed at baseline, but only through the
extensive margin among those not self-employed. There are 419 respondents active in self-
employment in at least one baseline round, and 360 not active in self-employment. We then split the
self-employment sample further into those active in manufacturing during baseline, and those active
only in trade and services. Given the very rural nature of our sample, we expect those in trade and
services may have less opportunity to increase demand, while those in manufacturing likely face
fewer constraints because they can sell output in nearby towns. 26
        Panels B, C, and D of Table 4 report the treatment effects on activities of participants in the
self-employed manufacturing, self-employed non-manufacturing, and not-self-employed samples.
Among those active in self-employed manufacturing in baseline (Panel B), we see no shift toward
wage work, but instead a very large increase in reported business earnings. This is accompanied by a
modest (and statistically insignificant) increase in hours worked. Together, these imply marginal
earnings of 219 LKR per additional hour, about three times the sample mean of 72 LKR per hour
among all self-employed. These data are thus consistent with an increase in both work intensity and
work hours, as should be expected if the effective returns to labor increase. 27 Researchers have
struggled to find direct measures of effort in self-employment activities, and we lack good measures,
as well. So, we can only say that the reported increase in earnings is high relative to the reported
increase in hours worked, and we speculate that this may reflect an increase in the intensity of effort.
        In contrast, among those who are self-employed in trade and services (Panel C), we see a
sharp exit effect (column 3), accompanied by an increase in wage work (column 1), in wage earnings
(column 4) and in the hours worked in wage work (column 7). Again, the incremental earnings in
wage work per incremental hour worked – 54.9 LKR – is close to the sample average. Now,
however, the same calculation on self-employment – measured as a decrease in earnings per

increase in income and a shift out of self-employment. The three subsamples we construct are, hence, non-
experimental, and the analysis should be interpreted with this in mind.
26
   As it turns out, those active in manufacturing are also much more likely to report income from more than one
activity during the baseline period. Two-thirds of those in manufacturing are also active either in wage labor or
agriculture; this compares to less than 5 percent of those in trade and services. The differences in the subsamples
may be due to these multiple activities or some other characteristic correlated with involvement in manufacturing.
27
   See, for example, the estimated intensity effects found by Lazear (2000) when workers switched from hourly
wages to piece rates.


                                                        22
decreased hour worked – is also much closer to the sample mean among the self-employed, at 88.2
LKR per hour. Note that this decrease is a LATE of those remaining in self-employment in the
control group who would have exited with treatment. Thus, we should not expect to find any effect
of effort, since the self-employed over whom this effect is measured are in the control group. While
the trade and services self-employed are induced to make large movements to wage work, these
movements are ultimately ineffective in increasing income: wage earnings rise, but business earnings
fall by an almost identical amount. Finally, we see no effects on either activities or income earned
among those not self-employed at baseline (Panel D).
       We now move to a period-by-period analysis of subgroup impacts. Just as Table 3 showed
immediate impacts of the treatment on income, Table 5 demonstrates that an exit from self-
employment and an increase in wage hours take place even in the first few months of treatment.
Panels B and C show the time-varying effects for the two self-employment subsamples. Among the
self-employed in manufacturing (Panel B), we see the immediate jump in business earnings, which
fades very slightly over time until the last survey round, when it falls markedly and becomes
statistically insignificant. In Panel C, we find that the exit from self-employment among those
initially in trade and services increases throughout the post-treatment period. The treatment effect
on reporting self-employment activity is -5.4 percent and significant in the initial post-treatment
period. But this grows so that by the final two survey rounds, fully one in six of those in the
treatment group who were initially self-employed has exited self-employment. Both reporting any
wage earnings (Column 1) and the level of wage earnings (Column 4) increase steadily across time,
but business earnings decrease by a comparable amount in the first 13 months, and by substantially
more than the wage increase in the last two surveys.
       It is reasonable to ask whether the differences in the earnings response across these three
subsamples are mirrored in differences in savings behavior. We examine this question in Table 6,
where we return to the sources-and-uses analysis, this time by subsample. Panel A repeats the results
for the full sample (with outcomes winsorized) in Table 3, again using data from survey round 2
(September 2010) to survey round 18 (January 2012). Panels B, C, and D then show the self-
employed manufacturing, self-employed trade and services, and not-self-employed subsamples. We
see that there is a significant increase in savings (column 8) and loan repayments (column 10) only
among the self-employed in manufacturing, where individuals were successful in increasing earnings.
In this subsample, there is a small and insignificant change in consumption (column 7). Among the
self-employed in trade and services, the only category showing a significant treatment effect is

                                                 23
transfers outside the household; this category shows a decrease that, while significant at the .10 level,
is relatively small in magnitude. Among those not self-employed, there is a marginally significant
increase in other household inflows (column 6) and non-trivial, though highly insignificant, increases
in savings and consumption. Thus, we find a significant increase in savings only where there is a
significant increase in income, that is, among those who were self-employed in manufacturing at
baseline. We see strong labor market effects among those self-employed in non-manufacturing
activities, but these shifts generate neither increases in income nor increases in savings.
         Survey-based data on financial behavior are always reported with some noise. 28 To assess the
robustness of our results, we repeat all of the core results without winsorizing, with winsorizing at
the 95th percentile of the distribution, and using inverse hyperbolic sine transformations. These are
shown in Appendix Tables B1-B10.


5. WHY DO DEPOSIT COLLECTIONS INCREASE SAVINGS AND LABOR EFFORT?
         This section discusses and tests empirically, to the extent our data allow, several mechanisms
that might link deposit collections to increased labor effort. Empirically, in response to deposit
collection, weekly labor hours in wage work and self-employment increase by 1.29 hours or 4.2
percent of the control-group mean of 30.84 hours (Table 4, Panel A, columns 7 and 8). In the non-
manufacturing self-employed subsample, wage work and self-employment hours worked weekly
increase by 1.33 hours, a 2.5 percent increase over the control group mean of 53.25 hours.
         Are the increases we observe in labor hours reasonable given the interest paid on the
account? One approach to answering this question is to recall that, in the simple model presented in
                                                            ℎ𝑡𝑡
Section 3 above, the elasticity of the labor ratio                with respect gross interest rate (1 + 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡+1 ) is just
                                                          ℎ𝑡𝑡+1
 1
𝛾𝛾−1
     . Using a 5 percentage point increase in the real gross interest rate – that is, assuming that the

pre-intervention nominal interest rate was zero – and the sample-average increase in labor hours of
4.2 percent in the full sample, we find a value of γ equal to about 2.16. Using the 2.5 percent
increase in the manufacturing subsample yields a γ of 2.95. Both of these are close to the quadratic
disutility commonly assumed (often for convenience) in standard models and within the range of


28
   For example, we have one respondent who indicates receiving 1.65m LKR as his monthly household income. At 16
times the 99th percentile, this very likely reflects measurement error, and is extreme enough that, even after taking the
inverse hyperbolic sine transformation of this variable, it remains an outlier. Rather than selectively removing
observations like this one, which very plausibly reflect recording error, we prefer winsorization.


                                                            24
estimates for γ found in the literature (Beaudry and Van Wincoop, 1996, find an IES of 1, equivalent
to γ = 2, and Augenblick, Niederle, and Sprenger, 2015, estimate γ = 1.6 in an experiment over real
effort tasks) suggesting that the increase in labor hours is reasonable given a 5 percentage point
increase in real interest rates.
        We can also address the importance of the income channel using a direct survey question we
asked in the final monthly wave. In that survey, we asked participants in the treatment group several
questions about how the savings treatment had affected their behavior. Their responses are generally
consistent with the outcomes and channels we identify in the data. Of those opening accounts, 78
percent reported that the intervention helped them to increase savings, and only 5 percent said they
felt pressured to save by the door-to-door collection. Among those who said they had saved more,
38 percent said this was achieved primarily through increased income, 34 percent said this was
achieved through decreased consumption, and 22 percent said this was achieved through changes in
intra-household transfers. By far the most common source of increased income was said to be
“more effort to increase sales” in self-employment or agriculture. This was reported by 50 percent of
those saying that income had increased, with 13 percent reporting doing more work at a previously
engaged wage-paying job, 5 percent reporting doing new wage work, and 18 percent reporting
increased income from re-investing in self-employment or agriculture. Although we find some
evidence of increased investment in enterprises in the final survey rounds, these self-reported
narratives reinforce the idea that our intervention increased savings by raising incomes, principally
through more labor effort.
        While both the calibration and the survey evidence suggest that our results are broadly
sensible relative to the neoclassical literature on intertemporal labor substitution, it is of course
possible that labor effort and income increase for other reasons, or that other mechanisms amplify
the effect of interest rates. We explore some of the other channels in this section.
        In addition to the 5 percent interest rate, the deposit collection process has several features
that could induce an increase in savings. First, in-person visits by bank staff might remind
participants to save or exert peer pressure on participants. A growing literature suggests that people
may fail to save because doing so is not salient (Taubinsky 2014; Karlan, McConnell, Mullainathan,
Zinman, 2016); and, correspondingly, they might be induced to do save by reminders. In-person
visits may also generate peer pressure (Kast, Meier, and Pomeranz, 2012; Chandrasekhar and Breza,
2015). Second, the collection service has a commitment feature: we reduce the cost of making
deposits, but not withdrawals. This feature constrains the ability of individuals to use their funds in

                                                  25
the future since they must travel to make a withdrawal. 29 If participants are present-biased and
sophisticated, they could use the account to constrain future behavior. Finally, the product may
reduce loss of savings either from theft or from others in the household demanding transfers. This
is because once a deposit is made it is difficult to withdraw. Capture by others or loss through theft
would imply that the effective pre-intervention interest rates (e.g., saving in cash) may have been
negative, in turn implying that the increase in real interest rates was more than 5 percent.
         Exploring these additional explanations can shed light on how expanding savings
opportunities might increase labor effort and income. In addition, identifying the operative features
of the treatment is useful for policy design.
         Several elements of our design allow us to adjudicate between these potential explanations.
First, after six months, we introduced lockboxes in a subset of our control zones. This intervention
still reduces travel costs and protects against potential self-control and other-control impediments to
saving. At the same time, by contrast, it has much more limited elements of peer pressure and
provides much less of a reminder. Second, we elicit structural estimates of time preference using a
hypothetical time-dated monetary payment protocol. This permits an examination of whether
individuals who are more present-biased in a task designed to measure preferences exhibit larger
savings, income, and labor responses to treatment. 30 We also have geolocations for the center of
each of the 156 zones in our sample, allowing us to measure the travel distance and travel time along
roads from the zone to the bank (see Figure 1). Our sample was selected deliberately to lie between
5 kilometers and 15 kilometers from the bank. Conceivably, deposit collection reduces travel costs
more substantially for participants who live farther from the bank. We therefore check for
heterogeneous effects by travel distance.             Finally, we examine the role of other-control using
responses from baseline survey questions indicating whether the respondent had control over formal
and informal savings decisions.

29
   A substantial literature in developing countries studies products that provide commitment against withdrawal
(Ashraf, Karlan, and Yin 2006; Brune et al., 2016; Kast, Meier, Pomeranz, 2012; Dupas and Robinson 2013b; Bryan
et al., 2010; and Blumenstock, Callen, and Ghani, Forthcoming). Indeed, one recent large experiment finds little
effect of savings accounts without commitment features (Dupas et al. ,2016), and another with Malawian farmers
suggests the potential benefits of commitment may outweigh the cost of reduced flexibility (Gine, Goldberg,
Silverman, and Yang, 2016).
30
   The elicitation of preferences using time-dated monetary payments is more likely to accurately reveal present bias
when conducted with credit-constrained individuals because the intertemporal fungibility of money may pose less of
a confound (Cubitt and Read, 2017); Chabris, Laibson, and Schuldt, 2008; Andreoni and Sprenger, 2012; Carvalho,
Meier, and Wang, 2014; and Augenblick, Sprenger, and Niederle, 2015). Our sample, during the exercise, was
selected specifically for lack of access to formal finance, and so it is plausible that the exercise in this environment
could reflect present bias.


                                                          26
5.1. Limited Attention and Peer Pressure
       In July of 2011, six months after deposit collections began in the treated sample, we
introduced a lockbox treatment in 26 of our 78 control zones. As we discussed in Section 2.21 above,
this treatment was integrated with the mobile POS technology. Deposit collectors visited the box
periodically, added all deposits to user accounts, and left behind deposit receipts. Centralizing
collection greatly decreased costs to the bank. We consulted households in the 26 zones to
determine a secure location within their cluster of houses for the lockbox to be installed. Deposits in
the boxes were collected by a bank agent weekly in 13 of the zones, and biweekly in the other 13
zones. Participants collected receipts for the deposits from envelopes in a compartment on the
outside of the box. This introduction of a less personal collection service allows some scope to test
for the importance of reminders and peer pressure. Importantly, the introduction of savings
treatment to a new group of participants also provides a replication of the initial experiment in a
different sample at a different time. We examine the effects of this intervention comparing the 13
zones given weekly box collection to the control, running regressions of the form:


       (6)     𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽 ∙ 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧 + 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 + 𝜂𝜂𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .


𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 are the individual savings, income, or labor-related outcomes. The treatment effect is measured
relative to respondents in the 52 control clusters that remained as undisturbed controls following the
start of the lockbox experiment. Table 7 reports the corresponding estimates. Panel A reports
effects on savings outcomes while Panel B reports effects on labor-related outcomes. In columns 1-
3 of Panel A, we see that this treatment increased both the number and value of deposits, though by
only about one-third as much as the deposit collection response reported in Table 2. In Columns 4-
7, we see no clear impact on total savings, except perhaps that deposits crowded out informal
savings. Therefore, the lockbox appears to have a less substantial effect on financial behavior, and
we find no clear evidence that the increase in NSB institutional deposits leads to an increase in
overall savings. (Indeed, it appears to lead to some reduction in informal savings.)
       However, the deposit collection boxes do appear to create a labor market response that is
very similar to what we see in the initial treatment group. These results are reported in Panel B.
Wage employment increases (column 1), self-employment decreases (column 3), wage income rises
(column 4), and business income falls (column 5). Correspondingly, wage hours increase (column 6),

                                                                  27
and hours in self-employment decrease (column 7). These responses are similar to those seen in
Panel C of Tables 4 and 6 (the non-manufacturing self-employed): a shift of labor toward wage
work that is fully counterbalanced by a decline in business income. We interpret these results as
showing that the lockbox savings products lead participants to make attempts to increase income,
but these efforts are ultimately not successful, and, hence, lead to no additional income to channel
into savings. Given sample sizes, we can only speculate why the lockbox treatment does not lead to
an increase in income even among the self-employed in manufacturing. Perhaps these results suggest
a link between salience provided by door-to-door collection and the production of overall income.
Households may need the pressure of the weekly home visits to be successful in translating an
increase in labor effort into an increase in total income. Overall, however, the effect of the lockbox
treatment broadly confirms the link between improved savings options and labor decisions.


5.2. Self-Control
       Much of the recent interest in the theory underlying the use of savings products is due to
behavioral economics’ focus on the difficulty that people have putting aside money from daily cash
flows to meet savings goals. The literature provides several distinct reasons that individuals may fail
to save, and many of these explanations suggest that a high-frequency deposit collection service can
alter behavior in important ways. Individuals with self-control problems will achieve a higher savings
trajectory if the long-term self can lock the short-term self into a commitment (Laibson 1997).
Frequent deposit collecting allows people to get loose cash away from themselves, and may permit
them to control their own consumption of “temptation goods” (Banerjee and Mullainathan 2010).
Our savings product provides an interesting window on these behavioral dimensions: it features
convenient deposit and inconvenient withdrawal, and therefore has a commitment dimension.
       The fact that we find no evidence that treatment decreases expenditures suggests that
standard arguments about controlling consumption cannot be playing a driving role in the overall
effects of the program. The commitment feature of the product might allow present-biased
individuals to select new consumption streams more aligned with long-run preferences. Through
this channel, we would expect to see that income increases more, relative to controls while there
would be ambiguous effects on aggregate consumption, with savings balances building up faster for
the time inconsistent.
       To test this, we measured present bias using a standard hypothetical multiple price list; our
baseline survey asked the respondent “Suppose someone was going to pay you Rs. 1500 1 month

                                                  28
from now. He/she offers to pay you a lower amount today. What amount today would make you
just as happy as receiving Rs. 1500 in 1 month?” The answer to this question gives the total current
discount factor, or the product of 𝛽𝛽 and 𝛿𝛿 if intertemporal preferences take the quasi-hyperbolic
form 𝑈𝑈 = 𝐸𝐸0 [𝑢𝑢(𝑐𝑐0 ) + 𝛽𝛽 ∑𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡=1 𝛿𝛿 𝑡𝑡 𝑢𝑢(𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 )]. We then ask the same question with the time scale moved
out by one year (12 months from now versus 13 months), and the 𝛽𝛽 parameter can be calculated by
the ratio of the former to the latter answer.
        In addition, because of the potential for deposit collection to control the consumption of
“sin” or “temptation” goods, we conducted a survey experiment to induce truthful revelation of
goods whose use may be stigmatized. The survey experiment asked respondents to pick (and not
reveal to the enumerator), prior to each question about consumption of different sin goods, a card
numbered from 1 to 10. If the number was between 4 and 10 the respondent was to answer “blue”
if they consumed that sin good in the past month, and “red” if not, but if the number was between 1
and 3 they were to answer “blue”’ regardless of the correct response. In this way enumerators can
never infer the consumption status of a specific individual, but the sample prevalence of sin good
consumption can be readily calculated. The same property of aggregation holds across sin goods for
                                                                                                                       𝐼𝐼𝑗𝑗 �𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑗𝑗 �
an individual; consequently the panel dependent variable used in the analysis is∑𝑗𝑗                                                         , where
                                                                                                                      0.7(𝐽𝐽−0.3)

𝐼𝐼𝑗𝑗 �𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑗𝑗 � is an indicator for a response of “blue” for each of the J sin goods in the survey
experiment. We asked about purchase of alcohol, purchase of tobacco, and about gambling on
horse races and on cards. These questions were asked in pre-treatment wave 3 and in post-
treatment waves 10 and 18, and are included in Appendix B.
        Table 8 examines the heterogeneity of treatment effects by the extent of present bias. We
estimate these effects using regressions of the form:
        (7)     𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝜃𝜃1 ∙ 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧 + 𝜃𝜃2 ∙ 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧 ∙ 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖_𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 + 𝜂𝜂𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .
𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼_𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 is our experimental measure of subjects’ present bias corresponding to 𝛽𝛽 in the
quasi-hyperbolic utility function and the remaining variables are defined identically to specification
(4) above. To improve the precision of the estimates, we winsorize 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼_𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 at the 10th and
90th percentiles. Given the values on the price list used to measure preferences, subjects at the 10th
percentile have a 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼_𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 of 0.862 and subjects at the 90th percentile have a




                                                                  29
𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼_𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 of 1.071. 31 We have demeaned 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼_𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 so that our estimate of 𝜃𝜃1 reflects
the treatment effect at the mean 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒_𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 (which is 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼_𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 = 0.98 in both the
winsorized and un-winsorized samples).                  From this average effect, 𝜃𝜃2 then provides the
heterogeneity in impacts corresponding to a decrease in present bias (lower values of
𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼_𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 imply more present bias).
         The point estimates suggest that the positive effect of deposit collection on income (column
1), wage employment (column 2), business income (column 4), bank savings (column 8), non-bank
savings (column 9) and total savings (column 10) are larger for present-biased individuals. For all
three of the savings effects, the heterogeneity is significant at the 95% level implying that those with
self-control problems find the home visits more useful in effectively increasing savings. To provide
a sense of the difference, the estimated effect of deposit collection on total savings is 936 LKR at
the mean of 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼_𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 while it is 1422.04 LKR at the 10th percentile of the winsorized
distribution (𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚_𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 = 0.923). Likewise, the estimated effect on total income is 3235.2
LKR at mean 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼_𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 and 3,692.41 LKR at 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼_𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 = 0.923, though in this case
the interaction is imprecisely measured. We present Fan regressions in Figure 6 that illustrate this
same heterogeneity, showing that significant effects of the treatment on wage hours and overall
savings are restricted to individuals who have measured immediate discount factor of less than about
.925. The estimated effects on both our direct survey measure of `sin good’ consumption, as well
as the measure obtained using a randomized response technique, are small and imprecise.
         These results suggest that the commitment features of deposit collection play some role in
increasing savings by offsetting a reduction in savings due to present bias. Combining this with the
intuition from standard models of intertemporal labor allocation ̶ that increases in the value of
one’s labor provide an additional inducement to work in the current period ̶ suggest that the
commitment features of both the deposit collection and deposit boxes are a reason subjects are
working harder. However, as Figure 6 shows, the data are consistent with an increase in savings for
every level of beta. We additionally check for heterogeneity in treatment effects by distance to the
bank along the most direct road (Appendix Table A9), by numeracy (Appendix Table A10), years of
education (Appendix Table A11), household size (Appendix Table A12), the number of household
members of working age (Appendix Table A13), and the share of members of working age

31
   It is plausible that these respondents may have misunderstood the experimental task. Unwinsorized results are
qualitatively similar, though less precisely estimated (results available on request).

(Appendix Table A14). There is limited apparent heterogeneity in deposit-collection impact along
these dimensions (though the estimates are in cases imprecise) in linking deposit collection to
increases in savings and in labor effort. Taken together with the results from the prior section, these
tables suggest that behavioral explanations do play some role in moderating the effect of an interest
rate shock on labor, income, and savings.


5.3. Other-Control
         When members of a household disagree on the optimal savings trajectory, private
commercial savings may allow the pro-savings individual in the household to control the household
savings rate (Ashraf et al., 2006; Schaner, 2017). We examine the extent to which interpersonal
conflict drives savings by testing for impact heterogeneity over the degree of financial control
respondents had at baseline. In the second of our five baseline rounds, we asked the question, “Do
you have control over the use of money needed . . . for savings (such as in financial institutions, e.g.,
banks) for yourself/your children?” We code a dummy for “savings no control” equal to one if the
respondent reports no control over either formal or informal savings vehicles. 32 This direct survey
question provides a straightforward way of examining whether treatment had a stronger impact on
individuals who lacked control over savings decisions at the time the intervention began.
         The interaction analysis presented in Table 9 indicates that the impact of the treatment was
not concentrated among those who lacked financial control. These regressions include individual
and round fixed effects, the panel dummy for treatment, and the interaction between treatment and
an indicator for “had no savings control at baseline.” Importantly, it does not appear that the effect
of deposit collection on bank savings (column 8), non-bank savings (column 9) or total savings
(column 10) is localized to this group. Correspondingly, there is no clear differential impact for this
group for wage hours (column 2), self-employment (column 3), or business income (column 4).
Effects on total income (column 1) and consumption (column 5) do appear to be larger for this
group, though the interaction terms are not statistically significant. Curiously, there is some evidence
that deposit collection increased consumption of sin goods in this group (columns 6 and 7).
Collectively, this does not suggest a major role for other control. We emphasize that this context is
atypical for a developing country in that financial control is not highly gendered. In our sample, 63%

32
   This approach is intended to identify respondents with low degrees of spousal control. 456 of the 788 respondents
in our sample (58%) report having no control.. Results are similar if the analysis is conducted using only control over
formal savings.


                                                          31
of men, and 54% of women, indicate having no control of either formal or informal savings
decisions.
        An alternate approach to this problem is presented in Appendix Table A15, which draws on
an idea from Anderson & Baland (2002) in which the share of household income earned by the
respondent is taken as a measure of control over finances. Following their methodology, we analyze
heterogeneity by terciles of the share of income earned by the respondent and find results opposite
to those found in their paper: total savings impacts are slightly larger for the top and bottom terciles
than the middle tercile. While earnings impacts are larger for those with less income to begin with,
there is no evidence of significant differential impacts on consumption, transfers, or savings by
income tercile. Thus, taking this approach, we again conclude that the impact of our mobile deposit
collection does not arise as a result of improved ability to control the behavior of other household
members.


5.4. The Impact of Formal Accounts on Informal Savings Institutions
        At the time of designing the study we were concerned with the possibility that formal
savings accounts, by creating a private and concealable way of storing wealth, might undermine the
social insurance provided by informal savings institutions such as ROSCAs (Besley et al., 1993).
Such institutions are fragile in that they rely on social coercion to enforce contributions (Anderson
et al., 2009). By opening up new exit options, particularly for those with substantial savings liquidity,
private accounts could spell trouble for the effectiveness of both informal saving and risk-pooling
mechanisms. To address, this, we randomized the intensity of the weekly home treatment among
other members (besides the survey respondent) for a set of seetus as described in Section 2.2.2. As an
increasing share of these other members have access to private personal savings accounts, they may
become more likely to renege on ROSCA contributions, and less likely to exert effort monitoring
the behavior of group members. Thus, if formal savings are a substitute for informal savings
groups, we expect to see the attractiveness of ROSCA savings fall as an increasing share of the
ROSCA members renege on their savings commitments and on their attempts to control the
behavior of fellow group members. At the extreme this could lead to group collapse, and on the
intensive margin it could lead to a decline in the number of ROSCAs an individual chooses to
participate in and the quantity of savings achieved through ROSCAs.
         To understand the impact of seetu saturations on informal insurance, we use the monthly
flows of transfers into the household and out of the household (we screened out cases in which a

                                                   32
second household member was in the same seetu as the respondent, and so the interpersonal flows of
informal insurance should be primarily inter-household). We also examine the effect of the seetu
saturation experiment on overall savings. The sample for this analysis consists of the sampled 20
percent of the membership of each of the 84 close seetus drawn into the survey at baseline, and the
experimental variation arises from whether an additional random 0 percent, 20 percent, or 40
percent of their ROSCA was offered the POS weekly home savings product.
        We use two empirical specifications for each outcome. The first examines the overall
intention-to-treat effect within the close seetu membership. The second includes a dummy for
treatment and further includes the randomly chosen saturation within treatment seetus. In this
specification the dummy for treatment gives the impact in the 20 percent treatment saturation seetus,
and the slope term on the saturation gives the marginal effect on outcomes of treating (but not
studying) an additional fraction of the membership beyond this. Because we have no individuals
who are studied but not treated in treatment seetus, we are only able to estimate the Spillover on the
Treated, and not the Spillover on the Not Treated (Baird et al., 2017). The effects of the saturation
should therefore be interpreted as the impact of increasing the fraction of the seetu given the deposit
collection treatment, conditional upon the fact that the studied individual is treated.
        Appendix Table A16 shows the balance of the seetu saturation experiment.                    This
randomization was conducted in a very small number of units; the saturation experiment is
particularly subject to potential imbalance as each saturation cell contains only 13 seetus. We show
balance over 15 tests, and find only one of them to be significant at the 10 percent level.
Nonetheless there are some quantitatively large differences, particularly across the saturation
amounts within the treatment.        Overall savings is imbalanced across the distribution of the
saturation. We therefore proceed to the analysis of the saturation experiment with some caution as
the number of assignment units is small, and the balance not perfect.
        The results of this analysis are given in Table 10. Contrary to the hypothesis that private
individualized savings poses a threat to seetu participation, the treatment and the treatment saturation
appear to lead to superior outcomes for the seetus. Treatment on average increases the number of
seetus in which a respondent participates by 0.27 over a base of 1.8, an increase of more than 10
percent. Allowing for heterogeneity across the saturation rate indicates that where more individuals
are treated, membership in seetus increases more rapidly. The coefficient of 1.42, significant at the 1
percent level, indicates that each 20 percent increase in the fraction of the seetu treated increases the
number of seetus participated in by its members by a further 0.3. The monthly amount saved

                                                   33
through seetus is higher in treatment than in control zones, and the saturation effect is again positive
and large in absolute magnitude, although not significant. The total amount saved through the seetu
is 238 LKR per month higher in treatment than control seetus, and the saturation of treatment in the
informal savings groups is also positive (though insignificantly) correlated with total savings. Hence,
the result of the randomized saturation experiment indicates that, far from posing a threat to seetus,
the bank-driven deposit collecting appears to be fortifying informal savings groups.


6. CONCLUSION.
       We conducted an experiment with a powerful inducement to save: weekly visits by a deposit
collector equipped with a wireless POS device capable of printing out account balance receipts on
the spot. The experiment was implemented in Sri Lanka, a country with strong informal savings
institutions and a tradition of using formal banks for “children’s accounts” into which parents often
begin to put savings at the birth of a child. Despite this, we find strong effects of the treatment not
just on savings into program accounts, but into bank savings and overall savings as a whole. The
data therefore suggest that, even though the sample had access to a wide range of formal and
informal savings mechanisms, the simple low-transactions-cost account represented a significantly
better option. We tracked the sample with monthly surveys including five pre-treatment waves, and
a careful cash-flow accounting instrument designed to answer two questions: First, what are the
headwaters of formal savings? Second, what are the channels through which formal savings affects
income and expenditures?
       Our results confirm recent experimental findings that access to formal savings products can
produce surprisingly large benefits for unbanked households, even when these accounts bear low
real interest rates. Our detailed high-frequency surveys help to shed light on the mechanisms behind
these savings increases. We find a large and immediate increase in income following treatment,
allowing savings to increase without any accompanying decrease in consumption. The surveys
reveal that this newfound income is not generated by increased investment in entrepreneurial
activities; indeed, the savings product triggers an exit from self-employment.           In aggregate,
households work more hours in wage work. An increase in earned income explains a substantial
majority of the increase in income.
        The novelty of our results, then, is that we show substantial increases in savings and income
without any foregone consumption, and without the save-invest-earn channel that is suggested by
the literature on non-convexities in production. Earnings increase as soon as participants gain access

                                                  34
to the deposit collection service, and they increase in the face of exit from self-employment. These
overall sample impacts are made up of a number of distinct sub-group effects. When self-employed
households with manufacturing businesses were offered weekly home deposits, they successfully
expanded earnings by working harder in their own business; the higher income resulted in higher
total savings. Among those with non-manufacturing businesses, households exited self-employment
and increased labor in the wage market. The treatment effect on labor allocation is large in this
group – one in six individuals have exited self-employment by the end of the study – but ultimately
ineffective. The increase in wages is counterbalanced by a fall in business income; neither total
income nor total savings improves. The impact of the weekly home box treatment largely mirrors
this result. The effort to raise income by working harder in the wage market is unsuccessful.
        Thus, only the subgroup successful in raising aggregate income was ultimately able to
increase total savings: we find no headwaters for savings other than income. The implication is that
new institutional savings options will be most effective in raising total savings when they are offered
to households with potential to increase income, for example, by profitably expanding effort in self-
employment. A high-salience inducement to save regularly may be important to induce participants
to exert the continuous effort required to increase income through labor effort. We note that while
we believe our subsample analysis illuminates the mechanisms, our main conclusions derive from
the full sample analysis on which the experiment is based.
        The centrality of income generation underlines the challenge in detecting impacts when they
move through an outcome as difficult to detect as labor inputs. For example, Dupas and Robinson
(2013) find a positive treatment effect of their savings product of between .15 and .31 hours worked
per day in their samples. The effect we find is of similar magnitude – 1.29 hours per week, or ~.25
hours per day – but this effect is more precisely measured and is statistically significant. A substantial
reason our study has the ability to detect this channel is the long, high-frequency panel we collected,
providing us statistical power for highly stochastic outcomes (McKenzie 2012).
        In one sense it is surprising that a financial service offering nothing more than a low-cost
means to save in a bank could increase household income. However, as in classical macroeconomic
models of intertemporal labor allocation, the responses we observe in the data are consistent with
those we would expect from individuals who experience a large increase in the interest they receive
on savings. These effects appear to be larger for present-biased individuals, suggesting that the
commitment dimension of the product may reinforce the interest rate effect. These features of the
product drive up the benefit of working today to save for tomorrow, leading individuals to increase

                                                   35
labor effort in the initial period to build up savings. We read the full-sample results, supported by
the subsample analysis, as suggesting that the labor channel, rather than the investment channel,
deserves some attention when studying the benefits of saving.
