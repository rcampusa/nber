                                           ABSTRACT

We present results from a large-scale randomized experiment across 350 schools in Tanzania that
studied the impact of providing schools with (a) unconditional grants, (b) teacher incentives
based on student performance, and (c) both of the above. After two years, we find (a) no impact
on student test scores from providing school grants, (b) some evidence of positive effects from
teacher incentives, and (c) significant positive effects from providing both programs. Most
importantly, we find strong evidence of complementarities between the two programs, with the
effect of joint provision being significantly greater than the sum of the individual effects. Our
results suggest that combining spending on school inputs (which is the default policy) with
improved teacher incentives could substantially increase the cost-effectiveness of public spending
on education.

1     Introduction
Improving education quality in low-income countries is a top priority for the global hu-
man development agenda (United Nations, 2015), with governments and donors spend-
ing over a hundred billion dollars annually on education (World Bank, 2017). Yet devel-
oping country education systems have found it difficult to convert increases in spending
and enrollment into improvements in student learning (World Bank, 2018). One rea-
son could be that education systems face several additional constraints beyond limited
school resources.1 Thus, simply augmenting school resources may have limited impact
on learning outcomes if other binding constraints are not alleviated at the same time.
   A specific constraint that may limit the effectiveness of school inputs is low teacher
effort — exemplified by high rates of teacher absence documented in several developing
country settings (Chaudhury, Hammer, Kremer, Muralidharan, & Rogers, 2006). Thus,
while school inputs may improve learning when teacher effort is high (either due to
intrinsic motivation or external incentives/monitoring), they may be less effective when
teacher effort is low. Conversely, returns to teacher effort may be low in the absence
of adequate school inputs. In such a setting, the impact of jointly improving school
resources and teacher effort may be greater than the sum of doing both on their own.
   This paper tests for such complementarities using a large-scale randomized evaluation.
Our study is set in Tanzania, where two widely-posited constraints to education quality
are a lack of school resources, and low teacher motivation and effort (World Bank, 2012).
We study the individual impact of two programs, each designed to alleviate one of these
constraints, and also study the impact of providing these programs jointly. The first
program aimed to alleviate resource constraints by providing schools with grants of TZS
10,000 (∼US$6.25 at the time of the study) per-student, effectively doubling discretionary
school resources.2 The second program aimed to improve teacher motivation and effort
by providing teachers with performance-based bonuses — based on the number of their
students who passed basic tests of math, Kiswahili (local language), and English. A
teacher with average enrollment could earn up to 125% of monthly base pay as a bonus.
    1 Someof these include poor student health and nutrition, low student attendance, mismatch between
curriculum/pedagogy and student learning levels, and low levels of teacher effort and accountability.
Each of these challenges has been extensively documented in multiple developing country settings. See
Glewwe and Muralidharan (2016) and Mbiti (2016) for reviews and references to primary sources.
   2 The Government’s capitation grant policy aimed to provide schools with TZS 10,000/student. The

program we study provided another TZS 10,000/student over and above this grant, effectively doubling
the school grant. Since teacher salaries were paid directly by the government and did not pass through
the schools, these grants (from the government and the program) were the main source of discretionary
funding available to schools. Schools were not permitted to use grant funds to augment teacher salaries
or hire new teachers (consistent with government rules for capitation grant expenditure).


                                                  1
   We conducted the experiment in a large nationally-representative sample of 350 pub-
lic schools (and over 120,000 students) across 10 districts in mainland Tanzania. We
randomly allocated schools to four groups (stratified by district): 70 received uncon-
ditional school grants, 70 received the teacher performance pay program, 70 received
both programs, and 140 were assigned to a control group. The study was powered ad-
equately to test for complementarities, and we gave the same importance to testing for
complementarities as testing for the main effects of the two programs.3 All programs
were implemented by Twaweza, a leading Tanzanian non-profit organization.
   We report four sets of results. First, the school grant program significantly increased
per-student discretionary expenditure in treated schools. We find evidence of reduc-
tion in school and household spending in the Grant schools. Even after this reduction,
there was a significant increase in net discretionary school-level spending per student
in treated schools (excluding teacher salaries). However, this increase in spending had
no impact on student learning outcomes on low-stakes tests (conducted by the research
team) in math, Kiswahili, or English after both one and two years.
   Second, we find mixed evidence on the impact of teacher performance pay on stu-
dent learning. On low-stakes tests conducted by the research team, student test-scores
in Incentive schools were modestly higher than those in the control group, but these dif-
ferences were not statistically significant for most subjects. However, on the high-stakes
tests administered by Twaweza (that were used to calculate teacher bonus payments), we
find significant positive treatment effects. After two years, students in treated schools
were 37%, 17%, and 70% more likely to pass the Twaweza tests in math, Kiswahili, and
English — the outcome that teacher bonuses were based on. Overall, scores on high-
stakes tests were 0.21σ higher in treated schools after two years. As specified in our
pre-analysis plan, the analysis in this paper is mainly based on the low-stakes tests. We
present results on high-stakes tests to enable comparison with other studies on teacher
performance pay (that report results using high-stakes tests), and defer discussion and
interpretation of the differences in results on the two sets of tests to Section 4.2.
   Third, students in Combination schools, that received both school grants and teacher
incentives, had significantly higher test scores in all subjects on both the low-stakes and
high-stakes tests. After two years, composite test scores were 0.23σ higher on the low-
stakes tests, and 0.36σ higher on the high-stakes tests. Student pass rates on the latter
were 49%, 31%, and 116% higher in math, Kiswahili, and English.
   Fourth, and most important, we find strong evidence of complementarities between in-
puts and incentives. At the end of two years, test score gains in the Combination schools

                                                      2
were significantly greater than the sum of the gains in the Grant and Incentives schools
in each of the three subjects (math, Kiswahili, and English). Using a composite mea-
sure of test-scores across subjects, the “interaction” effect was equal to 0.18σ (p < 0.01).
These complementarities are quantitatively meaningful: point estimates of the impact of
the Combination treatment are over five times greater than the sum of the impact of the
Grant and Incentives treatments after two years.4 Thus, school inputs may be effective
when teachers have incentives to use them effectively, but not otherwise. Conversely,
motivated teachers may be more effective with additional school inputs.
   While we find strong evidence of complementarities between the grant and incentive
programs as implemented, cost-effectiveness calculations also depend on the cost of im-
plementing the programs, and the dose-response relationship between different values
of grants and incentives and impacts on test-scores. Assuming a linear dose-response
relationship, we estimate that the combination of grants and incentives would clearly be
more cost effective at improving test scores compared to spending the total cost of the
Combination treatment on larger school grants instead. However, we cannot rule out the
possibility that it may have been just as cost-effective to spend all the money spent on
the Combination program on a larger teacher incentive program instead.5
   To help interpret our results, we develop a simple stylized model where teachers
optimize effort choices given an education production function (increasing in teacher
effort and school inputs), their non-monetary and monetary rewards from improving
student learning, and a minimum learning constraint. The model highlights that it
is only under the implicit (and usually unstated) assumption that teachers have non-
financial reasons for exerting effort that we should expect extra inputs to improve test
scores. Instead, if teachers act like agents in standard economic models, then the optimal
response to an increase in inputs may be to reduce effort, which may attenuate impacts
of additional inputs on learning. However, the introduction of financial incentives will
typically raise the optimal amount of teacher effort when inputs increase, yielding policy
complementarities between inputs and incentives in improving learning outcomes.
   Our first and most important contribution is to experimentally establish the existence
   4 Since  the number of students passing exams was greater in Combination schools than in Incentive
schools, total program spending in Combination schools was 3.5% greater than the sum of spending in
Input and Incentive schools. The results on complementarities are robust to accounting for this additional
expenditure (see calculations in Section 4.4).
    5 This is because implementation costs were a much larger fraction of total costs in the Incentive pro-

gram (though the total amount spent on the Grant and Incentive programs were very similar at USD 7.13
and 7.10 per student/year respectively). Thus, spending all the money from the Combination program
on incentives would enable the value of the incentives to be 3.45 times higher than provided under the
Incentives program (because the implementation cost does not change with the size of the bonus), whereas
it would only yield 2.05 times the value of grants in the Grants program (see details in Section 5.3).


                                                    3
of complementarities across policies to improve learning outcomes. While several field
experiments have employed factorial (or cross-cutting) designs that could in principle be
used to test for such complementarities, these studies have usually been under-powered
to detect economically meaningful complementarities (typically due to budget and sam-
ple size constraints). Other experiments have evaluated basic and augmented versions
of a program and study variants A, and A + B; but not A, B, and A + B, which would be
needed to test for complementarities (for instance, see Pradhan et al. (2014); Kerwin and
Thornton (2017)). Finally, experimental studies of teacher incentive programs find larger
effects in schools with more resources, but this evidence is only suggestive of comple-
mentarities because of lack of random assignment of the inputs (see Muralidharan and
Sundararaman (2011b); Gilligan, Karachiwalla, Kasirye, Lucas, and Neal (2018)). Over-
all, as noted in a recent meta-analysis of education studies, “[t]here are surprisingly few
experiments (in education) with fully factorial designs that allow for strong experimental
tests of [complementarities]” (McEwan, 2015).6 7
   Second, our results suggest that a likely reason for the poor performance of input-
based education policies in developing countries is the absence of adequate teacher in-
centives for using resources effectively. Several randomized evaluations have found that
augmenting school resources has little impact on learning outcomes in developing coun-
tries (see for example Glewwe, Kremer, and Moulin (2009); Blimpo, Evans, and Lahire
(2015); Das et al. (2013); Pradhan et al. (2014); Sabarwal, Evans, and Marshak (2014); de
Ree, Muralidharan, Pradhan, and Rogers (2018)). Our results replicate the results on
the non-impact of providing additional school inputs, but also show that the inputs can
improve learning when combined with teacher incentives.8
   6A  notable exception from the early childhood development literature is Attanasio et al. (2014) which
studies the effects of providing (1) nutrition supplements, (2) stimulation programs, and (3) both of them,
on early childhood development in Colombia, and finds no evidence of complementarities across the two
programs studied. Two other noteworthy studies are Behrman, Parker, Todd, and Wolpin (2015) who
study providing incentives to teachers, students, and both of them (in Mexico) and List, Livingston, and
Neckermann (2012) who study providing incentives individually to teachers, students, and parents or
to a combination of these (in Chicago). However, neither study tests for complementarities because the
variants of the incentives implemented are different across the individual and joint treatments.
   7 There is a parallel literature on dynamic complementarities in human capital investments over time

(Cunha & Heckman, 2007; Malamud, Pop-Eleches, & Urquiola, 2016; Johnson & Jackson, 2017). While con-
ceptually similar, this literature is substantively different because it focuses on complementarities across
sequential investments. Our paper is situated more in the development economics tradition, where the
idea that there may be complementarities across policies implemented contemporaneously (due to multiple
constraints binding simultaneously) has been a central theme (Ray, 1998; Banerjee & Duflo, 2005).
   8 Prior studies have presented plausible ex post rationales for the lack of impact of additional resources

including poor implementation, household substitution, and inputs being mis-targeted (such as provid-
ing textbooks to students who could not read). Our results suggest that these constraints to translating
additional school resources into improved learning may not bind if teachers are suitably motivated to use
school resources better.


                                                     4
   Finally, we contribute to the broader literature on teacher incentives. While global
evidence on the effectiveness of teacher incentives is mixed, the patterns in the results
suggest that such policies are more effective in developing countries, perhaps due to
greater slack in teacher effort (Ganimian & Murnane, 2016). Our results are consistent
with this view and with results from Lavy (2002, 2009); Glewwe, Ilias, and Kremer (2010);
Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2011b); Duflo, Hanna, and Ryan (2012); Contreras and
Rau (2012); and Muralidharan (2012) who find that various forms of performance-linked
pay for teachers in low- and middle-income countries improved student test scores.9
   An important policy challenge for global development is that disadvantaged places
also tend to be those with weaker governance. For instance, teacher absence rates are
consistently higher in countries and states with lower per-capita income (Chaudhury
et al., 2006). Thus, places that are most in need of additional resources to provide basic
services like education are also places that are likely to be the least efficient at converting
additional spending into improved outcomes. Our results suggest that combining funds
for education inputs (which is what is done under the status quo) with incentives for
improved outcomes may be a promising option for addressing this challenge.
   This idea is gaining policy traction globally. Donors such as the World Bank are in-
creasingly using results-based-financing schemes in education (as proposed by Birdsall,
Savedoff, Mahgoub, and Vyborny (2012)), and several US states are exploring reforms
that link parts of school financing to state-level learning outcomes (Collier, 2016; Mesecar
& Soifer, 2016). Our results provide empirical support for such policy approaches.


2     Context and Interventions

2.1     Context
Our study is set in Tanzania, which is the sixth largest African country by population,
and home to over 50 million people. Partly due to the abolishment in 2001 of school
fees in public primary schools, Tanzania has made striking progress towards univer-
sal primary education with net enrollment growing from 52% in 2000 to over 94% in
2008 (Valente, 2015). Yet, despite this increase in school enrollment, learning levels re-
main low. In 2012, nationwide learning assessments showed that less than one-third of
grade 3 students were proficient at grade-2 literacy Kiswahili (the national language and
medium of instruction in primary schools), or in basic numeracy. Proficiency in English
    9 Theclaim that our results are consistent with prior evidence is based on results using our high-stakes
tests because most of these studies (except Duflo et al. (2012)) report impacts on high-stakes tests.


                                                     5
(the medium of instruction in secondary schools) was especially limited, with less than
12% of grade 3 students able to read at a grade 2 level in English (Uwezo, 2013; Jones,
Schipper, Ruto, & Rajani, 2014).
   Despite considerable public spending on education,10 budgetary allocations to educa-
tion (and actual funds received by schools) have not kept pace with the rapid increases
in enrollment. As a result, inadequate school resources are a widely-posited reason for
poor school quality. In 2012 only 3% of schools met the World Bank definition of having
sufficient infrastructure (clean water, adequate sanitation, and access to electricity) and
in grades 1, 2, and 3 there was only one math textbook for every five students (World
Bank, 2012). Class sizes in primary schools average 74 students, with almost 50 students
per teacher (World Bank, 2012).
   A second challenge for education quality is low teacher motivation and effort. A study
conducted in 2010 found that nearly one in four teachers were absent from school on a
given day, and over 50% of teachers who were present in school were absent from the
classroom (World Bank, 2012). The same study reported that on average, students receive
only about 2 hours of instruction per day (less than half of the scheduled instructional
time). Self-reported teacher motivation is also low: 47% of teachers surveyed in our data
report that they would not choose teaching as a career if they could start over again.


2.2    Interventions and Implementation
The interventions studied in this paper were implemented by Twaweza, an East African
civil-society organization focusing on citizen agency and public service delivery. Through
its Uwezo program, Twaweza has conducted large-scale, citizen-led independent mea-
surement of learning outcomes in East Africa from 2009 (see for example Uwezo (2017)).
Having documented the challenge of low levels of learning through the Uwezo program,
Twaweza conducted extensive discussions with education stakeholders (including teach-
ers’ unions, researchers, and policy makers) and identified that the two most widely
cited barriers to improving learning outcomes were inadequate school resources, and
poor teacher motivation and effort.
   Following this process, Twaweza formulated a program that aimed to alleviate these
constraints and study their impact on learning outcomes. The program was called
KiuFunza (“Thirst for learning” in Kiswahili) and was implemented in a nationally-
representative sample of schools across Tanzania over two years (2013 and 2014). Twaweza
(with technical inputs from the research team) implemented the interventions as part of
  10 About one-fifth of overall Tanzanian government expenditure is devoted to the education sector, over
40 percent of which is allocated to primary education (World Bank, 2015).

                                                   6
a randomized controlled trial to facilitate learning about program impacts. Twaweza
also worked closely with government officials to ensure smooth implementation of the
program and evaluation. The interventions are described below.

2.2.1      Capitation Grant (Grants) Program

Schools randomly selected for the capitation grants program received TZS 10,000 (∼US$6.25
at the time of the study) per student from Twaweza. This was over and above funds re-
ceived under the Government’s capitation grant program, which also had a stipulated
value of TZS 10,000/student. Guidelines for expenditure from program funds were sim-
ilar to that of the government’s own capitation grant program.11 In practice, there were
three key differences in the implementation quality of the government and Twaweza
grant programs. First, the per capita Twaweza grant was larger than the per-capita Gov-
ernment grant actually received by schools.12 Second, the Twaweza grants were sent
directly to the school bank account to minimize diversion and leakage. Third, Twaweza
communicated clearly with schools about the size of each tranche and expected date of
receipt to enable better planning for optimal use of the resources.
   Twaweza announced the grants early in the school year (March) during a series of
meetings with school staff and community members (including parents), and announced
that the program would run for two years (2013 and 2014). Twaweza also distributed
pamphlets and booklets that explained the program to parents, teachers, and community
members. Funds were transferred to school bank accounts in two scheduled tranches:
the first at the beginning of the second term (around April) and the second at the be-
ginning of the third term (around August/September). Typically, head teachers and
members of the school board decided how to spend the grant funds, but schools had to
maintain financial records of their transactions and were required to share revenue and
expenditure information with the community by displaying summary financial state-
ments in a public area in the school.
   The grant value was sizeable. For context, GDP/capita in Tanzania in 2013 was
∼US$1,000 and the per-student grant value was ∼0.6% of GDP/capita. If schools spent
all of their grants on books, the funds would be sufficient to purchase about ∼ 4-5 text-
books/student. Overall, Twaweza disbursed ∼US$350,000/year to the 70 schools in the
  11 For instance, capitation grant rules do not allow these funds to be used for teacher salaries. The
Twaweza Grants program had the same guidelines.
  12 On average, schools received only around 60% of the stipulated grant value of TZS 10,000/student

from the government’s capitation grant program, and many received much less than that (World Bank,
2012). Reasons included inadequate budgetary allocations by the central government, diversion of funds
for other uses by local governments, and delays in disbursements.


                                                  7
Grant program and delivered what a well-implemented school capitation grant program
would look like. Studying the impact of the Twaweza program on learning outcomes
therefore provides a likely upper bound of the impact of a scaled-up government school-
grant program, since the Twaweza program was implemented better.

2.2.2   Teacher Performance Pay (Incentives) Program

The teacher performance pay program provided cash bonuses to teachers based on
the performance of their students on independent learning assessments conducted by
Twaweza. Given Twaweza’s emphasis on early grade learning, the program was limited
to teachers in grades 1, 2, and 3 and focused on numeracy (mathematics) and literacy
in English and Kiswahili. For each of these subjects, an eligible teacher earned a TZS
5,000 (∼ US$3) bonus for each student who passed a simple, externally-administered,
grade-appropriate test based on the national curriculum. Additionally, the head teacher
was paid TZS 1,000 (∼ US$0.6 ) for each subject test a student passed.13
   The term used by Twaweza for the teacher-incentive program was “Cash on Delivery”
to reinforce the contrast between the approaches that underlay the two programs — with
the Grants program being one of unconditional school grants, and the teacher incentive
program being one where payments were contingent on outcomes.14 The communica-
tion to schools and teachers emphasized that the aim of the Incentives program was to
motivate teachers and reward them for achieving better learning outcomes.
   An advantage of the simple proficiency-based (or “threshold” based) incentive scheme
used by Twaweza is its transparency and clarity. As pay-for-performance schemes are
relatively novel in Tanzania, Twaweza prioritized having a bonus formula that would be
easy for teachers to understand. Bonuses based on passing basic tests of literacy and
numeracy are also simpler to implement compared to more complex systems based on
calculating measures of student and teacher value addition.
   There are also important limitations to such a threshold-based design (Ho, Lewis, &
MacGregor Farris, 2009). It may encourage teachers to focus on students close to the
passing threshold, neglecting students who are far below or far above the threshold
(Neal & Schanzenbach, 2010). In addition, such a design may be unfair to teachers who
serve a large fraction of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, who may be further
behind the passing standard. While Twaweza was aware of these limitations, they took a
  13 Twaweza   included head teachers in the incentive design to make them stakeholders in improving
learning outcomes. It is also likely that any scaled up teacher incentive program would also feature
bonuses for head-teachers along the lines implemented in the KiuFunza project.
  14 Twaweza used the term “Cash on Delivery” as a local version of a concept developed in the context

of foreign aid by Birdsall et al. (2012).


                                                  8
considered decision to keep the formula simple in the interest of transparency, simplicity
of explaining to teachers, and ease of implementation.15 Further, since the bonuses were
based on achieving basic functional literacy and numeracy, they were not too concerned
about students being so far behind the threshold that teachers would ignore them.
   Twaweza announced the program to teachers in March 2013 and explained the details
of the bonus calculations to the head teacher and teachers of the target grades (1-3)
and subjects (math, Kiswahili, and English). Pamphlets with a description of the bonus
structure and answers to frequently asked questions were handed out to teachers, and
booklets explaining program goals were distributed to parents. A follow-up visit in July
2013 reinforced the details of the program and provided an opportunity for questions
and feedback. Teachers understood the program: over 90% of those participating in the
program were able to correctly calculate the bonus level in a hypothetical scenario.
   The high-stakes assessments that were used to determine the bonus payments were
conducted at the end of the school year (with dates announced in advance), and con-
sisted of three subject tests administered to all pupils in grades 1, 2 and 3. To ensure the
integrity of the testing process, Twaweza created ten versions of the high-stakes tests,
and randomly assigned these to students within a classroom. To prevent teachers from
gaming the system by importing (or replacing) students, Twaweza only tested students
enrolled at baseline (and took student photos at baseline to prevent identity fraud). Since
each student enrolled at baseline had the potential to pass the exam, there would be no
gains from preventing weaker students from taking the exam. All tests were conducted
by and proctored by independent enumerators. Teacher bonuses were paid directly into
their bank accounts or through mobile money transfers.

2.2.3   Combination Arm

Schools assigned to the combination arm received both the capitation grant and teacher
incentive programs discussed above with identical implementation protocols.
 15 In the US, the early years of school accountability initiatives such as No Child Left Behind focused on

measures based on levels of student learning rather than value-addition for similar reasons.

3      Research Design

3.1      Sampling and Randomization
We conducted the experiment in a nationally-representative sample of 350 public schools
across 10 districts in mainland Tanzania.16 We first randomly sampled 10 districts from
mainland Tanzania, and then randomly sampled 35 schools within each of these dis-
tricts to get a sample of 350 schools (Figure 1). Within each district, 7 schools were
randomly assigned to receive capitation grants, 7 schools to receive teacher incentives,
and 7 schools to receive both grants and incentives. The remaining 14 schools did not
receive either program and served as our control group. Thus, adding over 10 districts,
the study had a total of 70 schools in each of the 3 treatment arms (Grants, Incentives,
and Combination) and 140 schools in the control group (Figure 1).


3.2      Data
Our analysis uses data collected from schools, teachers, students, and households over
the course of the study. Enumerators collected data on school facilities, input availabil-
ity, management practices, and school income/expenditure.17 While most categories of
school expenditure are difficult to map onto specific grades, we collected data on text-
book expenditures at the grade and subject level since this is a substantial expenditure
item that can be easily assigned to a specific grade.
   Enumerators also surveyed all teachers (about 1,500) who taught in focal grades (grades
1, 2, and 3) and focal subjects (math, English and Kiswahili), and collected data on indi-
vidual characteristics such as education and experience as well as effort measures such
as teaching practices. They also conducted head teacher interviews.
   For data on student learning outcomes, we sampled and tested 10 students from each
focal grade (grades 1, 2 and 3) within each school, and followed these 30 students over
the course of the study. We refer to these as low-stakes (or non-incentivized) tests as
they are used purely for research purposes (and teachers, students, and parents were
informed of this). From this set of 10,500 students, we randomly sampled 10 students
from each school (five from each of grade 2 and 3) to conduct household surveys. These
    16 The
         combination of random assignment and representative sampling provides externally validity to
our results across Tanzania (see Muralidharan and Niehaus (2017) for a more detailed discussion).
  17 Data on school expenditures were collected by reviewing receipts, accounting books, and other ac-

counting records, following the methods of the expenditure tracking surveys developed and used by the
World Bank (Reinikka & Smith, 2004; Gurkan, Kaiser, & Voorbraak, 2009). These data do not include
teacher salaries since salaries are paid directly by the government and do not pass through the school.


                                                  10
3,500 household surveys were used to collect information on household characteristics,
educational expenditures, and non-financial educational inputs at the household (such
as helping with homework).18
  We also use data from the high-stakes (or incentivized) tests conducted by Twaweza
that were used to determine teacher bonuses. These tests were taken by all students
in grades 1, 2, and 3 in Incentive and Combination schools (where bonuses had to be
paid). Twaweza did not conduct these tests in Grant schools, but they did conduct them
in a sample of 40 control schools to enable the computation of treatment effects of the
incentive programs on the high-stakes tests. However, we only have student level test-
scores from the second year of the evaluation as Twaweza only recorded aggregated
pass rates (needed to calculate bonus payments) in the first year. The low- and high-
stakes tests covered very similar content; see Appendix C for details on the design and
implementation of both the low- and the high-stakes tests.
  Figure 2 presents a timeline of the project, with implementation related activities listed
below the line, and research related activities above the line. The baseline survey was
conducted in February 2013, followed by an endline survey (with low-stakes testing) in
October 2013. The high-stakes tests by Twaweza were conducted in November 2013. A
similar calendar was followed in 2014. The trial registry record and the pre-analysis plan
are available at: https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/291.


3.3    Summary Statistics and Validity
The randomization was successful and observable characteristics of students, house-
holds, schools, and teachers are balanced across treatment arms; as are the normalized
baseline test scores in each grade-subject (Table 1). Table 1 also provides summary statis-
tics on the (representative) study population. The average student is 9 years old and
∼50% are male (Panel A). The schools are mostly rural (85%), mean enrollment is ∼730,
and class sizes are large — with an average of over 55 students per teacher (Panel C).19
Teachers in our sample were ∼2/3 female, ∼40 years old, had ∼15 years of experience,
and ∼40% of them did not have a teaching certificate (Panel D).
   Attrition on the low-stakes tests conducted by the research team is balanced across
treatment arms and is low — we were able to track around 90% of students in both
  18 Because  most of the survey questions focused on educational expenditures, including those in the
previous school year, we did not survey first-grade students in the first year of the study as they were
typically not attending school in the previous year. In the second year of the study, a representative
sample of second graders (the initial cohort of first graders) was added to the household survey.
  19 Thus, total enrollment in study schools was over 250,000 (350 x ∼730). Total enrollment in the focal

grades for the study (grades 1, 2, and 3) was a little over 120,000 students.


                                                   11
years, with slightly lower attrition in the second year (last two rows of Table 1: Panel A).
On the high-stakes tests, there is no differential student attendance in Incentive schools
relative to the control group, but attendance in Combination schools was higher (Table
A.3). We therefore present bounds of treatment effects on high-stakes tests, using the
approach of Lee (2009).


3.4    Empirical Strategy
Our main estimating equation for school-level outcomes takes the form:

             Ysdt = α0 + α1 Grantss + α2 Incentivess + α3 Combinations + γd + γt + Xs α4 + ε sdt ,               (1)


 where Ysdt is the outcome of interest in school s in district d at time t. Grantss is an
indicator variable for a school s receiving only the capitation grant program, Incentivess
indicates a school s that received only the teacher incentive program, and Combinations
indicates if a school s received both programs. γd and γt are district (strata) and year
fixed effects, and Xs is a set of school-level controls to increase precision. We use a
similar specification to examine teacher-level outcomes such as self-reported effort. All
standard errors are clustered at the school-level.
   We use the following estimating equation to study effects on learning outcomes:

  Zisdt = δ0 + δ1 Grants + δ2 Incentivess + δ3 Combinations + γz Zisd,t=0 + γd + γg + Xi δ4 + Xs δ5 + ε isdt ,   (2)


 where Zisdt is the normalized test score of student i in school s in district d at time t
(normalized with respect to the control-group distribution on the same test). Zisd,t=0 are
normalized baseline test scores, γd and γg are district (strata) and grade fixed effects. Xi
is a series of student characteristics (age, gender and grade), and Xs is a set of school and
teacher characteristics. We also report robustness to dropping the school-level controls.
   We focus on test scores in math, English, and Kiswahili as our primary outcomes, and
also study impacts on science (not a focal subject) to test if gains in focal subjects were
achieved at the cost of other subjects (multi-tasking). To mitigate concerns about the
potential for false positives due to multiple hypothesis testing across academic subjects,
we also create a composite summary measure of test scores, by using the first component
from a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the scores of the three subjects.
   Since high-stakes tests were only conducted in incentive schools, combination schools,
and a random set of 40 control schools, we estimate impacts on this sample (without
Grantss ). Further, because the high-stakes exam was conducted only at the end of the
year, we do not have baseline test scores or other student-level controls. Finally, student-


                                                       12
level data on high-stakes tests were only available in the second year.
   Following our pre-analysis plan, we prioritize results using low-stakes tests, but present
results on high-stakes tests to enable comparison with the literature on teacher incen-
tives. We jointly estimate the impacts of all interventions in a pooled regression and
present estimates for all interventions together in the tables below. However, for clar-
ity of exposition, we first discuss the impacts of each treatment (Grants, Incentives,
and Combination) individually, and then test for complementarities (specifically, we test
H0 : δ3 − δ2 − δ1 = 0) and discuss those results.


4       Results

4.1     Capitation Grant Program
4.1.1    How Were Grants Spent?

Table 2 (columns 1-3) presents descriptive statistics on how Grant schools spent their
extra funds. Textbooks and classroom teaching aids (like maps, charts, blackboards,
chalk, etc.) were the largest category of spending, jointly accounting for ∼65% of average
spending over the two years. Administrative costs, including wages of non-teaching staff
(e.g., cooks, janitors, and security guards) accounted for ∼27% of spending. Smaller
fractions (∼7%) were allocated to student support programs such as meal programs,
and very little (∼1%) was spent on construction and repairs. There were essentially no
funds allocated to teachers, in compliance with program rules.
   Schools also saved some of the grant funds (∼20% and ∼40% of grant value in the first
and second year). Since schools knew that the Grant program would end after two years,
and government funding streams were uncertain (both in terms of timing and amount),
we interpret this as “precautionary saving” and/or “consumption smoothing” behavior
by schools (as also seen in Sabarwal et al. (2014)). The possibility of outright theft was
minimized by the careful review of expenditures conducted by the Twaweza team (and
the prior announcements that such audits would take place).

4.1.2    Did Grants Change other Spending?

Table 3 examines the extent to which receiving the Grant program led to changes in
school and household spending. Column 1 presents total extra spending from the
Twaweza grant program. Schools that received Twaweza capitation grants saw a re-
duction in school expenditures from other sources (Column 2). Aggregating across both


                                            13
years, schools receiving the Grants program saw a reduction in school spending from
other sources of ∼2,400 TZS per student, which is around a third of the additional
spending enabled by the Grant program (Panel C - Columns 1 and 2).20
   Since average school spending per student (excluding teacher salaries) in the control
group was ∼5,200 TZS, spending the full grant value of 10,000 TZS would have tripled
this amount. After accounting for savings and reductions in school spending, there was
still a significant net increase in discretionary school spending per student of ∼4,700 TZS
— almost double the expenditure relative to the control group (Panel C - Column 3).21
   Next, we examine changes in household spending (Column 4) and report total net
per-student spending, accounting for both school and household spending (Column 5).
Consistent with the results documented by Das et al. (2013), we see an insignificant
reduction in household spending by ∼1,000 TZS per student in the first year, and a
larger significant reduction of ∼2,200 TZS per student in the second year (p = 0.07).
The main categories of spending where we see cuts are fees, textbooks, and food (Table
A.2).22 Taken together, the reductions in school and household spending attenuated
the impact of the Twaweza grant on per-student spending, but did not fully offset it.
On net, Grant schools saw a significant average increase in per-student (discretionary)
spending of ∼3,100 TZS/year (Panel C, Column 5), a 60% increase relative to mean
school-spending per student in the control group (excluding teacher salaries).

4.1.3      Did Grants Improve Learning?

Despite the significant increase in per-pupil funding seen above, there was no difference
in test scores between Grant and control schools in low-stakes tests of math, English or
Kiswahili in either year of our study. Point estimates of impact on a composite measure
of test scores were -0.03σ after one year and 0.01σ after two years (both insignificant;
Panel A in Table 4).23 Offsets are unlikely to be the main reason for our results, as we
  20 Our analysis of school finances suggests that these expenditure reductions are due to both reduction
in receipts of regular capitation grants by schools receiving Twaweza grants, as well as increased saving of
funds from the regular capitation grant by schools. Since we care most about actual increases in spending
and their impact on learning, we focus on expenditure as opposed to income or savings.
  21 We focus our analysis on discretionary spending at the school level (that is mainly funded by the

government’s capitation grants to schools) and exclude items like teacher salaries that are outside the
control of the schools. If teacher salaries are included, the net increase in school spending was 16%.
  22 Das et al. (2013) posit that the time pattern in the reduction of household spending is likely explained

by the grants being unanticipated in the first year, and anticipated in the second one. Similar reasons may
apply in our setting. It is also possible that some of the reductions (like fees and textbooks) are driven by
schools expecting parents to contribute less in the second year after receiving the Twaweza grant.
  23 Grade retention was not an outcome of interest in our pre-analysis plan because Tanzanian education

policy stipulates that grade promotion is mostly automatic in the early years of school. We test and
confirm that there was no difference in grade retention across the treatment groups (Table A.11)


                                                     14
do not see any impacts of the grant on test scores even in the first year, when the net
increase in discretionary spending per student in Grant schools was three times greater
than in the second year (Table 3, Column 5). Overall, our results are consistent with and
add to a large body of research that finds that merely increasing school resources rarely
improves student learning outcomes in developing countries (including Glewwe et al.
(2009) in Kenya, Blimpo et al. (2015) in Gambia, Das et al. (2013) in India, Pradhan et al.
(2014) in Indonesia, and Sabarwal et al. (2014) in Sierra Leone).


4.2       Teacher incentives
On the low-stakes tests administered by the research team, test scores in Incentive
schools are modestly higher than those in the control group, but typically not signifi-
cant (Table 4: Panel A). The composite treatment effect at the end of the first year was
0.06σ (p = 0.09), and at the end of two years it was 0.03σ (not significant).
  However, students in Incentive schools were significantly more likely to pass the high-
stakes Twaweza tests (the metric that bonuses were based on). At the end of two years,
they were 37%, 17%, and 70% more likely to pass the Twaweza tests in math, Kiswahili,
and English (all significant). These correspond to a 7.7, 7.3, and 2.1 percentage-point
increase in the passing rate relative to the mean control group passing rate of 21%, 44%,
and 3% in these subjects (Table A.1). Pass rates were also higher on all three subjects after
the first year (though not significant in English). On normalized test scores, students
in Incentive schools scored 0.17σ, 0.12σ, 0.12σ higher on math, Kiswahili, and English
(p < 0.05), and 0.21σ higher (p < 0.01) on the composite measure (Table 4: Panel B).24
  We now consider possible reasons for the difference in estimated impacts across the
two sets of tests. First, the content of the tests was very similar and so the differences
are unlikely to be explained by test content. Second, Twaweza employed strict security
protocols for the high-stakes test (as mentioned in Section 2.2.2), including having ten
different versions of the test paper that were randomized across students in the same
class, and having independent proctors present for every test. So, the likelihood of
cheating was minimized. Third, low-stakes tests were conducted ∼3 weeks before high-
stakes test in both years. Since schools often conduct reviews and practice exams at
the end of the school year, the superior performance on high-stakes tests could reflect
this additional preparation (which was likely more intense in the Incentive schools).
  24 We only have student-level data on the high-stakes tests in the second year. In the first year, Twaweza
only recorded if students passed each test, which was the only metric needed to calculate teacher bonuses.
Hence, we can estimate effects on passing the Twaweza test in both years, but can only calculate effects on
normalized test scores in the second year.



                                                    15
However, the performance on the low-stakes test does not seem to vary as a function of
the number of days between the two tests (Table A.5).
   A final possibility is differences in student effort and testing conditions across the two
sets of tests. During the low-stakes test, only a small (but representative) sample of
students were tested while the rest of the school functioned as if it were a regular school
day. On the other hand, the high-stakes tests implemented by Twaweza were conducted
in a more visible manner, where all other non-academic school activities were canceled
to allow all grade 1, 2, and 3 students to take the test in as quiet an environment as
possible. In addition, many schools opted to use the Twaweza exams as the official
end of year exam for grades 1, 2, and 3. Further, qualitative interviews suggest that
teachers were more likely to have emphasized the importance of these tests to students
(since bonus payments depended on performance on these tests). Hence, students and
teachers were likely to have been more motivated by the Twaweza exams.
   Taken together, we conjecture that the main reason for the variation in estimated treat-
ment effects across tests is the greater salience of the high-stakes tests in the Incentive
schools and a resulting increase in student effort on these tests. The estimated differ-
ence in the treatment effects across the two sets of tests — 0.10-0.15σ, is exactly in line
with recent experimental estimates that quantify the role of testing-day student effort on
measured test scores (Levitt, List, Neckermann, & Sadoff, 2016; Gneezy et al., 2017).
   The confirmation that test-taking effort is a salient component of measured test scores
by Levitt et al. (2016) and Gneezy et al. (2017) presents a conundrum for education
researchers as to what the appropriate measure of human capital should be for assessing
the impact of education interventions. On one hand, low-stakes tests may provide a
better estimate of a true measure of human capital that does not depend on external
stimuli for performance. On the other hand, test-taking effort is costly, and students
may not demonstrate their true potential under low-stakes testing, in which case, an
‘incentivized’ testing procedure may be a better measure of true human capital.
   Following our pre-analysis plan, we focus on the low-stakes tests in this paper because
these were conducted by the research team (as opposed to the implementation team) and
were conducted in all treatment groups, which is essential to test for complementarities
(high-stakes tests were not carried out in Grant schools). Yet, given recent evidence
on the importance of test-taking effort for measured test scores, and the fact that most
existing studies of teacher incentives have reported results based on the high-stakes tests,
some readers (including authors of meta-analyses of teacher incentives) may prefer to
focus on the estimates from the high-stakes tests for cost-effectiveness calculations and
comparing with existing studies. We present both sets of results for completeness.


                                             16
4.3     Combination of Capitation Grant and Teacher Incentives
4.3.1      Grant Expenditure and Offsets

Combination schools spent their extra grant funds in a similar manner as those receiving
only the grants (Table 2: Columns 4-6) and we find no significant difference in expen-
diture patterns of these funds between the Grant schools and the Combination schools
(Column 7). Similar to the Grant schools, we find a reduction in school and household
expenditures in the Combination schools as well (Table 3: Columns 2 and 4). As in the
case of the Grant schools, these responses attenuated the impact of the Twaweza grant
on per-student spending, but did not fully offset it.25 On net, Combination schools saw
a significant increase in per-student discretionary spending of ∼4,600 TZS/year (Panel
C, Column 5), a 90% increase relative to mean per-student spending in control schools.

4.3.2      Impact on Test Scores

After one year, relative to the control group, students in Combination schools scored
0.10σ higher on the low-stakes tests in all three focal subjects, and scored 0.12σ higher
on the composite measure (p < 0.05 in all cases, Table 4: Panel A). After two years,
they scored 0.20σ, 0.21σ, 0.18σ higher on math, Kiswahili, and English, and scored 0.23σ
higher on the composite measure of learning (p < 0.01 in all cases).26
   Turning to the high-stakes test scores, at the end of the second year, students in Com-
bination schools scored 0.25σ, 0.23σ, 0.22σ higher on math, Kiswahili, and English, and
scored 0.36σ higher on the composite measure (p < 0.01 in all cases, Table 4: Panel
B).27 Pass rates (which bonuses were based on) were also higher. At the end of two
years, students in Combination schools were 49%, 31%, and 116% more likely to pass
the Twaweza-administered high-stakes test in math, Kiswahili, and English (p < 0.01 in
all cases, Table A.1). These correspond to 10.3, 13.6, and 3.5 percentage-point increases
relative to the control means of 21%, 44%, and 3%. Pass rates were also higher for all
three subjects after the first year (though not significant in English).
   Thus, regardless of whether we use the high-stakes tests (conducted by Twaweza) or
  25 The   magnitudes of the reduction in school and household spending are lower in the Combination
schools than in the Grant schools. However, the differences are not significant (Panel C - last row).
   26 These results include students who were only treated for one year (e.g., third graders in the first year

of the program and first graders during the second year), and students who were treated in both years.
Appendix Table A.6 shows the results using only the students who were exposed to the interventions in
both years. We find very similar results among this group.
   27 Due to the differential attendance rates between Combination and control schools on the high-stakes

tests (Table A.3), we estimate Lee (2009) bounds on the treatment effects and find that the treatment effect
is still positive and significant for every subject as well as the composite measure of learning (Table A.4).


                                                     17
the low-stakes tests (conducted by the research team), students in schools that received
both programs had significantly higher test scores than those in control schools.


4.4     Complementarities Across Programs
Using the low-stakes conducted in all schools, we find strong evidence of complementar-
ities between the grant and incentive programs. Specifically, after two years, the impact
of the Combination program on test scores was significantly greater than the sum of the
impacts of the Grant and Incentive programs on their own. This difference is significant
for every academic subject and also for the composite measure of learning (α4 in Table
4: Panel A). The point estimate for complementarities is also positive in all subjects
after one year, but not always significant. These complementarities are quantitatively
important. Point estimates on the composite measure of learning for the Combination
treatment are over three times the size of the sum of the impact of the Grant and Incen-
tives treatments in the first year, and over five times greater in the second year.
   Since the number of students who passed the exams (on which the bonuses were paid)
was higher in the Combination schools than in the Incentive schools (Table A.1), the total
amount spent per student in the Combination schools was slightly (3.5%) higher than
the sum of the per-student spending in the Grant and Incentive schools.28 We therefore
test for α3 = 1.035 * (α1 + α2 ) and strongly reject equality (p < 0.01). Since grant spending
is the same in both Combination and Grant schools, but incentive payments were 12%
higher in Combination schools than in Incentive schools, we also test for α3 = α1 +
1.12 * α2 and reject equality (p < 0.02). In short, school inputs appear to be effective
when teachers have incentives to use them effectively, but not otherwise. Conversely,
motivated teachers (either for non-financial reasons or through incentives) can be more
effective with additional educational inputs.
   While we cannot test for complementarities on the high-stakes tests (because these
were not conducted in Grant schools), we see suggestive evidence of complementarities
here as well using two different approaches. First, if we assume that the impact of the
Grant program on its own is zero (based on Table 4: Panel A), then we can interpret
the significant difference on the high-stakes tests between Combination and Incentive
  28 Specifically,per student program spending in Grant, Incentive, and Combination schools was
USD 5.89, 2.52, and 8.71 respectively. Thus spending in Combination schools was 3.5% higher
((8.71/(5.89+2.52)) than the sum of spending in the Grant and Incentive schools. The additional spend-
ing is small because a large fraction of the bonus payments are made to teachers based on students who
would have passed anyway (as seen by the pass rate in the control group), and so the additional incentive
payment in Combination schools is only 12% higher ((8.71-5.89)/2.52).




                                                   18
schools as evidence of complementarities (β 5 in Table 4: Panel B).29 A second approach
is to compare the difference between Combination and Incentive schools (which reflects
the impact of the “Grant” and the “complementarities”) on both the high-stakes and
low-stakes tests. We cannot reject that this difference is zero (β 5 - α5 in last row of
Table 4: Panel C), except for Kiswahili (p-value 0.05). In other words, the estimated
effects of the “Grant plus complementarities” are similar across the low- and high-stakes
tests. These results are consistent with the idea that the high stakes boost the “levels”
of test scores in both Incentive and Combination schools, but that the magnitude of the
complementarities with school inputs was similar on both sets of tests.
   The experimental evidence of complementarities across school inputs and teacher in-
centives is our most important and original result. This has (to the best of our knowl-
edge) not been shown experimentally to date, though there is suggestive prior evidence
of complementarities between teacher incentives and inputs in prior work. For instance,
Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2011b) and Muralidharan (2012) find greater impacts
of teacher performance pay in cases where teachers have higher education and training,
suggesting complementarity between inputs (teacher knowledge) and incentives. More
recently, Gilligan et al. (2018) conduct a randomized evaluation of a teacher performance
pay program in Uganda and find that there was no impact on learning in schools that
had no textbooks, but that there was a significant positive impact in schools with text-
books (consistent with our findings in neighboring Tanzania). Finally, Andrabi, Das,
Khwaja, Ozyurt, and Singh (2018) find positive effects on learning outcomes from pro-
viding unconditional grants to private schools (in contrast with the literature finding no
effects of such grants on learning outcomes in public schools), which may be explained
by private schools having better incentives to use their resources effectively.
   Yet this evidence is only suggestive because teacher education and training, or text-
books, or the incentives of private school managers are not randomly assigned and
may be correlated with other omitted variables. In contrast, the current study features
random assignment of both treatments and their interaction, and is adequately pow-
ered to either detect or rule out economically meaningful complementarities (defined
as a magnitude comparable to those of the main effects). This allows us to experimen-
tally demonstrate the presence and importance of complementarities between input and
incentive-based policies for improving learning outcomes.
  29 This difference is significant even after Lee-bounds based adjustment of confidence intervals for dif-
ferential attrition (β 4 in Table A.4.)

4.5     Other Results
4.5.1   Multi-tasking

An important concern with teacher performance-pay schemes is the risk that such pro-
grams could encourage teachers to focus on incentivized subjects at the cost of other
subjects or activities; a classic case of the multi-tasking problem (Holmstrom & Milgrom,
1991). On the other hand, if these programs are able to improve students’ literacy and
numeracy skills, they may promote student learning even in other non-incentivized sub-
jects. Thus, the impact of performance-pay on non-incentivized outcomes will depend
on the extent to which the effort needed to improve incentivized and non-incentivized
outcomes are complements or substitutes (see Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2011b)
for a more detailed discussion).
   We test for these possibilities by looking at impacts on science, a non-incentivized
subject that was included in our battery of low-stakes student assessments. Results on
science are consistent with those on the other subjects, with no impact in the Grant and
Incentives treatments, and positive impacts in Combination schools (Table 5). Further,
mirroring the patterns we see on the incentivized subjects, we find evidence of com-
plementarities between grants and incentives in science in the second year. Overall, the
results suggest that teacher incentives on math and language in this setting did not hurt
learning in other subjects, and may have even helped it when the gains in math and
language were significant (as was the case in Combination schools).

4.5.2   Intra-school Resource Allocation

For the Grant and Combination schools, the value of the school grant was based on
the total enrollment across all grades (with the same per-student value of 10,000 TZS).
However, it is possible that schools may have spent the funds unequally across grades.
In particular, since performance on the grade 7 primary-school exit exam is an externally
salient metric that governments and parents focus on, schools may have chosen to divert
some of the grant to students in later grades (especially grade 7).
  We test for cross-grade diversion by examining spending on textbooks (an expenditure
category that can be mapped to grades) across students in Grades 1 to 3 (focal grades for
the study) and Grades 4-7 (non-study grades). Grant schools spent nearly 40% more on
textbooks in higher grades; however, we see no such pattern in the Combination schools,
where per-student textbook spending is similar across grades (Table 6). This difference
may be explained by the presence of teacher incentives for learning outcomes in lower


                                           20
grades in the Combination schools but not in Grant schools.
  Finally, we examine impacts on student performance on the Primary School Leaving
Examination (PSLE) taken by students in Grade 7, and find no evidence of any impact
of any of the treatment arms on this metric, both in terms of average scores or pass rates
(Table 5: Columns 3-6). Thus, despite textbook spending in grades 4-7 increasing to
nearly triple the value in the control group, we find no impact on 7th grade test scores
in either the Grant schools or the Combination schools. These results again suggest that
teacher incentives were key to making effective use of the additional resources (since
Combination schools only had incentives for Grades 1-3 and not for Grade 7).30

4.5.3   Heterogeneity

Since the incentive formula rewarded teachers based on the number of students who
passed a threshold, teachers in Incentive and Combination schools may have focused
more on students near the passing threshold (as shown by Neal and Schanzenbach (2010)
in the US). We test for heterogeneity of effects as a function of distance of student test-
scores from the passing threshold. Since the passing score varies by grade and subject,
we define the “distance from the threshold” as the absolute value of the difference in a
students’ own percentile and the percentile of the passing threshold. This allows us to
pool across grades and subjects for power. Overall, we find no evidence of differential
treatment effects as a function of either the average or the square of distance from the
passing threshold and report the results in Table A.9.31
   Next, we test for heterogeneity by student, teacher, and school characteristics using
Equation 1, and adding interactions of the treatment with each covariate. As above, we
use the low-stakes tests, and focus on the composite index of test scores. The interaction
coefficients of interest are reported in Table 7, with columns 1-3, 4-6, and 7-9 focusing on
heterogeneity by student, teacher, and school characteristics respectively.
   Overall, the treatments seem to have helped disadvantaged students more. In Com-
bination schools (where treatment effects are positive and significant), girls, and those
with lower initial test scores gain more. Results are not as robust for the Grant and
  30 There  is some evidence of complementarities on Grade 7 test scores in the second year (p-value 0.08).
However, since the Combination program had no impact per se and there is no evidence of complemen-
tarities in the first year, we see this as suggestive evidence.
  31 This is a robust result. Since this was a dimension on which we expected to find some heterogeneity

(as seen in our pre-analysis plan), we tested for this possibility using several possible functional forms and
definitions of “distance from the passing threshold”, but we never reject the null of no heterogeneity along
this dimension. This result validates Twaweza’s hypothesis (which informed the design of the Incentive
program) that differential targeting of students by teachers was unlikely given the very low absolute levels
of learning seen in this setting and the modest gains needed to achieve a passing score.


                                                     21
Incentive schools, but are broadly consistent (columns 1-3).32 We find little evidence of
heterogeneity by measures of teacher age, gender, or salary (columns 4-6), and some
suggestive evidence of heterogeneity by school characteristics (columns 7-9). On the lat-
ter, schools scoring higher on an index of facilities show higher gains when they receive
teacher incentives (Column 7). This is consistent with our experimental findings on the
complementarities of school inputs and incentives.
   We also find suggestive evidence of greater effects of receiving school grants (sig-
nificantly so in Combination schools) when schools are better managed, as measured
by a management practices survey administered to the head teacher. These results are
consistent with growing recent evidence on the importance of school management in
the education production function (see Bloom, Lemos, Sadun, and Van Reenen (2015);
Lemos, Muralidharan, and Scur (2018)). They are also consistent with our main result
of complementarities between school inputs and conditions where these inputs are used
well. However, since we did not pre-specify this hypotheses, we simply report the re-
sults for completeness and leave it to future work to explicitly test for complementarities
between management quality and school resources.


5      Discussion

5.1         Theoretical Framework
Our results confirm the lack of impact of inputs on their own, but also show that inputs
can improve learning when teachers are motivated to do so. To help interpret our results,
we present a simple stylized theoretical framework in Appendix B. The model specifies a
production function for test scores (that is increasing in school inputs and teacher effort),
teacher utility, and a minimum learning constraint below which teachers get sanctioned.
It clarifies that the impact of an education intervention on learning outcomes will depend
on both the production function and behavioral responses by teachers.
   The model highlights that it is only under the implicit (and usually unstated) assump-
tion that teachers have non-monetary motivation to improve learning that increasing in-
    32 Wealso examine heterogeneity of program impacts by non-parametrically plotting treatment effects
as a function of baseline test scores (which are a good summary statistic of all prior inputs into human
capital creation). Consistent with the overall zero effects in Grants schools, we find no significant effect
at any part of the baseline test-score distribution, though weaker students seem to have benefited more
in the second year. Students in Incentive schools scored higher than those in control schools at nearly all
points in the baseline distribution, but effects are typically not significant. Finally, students in Combination
schools did better than those in the control schools at every point in the baseline score distribution, with
the effects being significant at all points in the distribution in the second year (Figure A.1).


                                                      22
puts should be expected to improve test scores. In contrast, if teachers behave like agents
in standard economic models (with disutility of effort and limited non-monetary utility
from teaching), then increasing inputs may lead to a reduction of effort and no change
in learning, even if there are production function complementarities between inputs
and teacher effort. The intuition is straightforward: when inputs increase, teachers can
achieve the minimum learning-level constraint with lower effort. However, providing
incentives to teachers will typically raise the optimal effort when inputs are increased,
giving rise to policy complementarities between providing inputs and incentives.33
  While this model is not the only possible explanation for our results, it provides an
intuitive and parsimonious framework to interpret our experiment and results, as well
as existing results in the literature. In addition to the several experimental studies in
developing countries cited earlier that find no impact on test scores from providing ad-
ditional inputs, there is also considerable evidence that teachers in developing countries
reduce effort when provided with more resources.34 The model can explain all of these
existing results and helps to clarify the importance of teacher motivation (either financial
or non-financial) in translating school inputs into learning outcomes.


5.2    Mechanisms
As suggested by the model above, a likely mechanism for the results we find is increased
teacher effort (due to the incentives) and increased effectiveness of this additional effort
when the teacher has more educational materials to work with. However, we do not
find impacts on survey-based measures of teacher attendance, and teacher self-reports
(Table A.8). Teacher absence rates are unchanged (consistent with Muralidharan and
Sundararaman (2011b)), and we find little systematic evidence of impact on self-reported
data on the number of practice tests given, or provision of remedial teaching.
   In practice, it is likely that the test-score results are driven by increased intensity of
  33 This  discussion also helps to clarify two important points regarding the study of complementarities
in human capital formation. First, though much of the theoretical literature focuses on production function
complementarities, the possibility of behavioral responses makes it difficult to identify these empirically.
Thus, even well-identified studies (including ours) will estimate policy and not production-function com-
plementarities. Second, even if there are production-function complementarities between two sets of
inputs, there may not be policy complementarities from providing both because the former may be offset
by a reduction in agent effort. In contrast, combining inputs and incentives is more likely to increase agent
effort, which increase the likelihood of complementarities (consistent with our findings).
   34 For instance, Duflo, Dupas, and Kremer (2015) find that providing a randomly selected set of primary

schools in Kenya with an extra contract teacher led to an increase in absence rates of teachers in treated
schools. Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2013) find the same result in an experimental study of contract
teachers in India. Finally, Muralidharan, Das, Holla, and Mohpal (2017) show, using panel data from India,
that reducing pupil-teacher ratios in public schools was correlated with an increase in teacher absence.



                                                     23
teaching effort within the classroom. However, this is difficult to measure well through
surveys and observations, and we do not have any direct evidence of this since we
prioritized collecting data on expenditure and outcomes and did not conduct classroom
observations. In addition to cost, this decision was also informed by prior work showing
considerable Hawthorne effects in measuring teacher classroom behavior (Muralidharan
& Sundararaman, 2010), rendering such measures unreliable for measuring treatment
effects on teacher effort.
   We do see two pieces of suggestive evidence of increased teacher effort in Combi-
nation schools. First, the increase in net expenditure (Table 3: Column 5) was higher
in Combination schools than in the Grant schools. The contrast is stronger in the sec-
ond year, when parents in Grant schools cut back their spending, whereas there are no
parental offsets in Combination schools (p = 0.11; last row of Panel B, Column 4). This
is consistent with increases in (unobservable) teacher effort in Combination schools, to
encourage parents to not reduce their own education spending in response to the school
grants. For example, Combination schools seem to have not offered any fee reductions in
the second year, while Grant schools did (Table A.2). Second, Combination schools spent
significantly more per student (543 TZS) on textbooks in incentivized grades (relative to
non-incentivized grades) compared to schools that only received the Grants (Table 6).
   Overall, while our direct measures of teacher effort are limited, the indirect evidence
from patterns of expenditure across Grant and Combination schools suggests that teach-
ers in Combination schools may have exerted more effort to ensure that an increase in
resources translated into improvements in learning as well.


5.3   Cost Effectiveness
Moving from treatment effects to cost-effectiveness calculations requires a discussion of
three additional issues. These include the cost of implementing the programs, discus-
sions on scaling of the magnitude of impacts at larger value of grants and incentives,
and whether we should rely on estimates from low-stakes or high-stakes tests.
  The main cost of implementing the capitation grant program was for conducting the
audits. The costs of implementing the teacher incentive program included those of inde-
pendently testing all the students, calculating bonuses, paying them out, and communi-
cating these details to teachers. The cost of implementing the Combination program was
the same as implementing the Incentives program (because the audits were conducted
during the same visit as that in which students were tested). Table A.10 provides the di-
rect and implementation costs of all three programs (per student). These are as follows:


                                           24
Grants — 5.89 and 1.24 USD (total of 7.13 USD); Incentives — 2.52 and 4.58 USD (total
of 7.10 USD); Combination — 8.71 and 4.58 USD (total of 13.29 USD).
  Our results using low-stakes tests suggest that neither the Grant nor Incentive pro-
grams were effective on their own and that only the Combination program was effective
(and hence cost effective). In Combination schools, we estimate that the cost of increas-
ing test scores by 0.1σ per student was 5.78 USD.
  We next consider the issue of scaling. Specifically, what would the impacts be if we
spent all the money from the Combination program on inputs or incentives? Doing
this requires us to make an assumption of a linear dose-response relationship between
per-student program spending and impact (which we justify below).35 Spending the full
value of the Combination program on inputs would yield a per-student input expendi-
ture of 12.05 USD (13.29 minus implementation cost of 1.24), which would be 2.05 times
greater than the value provided in the Grants treatment (5.89 USD). We therefore test
α3 = 2.05 * α1 in Table 4 (0.23 vs 0.02), and reject equality (p = 0.03). Thus, it is highly
unlikely that spending all the money on grants would have raised test scores by the
amount seen in the Combination schools.36
  If we spent the full amount of the Combination program on the Incentive program,
the value of the Incentives would be 8.71 USD (13.29 minus the implementation cost of
4.58), which is 3.45 times greater than the bonuses provided in the Incentives treatment.
Conducting a similar test, the point estimate of α3 is greater than 3.45 * α2 in Table 4
  35 Our  experiment was designed to test for complementarities among two program as implemented: i.e.
is the impact of providing two programs together greater than the sum of the impacts of providing them
individually. But, this design requires a linearity assumption for cost-effectiveness calculations against
a counterfactual of spending all the money in the Combination arm on one treatment. An alternative
experimental design would have been to allocate the same amount of money to Grant, Incentive, and
Combination schools (including implementation costs) to test for how the marginal dollar should be
optimally allocated (though even here, the researcher needs to decide how to split the fixed amount of
money between the two individual treatments in the Combination schools). However, while this design
can do cost effectiveness calculations without any further assumptions, it requires a linearity assumption
to test for complementarities since the individual treatments will now spend more on each treatment than
the joint one and the treatments are technically different across each treatment arm (see List et al. (2012)
for an example of such a research design in schools in Chicago). Thus, a functional form assumption
is unavoidable for simultaneously testing complementarities and doing cost-effectiveness calculations in
a study with three treatment arms. Our design prioritized testing for complementarities between two
identical policies as implemented, which is the textbook definition of complementarities.
   36 The linearity assumption is plausible here for 3 reasons. First, the grant spending was not for infras-

tructure or teachers (which could be ‘lumpy’ and subject to non-linearities in impact) but for books and
materials, which would vary more continuously. Second, we are not aware of any study that has found
evidence of non-linearities in the impact of school grants. Third, we find no heterogeneity of the impact
of either Grants of Combination by enrollment (Table 7: Column 8). The 5-95 percentile range of school
enrollment ranged from 235 to 2,602 students, yielding a range of USD 1,300 to USD 16,000 in grant value
across schools in this range. Thus, if there were meaningful economies of scale and non-linearities in the
use of inputs, we would expect to see some heterogeneity by enrollment, which we do not.


                                                     25
(0.23 vs 0.10), but this difference is not significant (p = 0.39). These calculations suggest
that we cannot rule out the possibility that spending all the money on incentives may
have been as cost-effective as spending on a combination of inputs and incentives.37
   This result is even stronger when we use estimates of treatment effects from the high-
stakes exams (which may provide better comparability with existing studies on teacher
incentives). Using these estimates, the cost of increasing test scores by 0.1σ per student
was USD 3.38 in Incentive schools and USD 3.69 in Combination schools. Performing
the same exercise as above, we now see that the point estimate of β 3 is considerably
less than 3.45 * β 2 in Table 4: Panel B (0.36 vs 0.72), and the difference is significant
(p = 0.09). These results suggest that spending all the money on incentives may be as
or more cost-effective than spending on a combination of inputs and incentives at the
current margin (where input spending is considerable and incentive spending is zero).
   A bonus is a different way of compensating teachers. Hence, in the medium-term, it
may be possible to implement teacher incentive programs at a lower cost by doing so
in the context of regular salary increases. Specifically, these could be replaced with a
cost-neutral alternative that has a lower base increase but greater performance-linked
pay.38 In such a scenario, the main long-term cost of a teacher incentive program is
the administrative cost of implementing the program (including costs of independent
measurement and recording of student learning) and not the cost of the bonus itself.39
Using the administrative costs in this study, the cost of increasing test scores by 0.1σ per
student would be USD 2.18 in Incentive schools and USD 2.9 in Combination schools
(including the input cost but not the incentive cost).40
   Overall, these estimates compare well with the estimated cost-effectiveness of several
other interventions to improve education in Africa. For instance, some of the interven-
tions with positive impacts on learning reviewed by Kremer, Brannen, and Glennerster
  37 While there is less evidence to motivate a functional form for the relationship between the extent of
teacher incentives and test score gains, one piece of suggestive evidence for linearity comes from Muralid-
haran (2012). The paper finds that individual teacher incentives strongly outperform group incentives
over five years, but effects are comparable if the group incentive treatment is coded as 1/n as the indi-
vidual incentive treatment (where n is the number of teachers in the group incentive schools). Thus, the
estimated treatment effect was proportional to the value of the incentives teachers faced at the individual
level — suggesting a linear dose-response relationship.
  38 Such an approach may be especially promising to consider because typical across-the-board teacher

salary increases are unlikely to have any positive impact on the effectiveness of incumbent teachers as
shown recently by de Ree et al. (2018).
  39 We abstract away from a risk-aversion premium that may need to be paid, because this will be second

order for small spreads in pay and typical values of risk-aversion parameters.
  40 With a linear dose-response relationship between bonus size and performance, the cost effectiveness

of incentives can be increased considerably by increasing the mean-preserving spread of pay (increasing
the share of the bonus). If we were to spend all the money from the combination program on incentives,
the cost per 0.1σ per student would fall to 0.63 USD.


                                                    26
(2013) include: a conditional cash transfer in Malawi, with a cost of USD 100 per 0.1σ
gain per student (Baird, McIntosh, & Özler, 2011); scholarships for girls in Kenya, with a
cost of USD 7.14/0.1σ (Kremer, Miguel, & Thornton, 2009); contract teachers and stream-
ing in Kenya, with a cost of USD 5/0.1σ (Duflo et al., 2015; Duflo, Dupas, & Kremer,
2011); and teacher incentives in Kenya (evaluated using data from high-stakes tests),
with a cost of USD 1.59/0.1σ (Glewwe et al., 2010).41 Thus, the only program more cost
effective than the ones we study here was also a teacher-incentive program. In addi-
tion, many education interventions have either zero effect or provide no cost data for
cost-effectiveness calculations (Evans & Popova, 2016).
   Taken together, our results suggest that reforms to teacher compensation structure
that reward improving student learning can be highly cost-effective relative to the status
quo of education spending, that is largely input-based. Further, the complementarities
of teacher incentives with inputs suggest that improving teacher incentives may also
improve the effectiveness of existing school inputs. Thus, our 2x2 experimental design
is only needed to identify complementarities by ensuring that both policies are changed
exogenously. From a policy perspective, if status quo spending on inputs is high, and
on incentives is zero, the marginal return of improving the latter may be higher.


6      Conclusion
We report findings from a large randomized controlled trial conducted across a repre-
sentative sample of 350 Tanzanian schools and over 120,000 students that studied the
impact of three different programs to improve learning in early grades. These included
unconditional school grants to alleviate school resource constraints; bonus payments
to teachers based on student learning outcomes to improve teacher motivation and ef-
fort; and both of the above. Consistent with the existing evidence, we find that merely
increasing school resources via school grants does little to improve learning outcomes.
Also consistent with prior evidence from developing countries, the teacher incentive pro-
gram led to improvements in student learning (but only on high-stakes tests). Test scores
in schools that received both programs were significantly higher on both high-stakes and
low-stakes tests. Moreover, we find strong evidence of complementarities between in-
puts and incentives with the effect of providing both being significantly greater than the
sum of the individual effects.
    41 We
        use up to date numbers released in a standardized template by The Abdul Latif Jameel
Poverty Action Lab at https://www.povertyactionlab.org/policy-lessons/education/increasing-test-
score-performance. We only include estimates from peer-reviewed published studies.



                                              27
   The evidence of complementarities suggests that there may be multiple binding con-
straints to improving learning outcomes in developing countries. In such a setting,
policies that alleviate some constraints but not others may have a limited impact on
outcomes. This point is exemplified by the large and growing body of evidence on
the limited impact on learning outcomes of simply providing more resources (and re-
inforced by our results on the Grant program). At the same time, our results highlight
that these additional resources can significantly improve outcomes if accompanied by
improved incentives to use them effectively.
   Conversely, even well-motivated staff may not be able to deliver services effectively if
they lack even the basic resources to do so. The positive effects of Incentives on their own
(on the high-stakes tests) are consistent with schools having at least some resources to
work with. But the complementarity with Grants clearly points to the fact that a lack of
resources could be a binding constraint to quality improvement for motivated teachers.42
   Our results may be relevant for the design of development interventions more gener-
ally. Cross-country evidence suggests that foreign aid (inputs) may be more effective in
countries with more growth-friendly policies (a proxy for likelihood of using resources
well) (Burnside & Dollar, 2000), but these results are not very robust (Easterly, Levine,
& Roodman, 2004). Our results finding no impact of inputs on their own, and strong
complementarities between inputs and incentives provides well-identified evidence of
the Burnside and Dollar (2000) hypothesis in the context of a sector (education), that ac-
counts for a sixth of developing country government spending (World Bank, 2015) and
over fifteen billion dollars of aid spending annually (OECD, 2016).
   Finally, we note that the default pattern of social sector spending in most countries
(and also in donor led development assistance programs) is to expand school inputs.
These include both physical inputs, and programs for teacher training and capacity
building. Our results show that the marginal returns of introducing reforms to better
reward improved teacher effort and student learning may be particularly high in settings
where inputs are being expanded. Of course, implementing teacher performance-pay
systems will require investments in implementation capacity, but our estimates suggest
that this could be a cost-effective investment and that doing so may meaningfully expand
state capacity for improved service delivery in developing countries.43
  42 Indeed, one reason for why many senior policy makers may genuinely believe that resource constraints
are binding is that officials who have been promoted and risen to the top of their institutional hierarchies
are more likely to have higher intrinsic motivation. It is thus more likely that the binding constraints for
these officials are resources and not motivation.
  43 Since the integrity of measurement may be compromised if implemented through the government it-

self, one viable option for scaling up the implementation of performance-pay programs may be for govern-
ments to partner with committed and credible local third-party organizations (like Twaweza) to conduct

       This table presents the mean and standard error of the mean (in parenthesis) for several characteristics of students in our sample
       (Panel A), households (Panel B), schools (Panel C) and teachers (Panel D) across treatment groups. The student sample consists of
       all students tested by the research team. The sample consists of 30 students sampled in year one (10 from grade 1, 10 from grade 2,
       and 10 from grade 3) and 10 students sampled in year 2 (from the new grade 1 cohort). The attrition in year 1 is measured using only
       the original 30 students sampled per school. The attrition in year 2 is measured using the sample of 30 students that are enrolled in
       grades 1, 2 and 3 in that year. Column 4 shows the p-value from testing whether the mean is equal across all treatment groups (H0 :=
       mean is equal across groups). The household asset index is the first component of a Principal Component Analysis of the following
       assets: Mobile phone, watch/clock, refrigerator, motorbike, car, bicycle, television and radio. The school infrastructure index is the
       first component of a Principal Component Analysis of indicator variables for: outer wall, staff room, playground, library, and kitchen.
       Standard errors are clustered at the school level for test of equality. ∗ p < 0.10, ∗∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗∗ p < 0.01

 Results from Estimating Equation 1 for grant expenditure per student, other school expenditure per student,
 total school expenditure per student, and household reported expenditure on education. All in TZ Shillings.
 Column (1) shows grant expenditure as the dependent variable. Column (2) shows other school expenditure.
 Column (3) shows total school expenditure. Column (4) shows household data on expenditure in education.
 Column (5) shows total expenditure (total school expenditure + household expenditure). Panel C regressions
 included data from both follow-ups, and therefore coefficients represent the average effect over both years.
 The coefficient for Incentives schools is not exactly zero in Column 1 due to school controls. 1 USD =1,600

  Results from estimating Equation 2 for different subjects at both follow-ups. Control variables include student characteristics (age,
  gender, grade and lag test scores), school characteristics (PTR, Infrastructure PCA index, indicator for whether the school is in an urban
  or rural location, a PCA index of how close is the school to different facilities, and an indicator for whether the school is single shift or
  not), and household characteristics (household size, a PCA wealth index, and education expenditure prior to the intervention). For Panel
  A, in the first year the weights of the three subjects to the PCA index are: 0.35 for Kiswahili, 0.3 for English, and 0.35 for Math. In the
  second year the weights of the three subjects to the PCA index are: 0.35 for Kiswahili, 0.31 for English, and 0.34 for Math. For Panel B,
  in the second year the weights of the three subjects to the PCA index are: 0.38 for Kiswahili, 0.24 for English, and 0.38 for Math. Panel
  B Year 1 results are not available due to data constraints (see text for details). Consequently, Panel C Year 1 is also not available. Sample
  sizes are larger in year 2 because the research team had more resources to prevent attrition. See Table A.7 for a version without school

  The dependent variable is the standardized composite (PCA) test score. Each regression has a different covariate interacted with the treatment dummies.
  The column title indicates the covariate interacted. The first three columns have the following covariates at the student level: the standardized test
  score at baseline; Gender, a dummy equal to one if the student is male; and the age in years. Columns 4-6 have the following covariates at the teacher
  level: a dummy if the teacher is male; the annual salary; and a dummy if the teacher claims it would choose another career path if they could start over
  at baseline. The teacher covariates are averaged across teachers in both years. Columns 7-9 have the following covariates as the school level: a dummy
  for whether the PCA index of facilities is above the median; the pupil-teacher ratio; and a dummy equal to one if the PCA index for managerial ability
  of the principal is above the median. Clustered standard errors, by school, in parentheses. ∗ p < 0.10, ∗∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗∗ p < 0.01

Note: These treatment and control lines are estimated using local linear regressions. The pointwise treatment effect
is calculated as the difference. The 95% confidence intervals are estimated using bootstrapping. The x-axis is the
percentile of the residual of a regression of a PCA index of the student’s test score across all subjects at baseline on
student and school characteristics. The y-axis is the residual of a regression of a PCA index of the student’s test score
across all subjects at each follow-up on student and school characteristics.

  The dependent variable is the standardized test score for different subjects. For
  each subject we present Lee (2009) bounds for all the treatment estimates (i.e.,
  trimming the left/right tail of the distribution in Incentive and Combination
  schools so that the proportion of test takes is the same as the number in control
  schools). Clustered standard errors, by school, in parentheses. ∗ p < 0.10, ∗∗

      The dependent variable is the standardized test score on the low-stakes test. The absolute
      value of the time difference (in days) between the low-stakes and the high-stakes exams is
      interacted with the treatment dummies. Panel A pool the data for the low-stakes exam of
      both years. Panel B uses data from the low-stakes exam in the first year. Panel C uses data
      from the low-stakes exam in the second year. The average difference in testing dates in
      the first year is 29.9 days. In the second year the average difference is 17 days. Clustered

  Results from estimating treatment effects on teacher behavior. Column (1) shows teacher
  attendance independently measured by enumerators during a surprise visit in the mid-

  measured by enumerators during a surprise visit in the middle of the school year. This
  was only measured during the second year of the experiment. Thus, there are fewer ob-
  servations than in other columns. Column (3) shows the number of tests per period as

  teacher provided any extra tutoring to students as the dependent variable. Column (5)
  shows a dummy variable that indicates whether the teacher provided remedial teaching
  to students as the dependent variable. All regressions include data from both follow-ups,

  The dependent variable is the standardized test score. The absolute value of the difference (in
  percentage points) between the baseline percentile and the overall pass rate (1-pass rate to be
  exact) in the control schools (in the high-stakes test) is interacted with the treatment dummies.
  For example, the pass rate in Grade 2 in the math test in Year 2 was 17%. Hence, a student in
  the 83 percentile would be right at the cutoff (and at a distance of zero). A student in the 20th
  percentile would be at a distance of 63 percentage points. A student in the 90th percentile would
  be at a distance of 7 percentage points. The value of the variable distance ranges from 0 to 1. Panel
  A interacts the treatment dummies with the absolute value of the distance. Panel B interacts the
  treatment dummies with the square value of the distance. Clustered standard errors, by school, in
  parentheses. ∗ p < 0.10, ∗∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗∗ p < 0.01

 Direct costs (in USD per student) reflect the cost of the program per se. For Grants, this
 is the cost of the Grants. In Incentive schools this is the cost of the teacher incentives. In
 Combination schools is the sum of the grants and the incentives. The Implementation
 costs (in USD per student) reflect the administrative cost of implementing the program.
 That is, any administrative cost of transferring the money, the cost of visiting schools
 for monitoring purposes (and to explain the program), testing teachers in Incentive and
 Combination schools, and financial audits in Grant and Combination schools. The total
 cost (in USD per student) is the sum of the direct and the implementation cost. The
 low-stakes and high-stakes treatment effects are for the PCA index of all subjects in the
 second year.

B    Theoretical Framework
We present a simple model of how changes in inputs and incentives translate into
changes in teacher effort and student learning outcomes. The model has three goals:
first, it clarifies that the impact of an education intervention on learning outcomes will
depend on both the production function and behavioral responses by teachers. In other
words, experiments will typically identify the “policy effect” of an intervention and not
the “production function” parameters (Todd & Wolpin, 2003). Second, it highlights that
it is only under the implicit (and usually unstated) assumption that teachers are intrin-
sically motivated that increasing inputs should be expected to improve test scores. In
contrast, if teachers behave like agents in standard economic models (with disutility
of effort and no intrinsic utility from their job), then increasing inputs may lead to a
reduction of effort and no change in learning, even if there are production function com-
plementarities between inputs and teacher effort. Finally, if there are complementarities
between effort and inputs in the production function, then providing incentives to teach-
ers may raise the optimal level of effort when inputs are increased, giving rise to policy
complementarities between providing inputs and incentives.
   Formally, we model teachers’ choice of effort (e) as solving the following problem:

                               max Ui (e) = W + λi ∆L − ci (e)                             (3)

                                         subject to


                                      W = S + b∆L                                        (3a)
                                      ∆L = f (e, I )                                     (3b)
                                      ∆L ≥ ∆L ≥ 0                                         (3c)

where W is total earnings, which is equal to a base salary (S) plus a bonus (b∆L) propor-
tional to gains in students’ learning ∆L (b is typically zero in practice). λi is a measure of
the teacher’s utility from improving student learning. This could reflect multiple factors
including intrinsic motivation, and supervision from parents and officials. Teacher ef-
fort, together with other inputs (I), translates into learning gains via f , which is strictly
increasing in both arguments ( f e > 0 and f I > 0), concave in each argument ( f ee < 0
and f I I < 0), and features complementarity between effort and inputs ( f eI > 0). Effort
entails a cost, ci , which is increasing and convex (ci0 (·) > 0 and ci00 (·) > 0). We allow
λi and ci to vary across teachers (indexed by i) to account for teacher heterogeneity. Fi-

                                             52
nally, we assume that learning gains cannot be negative and have to be over a minimum
level (∆L). This can be interpreted as the minimum level of learning (including that
taking place outside the school) required for teachers to not be sanctioned by parents or
supervisors.44
   Let emin ( I ) be the effort required to achieve ∆L at a level of inputs equal to I (i.e.,
f (emin , I ) = ∆L). Let emc
                          ∗ ( I ) be the effort at which the marginal cost of effort is equal to
                                           ∗ , I ) = c0 ( e∗ )). Thus, the level of effort chosen will
its marginal benefit (i.e., (λi + b) f e (emc         i mc
     ∗                        ∗
be e ( I ) = max(emin ( I ), emc ( I )).
   With the structure above, Figure B.2a illustrates how the optimal level of teacher effort
would vary with b + λi at two different levels of inputs (I1 > I0 ). Figure B.2b shows the
corresponding learning gains. In the absence of incentives or intrinsic motivation (i.e.,
b + λi = 0), it is Equation 3c that binds, and e∗ ( I ) = emin ( I ). Thus, if b + λi = 0, then
the marginal cost of effort is above the marginal benefit in equilibrium.45 Effort does not
change as b increases up to the point where the marginal benefit (b + λi ) is equal to the
marginal cost of providing effort. This corresponds to the flat region to the left of the
thresholds κ0 and κ1 in Figure B.2a.
   In the absence of incentives and for low values of λi (such that b + λi is near zero),
an increase in inputs will lead teachers to re-optimize and decrease the effort they exert.
The intuition is straightforward: if inputs increase, teachers can achieve the required
minimum ∆L with lower effort. This is consistent with evidence from multiple settings
showing that teachers in developing countries reduce effort when provided with more
resources.46 Since the binding constraint for effort continues to be Equation 3c, the
increase in inputs would lead to a reduction of effort to the point that allows ∆L to be
achieved, and there would be no net gain in learning as seen in Figure B.2b.
   Thus, in the absence of incentives for improving learning outcomes, the relationship
between extra inputs and improved test scores will depend on the distribution of λi in
the population of teachers. In settings where λi is high for most teachers, improving
  44 ∆L  ≥ ∆L ≥ 0 can also be motivated by intrinsic motivation considerations with teachers experiencing
disutility if outcomes are too low. This is a variant of Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991) where teachers have
a minimum outcome threshold as opposed to a minimum effort threshold below which they experience
disutility. In this case, ∆L would also vary by teacher.
  45 If λ > 0 the qualitative results do not change as long as λ is low enough that Equation 3c binds,
         i                                                         i
leading to e∗ ( I ) = emin ( I ).
  46 For instance, Duflo et al. (2015) find that providing a randomly selected set of primary schools in

Kenya with an extra contract teacher led to an increase in absence rates of teachers in treated schools.
Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2013) find the same result in an experimental study of contract teachers
in India. Finally, Muralidharan et al. (2017) show, using panel data from India, that reducing pupil-teacher
ratios in public schools was correlated with an increase in teacher absence.

school inputs may improve test scores.47 Increasing inputs lowers the threshold (from

κ0 to κ1 in Figure B.2a) that b + λi needs to exceed for Equation 3c to not bind, and for
effort to increase (because f eI > 0). This is another channel through which increasing
inputs could increase teacher effort and test scores (as seen in Figure B.2a, where κ1 < κ0
when I1 > I0 ). However, in settings where λi is low for most teachers (such as in many
developing countries with high levels of teacher absence), this may be less likely (since
λi + b = 0 may still be below κ1 ).
   If additional inputs are combined with performance-linked pay that increases b, then
the distribution of b + λi is shifted to the right, and for any given distribution of λi it
is more likely that teachers are shifted to the right of κ1 and find it optimal to increase
effort.48 Further, as discussed above, to the right of κ1 , the optimal amount of effort is
higher at higher levels of inputs (i.e., e∗I ( I1 ) > e∗I ( I0 ) if b + λi > κ1 ). Thus, as long as
Equation 3c is not binding, the complementarity in the production function ( f eI > 0) will
also yield complementarities in the policy effects.
   We do not formally test the model above because intensity of teacher effort is difficult
to measure accurately. We include the model to provide an intuitive and parsimonious
framework to interpret our experiment and results, as well as existing results in the
literature. Teacher effort in the model need not be restricted to classroom effort. It can
also include working with parents to provide inputs or effort at home.




outcomes in the US, but teacher utility from improving student outcomes in the US may be higher than in
developing countries (partly due to more educated parents and better supervision).
  48 While it is possible that the provision of incentives for performance may crowd out intrinsic motivation

(Deci & Ryan, 1985; Fehr & Falk, 2002), it is also possible that the opposite is true and that incentives can
crowd in intrinsic motivation by reinforcing the value of the task (Mullainathan, 2005). Empirical evidence
from education in developing countries suggests that performance-based pay increases teachers’ motivation
(Muralidharan & Sundararaman, 2011a). We assume therefore that λi and b are additively separable.

C     Test Design
The tests used in this evaluation were developed by Tanzanian education professionals,
and were similar in content to the tests used in the Uwezo annual learning assessment.49
The consultants developed two types of tests: a low-stakes test that was used for research
purposes and a high-stakes test that was used to by Twaweza to determine teacher
bonuses. Both types of tests were designed to match the national curriculum.


C.1    Low-stakes test
For data on student learning outcomes, we sampled and tested 10 students from each
focal grade (grades 1, 2 and 3) within each school, and followed these 30 students over
the course of the study. We refer to these as low-stakes (or non-incentivized) tests as they
are used purely for research purposes. Given the low levels of learning in Tanzania, we
conducted one-on-one tests in which a test enumerator sits with the student and guides
her/him through a large font test booklet. This improved data quality and also enabled
us to capture a wide range of skills in the event the student was not literate. Students
are asked to read and answer the test questions to the administrator who records the
number of correctly read or answered test items. For the numeracy questions and the
spelling questions students were allowed to use pencil and paper. In order to avoid
ceiling and floor effects, we requested the consultants to include “easy”, “medium”, and
“hard” items.
   The baseline test collected at the beginning of the 2013 school year was based on the
standard Uwezo assesment. As such, the test was anchored against the second grade
curriculum in Tanzania. As all students in our sample took this test, it was not a grade
specific test. However, the test was adaptive and included a wide range of numeracy and
literacy skills. Students started the test at different skill levels depending on their grade,
and then progressed to either harder or easier skills depending on their performance.
The test featured 15 items in Kiswahili, 15 in English, and 33 in math. In Kiswahili and
Swahili, the key concepts covered in the test were syllables, reading words, and reading
comprehension. In math, the test covered simple counting, number recognition, inequal-
ities of number (i.e. which is greater), addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and
“everyday mathematics” (or culturally appropriate word problems).
   During both endline tests (in 2013 and 2014), we tested students based on the grade
we expected them to be enrolled. Both of these tests were grade specific tests designed
 49 More   information is available at https://www.twaweza.org/go/uwezo


                                                 56
to measure the main competencies outlined in the curriculum.50 The content of the tests
is summarized in in Table C.12. The number of items of each test varied. In the first
year the Kiswahili and English tests included 27 items for grade 1, 20 items for grade 2,
and 9 items for grade 3. In the second year, the number of items was reduced mainly
by dropping items that required students to write (or spell). For math, there were 34
items for grade 1, 24 items for grade 2, and 24 items for grade 3. In the second year, the
number of items on the grade 1 math test was reduced. However, we added a number
of easier items to the grade 3 test, and left the length of the grade 2 test unchanged.
   We standardize the test scores by grade so that the mean and standard deviation in
the control group is equal to one. To put our results in context, the average difference
between students who are at grade level and those who are not, in Controls schools, is of
1.8σ in Kiswahili and Math, and 4.8σ in English at the end of 2013. In 2014, the average
difference is of 1.6σ in Kiswahili and Math, and 4.8σ in English.


C.2    High-stakes test
We also use data from the high-stakes (or incentivized) tests conducted by Twaweza that
were used to determine teacher bonuses. These tests were taken by all students in grades
1, 2, and 3 in Incentive and Combination schools, where the program required them to
calculate the bonuses. Since no bonuses were paid in Grants schools and high-stakes
testing is expensive, Twaweza did not conduct the high-stakes tests in Grants schools.
Twaweza did, however, administer them in a sample of 40 randomly selected control
schools to enable the computation of treatment effects of the incentive programs on the
high-stakes tests. However, we only have student level test-scores from the second year
of the evaluation as the Twaweza teams only recorded aggregated pass rates (needed to
calculate bonus payments) in the first year.
   A number of measures were introduced to enhance test security. First, to prevent test-
taking by non-target grade candidates, students could only be tested if their name had
been listed and their photo taken at baseline. Second, there were ten versions of the
tests to prevent copying and leakage; each student was assigned a randomly generated
number from a table to identify the test version, with the choice of the number based on
day of the week and the first letter of the student’s name. Finally, tests were handled,
administered, and scored by Twaweza teams without any teacher involvement. Several
checks were done ex-post by Twaweza to ensure there was not any cheating on the high-
  50 During the third round of data collection (at the beginning of the 2014 school year) we only tested
grade 1 students. The test followed the format of the grade 1 test during the second round of data
collection.

stakes test. Twaweza only found one instance of cheating, where passes from one school
were moved to another school. This happened in 2013 and after the discovery the school
tallies were corrected to reflect to original numbers of students passing. The corrected
data have been used in the analysis for this paper.


C.3    Comparability of tests
The high-stakes tests were designed by the same Tanzanian education professionals as
the low-stakes test using the same test-development framework. As a result, the subject
order, question type, and phrasing was similar across both tests. The main difference is
the high-stakes test is shorter, measuring only the skills necessary to calculate whether
students passed the proficiency threshold or not. The low-stakes test covered more skills
and as a result had more questions in each section (Kiswahili, English and math) to
avoid bottom- and top-coding. Consequently, the high-stakes test was shorter (about 15
minutes) than the low-stakes test (40 minutes).
   The content of both rounds of the high-stakes test was similar. The specific skills tested
are outlined in Table C.12.
   Although the content between the two types of test is similar, there are a number of
important differences in the test administration across the low- and high-stakes tests. As
mentioned above, the low-stakes test took longer (40 minutes) than the high-stakes test
(15 minutes). The low-stakes test had more questions in each section (Kiswahili, English
and math) to avoid bottom- and top-coding, and also included an “other subject” module
at the end to measure potential spillover effects. In order to keep field logistics and costs
manageable, the high-stakes test was designed to secure the data required for the bonus
calculations while keeping per-student test time within an upper limit of 20 minutes.
   Further, even though both tests were administered individually to students, the test-
ing environment was different. Low-stakes tests were administered by taking sampled
students out of their classroom during a regular school day. In contrast, the high-stakes
test was more “official” as all students in Grades 1-3 were tested on a prearranged test
day. On the test day, students in other grades would sometimes be sent home to avoid
distractions. Extra-curricular activities were also canceled during the Twaweza test. In
addition, most schools used the incentivized test as the end of year test. However, the
Twaweza test team was n charge of all the test proceedings.

Note: The Table summarizes the test content for each subject across different grades and data collection
rounds. Both high-stakes and low-stakes tests were developed using the same test-development frame-
work as the Uwezo national assessments. The main difference between the high-stakes and low-stakes
test is the high-stakes test is designed to measure proficiency so the test has a variety of stopping rules to
reduce testing time.
