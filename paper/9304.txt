This paper presents a stylized model of international trade and asset price bubbles. Its central insight is that
bubbles tend to appear and expand in countries where productivity is low relative to the rest of the world.
These bubbles absorb local savings, eliminating inefficient investments and liberating resources that are in
part used to invest in high productivity countries. Through this channel, bubbles act as a substitute for
international capital flows, improving the international allocation of investment and reducing rate-of-return
differentials across countries. This view of asset price bubbles has important implications for the way we
think about economic growth and fluctuations. It also provides a simple account of some real world
phenomenae that have been difficult to model before, such as the recurrence and depth of financial crises or
their puzzling tendency to propagate across countries.

         This paper presents a stylized model of international trade and asset price
bubbles.1 Its central insight is that bubbles tend to appear and expand in countries
where productivity is low relative to the rest of the world. These bubbles absorb local
savings, eliminating inefficient investments and liberating resources that are in part
used to invest in high productivity countries. Through this channel, bubbles act as a
substitute for international capital flows, improving the international allocation of
investment and reducing rate-of-return differentials across countries. This view of
asset price bubbles has important implications for the way we think about economic
growth and fluctuations. It also provides a simple account of some real world
phenomenae that have been difficult to model before, such as the recurrence and
depth of financial crises or their puzzling tendency to propagate across countries.


         Tirole [1985] has argued that markets create asset price bubbles to eliminate
inefficient investments.2 His argument goes as follows: Consider an economy where
the growth rate exceeds the rate of return to capital. In this economy, a bubble can
create its own demand without outgrowing savings by offering a rate of price
appreciation above the rate of return but below the growth rate. The bubble absorbs
part of the economy’s savings, crowding out investment and reducing the capital
stock and output. Since the resources devoted to investment (roughly growth times
the capital stock) exceed the resources obtained from such activity (roughly the rate
of return times the capital stock), the bubble raises consumption and improves
welfare. The key insight of Tirole’s theory is that the bubble takes away resources
from inefficient investors and puts them in the hands of consumers.


         An implicit assumption in Tirole’s argument is that all investors face the same
rate of return. Assume instead that, as a result of frictions in financial markets, the
economy contains efficient investors that enjoy rates of return in excess of the growth

value of its dividend flow or fundamental value.

  Tirole’s paper builds on the path-breaking work of Samuelson [1958], who was the first to note that
useless assets might be valued in a competitive economy and that this would be Pareto improving.

rate, and also inefficient investors that do not. In this economy, a bubble can create
its own demand within the group of inefficient investors without outgrowing their
savings by offering a rate of price appreciation above their rate of return but below the
growth rate. The bubble crowds out inefficient investments and liberates resources
that can be used not only to raise consumption, but also to increase efficient
investments. Through this channel, the bubble can now lead to an increase in the
capital stock and output. Since inefficient investors devote more resources to
investment than they obtain from it, the bubble still raises welfare. The key insight
now is that the bubble takes away resources from inefficient investors and puts them
in the hands of both consumers and efficient investors.


         The goal of this paper is to examine the consequences of this view of asset
price bubbles for the theories of economic growth and fluctuations. To do this, I keep
two maintained hypotheses throughout the paper. The first one is that international
goods markets are sufficiently integrated that long-run rates of economic growth are
positively linked across countries. This implies that countries that save more and have
better technologies and policies are richer but do not grow faster.3 The second
hypothesis is that international financial markets have limited ability to arbitrage
cross-country differences in rates of return. This might be due to a variety of frictions
such as policy-induced barriers, transaction costs, information asymmetries and
sovereign risk.4 If trade in goods ensures that all countries share the same long-run
rate of economic growth while frictions in asset trade allow countries to have different
rates of return, asset price bubbles naturally arise in those countries where the rate of
return is below the common or world growth rate.5

3
  Leaving a few miracles and disasters aside, there is ample evidence in support of this view. Despite
large cross-country differences in economic policies, saving rates and technology, the world income
distribution has been relatively stable in the second half of the twentieth century. Howitt [2000] has
argued that this stability might be due to technology spillovers, while Acemoglu and I [2002] have argued
that it might be due to terms-of-trade effects. Through any of these channels, countries with bad
characteristics are able to grow fast and keep up with the rest of the world.
4
  These frictions do not preclude all international capital flows, although the latter are much smaller than
what theories based on frictionless markets predict. See Kraay et al. [2000] for a review of the evidence.
5
  In an influential paper, Abel et al. [1989] noticed that the capital share exceeds investment in industrial
countries. Since this implies that the average rate of return is above the growth rate, many have used




                                                     2
         To study the implications of this observation, I construct a stylized world
equilibrium model in which the cost of trading goods is negligible while the cost of
trading assets is prohibitive. This is a crude but effective way to capture the two
maintained hypotheses discussed above. The model has equilibria with bubbles, in
addition to the bubbleless equilibrium that we always take for granted. These are
country bubbles, since they can be sold only within the country.6 Bubbles appear in
countries with low productivity, eliminating domestic investment and raising domestic
consumption. This shift in demand lowers the price of investment goods relative to
consumption goods all over the world, raising investment in countries with high
productivity. Since the transfer of resources from low- to high-productivity countries is
done via prices and without any actual or recorded capital flow, this could be aptly
described as a theory of capital flows with zero current accounts.


         Since bubbles act as a substitute for international capital flows, many of their
effects are akin to those that one would expect from financial integration. By
improving the average efficiency of investment, asset price bubbles tend to raise the
world growth rate. By shifting investments towards countries with high productivity,
asset price bubbles tend to make the world economy more sensitive to shocks in
these countries and less sensitive to shocks in other countries. By providing low-
productivity countries with a better savings vehicle, asset price bubbles also tend to
improve the world income distribution. By expanding at the end of booms and
contracting at the end of recessions, bubbles tend to amplify the effects of
productivity shocks on investment while dampening their effects on consumption. All
of these effects, which are typically associated with financial integration, arise here as



this observation to question the empirical validity of Tirole’s model. But this conclusion rests on the
assumption that financial markets are frictionless. Even if the average rate of return exceeds the growth
rate, the economy might contain pockets of investors with low rates of returns that are willing to buy a
bubble. Hence it is not possible in general to rule out the presence of bubbles by comparing the
aggregate capital share and investment.
6
  In Ventura [2002], I consider the case in which financial markets are well integrated in the sense that
domestic and international transactions are subject to the same sort of frictions. In this case, bubbles are
traded across countries and I refer to them as global bubbles.




                                                     3
the sole result of asset price bubbles since capital flows are not possible and trade is
always balanced by assumption.


       Bubbles also have some effects that are different from those that one would
expect from financial integration. For instance, domestic and foreign shocks lead to
movements in the size of the bubble that generate potentially large wealth effects.
Through this channel, the presence of bubbles magnifies the effects of productivity
and other shocks on aggregate activity. Another effect of bubbles is to open the door
to shocks to expectations as a new source of macroeconomic fluctuations. Bubbles
are inherently unstable, since they arise in environments where agents need to
coordinate to one among a variety of possible equilibria. Since bubbles magnify the
effects of productivity shocks and open the door to expectational shocks, low
productivity countries that have large bubbles tend to be more volatile than high
productivity countries that have small bubbles. But the relationship between volatility
and productivity is nonlinear. Countries with intermediate levels of productivity tend to
have smaller but more volatile bubbles. In particular, I find that in these countries
external shocks generate movements in the size of their bubbles that have potentially
large wealth effects. This observation can be used to provide a theoretical justification
to the notion that middle-income countries are very vulnerable to small economic
fluctuations in high-income countries. It can also be used as key building block in an
attempt to sketch a theory of the international contagion of financial crises.


       The paper is organized as follows: Section one presents a stylized model of
trade and growth and describes the world equilibrium without bubbles. Section two
shows that there are additional world equilibria with bubbles and formally describes
them. Sections three to seven present five examples designed to illustrate the
macroeconomic effects of bubbles. The first two emphasize the role of bubbles as a
substitute for international capital flows. The remaining three deal with the concepts
of financial fragility, vulnerability to external shocks and contagion. Section eight
concludes.

1. A Productivity-Based View of the Growth Process

       In this section I present a simple model of trade and growth that will serve as a
tool or vehicle to study the conditions under which asset price bubbles can exist and
their macroeconomic effects. The model has some unrealistic features such as the
prediction that factor prices are equalized across countries or the assumption that the
law of one price applies to all goods. These aspects of the model are not important
however for the results of this paper, and have been chosen only to streamline the
discussion. The two critical features of the model have already been discussed in the
introduction: while trade in goods ensures that long-run rates of economic growth are
equalized across countries, frictions in asset trade preclude the elimination of rate-of-
return differentials across countries. There are various models of trade and growth
that share these two critical features without predicting that goods and factor prices
are equalized across countries. For instance, Acemoglu and I [2002] wrote a model
with these characteristics recently.


       Consider a world economy with J countries, indexed by j=1,2,…,J. There are
two factors of production: labor and capital, and they are used in the production of
two intermediates: K- and L-products. These intermediates are in turn used to
produce two final goods: consumption and investment. The costs of transporting
factors are prohibitive, while the costs of transporting goods are negligible.


       In all countries there are competitive firms with access to a common
technology to produce intermediates. To produce one unit of the K-product, these
firms require one unit of capital. To produce one unit of the L-product, they need one
unit of labor. Since final goods production only requires intermediates, full
employment of factors implies that both intermediates are produced in all countries.
Perfect competition ensures that the rental and the wage are equal to the prices of K-
and L-products in all countries, while international trade ensures that the prices of
these intermediates are equalized across countries. It follows that factor prices are




                                            5
equalized across countries as well.7 Define rt and wt as the common rental (or price of
K-products) and wage (or price of L-products) at date t.


         In all countries there are also competitive firms with access to a common
technology to produce final goods. To produce one unit of the consumption good,
firms have a Cobb-Douglas technology with a L-product (or labor) share equal to α,
with 0<α<1. To produce one unit of the investment good, firms have a technology that
requires one unit of the K-product. Since all firms in all countries face the same price
of intermediates, the costs of producing final goods are also the same in all countries.
Perfect competition then ensures that goods prices equal these production costs:


(1)      1 = rt1− α ⋅ w αt

(2)       qt = rt


where qt is the price of investment and consumption is the numeraire.


         The demographic structure of countries is that of a two-period overlapping
generations model with constant population. All generations have size one. In each
date, a new generation of consumers is born that lives two periods: young and old.
The consumers’ goal in life is to maximize the expected value of old age
consumption. When young, consumers work and save their wage. The only decision
in their life is what to do with these savings. When old, consumers use the return to
their savings to purchase consumption goods. This formulation is nothing but a stark
version of the popular life-cycle model of savings.




7
 This result is due to Samuelson [1948] and applies to a wide range of models (See Krugman and
Helpman [1985]). What is perhaps surprising here is that factor prices are equalized for any cross-
country distribution of capital-labor ratios. This is a special but very convenient property of this specific
production structure that I borrow from Ventura [1997].




                                                      6
        In each generation, some of the young create and operate firms that purchase
investment goods in their youth and convert them into capital that can be used in their
old age. For simplicity, I assume that this entrepreneurial activity requires no effort
and that there is enough talent in the country so as to drive the wage of
entrepreneurs to zero. The entrepreneurs of country j at date t are capable of
producing π tj +1 units of capital with each investment good. I refer to π tj +1 as the
productivity of country j and assume that it can vary stochastically over time within a
support that is strictly positive and bounded above. Let Itj and K tj be the investment
and capital stock of the country. Assuming that capital fully depreciates in one
generation, we have that:


(3)     K tj +1 = π tj +1 ⋅ Itj


        Given these assumptions, each unit of income invested in country j yields a
                                  rt +1 ⋅ π tj +1
rate of return equal to                           . To finance their purchases of investment goods,
                                       qt

firms issue shares and sell them in the domestic stock market. After output has been
produced and distributed in the form of dividend, the firm has no assets and the value
of its shares drops to zero.


        A key assumption is that the costs of trading in the domestic stock market are
negligible, while the costs of trading in foreign stock markets are prohibitive. This
asymmetry in costs could be due to a policy-induced barrier such as prohibitive
capital controls, or it could be due to the inability of countries to commit not to
expropriate foreign investments. Whatever the reason, the young are forced to invest
all of their savings in the domestic stock market, and this implies the following:


(4)     qt ⋅ Itj = w t

(5)     Ctj = rt ⋅ K tj




                                                       7
       Equation (4) states that investment is equal to labor income, since the young
save the entire wage. Equation (5) shows that consumption is equal to capital
income, since the old have no bequest motive.


       Define world averages by omitting the country subscript. For instance, the
                                              1
world average capital stock is K t =
                                              J
                                                ⋅   ∑K
                                                    j
                                                         j
                                                         t   . Applying Shepard’s lemma to Equations

(1) and (2), we find the world average demands for K and L-products as
1              1− α           α
   ⋅ qt ⋅ It +      ⋅ C t and    ⋅ C t , respectively. Since the average supplies of these
rt              rr            wt

products are Kt and 1, international commodity markets clear if and only if:


(6)     rt ⋅ K t = qt ⋅ It + (1 − α ) ⋅ C t

(7)     w t = α ⋅ Ct


       The competitive equilibrium of this world economy is a set of prices and
quantities such that consumers optimize and markets clear. Together with an initial
distribution of capital stocks, Equations (1)-(7) provide a complete description of this
equilibrium. By Walras’ law, one among Equations (4)-(7) is redundant and can be
dropped. I show next some properties of this world equilibrium.


       Let R tj be the rate of return to the portfolio of country j. Since this portfolio
contains only domestic investment, we can use Equations (1), (2) and (7), to find that:


                    −α
(8)    R tj   =    1− α
                  gt      ⋅ π tj


                                                                           C t +1
where gt is the growth rate of world consumption, i.e. g t ≡                      . Consider the case in
                                                                           Ct

which this growth rate is positive. Despite the continuous decline in the rental rate,




                                                        8
the rate of return remains constant because the price of investment goods also
declines at the same rate. This follows from Equation (2) and is a direct consequence
of the assumption that only capital is used in the production of investment goods. The
idea that there exists a core of capital goods that can be produced using only this
same core of capital goods is the basic tenet underlying the linear growth model of
Rebelo [1991]. Here we have adopted the extreme AK version of this model in which
there is only one capital good in this core.


         It follows from Equations (3), (5) and (7) that the world growth rate of
consumption is given by:


(9)      gt = α ⋅ R t


         The world growth rate depends positively on α and Rt. The higher is α, the
higher is the labor share in income and the higher is world savings. The higher is Rt,
the higher is the average return obtained from these savings. All countries share a
common growth rate in the long run. The reason is simple: growth in high-return
countries improves the terms of trade of low-return ones and this keeps the world
income distribution stable. Since wages are equalized internationally, all countries
save the same, and differences in consumption reflect differences in rates of return.
                                                              C tj R tj 8
To see this, note that Equations (3)-(5) imply that               =     .
                                                              Ct Rt


         Solving Equations (8) and (9), we obtain this stylized description of the growth
process as a function of the exogenously specified productivity processes:


         g t = (α ⋅ π t )
                        1− α
(10)


8
  It would be straightforward to introduce labor-augmenting productivities differences across countries as
in Ventura [1997]. This would generate cross-country differences in wages and savings.




                                                    9
        World growth depends on average productivity, while each country’s position
in the world distribution of consumption or wealth depends on its relative productivity.
This world therefore encapsulates a traditional or productivity-based view of economic
growth and fluctuations. This view is reasonable and has the potential to explain
some of the most interesting growth experiences, such as the existence of growth
miracles or worldwide changes in rates of economic growth. But the productivity-
based view is not well suited to explain other real world phenomenae such as the
recurrence and depth of financial crises or their puzzling tendency to propagate
across countries. A key question is therefore: How can we model these aspects of
reality without losing the basic insights of the productivity-based view? A central claim
of this paper is that the implicit (and unjustified) assumption that asset prices reflect
their fundamental value is the obstacle that stands on the way of doing this. Once we
push it aside, it is possible to catch an eye-opening glimpse of what the productivity-
based view has been leaving behind.




2. Country Bubbles

        If R tj > g t for all j and t, the world equilibrium described in the previous section

is unique. But if R tj < g t for some j and t, there might be other equilibria in which
useless assets or firms are valued and traded in the stock market. Following standard
convention, I refer to these useless assets or firms as pure bubbles.9 To be clear,
these bubbles are rational since their existence does not rely on the presence of
individuals that are incapable of processing publicly available information or that
behave in a manner that is inconsistent with the usual axioms of choice theory. In the
bubbly equilibria studied here, the old sell bubbles to the young. The later understand

9
  The distinction between productive assets and pure bubbles is useful as a theoretical device. However
in the real world asset price bubbles sometime seem to appear in productive assets. Olivier [2000]
shows how to modify the theory to allow for bubbles that are “attached” to productive assets.




                                                  10
that these bubbles will never deliver a dividend, but they still buy them because they
rationally expect a return in the form of price appreciation.


        Since the costs of international trade in assets are still prohibitive, bubbles are
only traded within the country. That is, they are country bubbles. Let B tj be the size of
the bubble in country j at date t, i.e. the value of all the useless firms traded in the
stock market of country j. This bubble grows according to this process:


(11)    B tj +1 = µ tj +1 ⋅ B tj


where µ tj +1 is the growth rate of the bubble or its rate of price appreciation. Note that

µ tj +1 might not be known as of date t, since in general the value of the bubble at date
t+1 depend on information that is not available at date t. I define a country bubble as
an initial value, i.e. B0j > 0 and a price appreciation process, i.e. µ tj +1 for all t≥0.


        The presence of a bubble enlarges the portfolio choice of the young since they
now can choose whether to hold the capital stock, the country bubble, or both. We
must therefore replace Equation (4) by this pair:


(12)    qt ⋅ Itj + B tj = w t

               
                0                 { }         r ⋅ π j 
                          if E t µ tj +1 < E t  t +1 t +1 
                                               qt 
               
(13)
               
                                   { }         r ⋅ π j 
        B tj = [0, w t ] if E t µ tj +1 = E t  t +1 t +1 
                                               qt 
               
                wt                { }         r ⋅ π j 
                          if E t µ tj +1 > E t  t +1 t +1 
               
                                               qt 


        Equation (12) shows that the young now distribute their savings between the
stock of capital and the bubble. Equation (13) describes the choice of country

                                                                                      qt

the young are risk-neutral, they choose the asset that offers the highest expected
return. If both assets offer the same expected return, the young are indifferent
between holding capital, the bubble or both.


        The presence of the bubble also implies that the consumption of the old is
now given by their capital income plus the proceeds of selling the bubble. Therefore,
we must replace Equation (5) by:


(14)      C tj = rt ⋅ K tj + B tj


        The rest of the model remains the same. For a given initial distribution of
capital stocks, a competitive equilibrium of the world economy consists of a set of
country bubbles such that Equations (1)-(3), (6)-(7) and (11)-(14) hold for all possible
realizations of the world economy. Once again, by Walras’ law we can drop one
among Equations (6), (7), (12) and (14). The productivity-based view or bubbleless

                                                             { }        r ⋅ π j 

t. This equilibrium always exists, as shown in the previous section. But it might not be
unique.


        Since the country portfolio now might contain the bubble, its rate of return
need no longer be equal to the rate of return to capital. Define b tj as the share of the

                                                                B tj
bubble in the country portfolio or savings, i.e. b tj ≡                    . The rate of return to
                                                           qt ⋅ Itj + B tj
country j’s portfolio is now given by:




                                                12

(15)      R tj = g 1t−α ⋅ π tj ⋅ (1 − b tj −1 ) + µ tj ⋅ b tj −1


          A bit of algebra shows that Equation (9) still describes the world growth rate.
However, it is not possible to provide a complete description of the growth process as
a function of exogenous impulses using Equations (9) and (15) alone. To do so we
need to specify exogenously not only the path of productivity, but also how countries
coordinate to a particular equilibrium. For instance, the derivation of Equation (10)
implicitly assumes that: (i) the bubbleless equilibrium is unique or, alternatively, (ii) all
countries coordinate to the bubbleless equilibrium with probability one. Either of these
two assumptions or views is sufficient to justify the productivity-based view of the
growth process. But they are not the only possibilities.


          As a prelude to making assumptions on how countries coordinate to a given
equilibrium, it is useful to obtain a simple characterization of all the sets of country
bubbles that are feasible in world equilibrium. The following proposition does this:


Proposition #1: Consider J sequences b tj                      { }  t =∞
                                                                    t =0   such that b tj ∈ [0,1] for all t and j. The

set of country bubbles defined by these sequences is feasible if and only if, for all j

                                                    
                                                     
                                                 1− α
             
             
(C2) gt +1 =  α ⋅
                      ∑π j ⋅ (1 − b tj ) 
                      j t +1                           .
                  J − α ⋅ jb t +1 ) 
                                 j
                                  ∑
                                        


          The proof simply consists on substituting Equation (11) into (13) and using
equilibrium prices to obtain (C1), and to substitute Equation (15) into Equation (9) to
obtain (C2). The proposition is useful because it allows us to check whether a
proposed set of country bubbles is feasible by solving a small system of equations.




                                                                   13
        To develop intuitions about the macroeconomic effects of bubbles, I develop
next five examples. Together, they reveal a new and broader view of the growth
process in which both productivity and asset price bubbles play central roles, and
interact in interesting and somewhat surprising ways. A recurring theme is that
bubbles substitute for capital flows and, as a result, their main effects are akin or
similar to those of financial integration. Another theme is that movements in the size
of bubbles create large wealth shocks. These movements might be driven by shocks
to productivity. But the presence of bubbles also opens the door for shocks to
expectations to become part of the macroeconomic landscape.




3. Bubbles as a Substitute for Long-Term Capital Flows

        Assume the world contains infinitely many countries of two types. Half of them
have low productivity, i.e. πtj = πL ; while the rest have high productivity, i.e.

π tj = πH > πL . The goal of this example is to determine how the presence of bubbles
affects both the world growth rate and the distribution of wealth across countries.


        It is useful to start by describing the bubbleless equilibrium. It follows from
Equations (8) and (9) that in this equilibrium the following applies:


                            1− α
              πL + πH 
(16)    g =  α ⋅     
                  2 
                 −α
(17)    R j = g1− α ⋅ π j


        The world growth rate depends only on average productivity, while the cross-
country distribution of rates of return (and consumption or wealth) depends on how




                                             14
dispersed this productivity is. As discussed already, this is the essence of the
productivity-based view of economic growth.


         But this might not be the only equilibrium of this world economy. Consider the
possibility that country j deviates from the others and coordinates to an equilibrium
with a stationary bubble, i.e. b tj = b for all t. Is this possible? Since the world growth
rate is constant and there is no uncertainty, condition (C1) for this bubble can be
written as follows:


            1
(18)     g α
          1−    ≥ πj


To create its own demand, the bubble must grow at a rate that is no lower than the
                                     −α
rate of return to capital, i.e. g1−α ⋅ π j . To ensure that it does not outgrow savings, the
bubble must grow at a rate that is no higher than the growth rate, i.e. g. Therefore,
Equation (19) says that there is room for a bubble in country j if and only if the growth
rate exceeds the rate of return to capital. Except for the knife-edge case in which
inequality (18) holds strictly, we have that:


(19)     b =1


That is, the bubble crowds out all the investment of the country. If country j is a high-
productivity country this bubble is not feasible because condition (18) never holds (To
check this, substitute Equation (16) into condition (18) with πj=πH). If country j is a low-
productivity country the bubble might be feasible because condition (18) holds for
some parameter values.10



10
  If it has low productivity, country j might also have any of a continuum of non-stationary bubbles
defined by an initial value b0 ∈(0,1] and sequence of b t such that (C1) holds with strict equality. These
                               j                         j

bubbles vanish gradually over time and will be ignored in the rest of this paper.




                                                    15
        Consider the case in which a fraction φ of the low productivity countries
coordinate to the bubbly equilibrium, while the rest coordinate to the bubbleless one. I
refer to φ as the size of the world bubble. It follows from Equations (9) and (15) that:


                                     1− α
               (1 − φ) ⋅ πL + πH 
(20)     g =  α ⋅               
                                  
                   2−α⋅φ         

            g             if b tj = 1
            
(21)    R =  −α
           j

            g ⋅ π
                          if b tj = 0
              1− α j




        Equations (20) and (21) describe the world growth rate and the return to the
country portfolios in the bubbly equilibrium. Substituting Equation (20) into condition
(18), we find that this equilibrium exists if and only if cross-country dispersion in
                                             πL    α
productivity is sufficiently high, i.e. if      <     . Assume this from now on.
                                             πH
                                                  2−α


        Using Equation (20), it is straightforward to check that the world growth rate
increases with the size of the bubble. The key intuition is that the bubble eliminates
inefficient investments in low-productivity countries and raises efficient investments in
high-productivity ones. An increase of one percent in the world bubble increases
consumption (or reduces investment spending) by one percent in countries where
average productivity is πL. This lowers the price of investment goods and raises the
wage all over the world. A lower price of investment goods means that each unit of
savings buys more investment goods, while a higher wage means that savings
increases all over the world. A one percent increase in the world bubble leads to an
increase of investment spending of α percent in the rest of the world where average
                  (1 − φ) ⋅ πL + πH
productivity is                     (See Equations (7) and (12)). Since Equations (18) and
                      2− α⋅φ

                                                                  (1 − φ) ⋅ πL + πH
(20) ensure that the bubble is feasible if and only if πL < α ⋅                     , we have
                                                                      2− α⋅φ




                                                 16
that an increase in the size of the bubble increases the world capital stock for a given
level of production and this raises the world growth rate. The maximum world growth
rate applies in the limit where the bubble is as large as it can be, i.e. φ→1.


       Using Equation (21), we also find that the presence of bubbles raises the rate
of return of the portfolio of the countries that hold the bubble relative to the rest of the
world. This means that these countries move up in the world distribution of
consumption and wealth. Since countries that have a bubble also have low
productivity, the presence of bubbles tends to reduce rate-of-return differentials and
                                                                                 C tj R tj
improve the world distribution of consumption and wealth. (Remember that             =     ).
                                                                                 Ct Rt

In fact, the most equalitarian distribution applies in the limit when the bubble is as
large as it can be, i.e. φ→1.


       This example illustrates the role of bubbles as a substitute for long-term
capital flows. Since the later are not possible, stock markets generate bubbles as an
alternative or second-best mechanism to improve the world allocation of investment.
Bubbles arise in low-productivity countries, eliminating inefficient investments and
liberating resources that are used in part to increase investment in high-productivity
countries. This transfer is made via changes in prices and without actual capital flows,
since we have assumed throughout that trade is balanced and current accounts are
zero. By increasing the efficiency of world investment, bubbles raise the world growth
rate. By reducing rate-of-return differentials across countries, bubbles improve the
world income distribution.

4. Bubbles as a Substitute for Short-Term Capital Flows

        Consider next a world with infinitely many countries of a single type.
                                                                     }     {
Productivity fluctuates between a high and a low state, i.e. πtj ∈ πL , πH with πH ≥ πL . I

assume that productivity is known before making investments, i.e. E {π } = π    t
                                                                                    j
                                                                                    t +1
                                                                                           j
                                                                                           t +1 .   The

probability of transitioning from one state to the other is equal to λ and is independent
across j and t. The world starts with half of the countries in each state. Since this is
the invariant distribution, the proportion of countries in each state is constant over
time. The goal of this example is to determine how the presence of bubbles
determines the way countries react to productivity shocks.


        The bubbleless equilibrium of this world economy is the same as in the
previous example, i.e. as described in Equations (16)-(17). The only difference is that
now all countries are ex-ante identical and each of them spends half of the time being
low-productivity and half of the time being high-productivity. As λ→0 differences in
productivity become permanent and we approach the world we analyzed in the
previous subsection.


        Consider the possibility that country j deviates from the others and coordinates
to an equilibrium with a stationary bubble, i.e. b tj = bH if π tj = πH and b tj = bL if π tj = πL .
In this case, condition (C1) implies the following:


                    bH  1−α
                              1
                                                                 bL  1−α
                                                                           1
(22)     1 − λ + λ ⋅ L  ⋅ g   ≥ πL       and        1 − λ + λ ⋅ H  ⋅ g   ≥ πH
                    b                                          b  


                1
Since πH > g1− α the bubble must expand at the end of high productivity periods to
create its own demand, i.e. bL>bH. This in turn implies that the bubble must contract at




                                                 18
the end of low productivity periods. Except for the knife-edge case in which both
inequalities hold strictly, it follows from (22) that:


                                         λ
(23)     bL = 1             bH =
                                         πH
                                   λ+     1
                                                −1
                                        g1− α


         Now either all the countries can have the bubble, or none of them can have it.
Note also that shocks to productivity generate movements in the bubble. Transitions
to the high state lead to contractions of the bubble, while transitions to the low state
lead to expansions. Equation (23) shows that the size of these movements is
positively related to the world growth rate. The larger is the latter the more attractive
is the bubble inside high productivity periods, and the smaller are the expansions at
the end of these periods that are required to support the demand for the bubble.
Equation (23) also shows that there is a positive relationship between the size of
these movements in the bubble and the persistence of shocks. The smaller is the
transition probability the lower is the likelihood that the bubble expands and, as a
result, the larger are the expansions that are required at the end of high productivity
periods.


         Consider the case in which a fraction φ of the countries coordinate to the
stationary bubble, while the rest coordinate to the bubbleless equilibrium.11 It follows
from Equations (9) and (15) that, in this case:


                                                     1− α
               (1 − φ) ⋅ πL + (1 − φ ⋅ bH ) ⋅ πH 
(24)     g =  α ⋅                               
                                                  
                     2 −  α ⋅ φ ⋅ (1 + b H
                                            )     



   Note that now φ is the fraction of all countries with a bubble, while in the previous example φ was the
11

fraction of low-productivity countries with a bubble. Since the previous example obtains as the limit in
which λ→0 and b →0, all the formulas in the previous section are valid under both definitions.

where I have used the finding that bL=1. Equations (23)-(25) provide a full description
of the bubbly equilibrium, if it exists. The latter requires a sufficiently high dispersion
of productivities. In fact, it is easy to show that this restriction is more stringent now
than in the previous example. Assume that it is satisfied from now on.


        The equilibrium values for bH and g are obtained by crossing Equations (24)
and (25). Figure 1 shows how these values depend on φ and λ. An increase in the
world bubble raises the world growth rate and, for the reasons discussed, it increases
the size of the bubble in high productivity countries (compare points A and B). An
increase in the transition probability raises the size of the bubble in high productivity
countries and, as a result, it reduces efficient investment and lowers the world growth
rate (compare points A and C).


        In this example the presence of a bubble not only raises the long-run rate of
growth, but also affects the nature of economic fluctuations. A first effect of the
bubble is hat increases the volatility of investment. In countries that do not have a
bubble, investment is not sensitive to domestic productivity and is determined solely
by the savings of the young. In countries that do have a bubble, investment fluctuates
with domestic productivity. When productivity is high, the bubble contracts and
investment expands. When productivity is low, the bubble expands and investment
contracts. This is how bubbles break the link between changes in domestic
investment and the savings of the young, just as international capital flows would do if
they were possible.




                                                  20
        A second effect of the bubble is to create potentially large wealth effects that
impact on consumption. In countries without a bubble, consumption fluctuates one-to-
one with domestic productivity. This is not the case in countries with a bubble, since
their consumption depends on both the return to capital and the rate of growth of the
bubble. Conditional on being in normal times (i.e. periods in which a country does not
transition from one state to the other), countries with a bubble have a smoother
consumption process than those without a bubble. The reason is that the rate of
return to their portfolio is higher in the low state but lower in the high state. If this were
all, we would conclude that the bubble reduces the volatility of consumption just as
international capital flows would do in this context if they were possible. But bubbles
also generate a source of volatility in consumption that we would not observe in a
financially integrated world. During the transitions from one state to the other, the
movements in the size of the bubble generate wealth effects that might potentially
have a large impact on consumption and welfare. In particular, we have that at the
end of high-productivity periods there is a consumption boom, while at the end of low-
productivity periods there is a consumption bust.


        This world economy provides another example of how stock markets create
bubbles as a substitute for international capital flows. Bubbles expand when the
economy transitions to the low productivity state, absorbing savings and eliminating
inefficient investments. Bubbles contract when the economy transitions to the high
productivity state, releasing savings and making room for efficient investments. These
movements in the bubble shift investments from low to high productivity countries,
improving the world allocation of investment and reducing rate-of-return differentials
across countries. As a result of the movements in the bubble, investment becomes
more volatile than what standard models would predict, while consumption becomes
smoother in normal times but subject to potentially large wealth shocks associated
with expansions and contractions in the bubble.




                                             21
         Some of the implications of the theory are becoming clear now. The same
factors that would generate a capital outflow (i.e. the realization that a high
productivity period is ending) generate growth in the bubble as a prelude to a collapse
of investment. Conversely, the same factors that would generate a capital inflow (i.e.
the realization that a low productivity period is ending) generate a collapse in the
bubble as a prelude to an investment boom. Provided that the country always
coordinates to the stationary bubble, the movements of the later are therefore closely
tied to movements in productivity. But why would the economy always coordinate to
the stationary bubble? The answer, of course, is that it does not have to.




5. Financial Fragility

         Consider the same world as in the previous example, but now assume that all
countries coordinate to an equilibrium using a country-specific sunspot variable that
says BUBBLE with probability φ and NO BUBBLE with probability 1-φ. These
sunspots are independent across countries and over time. When a country switches
from the bubbly to the bubbleless equilibrium, the old find that the value of the bubble
they are holding collapses to zero and they suffer a loss. When a country switches
from the bubbleless to the bubbly equilibrium, the old find themselves able to sell a
useless object to the young and experience a windfall. The world starts with a fraction
φ of all the countries having a bubble. Since this is the invariant distribution, the
proportion of countries in each state is constant over time. The goal of this example is
to show how the presence of bubbles makes countries fragile to shocks to
expectations. In fact, it is tempting to think about this example as a model of financial
fragility.


         This change in assumptions implies a few minor adjustments in the argument
of the previous subsection. If the jth sunspot variable says NO BUBBLE, we have that




                                            22
b tj = 0 . If the jth sunspot variable says BUBBLE, we have then a stationary bubble
very similar to the one in the previous section. Since there is a probability that the
bubble bursts, condition (C1) now implies that:


                    bH  1−α
                               1
                                                                     bL  1−α
                                                                               1
(26)    1 − λ + λ ⋅   L 
                           ⋅ g   ⋅ φ ≥ πL     and        1 − λ + λ ⋅   H
                                                                           ⋅ g   ⋅ φ ≥ πH
                    b                                              b  


       Except for the knife-edge case in which both inequalities hold strictly, it follows
from Equation (26) that:


                                         λ
(27)    bL = 1            bH =
                                         πH
                                 λ+         1
                                                  −1
                                      φ ⋅ g1− α


Conditional on remaining in the bubbly equilibrium, the behavior of the bubble is
basically the same as in the previous example. Of course, now the bubble also bursts
and reappears with some probability. Also, we can show that the dispersion of
productivity required to sustain the bubbly equilibrium is higher here, since the
probability of bursting makes the bubble less attractive.


       The presence of the bubble opens the door for shocks to expectations to
affect real variables such as investment and consumption. Conditional on not
changing the equilibrium, the behavior of consumption and investment in countries
with and without a bubble is the same as in the previous example. But now all
countries go through periods in which they have a bubble and periods in which they
do not. When the bubble bursts, consumption declines as the wealth of the old
collapses and investment increases. In the aftermath of the bursting of the bubble,
consumption increases in high productivity countries but declines in low productivity
ones. When the bubble appears, consumption increases and investment declines. In




                                                    23
the aftermath of the appearance of the bubble, consumption declines in high
productivity countries but increases in low productivity ones.


         An interesting finding relates to the interaction between shocks to productivity
and shocks to expectations. Since countries tend to have a large bubble component
in their wealth when productivity is low, shocks to expectations tend to have more
extreme effects on macroeconomic aggregates and welfare during recessions.
Conversely, during booms countries are less fragile or more resilient to shocks to
expectations because the bubble component of wealth is smaller. Therefore, we find
that shocks to productivity and expectations multiply the effects of each other and
tend to increase the amplitude of economic fluctuations if they are positively
correlated.


         Although the model cannot predict the onset of expectations-driven crises,12 it
still offers fresh insights into old problems. Consider for instance the popular view that
countries should impose a Tobin tax or some sort of capital controls to reduce the
probability of costly financial crises and help stabilize small open economies. The
example presented here depicts a case in which financial fragility arises precisely as
a result of impediments to asset trade. In the absence of these impediments, all world
investment would be located in the high productivity countries. In such a world, there
would be no room for shocks to expectations and their wealth effects. The theory
therefore suggests the opposite view that in order to eliminate bubbles and the
financial fragility that accompanies them one should not add frictions in financial
markets, but remove them instead.




12
   This would certainly be too much to ask from the model. After all, the model cannot predict the onset
of productivity-driven crises either. To determine the equilibrium path of the world economy, we must
specify a path for both productivity and expectations. Both variables are taken as given here and this is
why I label them shocks.

6. Vulnerability to External Shocks

        Consider a world economy with two countries. North’s productivity fluctuates
                                             {      }
between a high and a low state, i.e. πNt ∈ πL , πH with πH > πL ; while South’s is

constant but low: πS < πL . As in previous examples, this productivity is known before

                                  { }
investments are made, i.e. E t πNt +1 = πNt +1 . In this world economy, all productivity
fluctuations have their origin in North. The goal of this example is to show that the
presence of bubbles makes low and middle-income countries particularly vulnerable
to productivity fluctuations in rich countries.


        If the North-South productivity gap is small, the unique equilibrium of this
world economy is the bubbleless one. In this equilibrium, the world allocates half of its
investment in North and the rest in South. As a result, we have that:


                           1− α
               πN + πS 
(28)    gt =  α ⋅ t   
                        
                     2 

        RNt   πNt
(29)        =
        RSt   πS


        Equations (28) and (29) describe the evolution of world growth and the world
distribution of consumption or wealth in the bubbleless equilibrium. The top panel of
Figure 2 shows this evolution graphically. The world growth rate fluctuates as a result
of productivity shocks in North. Since each country invests at home, North tends to
suffer more from its own shocks than South.


        If the North-South productivity gap is large, there is a bubbly equilibrium in
which South has a stationary bubble defined by bSt = 1 for all t. Assume South




                                              25
coordinates to this equilibrium with probability one. Then, all the investment is done in
North and, as a result, we have that:


                        1− α
                   πN 
(30)    gt =  α ⋅ t 
               2−α

        RNt   2−α
(31)        =
         S
        Rt     α


        The middle panel of Figure 2 shows the evolution of the world growth rate and
relative consumptions in the bubbly equilibrium. The presence of the bubble makes
the world growth rate more sensitive to productivity shocks in North, since now these
shocks not only raise the rate of return to North’s investment but also the growth rate
of South’s bubble. The presence of the bubble also tends to synchronize economic
fluctuations in North and South. In the bubbleless equilibrium, the return to each
country portfolio depends more on the country’s own productivity than in the
productivity of the other country. In the bubbly equilibrium, the returns to both
countries’ portfolios depend only on North’s productivity. As a result, the bubble
generates a perfect correlation in country portfolios and wealth. Despite North having
more volatile productivity than South, both countries experience the same volatility in
their consumption and wealth.


        If the North-South productivity gap is small, South is better off investing. If the
gap is large, South is better off not investing and instead holding a bubble. If the gap
is intermediate however, South might be better off investing when North’s productivity
is low, but might be better off holding a bubble when North’s productivity is high. Is
such behavior possible? The answer is ‘almost’. If the North-South productivity gap is
intermediate, there is a bubbly equilibrium in which South’s bubble expands with an
increase in North’s productivity and contracts with a decrease. To see this, assume
that South has a stationary bubble, i.e. b St = bH if πNt = πH and b St = bL if πNt = πL .




                                              26
Assume also that the growth rate has four states, i.e. gt = gHH if πNt = πNt +1 = πH ,

gt = gHL if πNt = πH and πNt +1 = πL , gt = gLL if πNt = πNt +1 = πL and gt = gHL if πNt = πL and

πNt +1 = πH (this turns out to be the right guess, of course). With these definitions,
condition (C1) implies that:

        Except for the knife-edge case in which both inequalities are strict, it follows
that:


                                              gLH ⋅ λ
(33)    bL =                                                                               and        bH = 1
                             ( )              ( )
                                  −α                −α
                                                          S
               (1 − λ ) ⋅   gLL 1− α   +λ⋅    gLH 1− α    ⋅ π − g ⋅ (1 − λ )
                                                                   LL

                                                         


This bubble is similar to those found in previous examples. When North productivity is
high, the bubble expands and reallocates investments from South to North. When
North productivity is low, the bubble contracts and reallocates investments from North
to South. Using condition (C2), we also find the following process for the growth rate
as a function of the bubble:

                                                               27
where I have used the finding that bH=1. Equations (33) and (34) implicitly define the
growth process and the behavior of the bubble. In general, these equations cannot be
solved analytically, although it is quite straightforward to solve the system
numerically.


       The bottom panel of Figure 2 shows the evolution of the world growth rate and
the world distribution of consumption in this equilibrium. Conditional on being in
normal times (i.e. periods in which a country does not transition from one state to the
other), South experiences a smoother consumption process than North. During a
boom, South holds the bubble to take advantage of the high productivity of North.
During a recession, South shifts its portfolio towards investment to moderate the fall
in its return. But, as in previous examples, bubbles generate potentially large wealth
effects during the transitions. In particular, the onset of a recession leads to a
collapse in the bubble while the beginning of a boom leads to an expansion in the
bubble. On impact, recessions and booms are felt much more strongly in South even
if they have their origin in North. After the dust clears, changes in North productivity
affect relatively more North than South. This world economy therefore illustrates how
bubbles create a channel for small productivity shocks in North to create sharp
changes in asset prices in South. These movements in asset prices in turn generate
large effects on consumption, wealth and welfare.


       This example also provides a new perspective on the connection between
economic reforms and vulnerability to external crises. The key observation is that
successful economic reforms in South lead to a progressive reduction in the North-
South productivity gap. Assume initially that this gap is large and South, perhaps with
some encouragement from North, decides to implement reforms. In their first stage,
these reforms might be successful at raising South’s productivity, but they have no
impact on its consumption or welfare since South still prefers to hold the bubble
rather than to invest. Assume that, despite this apparent lack of success, South
decides to pursue reforms even further until the productivity gap becomes




                                            28
intermediate. In this second stage, South notices some convergence towards North’s
average levels of consumption and wealth. But at the same time, South finds itself
more vulnerable to North shocks. Small drops in North productivity create sharp
financial crises. Small increases in North productivity lead to asset price booms. The
reforms have made consumption higher on average, but much more volatile. Assume
that South reacts to this by further implementing reforms until the productivity gap is
small. At this point, South finally enjoys high and stable consumption. The bubble is
gone, and so are the wealth effects that are at the root of the sharp crises and
booms.


       The bubble also determines the distributive effects of reforms. Whenever we
reach stage two of the reforms, a conflict arises between the young and the old.
Successful economic reforms make investment more attractive, reducing the demand
for the bubble and leading to its contraction or bursting. This leads to a fall in
consumption and the welfare of the old. After this initial decline in wealth and
consumption, all future generations in South (and North) are better off as a result of
the economic reforms. To the extent hath transferring resources across different
groups is costly, the presence of a bubble makes more difficult to reach a consensus
on the need to implement reforms. The key reason is that these economic reforms
harm the owners of the bubble if they are successful.




7. Contagion

       Consider a world economy with three countries, West, East and South; with
productivities equal to πW >πE>πS≈0, respectively. With this assumption, we already
know that West cannot have a bubble and that South can. Whether East can have a
bubble or not depends on parameter values. I assume that South uses a sunspot
variable to coordinate to a given equilibrium. This sunspot variable has two states:
BUBBLE and NO BUBBLE; and the probability to transition from one state to the




                                            29
other is given by λ. When the bubble bursts in South, consumption and wealth drop to
zero there. The goal of this example is to study how these expectations-driven
financial crises in South are propagated to West and East.


         The structure of this example is very similar to that of the previous one, with
financial crises in South taking up the role of productivity shocks in North. If the West-
East productivity gap is small, East cannot have a bubble and the equilibrium is given
by:


                                 1− α
                     πW + πE 

                                                           


         The world growth rate fluctuates with South’s bubble. Increases in the bubble
transfer resources to West and East that are invested more efficiently, raising the
world growth rate. When the bubble bursts, these resources return to South where
they are invested with very low efficiency (essentially wasted since πS≈0), lowering
the world growth rate. Through this channel, movements in the bubble affect the
world growth rate and the distribution of consumption. When the bubble bursts, there
is a proportional increase in the return to the portfolios of both North and South, as
the lower growth rate implies a slower decline in the price of investment goods.
Hence, movements in the bubble do not affect their relative consumption or wealth,

         If the West-East productivity gap is large, East can have a stationary bubble
defined by bSt = 1 for all t. Assume East coordinates to this bubble with probability
one. Then, we have that:


                                           1− α
                           πW            

         Once again, the world growth rate fluctuates with South’s bubble for exactly
the same reasons it did in the bubbleless equilibrium. But now the shock is
propagated differently to East and West. While the bursting of the bubble still raises
the return to West’s portfolio, it now reduces the return to East’s because the fall in
the world growth rate decreases the return to East’s bubble. When East has a bubble,
shocks to expectations in South have a larger effect on East than on West, i.e.
C tW   πW
     =         .

         The most interesting case is the one in which the productivity gap is
intermediate. Then East has a bubble that contracts when South’s bubble bursts and
expands when South’s bubble re-appears. To see this, use condition (C1) to find that
Equations (32) and (33) apply now to East’s bubble, provided that we replace πS by
πE and use the superscripts “H” and “L” to indicate bSt = 1 and bSt = 0 , respectively.
Moreover, we can also use condition (C2) to find that:

where I have used the finding that bH=1. Equations (33) and (39) implicitly define the
growth process and the bubble. The behavior of East’s bubble is analogous to that
described in the previous example. This reinforces the message that middle-income
countries are especially vulnerable to external shocks, regardless of whether the
origin of these shocks is a drop of productivity in high productivity countries or a
coordination failure in low productivity ones.


         This example also gives rise to a phenomenon that resembles the “contagion”
of financial crises that we sometimes observe in the real world. Note that movements
in South’s bubble generate positively correlated movements in East’s bubble. The key
insight of this example is that bubbles are complements. That is, bubbles elsewhere
in the world raise the world growth rate and make it more likely that a bubble appears
at home. If the West-East productivity gap is intermediate, a large bubble in East can
be supported if and only if there is a bubble in South. Under these circumstances, if
South’s bubble bursts East’s bubble sharply contracts. This positive correlation in the
bubbles of South and East happens even though there are few direct linkages
between them. Naturally, there are no capital flows between East and South since I
have ruled them out from the start. Moreover, the example can also be constructed in
such a way that there is no commodity trade between these countries either.13

  The patterns of trade in this world are straightforward. When South has a bubble, East and South are
exporters of L-products, while West is an exporter of K-products. As a result East and South do not trade
with each other. When South does not have a bubble, South is still an exporter of L-products, while
North is still an exporter of K-products. Whether East remains an exporter of L-products or becomes now
an exporter of K-products depends on parameter values. For instance, if α is large the demand for L-
products is strong enough that East remains an exporter of L-products. In this case, East and South
never trade.

8. Conclusion

        The theory developed here provides a new view of asset price bubbles as a
market-generated device to facilitate international capital flows in the presence of
frictions in international financial markets. The central insight is that bubbles tend to
appear and expand in countries where productivity is low relative to the rest of the
world. These bubbles absorb local savings, eliminating inefficient investments and
liberating resources that are in part used to invest in high productivity countries. This
improves the world allocation of investment and reduces rate-of-return differentials
across countries. As a result, bubbles allow the world economy to operate at a higher
level of efficiency.


        This theory of asset price bubbles extends and complements the standard
productivity-based view of economic growth, providing it with the potential to account
for a wide range of real world phenomenae that had proved quite difficult to model
before. With the help of some examples, I have derived a number of suggestive and
somewhat surprising results regarding the interaction between bubbles and
productivity and how this interaction shapes the growth process. While some of these
results are likely to withstand realistic extensions of the theory, others will certainly
not. I regard the model proposed here as a first step towards a better understanding
of the connection between asset price bubbles, international capital flows and
economic growth.
