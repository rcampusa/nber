            Rational Expectations, the Expectations Hypothesis,
             and Treasury Bill Yields: An Econometric Analysis

                                 ABSTRACT

      This paper tests the joint hypothesis of rational expectations and the

expectations model of the term structure for three— and six—month Treasury

bills. Previous studies are extended in three directions. First, common

efficient markets—rational expectations tests are compared, and it is shown

that four of the five tests considered are asymptotically equivalent, and

that the fifth is less restrictive than the other four. Second, the joint

hypothesis is tested using weekly data for Treasury bills maturing in exactly

13 and 26 weeks beginning in 1970 and ending in 1979. In contrast, previous

studies using comparable data have typically discarded 12/13 of the sample to

form a nonoverlapping data set. Finally, a more complete set of possible

determinants of time—varying term premiums is tested.

           RATIONAL EXPECTATIONS, THE EXPECTATIONS HYPOTHESIS,
            AND TREASURY BILL YIELDS: AN ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS

                    David S. Jones and V. Vance Roley*

      The joint hypothesis consisting of rational expectations and the

expectations model of the term structure has been subject to an increasing

amount of scrutiny in recent years. Some of this research has followed Roll

[26] and examined this joint hypothesis under the guise of the "efficient

markets" hypothesis. Other researchers have taken the study by Modigliani and

Shiller [18] as the starting point and tested rationality and the expectations

hypothesis explicitly. Prominent examples of recent studies focusing on this

model include McCulloch [13], Mishkin [14,15], Pesando [23], Sargent [27],

Shiller [28,29], Friedman [6], and Singleton [31,32], who either explicitly or

implicitly test this joint hypothesis. In virtually all of these studies,

however, not only are different "nonoverlapping" data sets employed, but the

tests themselves apparently are not uniform. For example, Mishkin [15] and

Sargent [27] test cross—equation restrictions implied by this theory, while

Pesando [23], Shiller [28,29], and Friedman [6] have collected data and utilized

tests that enable straightforward single—equation estimation.

      As a whole, the evidence surrounding the validity of this joint hypothesis

is mixed. In cases where the potential roles of time—varying term premiums are

not explicit (e.g., Sargent [27] and Shiller [29]), the null hypothesis

associated with this model cannot be rejected. However, when time—varying

term premiums dependent on the level of interest rates are included, both

Shiller [28] and Friedman [6] reject the joint hypothesis. Moreover, in

studies allowing other possible determinants of time—varying term premiums,

Nelson [19] and Friedman [6] again reject the model. Still other researchers
                                   —2—




have substituted alternative models of market equilibrium for the expectations

hypothesis and tested whether security markets are efficient (e.g., Fama {5]

and Mishkin [16]). In these latter studies, the expectations hypothesis is

rejected a priori.

      The range of results from previous studies is attributable to at least

two factors. First, different data sets are used, some of which are constructed

more carefully than others. Second, the list of potential determinants of time—

varying term premiums has varied considerably among studies. Some might also

argue that a third possible reason for the divergent results is due to the

apparently different formulations of the tests. As is shown in the first sec-

tion of this paper, however, in tests using observed market data (as opposed

to the survey data used by Friedman [6]), many efficient markets—rational

expectations tests are asymptotically equivalent.

      The purpose of this paper is to investigate the joint hypothesis of

rational expectations and the expectations model of the term structure in the

context of the Treasury bill market. This market is selected for two reasons.

First, the Treasury bill market has been studied extensively, with empirical

results that highlight the possible roles that data and methodology play in

tests of the model (e.g., Roll [26], Hamburger and Platt [10], Fama [5], Friedman

[6], and Mishkin [16]). Second, Treasury bill data are ideally suited for such

an exercise because (a) Treasury bills are issued at regular and frequent inter-

vals, (b) different maturities have homogenous tax treatment, and (c) they are

pure discount securities which avoids complications related to coupons. While

others have noted these attributes and investigated the behavior of Treasury

bill yields as a consequence, previous studies are almost uniformly based on
                                   —3—




nonoverlapping quarterly samples that effectively discard 12/13 of the available

data. In contrast, in this paper all available data are used for Treasury bills

maturing in exactly 13 and 26 weeks in a sample spanning most of the l970s.

As Hansen and Hodrick [11] show in the context of the foreign exchange market,

more powerful asymptotic tests may be obtained using all of the available

weekly data than in constructing nonoverlapping samples to avoid the problem of

serial correlation.

      Following this introductory section, the first section compares alterna-

tive tests of the joint hypothesis of rationality and the expectations hypoth-

esis. In the second section, the Treasury bill yield data used here as well as

the data for possible determinants of time—varying term premiums are described.

The estimation problems posed by the use of weekly overlapping data are also

discussed in this section. In the third section, the estimation and test

results are presented. The main conclusions of this paper are summarized in

the final section.

      I. Tests of Rationality and the Expectations Hypothesis

      In this section, five efficient markets—rational expectations tests

appearing in the literature are compared. Extending the results of Abel and

Mishkin [1], who show that Test I and Test II below are asymptotically equiva—

lent, two other tests may also be shown to be asymptotically equivalent to

Test I. In particular, it is demonstrated that a simple single—equation test

is in fact equivalent to more complicated tests involving restrictions across

equations.

      In the discussion below, all derivations are in terms of the three— and

six—month yields which are examined empirically in a later section. Further—
                                           —4—




more, it is assumed for analytical convenience that the data are nonoverlapping

in each case.-1 Under these conditions, the joint hypothesis of rational

expectations and the expectations model of the term structure may be repre-

sented by the usual approximation-'

                                     + (l/2).E(R3t÷jQ) + a
                 R6t =   (lI2).R3                                             (1)

where

                 R6t = yield   on six—month Treasury bills at time t

                 a   =   constant   term premium (Hicks [121)

                     =   information   set used by investors at time t

         E(...       =   expectation conditional on 2t' taken as the linear
                         least squares forecast of a random variable based
                         on information available at time t.

The above model (1) merely states that the yield to maturity on a six—month

Treasury bill equals one—half of the sum of the current three—month Treasury

bill yield and the expected three—month yield in period t+l evaluated at

time t, plus a constant term premium. Different permutations of the basic

relationship are used to derive the tests considered immediately below.

Test I

        The first test considered here is taken as the standard when investigating

the asymptotic properties of alternative tests. This test is by far the easiest

to implement, and it follows directly from equation (1). In particular, the

hypothesis to be tested is that the expected quarterly holding—period yield

on a six—month Treasury bill differs from the current three—month Treasury bill

yield by at most a constant term premium. To conform to this test, equation

(1) may be rewritten as

                   h
                 E(R6k) = R3         + a                                      (2)

where

                                       —
             E(RtI)                        E(R3+iI)
               h
             R6          approximate holding—period yield on six—month Treasury
                                                         —
                         bills in period t (R =
                                                        2R6t
In   turn, the expression for the one—period—ahead three—month Treasury bill

yield may be represented as

             R3t+l =        E(R3+iIt)      + e+1                           (3)


where e+1 the forecast error for the three—month rate, is uncorrelated with

any information in           The equation to be tested may therefore be estimated as


             R611t =        + bi.R3 +            + e1                      (4)
                       b0
where

                   =   lx(k_l) vector of variables consisting of information which
                       is costlessly available to investors at time t

      b0,b1,b* =       coefficients   to be estimated

and the test becomes—'

                                                                           (5)
      H0: b1=l,b=O.
        If the null hypothesis (5) can be rejected, it may be attributable to

either the rejection of rational expectations or the expectations model of the

term structure, or both. On the basis of this test, as well as the alternative

tests below, the precise cause of the rejection cannot be isolated. If, however,

the expectations hypothesis is valid, then rejection of the null hypothesis (5)

indicates that investors do not efficiently use all costlessly available

information. On the other hand, if investors' form expectations "rationally,"

then the model of equilibrium yields may include time—varying term premiums.

        In any event, the null hypothesis may be tested by estimating equation (4),

or equivalently

            Rt — R3          =        +
                                          e+1
by ordinary least squares and computing the appropriate test statistic for

            H0: b=O                                                        (5)

where

            z = {R ,x }

                 =
                     {b1_l,b*}
and the constant term is assumed to be zero for simplicity. In this case,

the usual test statistic is

            Q =      b[a2(ZZ)']'b             =   (l/2)bZZb                (6)



where       b =       (ZZ)1Z
            Z =      NXk matrix with row j equal to z.,jl,. .        .,N

            y        NX1 vector with element j equal to R . — R3 ,J•,j1,. ..,N

                 =    [l/(N—k)](—Zb)(—Z).
As is well known, under the null hypothesis, Q has an F-distribution with (k,N—k)

degrees of freedom, and is asymptotically distributed as 2(k).

Test II

        Another test formulated by Mishkin [15,161 involves cross—equation ratio-

nality restrictions. In this case, a distinction is made between anticipated

and unanticipated movements in economic variables following Barro [2,31. The

main feature of this framework is that if the economic variables in the model

are precisely those comprising the information set used by the market, then the

effects of unanticipated movements in variables on ex post holding—period yields

may be estimated, as well as testing the joint hypothesis of rational expecta-

tions and the expectations model of the term structure.
                                                  —7—




        Following Nishkin [15,16], the joint hypothesis of rational expectations

and the expectations model—equations (1) and (3)—may be shown to imply

             Rt -              R3        =                      +
                                                                    v                      (7)

where

             w             =       lxm vector of variables relevant to the determination of
                 t+1
                                   Treasury bill yields

             6
                           =       mxl vector of coefficients
                           =       an error that is orthogonal to 2
             v
                 t                                                      t
This model implies that unanticipated changes in the holding—period yield on
six—month Treasury bills will occur only when unanticipated information is

observed by investors.

        To represent investors' anticipations, Mishkin specifies the vector
              8/
autoregression—

             w             =       zr+u—t+l
                                   —t
                                                                                           (8)
where

             u             =       lxm vector of errors such that E(z u .)=O,j>O;
                                                                              —   and
                 t+l                                                         t 3
                                                   E(uu .)E,jO.

Substituting         investors' predictions of w
                                                          t+l
                                                                into equation (7) yields


             Rt — R3t                               + Vt.

The cross—equation test of rational expectations and the expectations model

becomes


            H0:
                       r       =   r*.                                                     (9)

        As shown by Abel and Mishkin [1], the Wald test of the null hypothesis (9)

associated with the Zeilner estimation of (8) and (7) is asymptotically equiva—

lent to Test I. Following these authors' proof, this may be seen by noting that

equation (7) may be rewritten as
                                           —8—



                     —
                         R3t
                               =
                                   (w+i_zr)   +    +v                          (7)
where         0 =   (r_r*)
 and the null hypothesis is

                     0 = 0.                                                    (9)
              H0:
         Because the T constraint across equations (8) and (7) is not binding,

the Zeilner estimator of 3 may be obtained by estimating equations (8) and (7)

recursively using OLS. In the matrix notation used earlier, the OLS estimates

of equation (8) implies

              zr= w—                                                           (10)

where W and U are NXm matrices corresponding to
                                              ;+l and u+1, respectively.
Subutituting equation (10) into equation (7) yields
                                                                               (7
Becau;e    the vector autoregression (8) is estimated by OLS, U is orthogonal to

Z    and the estimator of 0 is

which is numerically      identical to the estimator obtained in Test I.

         The final step involves computing the Wald test statistic corre-

sponding to the null hypothesis (9). This statistic may be computed

as


             R =    0{v(ZZ)1110                                                (12)

where        ; = (l/N)(—u—ze)-(—u—ze)
which   is asymptotically distributed as x2       with   k degrees of freedom. Abel
and Mishkin {lJ further show that the v may be computed from the OLS estima-
tion of equation (4),          and is equivalent, except for degrees of freedom, to
                                         —9—




2 used in equation (12). Thus Test I—as described by equations (5) and

 (6)—and Test Il—as described by equations (9) and (12)—are asymptotically

equivalent.

Test III

        Another test involving cross—equation restrictions focuses on the forward

three—month Treasury bill yield and the time—series process generating the three—

month yield. In this respect, the rationality restrictions to be tested are

analogous to those specified by Modigliani and Shiller [18], and tested by

Pesando [21] and Friedman [7] with survey data for inflation and interest rates,

respectively.

        Using the expression for the expectations hypothesis (1), the implied

three—month forward yield equals investors' rational expectation of the future

spot rate

                           =
            2R6 —     R3       E(R3+1Jc2)                               (13)


where the constant term premium is again deleted without any loss of generality.

In turn, R3t+l is assumed to be generated by a stochastic process including all

That is, the null hypothesis is

        Note that the right—hand side variables of equations (14) and (15) are

identical, implying that the Zeilner and OLS estimators for this two—equation

system are equivalent. In matrix notation, these estimators may be written

as

The variance—covariance matrix of these estimators is

                                         =                                            (18)

                                             respectively.

        In this case, it may be verified that the Wald test statistic for the

null hypothesis (16) is

              R   =                                                                   (19)

which is asymptotically distributed as 2(k) under the null

hypothesis.

        Alternatively, the stochastic processes (14) and (15) may be combined to

form

                                                       =          +                   (20)

where        6        =   kxl   vector of coefficients

                      = an error that is orthogonal to


From equation (2), the left—hand side of equation (20) merely equals                        —

The OLS estimator of 6 may therefore be expressed as

             6 =      (zz)'Z                                                         (21)


with variance—covariance matrix

             V(6) =       a2(ZZ)'                                                    (22)


where        a2 = OLS estimate of E(2).

        Note that         =
                              2—            which implies that equation (14) and (15) may be

substituted into (21) to yield

             6 =
                      (zz)z2 — (ZZ)z1                                                (23)




A similar substitution further implies that

             a2 =             + G2 —
                                        2;2

             1J                        1J
        Under the null hypothesis analogous to that in Test I (5), the relevant

test statistic for equation (20) is

            R = [l/a2]6(ZZ)rS

                  =
                      [l/(at1+a2_2a2) (x_x*)    I          (ZZ) (x_x*)

which is asymptotically equivalent to the Wald test statistic (19). The test

statistic for the cross—equation restrictions is, therefore, asymptotically

equivalent to that of the single—equation test described in Test I.

Test IV

        In addition to using volatility measures to assess the joint hypothesis of

rational expectations and the expectations model of the term structure, Shiller

[29] also conducts formal econometric tests using a single—equation estimation

approach.-' In terms of the three— and six—month yields examined here, Shiller's

[29] single—equation approach involves estimating an equation of the form

              R3+i — R6t     =
                                 b0 + bi(R6 t-R3            + t+l         (24)

Substituting expression (26) into (3) and then subtracting R6t from both sides

yields the expression

            R3t+l —   R6t
                             =   — + R6 —               +

        From the above, it is apparent that a slightly more general representa-

tion of this same test may be formed by rewriting equation (24) as

            R3t + R3 t+l —       2.R6
                                        =

and testing

This latter equation, together with the null hypothesis (25), is equivalent to

specialized version of Test I in which z consists of only R   and R

        The final case considered here is the test of cross—equation rationality

                                  but possibly contemporaneously correlated.
The cross—equation restrictions are again derived from the approximation used

to represent the joint hypothesis of rational expectations and the expectations

model of the term structure, but in this case the model is specified in terms

of information known at time t—l

             E(R6,k1_1) =          (l/2).E(R3c1)             + (l/2).E(R3,+1Ic2_1) + .                   (30)

As shown by Sargent [27], nonlinear restrictions on the vector autoregression

(29) are implied by this model (30).

        As both Sargent [27] and Shiller [29] note, however, such complicated

nonlinear restrictions are not necessary if the data allow the computation of

forward rates. In particular, with the three— and six—month yields used here,
                                            —14—



the expected three—month spot rate in period t may be expressed as

             E(R3,l_1) = 2.R6,_i            —
                                                R3 t-l

where          a under the null hypothesis. In turn, under the hypothesis of

rational expectations, the realizations of R3                     and R6t may be represented as


             R3+i = E(R3,+iQ_i) +
                                                                                     (32)
             R6 =        E(R6,Ict_1)
                                        +

                         orthogonal to

        If the joint hypothesis is true, equations (31) and (32) may be substituted

into equation (30) to yield

             (2.R6,_R3÷i) =          (26,_i_R3,_1)           + (c+1_2.n)             (33)


where the left—hand side equals                 and the right—hand side consists of the

forward three—month rate corresponding to R3 and an error term.-' The ioint

hypothesis of rationality and the expectations theory of the term structure may

therefore be tested by estimating the equatiori-'1

                 =                                           +
                     b.(2.R6,_i_R3,_i) + -—-                     (e+1—2.n)           (3Y)

where     l€Qt 1 and c is a vector of coefficients. The null hypothesis in this

case corresponds to the parameter restrictions

            H: b = 1,       c   0,                                                   (34)

which are a subset of the restrictions tested in the previous four tests.

        To demonstrate that the restrictions given by the null hypothesis of this

test (34) are a subset of those corresponding to the null hypothesis of Test I

(5), equations (4), (31), and (32) together may be used to represent                        as
                                      —15—



(assuming for simplicity that the term premium is constant)

            Rt =   b0
                        + bi.(2.R6,1_R3,t_i) ÷
                                                 b2.e   + e+i.           (35)


In terms of this expression, the null hypothesis of Test I becomes


            H0: b1 = b2
                             =   1.                                      (5)
Because e is orthogonal to (2.R6,_1_R3,_1), this same equation may be

estimated to test the null hypothesis of Test V, i.e.,

                        1.                                            (34)
           H0: b1 =
Thus, in Test V restrictions are only placed on the information set available

at time t—l, while in Test I additional restrictions are placed on the

innovations in variables between time t—l and time t. The usefulness of Test

V is therefore limited.

       II. Data and Estimation Techniques

       The disparity among the data sets in previous studies may in part account

for the range of empirical findings. Moreover, inadequate yield data for both

dependent and independent variables in equations such as (4) may have reduced

the asymptotic power of tests—in cases where the dependent variable is measured

with error—or caused biased coefficient estimates—in cases where the indepen-

dent variables are measured with error. This paper seeks to improve on previous

studies by measuring yields to maturity and holding-period yields precisely, and

by using all available data within a given time period. Following the descrip-

tions of the data, the problems posed by an overlapping weekly sample and the

estimation procedure used to obtain consistent estimates for both coefficients

and their variances are discussed.

Data

       In addition to Treasury bill yields, possible nonyield determinants of

time—varying term premiums are also examined empirically. Both the yield and

nonyield data are described below, with brief rationales for the nonyield data

also provided. It should also be emphasized that the possible determinants of

time—varying term premiums were selected a priori, and were not subject to any

"pretesting.
               ,!/

        U.S. Treasury Bill Yields. The Treasury bill yield data are taken from

"Composite Closing Quotations for U.S. Government Securities," which is a

letter published daily by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The data were

collected for weekly intervals from Friday's letter, beginning on January 2,

1970, and ending September 13, 1979. During this period, the Federal Reserve

focused on the control of one or more monetary aggregates, although perhaps to

varying degrees, while maintaining an important role for "money market condi-

tions." Extending the sample further would have encompassed the October 1979

policy change, which de—emphasized money market conditions in favor of a reserve

aggregate control procedure.

        During the entire sample period, a previously announced amount of three—

and six—month Treasury bills were auctioned every week (usually on Monday), and

made available to investors on Thursday.-' The data used here correspond to

the average of the closing bid and ask quotations of these newly issued three—

and six—month bills. As such, a six—month (26--week) bill in this sample matures

on exactly the same day as two successive three—month (13—week) bills. The

yield data are also expressed as coupon—equivalent yields (in percent),

In addition, the quarterly holding—period yield on a six—month bill is computed

as

      U.S. Treasury Bill Supplies (S3 and S6). Researchers have for some time

tested the statistical significance of security supply variables as determinants

of relative yields.--' While most of these efforts were unsuccessful in isolating

significant economic effects in a single—equation context, Roley [24,25] has

recently found such effects using a disaggregated structural model. In this

latter model, the reduced—form for security yields implies that the effects of

Treasury security supplies vary depending on investors' wealth flows.--' tjnfor—

tunately, investors' wealth flows are not available on a weekly basis, making

the use of more traditional specifications a necessity.

      The Treasury bill supply data are collected to correspond exactly to the

yields. These data consist of the amount of three— and six—month bills auctioned

each week(in billions of dollars), as reported in the Treasury Bulletin. These

weekly supply figures are easily accessible to investors before Thursday, the

day corresponding to the yield data. For three—month bills, the supply data

represent weekly flows, since some bills issued previously also mature in 13

weeks. For six—month bills, this is often not the case, implying that the data

represent both stocks and flows of bills maturing in 26 weeks.

     Unemployment Rate (RUn). Following Nelson [19], researchers have occa-

sionally tested the significance of the unemployment rate—as well as other

cyclical macroeconomic variables—as a determinant of time—varying term pre—

          The data series for this variable differs from those of the others

included in this study in that it is a monthly series. Thus, in some cases the
                                   —18—



latest figure has been known for one week, while at other times it has been

available for two, three, four, or five weeks. The unrevised unemployment rate

figure (in percent), as announced initially by the Bureau of Labor Statistics

(Department of Labor), is used here. To take account of the different lengths

of time that the most recent figure was known, five separate variables were

originally entered into the estimated equations. In the estimated equations

reported in the next section, however, a single unemployment rate variable is

reported. The x2 statistic used to test the hypothesis that these five

variables have the same coefficient had a value of less than .0001.

      Risk. Following Fama [5] and Mishkin [16], a risk variable is also

included as a possible determinant of a time—varying term premium. This measure

is included by these researchers in an attempt to account for the increased risk

of capital loss usually associated with greater interest rate volatility. Fol-

lowing Mishkin [16], this variable is represented as


          RISK =   (l/8).Z   R3tl3. —     R3t_l3(j+l)I
where t is now defined in terms of weekly intervals.-'

     Foreign Holdings of U.S. Treasury Securities (FH). Throughout the late

1970's it was often alleged that foreign central banks had "preferred habitats"

in terms of their purchases of U.S. Treasury securities. To examine whether this

behavior ultimately affected relative yields by changing net supplies available

to domestic investors, a variable representing foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury

securities is included. The data series used here corresponds to marketable U.S.

Government securities (in tens of billions of dollars) held in custody by the

Federal Reserve System for foreign official and international accounts, and is

reported each Friday in the Federal Reserve's H.4.l release. With respect to
                                        —19—



the yield data, the previous Friday's foreign holdings figure is used in the

empirical work.

Estimation Techniques

        Because four of the five tests were shown to be asymptotically equiva-

lent and Test V was shown to be less restrictive than the others, only one

basic specification is empirically examined. This specification corresponds

to equation (4) which was derived in conjunction with Test I. With a nonover—

lapping data set including three—month Treasury bills spaced 13 weeks apart,

consistent estimates of the vector of coefficients in equation (4) and their

variance—covariance matrix may be obtained using OLS estimation. However,

with the weekly data employed here, the errors in equation (4) are described

by a 12th—order moving—average process

                          12
             e
                 t+l      .  i t—i
                       vt + S.v     .                                  (36)


where       v = serially       uncorrelated error process.

This representation of the error process follows, for example, if the null

hypothesis (5) also holds for Treasury bills with one week to maturity, in

which case the v •(i=O,l,...,l2) in (36) represent successive weekly innova-

tions in the one—week yield.

        As discussed by Hansen and Hodrick [11], OLS estimation of equation (4)

with the moving—average error process (36) results in consistent coefficient

estimates, but the usual estimate of the variance—covariance matrix of the

estimated coefficients is not consistent. Generalized least squares (GLS)

estimation appears to be a logical alternative to OLS in this case. However,

as these authors again show, in rational expectations models such as equation
                                       —20—



(4) GLS techniques do not lead to consistent coefficient         estimates.
        As an alternative to the above estimation techniques, Hansen and Hodrick

[11] propose estimating equations such as (4) by OLS, and then computing a

modified variance—covariance matrix of the estimated coefficients using the

moving—average process (36). Because the OLS estimates of the coefficients are

already consistent, the procedure only involves computing a consistent esti-

mator of the asymptotic variance—covariance matrix. In this respect, Hansen

and Hodrick demonstrate that a consistent estimator of the asymptotic variance—

covariance matrix of N2(b—b) is

            N(ZZ)1ZSZ(ZZ)1                                                    (37)

where        S =   estimated NXN variance—covariance matrix of e+i(t=l,. .
                                                             N
                   with individual elements computed as s,( e.e.).[l/(N_j)]

                   j=0,1,... ,l2
and b, b, and Z are defined as before in equations (4), (4), and (6). These

authors further prove that the asymptotic variance—covariance matrix (37)

obtained using overlapping data is more efficient than that estimated by OLS

with a nonoverlapping data set. This latter feature provides motivation for

using all of the available data. The relevant test statistic obtained from

this estimation procedure is

which is asymptotically distributed as x2 with k degrees of freedom.

        III. Empirical Results

        To test the joint hypothesis of rational expectations and the expecta-

tions model of the term structure, equation (4) from Test I is estimated.

Again, of the five tests considered in the first section, Tests II, III, and
                                         —21—



IV were shown   to   be asymptotically equivalent to Test I. The equations are

estimated with weekly data, starting on January 2, 1970, and ending on

September 13, 1979, a total of 507 observations. In some instances lagged

values of yields appear as right—hand side variables, which somewhat shortens

the estimation period. Consistent coefficient estimates and test statistics

are obtained using the Hansen—Hodrick procedure outlined in the previous

section.

      The basic notion behind this test is that if investors form their expec-

tations rationally, and the expectations hypothesis accurately represents

equilibrium yields, then the excess quarterly return on a six—month Treasury

bill is uncorrelated with any previously available costless information. This

test is represented by equations (4) and (5) of which the former may be

written to conform to the variables introduced above as


           Rt =           +           + b2.R6 + b3.RU +
                     b0       b1.R3                       b4•FHt
                                                                        (39)
                 + b5.S3 + b6.S6 + b7.RISK + e1.

The null hypothesis to be tested is

                              =    =    =    =    = 0.
           H0: b1 = 1, b = b3   b4   b5   b6   b7                       (40)


      The estimation and test results of this equation as well as seven other

subcases are reported in Table 1. The first equation (1.1) merely investi-

gates the hypothesis that b1l, when all other information is excluded. As is

apparent from the last two columns in Table 1, this hypothesis cannot be

rejected at any reasonable level of significance.

      In the second row, the entire information set is included, as in equation

(39), and the null hypothesis can be rejected at less than the 0.05 percent

level of significance. In this equation, the level of the six—month yield—

similar to Shiller [28] and Friedman [61—and the foreign holdings variable

are statistically significant at the 5 percent level. The sign of the

coefficient on this latter variable implies that the higher the level of

foreign holdings of Treasury securities, the lower the term premium. Because

foreign purchases are comprised mainly of three—month bills, one possible

explanation of this result is that when investors observe high foreign

holdings, they expect further purchases of three—month bills in the next

period (t+l). In turn, continued foreign purchases reduce the net supply of

three—month bills in period t+l, which may be expected to lower R3       and
                h
hence increase R6     Thus, the risk of capital loss is reduced, which lowers

the required term premium.U'

      Two further details concerning the estimation results of equation (1.2)

also deserve comment. First, the large sample size resulting from the use of

overlapping data may make it desirable to evaluate the test statistics at

somewhat lower significance levels than usual. However, with the marginal

significance level of 0.0002 percent reported in the table, only a drastic

reduction in the significance level would alter the outcome of the test.

Second, the statistical significance of the time—varying term premium does not,

of course, guarantee its economic significance. In an attempt to evaluate its

economic significance, the implied term premium was calculated and found to
                                                h
account for about 35 percent of the variance of R6t —   R3t.   Alternatively,
                                                                                28/
the standard deviation of the implied term premium is about 60 basis points.—

      The remaining rows of Table 1 include each of the information variables

separately. In these equations the null hypothesis can be rejected at the 5

percent level in only one instance, when the risk variable is included. Never-

theless, the most meaningful test involves equation (1.2) in Table 1, which

includes the entire information set.

      Equation (39) is also subjected to two types of specification tests—a

Chow test and a Goldfeld—Quandt test. In part, these tests are motivated by

the somewhat different empirical results obtained by Mishkin [14] and Shiller

[28], where the specifications only apparently differ in terms of assumptions

about heteroscedasticity. To avoid problems posed by the 12th—order moving—

average error process embodied in the weekly data used here, the tests were

conducted for nonoverlapping samples with observations spaced 13 weeks apart.

For the first such subsample—beginning on December 30, 1971 and ending on

June 21, 1979—the values of the Chow and Goldfeld—Quandt test statistics are

1.7393 and 0.1693, respectively, with marginal significance levels of 0.5750

and 0.72O8.-' Thus, the results do not indicate any problems regarding

structural shifts and heteroscedasticity.

      IV. Summary of Conclusions

      In the investigation of the joint hypothesis of rational expectations and

the expectations model of the term—structure presented in this paper, previous

studies were extended in three main areas. First, common efficient markets—

rational expectations tests were compared, and it was shown that four of the

five tests considered are asymptotically equivalent, and the fifth is less

restrictive than the other four. Second, all available data for Treasury bills

maturing in exactly 13 and 26 weeks beginning in 1970 and ending in 1979 were

used in testing the joint hypothesis. In contrast, previous studies typically

discarded 12/13 of the sample to form a nonoverlapping data set. Finally, a
                                   —24—




more complete set of possible determinants of time—varying term premiums was

tested.

      The empirical results indicated that the null hypothesis that investors

form their expectations rationally and the expectations model of the term

structure accurately represents equilibrium yields could be rejected at an

extremely low significance level. This result most noticeably differs from

those obtained recently by Sargent [27] and Shiller [29], who also used

Treasury security yields and could not reject this same joint hypothesis.

Because a joint hypothesis was tested, however, the precise cause of rejection

cannot be determined. The results instead indicate that either investors do

not form expectations rationally, or equilibrium yields contain time—varying

term premiums which depend on costlessly available information.

1. These results may be generalized very easily and applied to studies involving
    pairs of securities such as Treasury bills and long—term bonds.

2. Again, overlapping data are actually used here, but this presents estimation,
    not analytical, problems. Nonoverlapping data may be considered without
    any loss of generality.

3. While this approximation is particularly convenient for the analytical
    discussion in this section, it is not employed in the empirical work.
    Instead, exact yields to maturity and holding—period yields are employed.
    For a more accurate approximation for long—term
                                                    securities, see Modigliani
    and Shiller [18].

4.
     Similar to Friedman [7], only costlessly available data are used in the
     vector. In the efficient markets literature, this test corresponds to a
     semistrong—form test. For discussions of different concepts of market
     efficiency, see Fama [4] and Throop [33].

5. Alternatively, equation (4) may be written as

            Rh
             6,t
                 -R3,t    b0 +xb*+e
                             —t—    t+1
     where    includes the current three—month bill rate. For recent examples
     of this approach, see Mishkin [14], Shiller [28], and Friedman [7].
     Friedman's test differs from the others in that market survey data are
     used to represent E(R3+1Ic2).

6. There appears to be confusion in the literature concerning the asymptotic
    efficiency of OLS in situations like (4) where the residual et+l is
    orthogonal to all information available at time t,     but in which et÷l
    is likely correlated with elements of t+l not included in       In such
    cases, the {et} will be serially uncorrelated provided that et+lGOt+l and
     t÷i, prompting some researchers to conclude that (under normality) OLS
     and FUlL are equivalent and, hence. OLS is asymptotically efficient.
                                                                           (See,
     for example, Abel and Mishkin [1].) Such a conclusion, however, is not
     generally valid because in these situations correlations between the con-
     temporaneous error term and future regressors (i.e., elements of
                                                                      t+j not
    in     for i>O) may permit more efficient estimation of the regression
    parameters than is possible with OLS. For example, consider the following
    model:

              =
                       + e+1
    where the distributions of Xt and et exhibit the properties: E(xt)=E(et+1)=O;
    E(xtj.e+1)=O, for iO; E(xt+i.et+l)0, for i>l; Var(et)=2; Var(xt)=l; and
     the correlation between xt+l and et+1 is p. If n is the sample size, then
     it is straightforward to verify that the asymptotic distribution of the OLS
     estimator of    8OLS' is

           n1(8) N(O,2).
    Next, consider an alternative estimator of ,   , given   by the OLS estimator
    of   in the regression

           yt =   •x + p•x1 +
    It may be shown that    is an asymptotically efficient estimator of ,   with
    asymptotic distribution


           flh/2(_8)    N(O,(1-p2)2)

    which clealy has a lower variance than OLS provided pO. In fact, if
    pl, then   estimates   precisely! This special case is hardly surprising
     since if xt+l and et÷l are perfectly correlated (i.e., p=l), then three
     consecutive observations on the Yt and Xt suffice to determine two of the
     corresponding residuals (et) precisely, thereby eliminating all uncertainty
     from the regression.

7. As Mishkin [15,161 notes, even if the entire information set is not included
    in the model, the joint hypothesis may nevertheless be tested. Mishkin also
    observes that causality is subject to the interpretation of the researcher
    in this framework.

8. Note that zt is solely comprised of lagged values of w in this case.

 9. Note that the estimators in (17) are not FIML nor need they be efficient
     for reasons similar to those discussed in footnote 6.

10. For discussions of volatility measures and their implications, see Shiller
     [29,30]. Formal tests concerning the excess volatility of long—term yields
     are conducted by Singleton [32].

11. Shiller [29] actually tests the null hypothesis (25) against a specific
     alternative hypothesis, but this is not considered here.
12. A slightly more general representation of the expected future spot yield
     is used here in comparison to Shiller [291, who assumes that the term
     premium equals zero.

13. This test has also been applied recently by Hakkio [9].

14. Sargent [27] specifies the vector autoregression in first differences,
     which, as Shiller [29] notes, implies that the variances of the yields
     are infinite.

15. The basic reason that the error term ti is described by a first—order
     moving—average process is that it consists of innovations from time t—l
     to time t+l. This feature is discussed in the next section in the
     context of the overlapping data used in the empirical work.

16. Note that the term premiums in equations (30) and (31) cancel.

17. As Hansen and Hodrick [11] demonstrate in a similar context, using a first—
     order moving—average correction in the estimation of equation (33) results
     in inconsistent estimates. This topic is discussed in more detail in the
     next section.

18. As discussed later in this section, foreign purchases of Treasury bills are
     included in the data set. A foreign exchange rate was employed initially
     (and was statistically significant), but it was replaced in the early
     stages of this project because the rationale for its inclusion depended
     ultimately on foreign purchases. The other possible determinants of time—
     varying term premiums examined here have all appeared in previous studies.
     Thus, it may be argued that the data have in fact been subjected to some
     pretesting. Nevertheless, variables such as security supplies have been
     included for theoretical reasons, not because of their statistical
     significance (in this case, lack of statistical significance) in previous
     studies using single—equation estimation procedures.

19. The usual proviso concerning holidays applies here.

20. Instead of 90 and 180, actual days to maturity ranging from 90 to 92 days
     for three—month bills, for example, were used.

21. See, for example, Okun [20], Modigliani and Sutch [17], and more recently,
     Friedman [6].

22. For an explicit representation of this reduced—form expression, along with
     other details of structural models of interest rate determination, see
     Friedman and Roley [8].

23. See, for example, Pesando [22] and Friedman [6].

24. Fama's [5] measure only differs from that in the text in that it is com-
     puted using monthly, instead of quarterly, data.
25. Again, OLS estimates may not be efficient in this case for reasons dis-
     cussed in footnote 6.

26. GLS estimation requires that the right—hand side variables are strictly
     exogenous. In other words, future values of the right—hand side
     variables should be useless in forming optimal forecasts of R1   a
     property that is clearly violated.
                                                                  '
27. To examine this explanation further, the following equation was estimated
     over the sample of 507 observations:

          LFH =    0.0131 + 0.l154•tFH 13 + O.2394e 1 + e
                                                   t—     t
                   (0.0043) (0.0472)

             =    0.01     SE = 0.0718   DW = 2.04

    where standard errors are in parentheses. These estimates do, in fact,
    indicate a positive and statistically significant relationship between
    net changes in foreign holdings from time t—13 to time t.

28. The estimated variance of the term premium was computed as the difference
     in the estimated residual variances of the constrained version (i.e.,
     b11) of equation (1.1) and equation (1.2).

29. The degrees of freedom for these F—statistics are (8,15) and (5,5),
     respectively. The middle five observations were deleted in computing the
     Goldfeld—Quandt statistic. These two tests were also performed for the
     other 12 nonoverlapping subsamples. In only one case was a F—statistic
     significant at the 5 percent level. However, due to the error process
     (36) inherent in the data, these tests are not independent, making their
     interpretation as a group difficult.
