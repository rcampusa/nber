                     Does the Estate Tax Raise Revenue?




                                   ABSTRACT




      Proponents    of transfer taxation argue that     levies on gifts and
estates   serve the dual   purposes   of breaking up large concentrations of
private   wealth, while raising significant revenues.             A number of
commentators have recently questioned the first of these purported
advantages, on the grounds that a variety of available estate planning
techniques allow wealthy individuals to pass on vast resources
essentially tax free.      Most techniques entail the use of intra vivos
transfers, and are particularly effective when these transfers are made
as early in life as possible. In this paper, I argue that           the   use of
these same estate   planning   techniques also largely neutralize the second
objective of transfer taxation by depressing income tax revenues. This
effect is reinforced by the tendency for estate taxation to encourage
charitable bequests. Although it is difficult to quantify the indirect
revenue effects with a high degree of precision, I find that, prior to
the Tax Reform Act of 1986, these effects could easily have offset all
revenues collected through the estate tax. The recent Tax Reform Act
only partially vitiates this conclusions.

I.    Introduction

      Proponents of transfer taxation argue that well—designed levies on

estates and gifts serve two primary objectives. First, such taxes may

promote an equitable distribution of economic resources by breaking up

large concentrations of wealth. Yet many commentators have noted that

common estate planning techniques allow wealthy individuals to transfer

vast fortunes while paying little or no tax (see e.g. Cooper [1979]).

Accordingly, it is possible that this first objective is served only in

cases where individuals have little or no desire to avoid taxation.

Second, transfer taxes raise revenue. In practice, levies on gifts and

estates have raised roughly $6 billion per year over the last five

years. While this suni   is   certainly substantial, one should bear in mind

that it represents less than 1% of all federal revenues for the same

period, despite the imposition of high statutory marginal tax rates.

One might therefore be inclined to conclude that transfer taxation

achieves the second objective with perhaps a modicum of success.

      Unfortunately, this conclusion is premature. In order to measure

the true revenues associated with transfer taxation, one must determine

the net incremental contribution which these taxes make to total federal

revenues, or, to put it another way, one must estimate the amount by

which total revenues would decline if these taxes were eliminated. This

figure may bear very little relation to measures of collected revenue

reported   by the government. In particular, many of the same estate
planning techniques which allow wealthy individuals to escape transfer
                                   —2—




taxation also have important income tax implications. Thus, elimination

of transfer taxes might significantly affect income tax revenues.

      In this paper, I argue that, as a consequence of behavioral

responses to estate taxation, a substantial amount of capital income is

taxed at lower marginal rates under the personal income tax. I

emphasize two major channels through which this occurs. First, estate

planners agree that perhaps the best method of avoiding estate taxes is

to make substantial intra vivos gifts, and to make them as early in life

as possible. Typically, wealthy individuals can do this in ways which

minimize, or entirely eliminate gift tax liabilities. The net effect is

to transfer wealth, typically from parents to children, during a period

of life in which children tend to pay lower marginal rates under the

personal income tax. While differences between marginal income tax

rates alone create incentives for wealthy individuals to make intra

vivos gifts,-!1 the estate tax adds to this incentive, presumably

generating larger transfers. The government effectively foregoes a

portion of its tax claim on incrementally transferred assets. Second,

since charitable bequests are deductible from gross estate for tax

purposes, the estate tax creates a substantial incentive to make such

contributions. While one might well deem this a desirable outcome, it

is important to recognize that it, too, has important consequences for

the income tax. In this case, resources are transferred from

individuals with positive marginal tax rates to tax exempt

institutions. As a result, the government foregoes its entire claim on

the transferred assets.
                                       —3—




         Unfortunately,   it is extremely difficult to measure these effects

with precision. The most important obstacle is the availability of

extensive financial data on a sample drawn from the wealthiest 5%        of   the

population. While most of this information is in principle contained in

federal personal income, estate, and gift tax returns, the IRS is

reluctant to release such information for fear of violating the

confidentiality of wealthy taxpapers. Even if this data became

available, the measurement of intra vivos transfers (which are often

well—disguised) would pose severe conceptual difficulties. My strategy

in this paper is to estimate true revenues on the basis of the best

available evidence. Since this evidence is admittedly sketchy, it is

appropriate    to think of my calculations as suggestive, rather than
precise.
         Two major conclusions emerge from this study. First, the indirect

effects of estate taxation on federal personal income tax revenue are

potentially of the same order of magnitude as the reported revenue

collected by this tax. Thus, these reported figures may lead one quite

far astray. Second, available evidence suggests that, historically,

true revenues associated with estate taxation may well have been near

zero,    or even negative. Recent tax reforms which reduce the
progressivity      of federal personal income tax rates only partially

vitiate this conclusion. Far from "backing up" the income tax as some

have claimed, the estate tax may actually generate a rise in income tax

avoidance   activities sufficient to offset revenue collected through
estate   levies.

         This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, I briefly

review the history of federal estate and gift taxes, paying special

attention to provisions which play prominent roles in the ensuring

analysis. I elaborate upon the incentive effects of estate taxation in

section 3, and present evidence documenting significant behavioral

adjustments to changes in the tax code in section 4. Section 5 contains

estimates of net revenue raised through estate taxation, which are

adjusted to account for the behavioral responses discussed in sections 3

and 4. In section 6, I turn my attention to several additional

considerations, some of which introduce potentially countervailing

forces. Special attention is given to various provisions of the Tax

Reform Act of 1986. Section 7 contains conclusions.


II. A Brief        History of Federal Estate   and   Gift Thxatlon
         The   modern estate tax has been in effect since 1916.      The original

legislation      provided for   a $50,000 exemption, with progressive marginal

tax rates      rising from 1%, to 10% on   estates over $10 million. The gift

tax was    instituted in   1924. Rates ranged from 1% to     25%, matching
estate    tax rates in the same year. Donor's were provided with a $50,000

exemption, plus a $5000 annual exclusion per donee. As of 1932, gift

tax rates were reduced relative to estate tax         rates, and remained 25%
lower than estate rates through 1976.

         From 1943 to 1976, the basic provisions of federal estate and gift

taxes remained essential unchanged. The law provided for a $60,000

estate tax exemption, with progressive rates ranging from 3% to 77%.

The gift tax exemption was fixed at $30,000, with a $3,000 annual
                                    —5—



exclusion per donee. Decedents were allowed to bequeath one—half of

their gross estates to their spouses tax free (the marital deduction),

and all charitable bequests were deductible. In addition, recipients of

bequests were allowed to step—up the basis on all assets for purposes of

capital gains taxation to the fair market value of those assets at the

time of their benefactor's death. A step—up of basis was not allowed

for assets transferred by gift.

      Congress significantly altered the structure of federal transfer

taxes in the Tax Reform Act of 1976. Most importantly, this act

provided for unification of estate and gift taxes. Since 1976, all

cognizable transfers have been taxed jointly under the same progressive

schedule, which originally includes a maximum rate of 70%. Lifetime

giving is still slightly favored, in that the gift tax is imposed only

on the net transfer, while the estate tax base also includes amounts

used to pay the tax. The act also established a unified credit, which

provided tax relief equivalent to a $60,000 exemption, but which was

designed to rise in steps over a period of years. The $3,000 yearly

gift tax exclusion was retained, and the marital deduction was

liberalized, so that decedents could transfer the maximum of $250,000

and 50% of gross estate tax free. Finally, Congress removed the step—up

of basis at death, but this provision was later repealed.

      The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA) embraced four major

changes to this system of transfer taxation. First, the unified credit

was increased   in steps to a maximum of $192,800 in 1987   (equivalent to a

$600,000   exemption).   Second, the maximum marginal tax rate was
                                         —6—




decreased    in steps   from   70% to 50%.   Third,   all limits on the marital

deduction   were removed. Finally, the annual gift tax exclusion was

raised to $10,000.


III. Incentive     Effects of Estate     Taxation

       In   this section, I argue that the      federal estate   tax has generated
strong incentives for individuals to transfer large amounts of
accumulated wealth to their intended heirs prior to death, and in fact
to   do so as early in life as possible. Furthermore, I note that the

deductibility of charitable bequests enhances the attractiveness of

leaving a portion of one's estate to charity. In subsequent sections, I

document    the effects of these incentives on behavior, and compute the
attendent    impact on federal personal income        tax revenues.
       A.    Intra vivos gifts

       Prior to 1977, the federal tax system treated gifts more favorably

than bequests. Despite the unification of gift and estate taxes in the

Tax Reform Act of 1976, virtually all estate planners still recommend a

plan of systematic lifetime giving as perhaps the most important method

of transfer tax    avoidance     (see Brosterman [1977], Kess and Westlin

[1982], Esperti and Peterson [1983], Clay [1982], and Cooper [1979]).

In fact, Cooper argues that


        The first major goal of good estate planning is to freeze
        the size of a client's estate at its current level and
        divert future growth to the natural objects of the client's
        bounty.  ...    it is far easier to
                                         divert future growth than
        it is to disgorge wealth already accumulated, and good
        estate planning attempts to get estate—freezing action into
        operation as soon as possible so as to cut off wealth
                                    —7—



     accumulation before it becomes a more serious planning
     problem.


(emphasis added). In practice, there are many ways to accomplish this

while simultaneously minimizing, or entirely avoiding gift tax

liability. Since these planning techniques have been reviewed at length

elsewhere, I will provide only a brief summary   of   the major strategies.


      1.   Undisguised gifts
      Since   a substantial amount of gifts is entirely exempt from
taxation, a simple plan of undisguised lifetime giving is, for the
majority   of families, the most effective estate planning tool. By

splitting gifts, a married couple can now transfer $20,000 ($6,000 prior

to 1982) per year to each intended heir without incurring any gift tax

liability whatsoever. Thus, a couple with two children could divest

itself of $1 million over a 25 year period simply by taking advantage of

the gift tax exclusion. If the couple is willing to contemplate gifts

to grandchildren, or to spouses of children or grandchildren, the

potential for transfer tax avoidance grows enormously.

      It is, however, essential to begin taking advantage of the gift
tax exclusion as early as possible. For one thing, the timing of each
individual's death is uncertain, and all assets remaining in his

possession at the time of his death are taxable as part of his estate.

In addition, the exemption is not cumulative, so that failure to take

advantage ofit in any particular year implies that one opportunity to
make tax—free transfers has been lost forever. This consideration may
be quite important for very wealthy individuals who, despite programs of
                                     —8—




systematic lifetime giving, still expect to die with substantial

estates.

        The Tax Reform Act of 1976 also provides substantial unified

credits against estate and gift tax liabilities. At first, it might

appear as though this provision treats gifts and bequests neutrally.

However, this impression is erroneous. In fact, as long as the donor

plans to exhaust the credit completely, its value is inversely related

to the date at which he chooses to take it. This principle is easily

demonstrated. For simplicity, assume that     the   credit is fixed at its

1987 level of $192,800, so that   it corresponds to an exemption of
$600,000. Consider a wealthy individual who, among other things, owns a

piece   of property worth $600,000. He may transfer the entire parcel to
his heirs immediately without incurring any tax      liability.   Upon his
eventual   demise, his estate will pay taxes only on the residual

assets. If, on the other hand, he holds the property until his death,

it will ordinarilly escalate in value. Suppose he in fact dies ten

years later, and that the property is then worth $1 million. The first

$600,000 would, of course, be exempt. However, his estate would then

pay taxes not only on the residual assets, but also on the $400,000.

gain.-/ At current rates, this would imply an incremental estate tax

liability of between $150,000 and $200,000.


        2. Diversion of profitable investment opportunities

        Perhaps the most common and informal estate planning activity

entails the diversion of profitable investment opportunities to one's

intended heirs. Parents can provide valuable information and advice
                                      —9—




concerning   potential investments without incurring gift tax     liability.
In many cases, parents devote great effort to locating and arranging
profitable business deals, and then bring their children in as
coinvestors. Such diversions do not generate any incremental tax
liabilities,   even though their success may   depend upon expert services
supplied   by the parent. If children lack the necessary capital, parents

can lend it to them. As long as these loans are made at prevailing

rates of interest and observe arms—length regulations, no gift tax

liability   is incurred even if the child would have been unable to obtain
a    similar loan from a third party. Alternatively, the parent can help

his child to obtain   a loan   at favorable rates by guaranteeing repayment,

without risk of transfer taxation. Finally, the parent can provide

assurances that, should the deal fail, he will pick up the loss. In the

event a loss actually occurs, the parent will be compelled to pay gift

tax on the associated transfer. However, from the point of view of a

risk averse child, the parent's     guarantee amounts to   an insurance

policy, the value of which exceeds his expected loss.

        For parents who own large portions of businesses or closely held

corporations, additional opportunities for diversions arise. In many

cases, a parent can shift profitable activities from his primary

business to a separate partnership or enterprise owned partially or

completely by his children. A parent may also bring his children into a

family partnership as silent partners, thereby diverting a share of the

earnings and appreciation from his business. In order to accomplish

this while minimizing taxable transfers, it is essential to arrange the
                                       —10—



partnership as early as possible.


      3.   Sophisticated estate tax avoidance
      Various   sophisticated estate   planning   techniques   allow   wealthy

individuals to transfer resources intra vivos in ways which escape

notice under the gift tax. Important techniques are the use of

preferred stock recapitalizations in closely held firms, installment

sales, and life insurance.

      In a preferred stock recapitalization, the parent cancells

outstanding common stock, and issues in its place a combination of

preferred and common stock. He distributes the preferred stock

primarily to himself (or other current owners), and the common stock

primarily to his children (or other intended heirs). If desired, this

can be accomplished without transferring significant control over the

corporation to his children. By selecting an appropriate dividend

entitlement for the preferred stock, the parent can reduce the value of

the common stock to a negligable level, reflecting only the speculative

growth potential of the corporation. In this way, the parent entirely

avoids the gift tax, but succeeds in transferring all future corporate

growth, brought about in part by his own expertise and effort, to his

children. One difficulty is, of course, that       the   parent may be forced

to accept a high level of taxable personal income from the preferred

stock. Nevertheless, there are many cases in which such income is

desirable, and it is in these cases that estate planners tend to

recommend the recapitalization.
                                    —11—



        Installment sales are frequently used to transfer real property.

The parent sells this property to his children while simultaneously

providing financing. He then typically foregives interest payments as

they come due. In some cases, the parent uses the property for business

activities, and leases it back from the child. Rental payments then

partially offset interest payments, and the remaining interest is

typically foregiven. All foregiven interest is, of course, potentially

taxable as a gift. The primary advantage of the installment sale is

that the parent can transfer all accumulation on the entire parcel

immediately, despite the fact that the bulk of actual gifts (foregiven

interest payments) will not be made for many years. In addition, when

the parent uses the property for business activities, he may be able to

develop it with the ultimate benefit eventually accruing to his children

free of tax. Finally, it is even possible to provide, as part of the

terms of the original sale, that the installment payments will terminate

upon the parents death, without drawing the unpaid portion into the

parent's estate. The primary disadvantage of the installment sale is

that it forces the parent to realize a capital gain. However, the

parent can defer realization through the use of balloon payments.

Furthermore, upon the parent's demise it   appears   possible to largely
eliminate   capital gains obligations on the remaining portion.
       Life insurance provides a particularly attractive estate planning
tool   for highly paid executives. It is quite common for corporations

(particularly those which are closely held) to provide their executives

with large amounts   of such insurance as a fringe benefit. An executive
                                     —12—



may assign ownership in this insurance to prospective heirs, thereby

excluding it from his estate. Although premiums over a certain

threshold are taxable to the executive under the personal income tax,

assignment of ownership in such a policy to heirs is apparently not

cognizable as a gift. As a result, this scheme completely avoids

transfer taxes. Since this arrangement can be used for ordinary life

insurance as well as group term insurance, the net effect can be to

transfer resources into an accumulating whole life policy. Since

investment income accruing to policy holders within life insurance

companies is tax exempt, the government thereby foregoes its entire

claim on the transferred assets until the executive's death.


        4.   EvasIon

        Many families presumably engage in simple gift tax evasion.   It is

certainly    possible for individuals to make substantial gifts in forms
which   are difficult, if not impossible for the IRS to trace. Outright

gifts of cash and durable goods (clothes, furniture, appliances) fall

into this category.



        Each of these estate and gift tax avoidance techniques has the

ultimate effect of transferring resources from parent to child at a

relatively     early date. Indeed, in most cases, effective planning
requires     these transfers to be made as early as possible. To the extent
children     face significantly lower marginal rates under the personal

income, significant losses of tax revenue may result.
                                      —13—



       It is important to bear in mind that wealthy individuals are not

solely motivated by the desire to minimize taxes. Indeed, estate

planners emphasize that this goal often conflicts with other legitimate

concerns, such as retaining control over one's assets, maintaining one's

desired standard of living, and providing one's children with

appropriate incentives. Proper estate planning balances the costs and

benefits of tax avoidance at the margin. For this very reason, we would

expect changes in the tax treatment of gifts and bequests to affect

intra vivos transfers significantly.


       B. Charitable      Bequesta
       Incentives   for charitable giving arise directly from the deducti-

bility of such bequests for estate tax purposes. If, for example, an

individual faces a marginal estate tax rate of 50%, he can     by foregoing

50$   of   bequests to his heirs provide $1 to charity. The effective price

of contributing $1 to charity is therefore only 50$ (in general, this

price is $(1 —      t),   where t is the testator's marginal estate tax

rate). Sophisticated estate planners may in addition recommend the use

of front—end trusts, which provide that the income from an estate be

used for charitable purposes over some specified period, after which all

assets are returned to the decedent's heirs. Such an arrangement can

virtually eliminate all estate taxes while preserving substantial value

for one's descendents.
                                    —14—




IV.     Behavioral Evidence
       While the estate tax creates strong incentive for wealthy
individuals to make intra vivos gifts and charitable bequests, this does
not   necessarily imply that these tax incentives have a significant

effect on behavior. Accordingly, I now present empirical evidence

concerning actual behavioral responses. As we shall see, the evidence

strongly supports the view that these responses are extremely large.


       A Intra Vivos Transfers

       Unfortunately, data on gifts is virtually impossible to obtain, in

part because they are often disguised as other sorts of transactions

(recall the discussion in Section 3). Although one can obtain some

information on trusts from IRS fiduciary income tax data, it is not

possible to distinguish between the formation of revocable and

irrevocable trusts. A revocable trust is not a consumated gift, and is

therefore treated as part of the donor's assets for tax purposes. As a

result, this data is uninformative.

       One can, nevertheless, document the sensitivity of intra vivos

transfers to tax code provisions indirectly. Note in particular that

the choice between making a gift or a bequest is essentially one of

timing. A parent can transfer wealth to his children immediately, or

hang on to it for a period of time, eventually making the same transfer

upon his death. This decision is therefore closely related to the

choice of whether to bequeath assets to one's spouse, or directly to

one's ultimate heirs. In this case, the couple can choose to transfer

wealth to its children immediately upon the death of the first spouse,
                                    —15—




or   to hang on to it for a period of time, eventually making the same

transfer upon the death of the second spouse..-! Again, the issue is

simply one of timing. However, unlike intra vivos transfers, ample

information is available concerning bequests to spouses. Furthermore,

ERTA fundamentally changed the tax treatment of spousal bequests as of

1982 by eliminating all limitations on the marital deduction. In

addition, the reduction of tax rates in 1977 somewhat diminished the

penalty associated with double taxation of wealth passed first to one's

spouse, and eventually to one's ultimate heirs. Finally, the reduction

of maximum tax rates in 1982 somewhat vitiated the importance for very

wealthy decedents of planning to split transfers to children or other

ultimate heirs evenly between spouses' estates. Thus, by examining

trends in spousal bequests over the last ten years or so, one can infer

the importance of estate tax provisions in determining the timing of

transfers to ultimate heirs./

        In order to measure behavioral responses to changes in the tax

code, I will compare IRS   statistics   on bequests to spouses from 1977 and

1983 returns. Most returns filed in any year concern the estates of

individuals who died in the previous year. Thus, the 1977 returns

primarily   contain estates treated under 1976 law (pre—Tax Reform Act of
1976), and the 1983 returns consist primarily of estates taxed under
ERTA.

        Since the filing requirement changed dramatically between 1976 and
1982 (from $60,000 to $225,000), the 1977 and 1983 returns reflect
radically   different samples. In   addition, data is only available on
                                      —16—



1983 returns for which gross estate exceeded $300,000. To restore

comparability, it is essential to restrict attention to 1977 returns on

which reported gross estate is sufficiently large. In particular, the

$300,000 threshold is, adjusting for inflation, roughly equivalent to

$180,000 in 1976. Unfortunately, the IRS is no longer willing to

release data on individual returns, and so it is necessary to employ

aggregated statistics. The IRS does however report sample averages for

these data, grouped by size of gross estate. Thus, it is possible to

restrict attention to 1977 returns on which gross estate exceeded

$150,000, or $200,000. In practice, we consider all estates exceeding a

$200,000 threshold, in part because this is closer to $180,000, and in

part because this selection criterion produces a sample of 59,553

returns. Given their similar sizes, there is every reason to believe

that these two   samples   reflect nearly identical segments of the

population. I should mention, however, that the use of $150,000 (rather

than $200,000) as a selection criterion would not significantly alter my

conclusions.

      Comparison of statistics for these samples reveals the following

pattern (see Table 1). For returns filed in 1977, married individuals

left 47.7$ out of every dollar to their spouses. For returns filed in

1983, this figure climbed to 59.4$    on the dollar——a net increase of

24.5%..J

      While this response is enormous, one might well wonder why it was

not even more pronounced. After all, ERTA allows individuals to

transfer unlimited resources to their spouses absolutely tax free.

There are at least three explanations. First, individuals may   adjust
their wills somewhat slowly in response to changes in estate tax

provisions. Indeed, one should recall that 1982 was the first year in

which decedents were allowed an unlimited marital deduction; this

deduction   may have been used to an even greater extent in subsequent
years. Second, many decedents exhausted the benefit of the marital
deduction   by driving their estate taxes to zero. Indeed, 78.6% of those

claiming the marital deduction paid no tax. Overall, the effective tax

rate on married decedents was a mere 4.7%, as compared to 17.5% for the

rest of the sample. Third, even with an unlimited marital deduction, it

is not always optimal to bequeath all assets to a surviving spouse,

since this strategy could lead to a large estate tax liability upon the

death of the second spouse.

      A comparison of 1977 and 1983 returns also reveals an increase in

the frequency with which individuals claimed the marital deduction

(refer again to Table 1). For the 1977 returns, 102 out of every 1000

married decedents failed to claim this deduction. By 1983, this figure

had fallen to 47 out of every 1000 married decedents, a decline of

roughly offset each other, so that one can still obtain a feel for the

accuracy of Clotfelter's predictions by comparing charitable bequests

across our two samples.

      Specifically, we find that for 1977 returns, decedents left 8.09+

out of every dollar to charity. By 1983, this figure had fallen to

         Overall, this evidence confirms the view that   the   timing of

transfers to one's ultimate heirs is extremely sensitive to estate          tax
provisions.     Accordingly, there is a strong presumption that     intra   vivos

gifts exhibit a similar sensitivity.


         B.   Charitable Bequests
         Previous   investigators have directly estimated the effect of

estate    tax provisions    on charitable bequests (see, e.g., McNees [1973],

Feldstein [1977], Boskin [1976], Barthold and Plotnick [1983], and

Clotfelter [1984]). In general, these estimates suggest that the

behavioral response is extremely large. For example, Clotfelter found

that a 1% rise in the effective price of charitable bequests (see

section 3B) would cause such bequests to decline by roughly 1%, and

perhaps by as much as 1 1/2%. Clotfelter used his estimates to simulate

the effect of ERTA on charitable giving. On the basis of his

calculations, he predicted that ERTA would depress charitable bequests

by between 34% and 52%.

         In this instance, economists have the rare opportunity to

determine the accuracy of a prediction based upon econometric estimates

of   behavioral responses by examining actual responses persuant to a
policy change. Unfortunately, the IRS has not        made any data on estate

tax returns available for any year between 1977 and 1983.         Thus,    of
necessity, the data samples used here span both the       1976 and 1981 tax

reforms.      Accordingly, any changes   in behavior reflect responses to both
acts. On      the other hand, ERTA was phased in over a period of several

years, so that      its   full effect was not felt in 1982. These two     factors
                                        —20—




roughly     offset each other, so that one can   still   obtain a feel for the

accuracy of Clotfelter's predictions by comparing charitable bequests

across our two samples.

        Specifically, we find that for 1977 returns, decedents left 8.09+

out of every dollar to charity. By 1983, this figure had fallen to

5.05+ on the dollar (see Table 1). The magnitude of this decline——

37.6%——is roughly in line with the low end of the range of possible

responses predicted by Clotfelter. Since, once again, individuals may

adjust their wills slowly in response to changes in estate tax

provisions, the observed response should be thought of as a lower

bound. Actual experience therefore provides striking confirmation of ex

ante econometric forecasts.

        Having   established that estate taxation not only creates
incentives for intra vivos giving and charitable bequests, but also that
these   incentives have an enormous impact on behavior, it is now

appropriate to consider the implications for personal income tax

revenues. This is the topic of the next section.


V.      True   Estate Thx   Revenues
        I   have argued in   previous sections that reported estate tax
revenue figures may    be quite misleading. To calculate true revenues,

one   must net out indirect effects. As a      first step, it is essential   to
determine    proper methods for measuring revenues. When an individual

holds an asset, the government effectively owns some claim on that

asset. However, the value of the government's claim depends in a fairly
                                  —21—



complex way both upon the individual's marginal tax rate, as well as

upon his behavior.

     Consider, for example, the effect of transferring a consol worth

$1 from one taxpayer to another. Suppose that the interest rate is 10%,

so that the consol pays 10+ each year. Taxpayer A is now, and always

will be in the 50% marginal tax bracket. Furthermore, suppose that A

would hold the consol indefinitely, consuming all of the after tax

income which it produces. If A in fact owns the consol, then the

government has a claim on a stream of 5+ payments in every subsequent

year. Taxpayer B is now, and always will be in the 25% marginal tax

bracket. Furthermore, B would also hold the consol indefinitely,

consuming exactly its after tax proceeds. If B owns the consol, then

the government has a claim on a stream of 2.5+ payments in every

subsequent year.

      In order to compare these streams with measures of current

revenues, one must calculate present values. The appropriate discount

rate for the government is the after tax rate of return for some average

government bondholder (see Feldstein [1974]). Suppose that this average

bondholder is in the 40% tax bracket. Then if A owns the consol, the

value of the government's claim is 83.3+, while if B holds the consol,

the value of this claim falls to 41.7$. Accordingly, if some policy

induces A to give B the consol, the government loses 41.7$.

      I remarked above that the value of the government's claim depends

not only upon the individual's marginal tax rate, but also upon his

behavior. To illustrate, suppose that both A and B would, if given the
                                  —22—




consol, sell it immediately (before receiving any income) to C, and

consume all the proceeds. Then any policy which induces A to give the

consol to B obviously has no income tax implications, despite

differences in the marginal tax rates of these individuals. This

hypothetical case raises a general point: as a taxpayer's marginal

propensity to consume his resources rises, the value of the government's

claim on his wealth falls. Since investments produce taxable income,

reinvestment is tantamount to transferring a portion of the individual's

after tax claim to the government. If, as one would expect, wealthy

individuals have higher propensities to reinvest, then transfers of

assets from high to low bracket taxpayers will have an even greater

impact on income tax revenues than indicated by the preceding

hypothetical calculation.

      While I have cast this discussion in terms of a consol, the same

reasoning applies equally well to all coupon bonds (by rolling these

over, one can effectively produce a consol). Since capital gains have

always received special treatment under the tax law, analogous

calculations for stocks and real property are a bit more complex. One

must specify the fraction of earnings paid out as current income

(dividends, or rent) and the frequency with which individuals turn over

assets, in addition to marginal tax rates and propensities to consume.

Details of all such computations appear in the appendix.

      Throughout the following analysis, I employ the revenue valuation

formulas derived in the appendix. I assume a nominal interest rate of

8%. In addition, I take the dividend/earning ratio on stocks to be
                                      —23—



0.5. Finally, I assume that investors turn over about 10% of their

assets   each year. This implies that    corporate shares are held on

average for 10 years (see King [1977]). I make no special calculations

for real estate holdings, instead treating them analogously to stock.


      A..   Intra   Vivos Transfers
      I now turn to the problem of estimating the indirect reveneue

effects of induced intra vivos transfers. The first task is to measure

the average ratio of gifts to bequests in a given year. I infer this

ratio by combining several available figures. Kotlikoff and Summers

[1981] estimated that, in 1974, total intra vivos transfers were

approximated 1.56 times the size of intergenerational bequests..i

 Unpublished data collected by Paul Menchik and Martin David from 1967

estate tax records and reported by Kotlikoff and Summers allow us to

determine the fraction of gross estates bequeathed across generations by

sex and marital status of the decedent. Combining the Menchik—David

figures with estate tax data on the distribution of gross estates over

the same categories of decedents, I find that approximately 33.8$ out of

every dollar of gross estates is bequeathed across generations. Thus,

for every dollar of reported bequests, individuals concurrently transfer

approximately 52.7$ (=     1.56X   33.8$) intra—vivos. One can use this

figure to estimate the likely magnitude of gifts in any desired year.

For example, in 1983 the total value of all gross estates exceeding

$300,000 was $50.4 billion. Accordingly, surviving individuals of

similar economic status (age adjusted) probably transferred on the order

of $26.5 billion (=     0.527 X 50.4 billion) intra vivos in
                                   —24—



      Of course, not all of this is attributable to the estate tax.

However, it seems reasonable to conclude on the basis of the evidence

presented in Section 4 that elimination of estate levies would have

reduced this number by a minimum of 25%. I have already argued that

this evidence probably understates the true behavioral response for a

variety of reasons. Indeed, estate planners often emphasize that

lifetime gifts have various adverse non—tax consequences, including loss

of control over resources and premature enrichment of one's children,

and they often recommend that individuals consider such transfers only

if the tax advantages are deemed sufficiently important (see, e.g., Kess

and Westlin [1982]). It therefore seems more likely that the estate tax

motivates closer to 50%, and conceivably as much as 75% of lifetime

gifts. I will present separate calculations for each of these

assumptions (25%, 50%, and 75%).

      The actual revenue loss associated with the transfer of an asset

worth $1 depends upon several factors. The first of these is the nature

of tax system prevailing subsequent to the transfer, and the associated

marginal tax rates of the concerned parties. I will provide separate

calculations for hypothetical policy regimes in which pre—ERTA and ERTA

income tax rate schedules are assumed to persist indefinitely    ,   as well
as similar calculations for the recent Tax Reform Act (TRA) of 1986.

Table 2 contains marginal tax rate assumptions for donors, recipients,

and average bondholders for each tax system. Note that I always place

the donor in the highest tax bracket. The recipient's marginal tax

bracket under the current law corresponds roughly to a married
                               —25—

                                  —26—



individual reporting taxable income (after deductions) of $0,000 per

year. I will return to these assumptions at the end of this section.

      The second important factor concerns the propensity of each

individual to consume out of current income. I consider two cases. In

Case I, the donor consumes one—half of realized nominal income, while

the recipient consumes all of it. For Case II, I change the recipient's

marginal propensity to consume to 0.7. Both cases reflect an assumption

that, over the relevant time period, recipients tend to consume a higher

fraction of current income. I expect this pattern because recipients

usually anticipate substantial gifts and bequests in the future, and are

therefore less inclined to save. I note that while the difference

between the marginal propensity to consume of donors and recipients does

somewhat affect my results, the actual levels of these parameters

appears to make very little difference.

      The third factor concerns the timing of the gift. If the donor

chose not to make an intra vivos transfer of wealth, the recipient would

inherit this wealth upon the donor's death anyway. Consequently, my

calculations should reflect lost revenues only between the time of the

gift and the donor's eventual death. I will refer to this as the

"acceleration factor." In Section 3, I argued that good estate planning

requires individuals to transfer resources as early in life as

possible. While I present calculations using acceleration factors of 5,

15, and 30 years, I therefore tend to prefer those based upon the larger

figures.
                                     —27--




        The fourth and final factor concerns the nature transferred

assets. I present separate calculations for stylized stocks and bonds

(see the appendix for details). The characteristics of actual assets

may, of course, differ from case to case.

        Tables 3   through 5 contain results. Each entry in these tables
indicates the revenue loss (in cents) induced by a private transfer of

assets worth $1, under specified assumptions. Unfortunately, I have no

direct evidence either on actual acceleration factors, or on the

composition of assets transferred intra vivos. To avoid conveying a

false sense of precision, I simply eyeball these tables, and select a

figure which corresponds roughly to an acceleration factor of between 15

and 30 years, and a portfolio consisting of stocks and bonds in equal

proportions. For pre—ERTA income tax law, I surmise that the revenue

loss per dollar transferred was close to 40$; for ERTA, it was roughly

20$; for the Tax Reform Act of 1986, it is somewhere between 10$ and

20$.

        In Table 6, I calculate the value of lost income tax revenues

under alternative sets of assumptions about the revenue loss per dollar

of transferred wealth, and the displacement factor (i.e., the fraction

of intra vivos transfers attributable to     estate   taxation). I take the

total   value of intra vivos transfers for the target population to be
$26.5 billion, which corresponds to    the estimated level of such

transfers in 1983. My preferred estimates of revenue loss per dollar

transferred, combined with a displacement factor of 0.5, generate the

following   conclusions. Under the highly progressive pre—ERTA income tax

rates, income tax losses associated with intra vivos transfers induced

by the estate tax would amount to between $4.5 billion and $5 billion.

Under ERTA rates, this figure would be between $3 billion and $3.5

billion. By making the income tax system less progressive, the Tax

Reform Act of 1986 would reduce this loss to perhaps $2 billion (the

effect of this Act is somewhat vitiated by the removal of the capital

gains exemption). To put these numbers in perspective, one should bear

in mind that the federal government collected $5.17 billion from levies

on estates with gross values exceeding $300,000 in 1983._i

        It is unfortunately   not entirely appropriate to compare revenue
loss calculations based upon the level of intra vivos transfer in 1983
with   estate tax revenues in 1983 for two of the three tax regimes.

Income tax rates during this period were established by ERTA and

taxpapers probably expected these rates to persist indefinitely. I have

already remarked that differentials between marginal personal income tax

rates by themselves provide incentives for individuals to make gifts,

rather than bequests. Had taxpayers expected pre—ERTA income tax rates

to prevail after 1983, the division of transfers would probably have

been more skewed towards gifts. Accordingly, official estate tax

revenues would have been lower, and the true revenue picture would have

been even worse. Conversely, had taxpapers espected the Tax Reform Act

of 1986 rates to prevail after 1983, the division of transfers might

have been more skewed towards bequests. While this would make the total
                                    —33—




revenue picture a bit better than my calculations suggest, I suspect

that the resulting bias is very small.2!

      At this point, it is appropriate to reflect on the accuracy of the

marginal tax rate assumptions employed throughout this exercise. For a

number of reasons, these may be erroneous. First, the children of

wealthy individuals may in many cases be wealthy themselves, especially

after accumulating significant gifts. Second, even comparatively

wealthy individuals may have relatively low taxable incomes upon

retirement. Third, it is well—known that many taxpayers shelter

enormous amounts of income. Some may even drive their marginal tax

rates to zero through vigorous use of provisions such as the investment

tax credit. On the other hand, many of the estate tax avoidance

techniques discussed in Section 3 also allow such individuals to pass

surplus tax shelters to their children, thereby reducing income tax

revenues through a related channel. One should also recall that several

techniques (i.e., the use of life insurance and pension funds) provide

for free accumulation subsequent to the transfer. In addition, children

may often   use transferred funds to purchase homes, in which case
subsequent implicit income escapes taxation entirely. Finally, my
calculations completely ignore the revenue losses associated with
avoidance activities that reduce gross estates below the filing

requirement. It is, however, impossible to account properly for any of

these factors without access to currently unavailable IRS records.
                                  —34—




      B.   Charitable Bequests

      I now turn my attention to charitable bequests. In 1983,

decedents with gross estates exceeding $300,000 left approximately $2.5

billion to charities. To calculate the indirect impact on income tax

revenues, one must first determine the fraction of this attributable to

estate taxation.

      I employ Clotfelter's behavioral estimates to compute the impact

on charitable bequests of eliminating estate taxation. Using parameters

from his most conservative case,i./ I find that charitable bequests would

decline by 79.3%, or, for 1983, about $2 billion. Such bequests would

have all but disappeared for estates under $1 million, and would have

fallen by more than 76% for estates exceeding $1 million.

      What is the revenue loss per dollar bequeathed to charity? Here,

the relevant comparison is between having the family retain the wealth

indefinitely, passing the unconsumed portion from generation to

generation, and having it bequeath the same wealth to a tax exempt

institution. I assume that the family is always taxed at the highest

statutory marginal rate, and calculate revenue losses per dollar of

transferred assets. Table 7 contains results for stylized stocks and

bonds under the three tax systems considered earlier. Again I eyeball

this table, and select figures which roughly reflect a portfolio divided

equally between stocks and bonds. Under pre—ERTA income tax law, the

revenue loss exceeded $1.50 on each dollar of induced charitable

bequests, or (for 1983 levels of charitable bequests) about $3 billion

in the aggregate. For rates prevailing subsequent to ERTA, the loss

appears to have about $1.25 on each dollar, or $2.5 billion in the

aggregate. Under the tax reform bill, the loss is between 80$ and $1 on

the dollar, or between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in the aggregate.

      I have presented estimates of revenue losses from intra vivos

giving and charitable bequests for three hypothetical policy regimes in

which, respectively, pre—ERTA, ERTA, and TRA income tax rates are

assumed to prevail, and to persist indefinitely after 1983. Combining

these estimates produces striking results. Under my preferred

assumptions, estate taxation would have induced a net loss of Federal

tax revenues roughly equal to $3 billion in 1983 for the highly

progressive pre—ERTA income tax regimes. The estate tax probably would

have broken even in 1983 or even generated a small loss under the ERTA

income tax regime (the total net reduction of income tax revenues, $5.5

billion to $6 billion, slightly exceeds offical estate tax revenues for

the target group). For rates adopted in the Tax Reform Act of 1986,

indirect losses would have been in the neighborhood of $3.5 to $4

billion, or roughly 70% to 80% of reported revenues. Even under the

more conservative view that estate taxation is responsible for only 25%

(rather than 50%) of intra vivos transfers, true revenues would still

have been negative under pre—ERTA income tax rates, perhaps 10% of

reported revenues under ERTA, and less than half of reported revenues

under the TRA rates.

      I   caution against attaching too much importance to any particular
set of numbers. While it   seems clear that indirect   revenue effects may
                                    —37—




be large relative to reported revenues, available data simply do not

permit precise calculations.


VI.   Additional Considerationa
      A.   Ancillary Effects   of Sophisticated Estate Planning Techniques
      The income tax implications of many estate planning techniques are

complex. In addition to shifting income between taxpayers, some

techniques create taxable income, while others generate new shelters. A

complete analysis of all indirect effects would represent a major

undertaking. For the time being, I simply note that estate planners

tend to recommend against techniques in cases where they would create

significant income tax liabilities. I have, for instance, already

remarked that the preferred stock recapitalization is typically applied

only when the parent desires a high level of current income for his own

personal purposes.


      B. Step—up of   Isis at Death
      Another factor which deserves careful consideration is the step—up

of basis at death for income tax purposes. If the estate tax causes

individuals to transfer assets through gifts that they would otherwise

have held until death, then, upon the eventual sale of such assets,

total capital gains tax liabilities will be greater. While this

consideration somewhat vitiates our conclusions, I suspect that it is of

comparatively minor importance, for four reasons.

      First, individuals concerned with tax avoidance clearly have an

incentive to transfer intra vivos all assets which they do not intend to
                                   —38—




hold   until death prior to transferring any assets which they never

intend to sell. Thus, the relevant question is whether or not donors

tend to turn over marginal assets at regular intervals. The evidence

presented in Section 5 suggests that affluent individuals transfer

roughly one—third of their total holdings intra vivos, and two—thirds at

death. Thus, as long as these individuals tend to turn over at least

one—third of their assets, I would not expect them to retain the

marginal asset until death.

       Second, if a parent is inclined to hold onto an asset for his

entire life, his heirs may well feel similarly inclined. This is

particularly true when the asset in question is a family business or

closely held corporation. Thus, the date of eventual sale may be quite

distant even at the time of the parents death, in which case the

discounted value of the incremental tax would be quite small.

       Third, when individuals hold assets until death, they often go to

great lengths to undervalue these assets, thereby minimizing estate tax

liability. In fact, Cooper [1979] points out that, through manipulating

a series of special factors which cause tax courts to reduce the

assessed market value of assets (particularly in closely—held

corporations), decedents have succeeded in sheltering as much as two—

thirds of actual asset value for estate tax purposes. Of course, in the

process, these decedents also lose the step—up of basis.

       Fourth and finally, families that engage in deliberate estate tax

avoidance may also be fairly sophisticated about income tax avoidance.

In particular, by appropriately timing the realization of gains and
                                           —39—




losses, taxpayers may be able to minimize, or even entirely eliminate
capital gains       tax   liabilities   (see Stiglitz [1983]). While it appears

that very few       investors employ such techniques    in the course of daily

portfolio management (see Poterba [1985]), they may well find it

worthwhile to do so when realizing large gains on assets which have been

held for very long periods of time.

         Consideration of the step—up of basis at death raises a related

issue. While this provision probably does not significantly vitiate my

conclusions,       it may well deter taxpayers from transferring intra vivos
substantially more assets than they do already. Indeed, estate planners

agree that by removing the opportunity to pass on property at death free

of capital gains tax, Congress would "increase greatly interest in

estate tax avoidance" (Cooper [1979, p. ii]).           Accordingly,   such action

would be likely, on balance, to depress federal revenues, contrary to

common wisdom.


         C.     The Thx Reform Act of 1986

         Throughout    this discussion, I have emphasized that the Tax Reform

Act of 1986 reduces the progressivity of federal income tax            rates,   and

thereby attenuates the revenue loss per dollar          diverted from bequests to
gifts.        The Act may also have other important effects, to which I have

alluded only briefly. Specifically, this decline in progressivity by

itself reduces incentives for intra vivos transfers. Under the new Act,

we might therefore expect both bequests and estate tax revenues to be

higher, while the marginal effect on lifetime giving of eliminating the

estate tax might well decline.
                                   —40—



        However, the Act also introduces countervailing forces. First, it

eliminates several opportunities for wealthy individuals to accumulate

resources tax free (e.g. through IRA's). Second, it removes numerous

tax shelters (e.g. the investment tax credit, the capital gains and

dividend exclusions, investment interest deductions, and passive

business loss offsets) through which many wealthy individuals currently

achieve significant reductions in their marginal tax rates. The net

effect of these changes remains to be seen.

        In addition, I have been somewhat conservative by assuming that

wealthy parents will face marginal income tax rates of 28%. In fact,

the Act includes a surcharge on taxable income between $71,900 and

$149,250 for couples ($43,150 and $87,560 for single individuals) which

may well produce an effective marginal tax rate of 33% for many wealthy

taxpayers.

        Other provisions also bear on these issues to a lesser degree.

Unearned income for children under 14 years of age is now counted as

taxable income for the parent——this somewhat attenuates the ability of

parents to arrange significant transfers of resources very early in

life. The Act also curtails income splitting through trusts, eliminates

the advantages of Clifford and Spousal Remainder Trusts, and strengthens

the Generation Skipping Tax. Yet it is difficult to imagine that these

provisions would have a large effect on the overall picture described

here.
                                       —41—



VII. Conclusions

      In this paper, I   have suggested that the   indirect effects of

estate levies on personal income tax revenues are     extremely   large

relative to estate tax collections. Indeed, although it is very

difficult to estimate these effects with any precision, in recent years

true estate   tax revenues   may well have been negative. I have emphasized

that these conclusions are highly dependent on the progressivity of the

personal income tax, but have also shown that indirect revenue effects

would continue to be extremely important even under the new tax reform

bill. Accordingly, common planning techniques severely cripple the

ability of the federal government to achieve the dual purposes of

promoting equity and raising revenue through estate taxation.

      Nevertheless, the existence of this tax does appear to effect a

diversion of substantial resources (upwards of $2 billion per year) to

charity, and many may view this as sufficient justification for its

retention. Furthermore, avenues for curtailing estate and gift tax

avoidance have not yet been fully exhausted. By persuing such avenues,

the federal government might    well   succeed in reducing large concentra-

tions of wealth, while significantly enhancing total federal revenue.

Yet in the absence of far—reaching reform, it seems unlikely that the

estate tax will do much more than benefit charitable causes.

                                  Footnotes


-1-'   For this reason, changes in the taxation of personal income in

       affect estate tax revenues, just as estate taxation affects income

       tax revenues. We return to this point in section 6.

       In general, only part of this gain will be due to inflation.

       Thus, the argument remains valid even if the credit is indexed.

       One obvious difference is that an individual might not be sure

       that his spouse would make the same bequests later on that he

       would have made himself. However, it is possible to overcome this

       difficulty through the use of a trust.

Al     Unfortunately, this period also witnessed the adoption of

       significant income tax reforms (under ERTA). Thus, changes in

       gift and bequest behavior may reflect a combination of effects

       (see footnote 1). One would not, however, expect income tax

       provisions to significantly affect the fraction of bequests left

       to spouses since, subsequent to the testator's death, all primary

       heirs (spouses and children) will ordinarily pay similar high—

       bracket marginal personal income tax rates. In addition, the

       limitation of the marital deduction was undoubtably the single

       most important tax—related determinant of spousal bequests, and

       its elimination probably swamped all other effects. For these

       reasons, data on spousal bequests may actually be preferrable to

       data on intra   vivos transfers.
                                     —43—




      After subtracting liabilities such as funeral and administrative
      expenses, debts and mortgages, one finds that bequests to other
      heirs   increased by roughly the same proportion.

      Specifically, the estimated that      transfers   across generations

      totalled about $70 billion, and they attricuted approximately

      60.9% of this to intra vivos transfers. Intra vivos transfers

      include life insurance policies in which the incidents of

      ownership have been transferred to the beneficiary, and which are

      therefore excluded from gross estate.

1.!   One could question this calculation on several grounds. First,

      wealthy individuals have more incentive to engage in estate

      planning, and therefore probably make a larger fraction of their

      transfers intra vivos than do average individuals. For this

      reason, the calculation probably understates the true magnitude of

      such transfers. Second, a number of significant tax reforms took

      place between 1974 (the year for which Kotlikoff and Summers made

      their calculations) and 1983. These included i) the unification

      of gift and estate taxes, ii) the reduction in estate tax rates,

      iii) the reduced progressivity of income tax rates, and iv) the

      liberalization    of the unified credit and yearly gift tax
      exclusion.     The first three factors would tend to reduce intra

      vivos giving, while the    fourth   has   the opposite effect. In view
      of   the enormous importance of the unified credit and yearly

      exclusion to most individuals, I suspect that the        $26.5   billion

      figure   is,   if anything, on the low side.
                                    —44—



2/      Total estate tax revenues were slightly higher than this, since,

        prior to 1984, the filing requirement was below $300,000.

        Unfortunately, the IRS has only released data on estates with

        gross values exceeding $300,000 for 1983. Accordingly, my

        calculations are intended to approximate the true net revenue

        associated with taxing this group.

2/      According to my calculations, transferring an asset worth $1 intra

        vivos lowers the present value of income tax payments by

        approximately 20+ under ERTA rates, and 15+ under TRA rates. The

        effect of this reform on intra vivos transfers should therefore be

        more or less equal to the effect of cutting the estate tax rate by

        only 5%. Other aspects of the TRA may reduce this effect even

        further——see the discussion in section 6C.

1_P_I   For estates of less than $1 million, I assume price and income

        elasticities of —1.6, and 0.4, respectively, and a marginal estate

        tax rate of 39%. For estates exceeding $1 million, these figures

        are —1.0, 0.4, and 45%, respectively.

                                               Appendix

        In this appendix, we derive formulas which express the value of

the government's claim on a privately held asset as a function of the

holder's characteristics, the tax system, and the nature of the asset.

       First, consider a bond (consol) which pays $i per year forever.

Suppose that   the        interest rate is i, so that              the   value of the bond is

$1. Each year, the bondholder, whose marginal tax                         rate   is m, consumes

fraction y of            nominal after tax income          generated      by the bond, and
reinvests the remainder in new bonds. Bonds pay                      interest at     the

beginning   of each year starting in year 1, so that at the end of year                         t

the   investor owns bonds worth

                                       (i + i(1_m)(1_y))t

and pays taxes of

                                       im(1 + i(l_m)(l_y))t_1

in period t+1. Supposing that xii is the marginal tax rate                           of the

average   bondholder, the present discounted                 value of this revenue stream

through   year T is

                   ç imtl + i(1—m)(1—y)j\t1

                                                    ji   — (1 +   i(1_m)(1_Y))T]
                                                              1 + (1—)i
                                             —48—




To calculate the revenue loss associated with transferring the bond from

one taxpayer to another for a period of T years, we simply calculate the

change in the value of this expression associated with changing the

values of m and y.

          Next, consider a stock which, in year 0, represents a claim on

capital    assets worth $1. These assets yield after corporate income           tax

earnings        of $p at the beginning of each year, starting in year 1. The

company always pays out the fraction a of earnings as current

dividends, and retains the remainder, investing it in new capital

assets. Thus, at the end of year t, one share of stock represents a

claim on capital assets worth


                                        +   p(1_a)]

          Let    At denote the number of shares of vintage t        stock   (shares

bought in period t) which the investor still holds at the end of period

t > -v.    We take Ag = 1.      Each year, the investor sells a fraction X

of his stock, irrespective of vintage, thus,


(1)                              At =
                                        A(1_X)t_
He consumes the fraction y of realized after tax nominal income, and

reinvests the proceeds in stock. Once again, we use m to denote the

investor's marginal tax rate, and in            to denote the marginal tax rate of

the average bondholder. In addition, we assume that the fraction e of

realized capital gains is exempt from taxation. Accordingly, in

period t, the investor pays taxes of

shares of new stock. While we were unable to obtain a nice closed—form

expression for total revenues, (1), (2), and (3) form a system of

difference equations which can be solved numerically. We then value the

revenue stream by discounting, as above.

      As a final step, we relate p to i through capital market

equilibrium conditions. Under traditional views of capital market

equilibrium (see Poterba and Summers [1985]),
