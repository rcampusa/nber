     INDUSTRIAL DE-DIVERSIFICATION AND ITS CONSEQUENCES FOR PRODUCTIVITY

                                  ABSTRACT
     Due in large part to intense takeover activity during the

1980s, the extent of American firms' industrial diversification

declined significantly during the second half of the decade.               The

mean number of industries in which firms operated declined 14

percent, and the fraction of single-industry firms increased 54

percent.   Firms that were "born" during the period were much less

diversified than those that "died", and "continuing" firms

reduced the number of industries in which they operated.             using

plant-level Census Bureau data, we show that productivity is

inversely related to the degree of diversification: holding

constant the nUmber of the parent firm's plants, the greater the

number of industries in which the parent operates, the lower the

productivity of its plants.      Hence de-diversification is one of

the means by which recent takeovers have contributed to u.S.

productivity growth.     We also find that the effectiveness of

regulations governing disclosure by companies of financial

information for their industry segments was low when they were

introduced in the 1970s and has been declining ever since.
