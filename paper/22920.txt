                                           ABSTRACT

We measure the impact of measurement error in labor-supply elasticities estimated over recalled
usual work hours, as is ubiquitous in the literature. Employing hours of work in diaries collected
by the American Time Use Survey, 2003-12, along with the same respondents’ recalled usual
hours, we show that the latter yield elasticities that are positively biased. We argue that this bias
arises from the salience on recalled hours of differences in wage rates.

    I.       Hours on the Job and Hours Working

         The elasticity of labor supply is one of the most studied parameters describing individual

behavior in the sub-field of labor economics and, because of its importance for explaining

macroeconomic fluctuations, perhaps in the entire discipline of economics. Large numbers of

estimates have been summarized over the past three decades (Pencavel, 1986; Killingsworth and

Heckman, 1986;, Blundell and MaCurdy, 1999; and Keane, 2011). In all studies based on

representative samples of employees the measure of the intensive margin of labor supply has

been the survey respondent’s recalled hours worked in the previous week (typically in monthly

labor-force surveys), month or year (typically in longitudinal annual household surveys). The use

of such longer-recall data to measure labor-supply elasticities remains ubiquitous (e.g., Bargain

et al, 2014; Blundell et al, 2016; Cherchye et al, 2012; Goux et al, 2014).1

         In this note we examine estimates of labor supply elasticities using a data set that, in

addition to requiring only very short recall, imposes adding-up restrictions upon respondents’

perceptions of their time allocated to different activities. Estimation of labor supply elasticities

based on this alternative, and arguably more accurate, survey methodology is novel and of

independent interest. Our main purpose, however, is to use the alternative hours of work measure

to assess the reliability of elasticity estimates based on the traditional hours measures. While

distinctions between an individual’s work hours on a particular job reported by the employer

have been noted to differ from what the worker recalls (Duncan and Hill, 1985; Bound et al,




1
 The main exception to this pattern has been a spate of studies on the responses of independent contractors’ effort to
variations in the price of the product they sell (e.g., most recently Stafford, 2015)

1994), the differences between these measures were not and, indeed, could not be used to

analyze the impact of measurement errors on estimated labor-supply responses.2

    II.      Time-Use Data in the Estimation of Labor Supply

          The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) provides a roughly one-eighth sub-sample of

recent respondents to the monthly household Current Population Survey (CPS) in the United

States. On some morning two to five months after their final appearance in the CPS, ATUS

respondents write up a diary detailing their activities at each minute of the previous day, which

upon diurnal aggregation yields total hours worked (defined in various ways), HA. In addition,

they answer the standard CPS question requiring them to recollect their usual weekly work

hours, HCPS (Hamermesh et al, 2005).

          We use diarists in the ATUS from 2003-12. Given the relatively few hours worked on

weekend days, we use only weekdays. Perhaps most important, because of the division bias

induced in calculating the hourly earnings of salaried workers (see Borjas, 1980), we limit the

sample to hourly-paid workers, who unlike other workers directly report an hourly wage rate.

These restrictions generate samples of 3,925 married and 4,262 unmarried women. Although the

literature on women’s labor supply elasticities is larger, that on men’s is also huge. We thus

create samples of male ATUS respondents using the same restrictions, yielding 3,840 married

and 3,086 unmarried men.

          The first three columns of Table 1 present descriptive statistics on HCPS and HA.

Throughout we use two measures of HA, one reporting total work time on the diary day, HA1, the

other calculated as total work time minus commuting time, HA2, in both cases converting

reported minutes to daily hours. The correlations between these latter two measures are nearly

 French (2004) considered the effect of nonclassical measurement error in recalled annual hours and wages for the
estimation of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution based on the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.

                                                       2
one. Thus while we present labor-supply elasticities estimated using both measures, we expect

very small differences between the results.

        Assuming a five-day workweek (and regrettably there is no information on days worked

in these data), the mean reported hours of work less commuting time (third column of Table 1)

differ only very slightly from recalled usual weekly hours.3 This result on means repeats similar

findings by Juster and Stafford (1991, Table 5) for the U.S. and Gershuny and Robinson (2013)

for Europe. The correlations between the diary measures and usual weekly hours, however, are

not high. The final column of Table 1 describes hourly wages among these samples of hourly-

paid workers. Not surprisingly, given selectivity into hourly-paid employment, the means are

well below economy-wide average hourly earnings.

        Since our main purpose here is to compare estimates of labor supply elasticities using

HCPS and HA, we use simple stylized labor-supply models that only adjust for obviously

exogenous covariates. Thus we estimate:

    (1) hi = αiw + βX + e, i = CPS, A1 or A2,

where the lower-case symbols indicate logarithms, the vector X contains a quadratic in age, and

fixed effects for state of residence, day of week, and year of the survey, the αi and β are

parameters to be estimated, and e is an error term. The estimated αi are shown for married and

unmarried women and men separately in Table 2. The estimated responses are fairly low, but not

far from the weighted middle of the vast range of estimates produced in the literature.
                                                                       CPS       A
        The crucial thing to note from these estimates is that               >       for both time-diary

measures of work time, for both married and unmarried people, and for both women and men.

The absolute differences are not huge, but they approach or exceed conventional levels of

 Very occasionally Supplements to the May CPS have collected information on days worked. In the May 1991
Supplement the mean days worked was 4.75 (5.07) among female (male) workers (Hamermesh, 1998).


                                                   3
statistical significance.4 The central question thrown up by these results is why this difference

arises? If, as we believe, the diary records of yesterday’s work time are less error-prone than the

one-week recalls of usual hours of work, the existence of classical measurement errors in the

latter would suggest that the estimated αCPS would be less than the estimated αA, and the R2

would be lower, in both cases the opposite of what we find.

    III.      Nonclassical Measurement Error

           HCPS is collected by interview shortly before former CPS respondents complete their one-

day time diaries. The hourly wage rates of hourly-paid diarists are transcribed from their

responses in their eighth month in the CPS if they were working and paid hourly then. In our

sub-samples about 85 (87) percent of the female (male) diarists were employed and paid hourly

in their eighth CPS month. 14 (13) percent of female (male) diarists were in the ATUS two

months after their final CPS interview; 71 (69) percent three months later; 14 (17) percent four

months later, and 1 (1) percent five months later. Thus the measure of hourly wages precedes

responses about HCPS and HA on average by three months.5

           The clear implication from the estimation of the labor supply elasticities using ATUS

data is that the CPS question eliciting information on usual weekly work hours introduces

nonclassical measurement error. There are three sources of measurement error in HCPS relative to

HA. They may be categorized as relating to recall error, the specificity of the observation period

and the constraint implied by the application of a 24-hour time budget. Recall error is likely

greater in HCPS than in HA, as the report is based on the recall of usual hours over a prior week, in



4
 We test this by calculating the statistics generated after using STATA’s sureg procedure to estimate (1) for hCPS and
hA1 (hA2) jointly.
5
 Re-estimating the models in Section II restricting the sample to those who reported hourly pay in CPS month 8
produced only very small changes in the results. Similarly small changes were produced when we deleted the
roughly 10 percent of each sample who report holding more than one job.

                                                          4
contrast to recorded hours worked on the previous day. A further source of measurement error

arises from the specificity of the ATUS diary (the actual hours at work in a specific 24-hour time

period) relative to the more general usual week reference period for HCPS. Finally, HA from the

time diary includes an explicit aggregate 24-hour time constraint on all activities over the

previous day, which imposes additional discipline on the diary measure that is absent from HCPS.

        Of these sources of measurement error, the lesser specificity and clarity of HCPS is likely

to introduce only random noise, which should make the R2 using this measure lower and should

attenuate the estimates of α, compared to those based on hA. In contrast, recall error and the

absence of a requirement that the respondent must list all of his/her activities so that they add to

24 hours are likely to introduce nonclassical measurement error in HCPS. Reported work hours,

HCPS, may be related to salience, as suggested by Akerlof and Yellen (1985) in their analysis of

measurement error in CPS responses about labor-force status in the previous year compared to

contemporaneous measures, and as discussed more generally in the survey by Bound et al (2001,

Section 5).

        These different sources of measurement error have also been considered in the literature

examining the reliability of information from family expenditure surveys, such as the U.S.

Consumer Expenditure Surveys. Like the ATUS used here, the two main approaches to

measurement are based on either longer-term recall or short-recall diary methods. Analogous to

our discussion, this literature considers how reliability generated by short-term diaries, precisely

specified reporting periods and expenditure items, and an aggregate budget constraint (based on

reported cash flow or total spending) relative to longer-term recall yield higher quality data (see

the essays in Carroll et al., 2015).




                                                 5
          To develop intuition on the nature of the measurement error, we make the strong

assumption that the time-use diary reliably measures work hours.6 The measurement error in

hCPS, denoted by eCPS = hCPS – hA, leads to:
                CPS
    (2) Bias(       )=

where                  and                 . The effect of nonclassical measurement error in hCPS is

analogous to an omitted variable, leading to bias in the estimation of α. To simplify further,

assume a bivariate relationship between hCPS and w (equivalently, no linear relationship between
                                 CPS
w and X), then the bias in             can be expressed as:

                CPS
    (3) Bias(         )=


Using this simple formula, the relative biases                            in estimating these labor supply

elasticities in the samples of married workers are 0.316 (0.115) and 0.339 (0.920) for A1 and A2

respectively for married women (men), while in the samples of unmarried workers they are 0.247

(0.497) and 0.360 (0.768) respectively for women (men).

    IV.      Conclusion

          In this note we have provided alternative estimates of elasticities describing labor supply

using recalled usual weekly hours, and time worked from a one-day diary kept by the same

respondents. Estimates using the latter measure are lower, which we argue results from

measurement errors induced by the greater salience of recalled work time among higher-earning

workers.

          Measures of usual hours, recalled either for the previous week, or even for the past year

(as in the major household longitudinal surveys), underlie nearly all studies of labor supply. Our

6
 We do not claim that this is strictly the case. Rather, we are demonstrating how the errors induced in H CPS by the
issues we have raised with the way this measure is obtained yield biased estimates compared to a measure that
removes these errors.

                                                         6
results suggest that the nature of surveys producing data on usual work hours creates

measurement errors that are positively correlated with the respondent’s wage rate. Using these

measures to estimate elasticities of labor supply then generates upward biases. The differences

we have shown between these biased estimates and others that avoid this difficulty are not huge,

but they do suggest some care in interpreting standard estimates of labor-supply elasticities.
