                            ABSTRACT

     This paper discusses the acceleration of inflation in
Brazil. In the early 1980s, the Brazilian inflation rate
increased in good measure because of the balance of payments
crisis and because of large depreciations of the cruzeiro. The
Cruzado Plan failed to stop inflation because of an extremely
loose monetary policy coupled with a lack of fiscal austerity.
Repeated price controls have increased the variability of
inflation. More recently, the decline in tax collections and the
growth of interest payments on a ballooning domestic debt have
built up a massive fiscal problem. Flight from money has further
aggravated Brazilian inflation.
     Two steps are used in explaining the Brazilian inflationary
process: the analysis of price freezes in the context of
sustained fiscal imbalance and the research on the consequences
of different fiscal deficit financing forms. The paths of
inflation and real cash balances in response to different shocks
are simulated. The focus is on the effects of controls that
impose a temporary reduction of the inflation rate under
different choices for monetary and fiscal policies. A model of
an open economy where agents can hold money, domestic bonds and
inventories of goods clarifies the linkage between Brazil's
growing inability to finance the public sector deficit externally
after 1982 and the acceleration of inflation.

                              I. INTRODUCTION

Brazil's inflation rate reached 40 percent per month during the last quarter

of 1989. Once again policy makers discussed the possibility of imposing

price controls despite the failure of the three previous attempts in 1986,

in 1987 and in 1989 at beating inflation by freezes. Figure 1 shows

inflation rates before and after the Cruzado Plan, the Bresser Plan and the

Summer Plan.

           This paper discusses the acceleration of inflation in Brazil in

the l98Os. Section II presents an overview (supported by the statistical

appendix) of the Brazilian recent macroeconomic performance. In the early

198Os, the Brazilian inflation rate increased in good measure because of the

balance of payments crisis and because of large depreciations of the

cruzeiro. The Cruzado Plan failed to stop inflation because of an extremely

loose monetary policy coupled with a lack of fiscal austerity. Repeated

price controls have increased the variability of inflation. More recently,

the decline in tax collections and the growth of interest payments on a

ballooning domestic debt have been building up a massive fiscal problem.

Flight from money has further aggravated Brazilian inflation.

          Two steps are particularly useful in explaining the Brazilian

inflationary process: the analysis of price freezes in the context of

sustained fiscal imbalance and the research on the consequences of different

fiscal deficit financing forms. These two steps are taken in sections III

and IV.

           Section III builds a simple model introducing financial markets

and interest rates in the traditional Cagan style model of inflationary

finance with rational expectations. It assumes inflation inertia. This means

that inflation in the cur'ent period reproduces inflation in the previous

period. Inertia occurs through the existence of formal or informal

indexation interacting with a staggered setting of wages, prices and

financial contracts. Inflation fluctuation relative to previous periods

depends on the behavior of interest rates. After characterizing steady

states, we use the model to simulate the paths of inflation and real cash

balances in response to different shocks. The focus is on the effects of

controls that impose a temporary reduction of the inflation rate under

different choices for monetary and fiscal policies.

           Section IV examines the central relationship between budget

deficits, external finance and inflation. It extends the model of section

III to an open, economy where agents can hold money, domestic bonds and

inventories of goods. Our contribution clarifies the linkage between

Brazil's growing inability to finance the public sector deficit externally

after 1982 and the acceleration of inflation. The suddenly limited access to
                                     3




external finance and the inadequacy of the government savings effort

profoundly affected the domestic macro-economic structure. Applying the

model developed in section IV to the analysis of inflation in Brazil after

1982, we discuss fiscal imbalances and balance of payments crises as causes

of inflation acceleration. We summarize our conclusions in section V.



                              II. OVERVIEW

Brazil has traditionally lived with high inflation rates. Between 1960 and

1964, increasingly populist administrations carried inflation from 2 to 6

percent per month. By 1968, inflation was down again to 1.5 percent, a level

that persisted until the first oil shock. Then it doubled to 3 percent per

month and doubled again to 6 percent in 1980-82. By 1983-85, inflation

increased to 10.5 percent per month. With the Cruzado Plan it fell to an

average of 5 percent per month. From then on it increased every year,

reaching more than 50 percent per month in December 1989.1



Debt stratezy and inflation

The foreign debt strategy of the 1970s and the balance of payments crisis of

the early 1980s play an important role in the history of Brazilian

inflation. After 1968, the government consciously embarked on a program of

tapping private capital markets to underwrite rapid expansion. Brazil relied

extensively on this external capital marker, implementing a debt-led model

of development to help finance the mounting capital and intermediate goods

imports associated with the average growth rates of near 10 percent between

1968 and 1973. In 1968, another component of the strategy was explicit
                                      4




adaptation to inflation through indexation of exchange rates. This was in

addition to the indexation of wages, rents and financial assets since 1964.

          When the oil shock struck in late 1973, Brazil was the largest oil

importer among developing countries. Already faced with the prospect of

weakening growth from internal cyclical causes, the government chose not to

risk a significant decline in real income from the adverse terms of trade

shock. It increased external borrowing, thus postponing the contractionary

effects of the petroleum "tax" and permitting domestic expansion to proceed.

Brazil opted for adjustment through an ambitious program of generalized

import substitution rather than export promotion or domestic recession.

           An elastic supply of debt responded to Brazilian requirements.

External borrowing and brief episodes of slower domestic activity kept the

balance of payments under control until late 1970s. Higher coffee and other

commodity prices also contributed by reversing the decline in the terms of

trade. Brazilian economic performance after the first oil price shock

remained above its trend level of growth of 7 percent per year: petro-dollar

recycling transfered considerable resources to Brazil that translated them

 into high rates of investment and economic growth.

            On the eve of the second oil shock, Brazil had the largest

 external debt in the world. Whereas the first stage of debt accumulation saw

 a large transfer of real resources, in later stages more and more borrowing

 went simply to cover interest obligations on earlier loans. The dynamics of

 debt-led debt had become part of the Brazilian story, a process magnified by

 rising interest rates.

The debt crisis

In 1980, facing rising oil prices and interest rates, Brazil found

additional finance available. But terms became more expensive as spreads

widened. The country was forced to a more austere set of policies and

domestic adjustment in 1981. For the first time in the post-war period

income declined. Discipline was rewarded with new capital flows.

           During the generalized debt crisis in 1982, the government

insisted that the Brazilian situation was distinct and capable of simple

remedy. With a Congressional election in November, politics precluded any

appeal to the It1F until after the votes had been counted. Only then did

Brazil join the rapidly lengthening queue of problem cases. But it did so

with the disadvantage of having its own inadequate stabilization program on

the table beforehand.

           Brazil managed best on its external accounts. A greater export

recovery in 1984 made it different from other large Latin American debtors.2

The current account was quickly restored to balance and the foreign exchange

constraint became less pressing. While the recession was worse than the

1930s Great Depression, the intervening decline in per capita income was

smaller than for other problem debtors. Output in 1984 was already on the

way up, led by export growth.



External adjustment

To judge from trade performance, adjustment to the debt crisis was nothing

short of phenomenal. The combination of export growth and import

substitution have produced large export surpluses in recent years. The trade
                                        6




deficits of the 1970s turned into large surpluses after 1983. Merchandise

exports increased from 13 billion dollars per year in 1977-79 to 34 billion

dollars in 1988. At the same time, Brazil restrained imports by continuing

to expand alternative domestic supply sources. Imports in 1983-88 were lower

than in 1977-82, despite the increase in output. In 1988, real CDP was 29

percent higher than in 1979, but the volume of imports was 23 percent lower.

(Table 2.A).

           In part, trade flows responded to the real depreciation of the

1980s: in the 1983-88 period, the real effective exchange rate was 20

percent lower relative to its level in 1977-82. But since the late 1960s

Brazil has also been exceptional among the Latin American countries in its

successful combination of import substitution and growth as well as

diversification of exports. Four factors have played a role: the size and

efficiency of the industrial sector, a crawling peg exchange rate policy

which has avoided long periods of overvaluation, an active promotion of

manufactured exports through incentives and subsidies, and import

restriction that has relied not merely on controls but also on the active

policy of investment directed toward import substitution in the late l970s.

               The recent large trade surpluses tend to create an illusory

 optimism about the ease with which large external transfers of resources can

 be realized. A broader perspective, incorporating the debt as an integral

 part of the Brazilian development problem, is necessary. Soaring debt

 service is an important component of fiscal deterioration in Brazil and it

 has been financed by growing trade surpluses. Section IV explores the

 important link between trade surpluses and inflation. In Brazil, trade
                                       7




surpluses   were used to pay interest on government debt while the government

financed the purchase of foreign exchange from the private sector by issuing

debt and printing money. As a consequence, inflation increased.

            The Brazilian experience also led to the understanding that

improvement of the balance of payments and domestic equilibrium were not

tightly linked. Indeed, as discussed in section IV,   trade   surpluses might

create new problems for macroeconomic policy.



Internal Adjustment

Progress on the external account was not matched internally. The large

positive government savings of the first half of the l970s had shrunk and

turned negative in the second half of the l980s.(Table 3.A). Government

savings are not a measure of the budget surplus because they leave public

enterprises out of the picture. They do, however, show that public finance

in Brazil has been deteriorating. Two factors explain the sharp decline in

government savings. One is the growing interest payments on domestic debt.

The other is the reduction in revenues from indirect taxes. The latter

results from less than perfect fiscal indexation, from evasion and from a

growing underground economy. The Instituto Brasileiro de Ceografia e

Estatistica (IBGE) calculates that the size of the underground economy is at

least as large as 15 percent of GDP. The decline in revenue from indirect

taxes was in part counterbalanced by an increase in direct taxation in 1986.

Yet the overall trend remains one of declining tax revenues.

             In 1983, successive letters of intent under IMF programs had no

sooner been dispatched than they were made obsolete by accelerating
                                      8




inflation that crippled attempts to observe the monetary targets. That

experience led to the development of a new deficit concept, adjusted for the

indexation of government debt, now widely applied in other countries.



Budget Concepts

          Table 1 shows alternative measures for the budget. When inflation

rises or abruptly falls, different budget concepts are strongly affected.

Inflation in Brazil sharply accelerated in the 1980s as did the public

sector borrowing requirements. The public sector borrowing requirements

(PSBR) move dramatically with inflation because of the inflationary

component of interest payments. If inflation were to cease, the PSBR would

shrink to the size of the budget deficit corrected for inflation.



                               [PLACE TABLE 1 HERE]



           The operational deficit (column 2 of table 1) captures the

behavior of the budget deficit better than the Public Sector Borrowing

Requirements (PSBR). It is calculated by subtracting the monetary correction

payments from the PSBR. Nonetheless, because the monetary correction index

is not always equal to the inflation rate, the operational deficit still is

not a proper measure of the budget deficit corrected for inflation. The

difference between the two represents capital gains or losses for the public

sector. Moreover, like the PSBR, it excludes the deficit of the monetary

authorities (which distribute large credit subsidies) and thus possibly
                                       9




underestimates in a substantial manner the actual borrowing needs of the

public sector.

           One can try to overcome the shortcomings of the operational

deficit by calculating the budget deficit corrected for inflation from the

consolidated debt of the public sector. Table 1 shows this measure in its

third column, and its calculation is shown in the statistical appendix. This

measure underestimates the deficit when prices are rising. In this

definition payments and revenues are deflated by the December price index.

If inflation is high and the excess of expenditures over revenues occurs

throughout the year, deflating the deficit of each month by the December

price index grossly underestimates the budget deficit of the year. Thus,

while this measure shows the behavior of the consolidated real debt, it does

not show the deficit according to the conventional definition. i.e., it does

not measure the difference between revenues and expenditures. Moreover, this

calculation is very sensitive to real depreciations when the share of

external debt in total debt is large. Thus, in a year where there is a large

real depreciation, the ratio debt/GOP will show a large increase. After 1985

this measure underestimates the deficit because the rate of depreciation has

been smaller than that of inflation.

           In 1983, as a percentage of GDP, the budget deficit corrected for

inflation was extraordinarily large. There are at least three major causes

for this large deficit. First, in contrast with historically large and

positive growth rates, output fell during 1983 by 3.4 percent. Second, the

domestic cost (corrected for inflation) of servicing the external debt

greatly increased during 1983 because of the real devaluation. Third,
                                     10




interest on government bonds included compensation for the 30 percent

devaluation of February, because the return on these bonds had been linked

to the rate of exchange depreciation.3

           In the following year the budget deficit corrected for inflation

declined. But in 1985, the budget deficit was still as large as 5 percent of

CDP. The Cruzado Plan grossly miscalculated the size of the fiscal deficit,

assuming a budget close to equilibrium, when the Cruzado Plan was launched

in in February 1986.



The Cruzado Plan

Relations with the IMF deteriorated, and previous plans for a mulciyear

rescheduling agreement with the banks were scrapped after a new civilian

government took office in March 1985. Although interest on the external debt

was fully paid, there were no inflows of new capital. Recovery was then

based on internal demand, with limited import increase. Despite strong

output growth, worrying signs came from increasing government internal debt

service, low investment rates and accelerating inflation. New and bold

measures were called for.

           The Cruzado Plan, implemented in February 1986 as a substitute for

a conventional recession-based strategy of stabilization, was centered upon

the premise that the high rates of inflation were driven by the inertial,

self-replicating force of indexation.4 Accordingly, the Cruzado Plan

enforced a sophisticated short-term standstill that maintained real income

positions and abolished future indexation. The key steps of the Cruzado Plan

 were the following:
                                       11




• Wages, rents and installment payments were readjusted and frozen, as were

all prices and the exchange rate.

• A tablita was devised to compensate for the expected inflation built into

extant contracts and thus avoid arbitrary redistribution between debtors and

creditors. A new currency was introduced to help facilitate the

readj us tulent.

• Indexation was virtually eliminated. An escala novel, with a 20 percent

threshold, was substituted for wages. In financial markets, indexation was

maintained only for instruments of more than one year maturity.

              Inflation was to be zero. For a few months it seemed true, and

there was generalized euphoria. But signs of disequilibrium from excess

demand mounted without inducing adequate compensatory response. Another

election loomed, and in the best Brazilian political tradition, corrective

actions were placed on hold.

              This time the new measures were announced immediately after the

election. They proved much too late, and much too little. The ice of

controls had thawed, and there was no opportunity to restore an orderly

process of readjustment of prices and wages. Events rapidly moved Out of

control as inflation rates mounted. There seemed to be policy impotence. The

deterioration in the balance of payments became as significant as the

mounting internal problem. Suddenly, Brazil's comfortable cushion of

 reserves, that could lend credibility to the maintenance of a fixed exchange

 rate, had vanished.

              There is no controversy about the reasons why the Cruzado Plan

 failed. The most prominent factor was the overheating of the economy through
                                     12




loose fiscal and monetary policies, as well as through the overly generous

wage policy. On the fiscal side, tax revenues disappointingly rose only a

little, revenues of state-owned companies were hurt by the price freeze,

spending ran higher than anticipated, and subsidies that were cut during

1983-84 staged a comeback in 1986. The public sector wage bill also

increased in line with the economy-wide trend. There was a sharp initial

monetisation of the economy: in the first three months following

stabilization the monetary base doubled. Loose monetary policy produced very

low interest rates that permitted firms lacking confidence in the program to

build up speculative stocks. Furthermore, the increase in real wages

promoted by the Cruzado Plan and the fast-growing economy rapidly expanded

wages and sustained a consumers' boom.

           New attempts at controlling inflation were made in mid-1987, with

the Bresser Plan, and in January 1989 with the Summer Plan. Once again the

government froze prices and cut zeros off the face value of the currency.

Promises to eliminate the budget deficit were made but not kept. President

Jose Sarney lacked the political will to implement measures of fiscal

consolidation. He also lacked credibility, determination and allies in the

Congress. With the budget deficit left unscathed and the trade surpluses

growing, all the three plans amounted to attempts to stop inflation by

decree.



Institutional Adaptation

Policy makers, designing the Cruzado Plan, believed that past inflationary

shocks were being perpetuated in a vicious circle created by indexation.
                                     13




Freezing prices, exchange rates, and wages would create a rupture with the

past, thus permitting the economy to rid itself of inertial inflation.

           The main obstacle to the price and wage freeze was the absence of

synchronization in price readjustrnents. Simply freezing wages and prices on

a given day would greatly favor wage earners and entrepreneurs who had

readjusted their prices immediately before the freeze. In a likely manner,

such a step would drastically punish those who were to have received their

new settlements the following day.

           Incomes policy, rather than playing the role of a coordinating

device, became the major objective of the Cruzado plan. All attention was

concentrated in deriving formulas that would permit a "neutral" price

freeze. Nonetheless, the objective of "neutrality" in income distribution

remains elusive because the choice of a reference point remains arbitrary.

           The initial price freeze will not produce excessive windfall

profits or losses only if there is little dispersion of relative prices. The

dispersion of relative prices in the context of a staggered price setting

introduces a serious problem for the use of freezes in the coordination of

expectations during a stabilization program. It is sometimes asserted that

dispersion of relative prices will be less when inflation is higher because

adjustments take place at shorter intervals. The Brazilian experience does

not support this view. When inflation rises, adjustments take place at

shorter intervals but are also bigger. Rising inflation does not contribute

 to reducing the dispersion of relative prices, but can make the problem

worse. In Brazil, during the last week of December 1989, a Chevette cost the

 same as 42 standard-size brassieres and a refrigerator the same as a linen
                                     14



shirt. The same bottle of wine cost 50 cruzados in one supermarket and 15

cruzados in another.

           Institutional adaptation to rising inflation has become pervasive

as buyers and sellers, borrowers and lenders, the government and the tax

payers have engaged in a self-defeating race to shorten the lags on pricing

and indexation. Since 1988, the supermarkets in Rio have closed each Monday

morning to remark prices and by the end of 1989 firms were discussing weekly

adjustments for wage earners. By November 1989, the sales of electronic

calculators and the number of credit cards had doubled in relation to their

numbers in 1988. To avoid delayed reimbursement, many merchants were

offering shoppers 30 percent discount for instant payment in cash or checks.

By the end of 1989, most restaurants and hotels stopped accepting credit

cards because 20-day billing period eroded the value of payments. Contracts

no longer were made in cruzados, but in terms   of   BTNs (a national treasury

bond, daily corrected for inflation and used as unit of account).



                               [PLACE FIGURE 2 HERE]



           Figure 2 shows the daily inflation rate between April 4th, 1988

and August 31st, 1989. One observes that on average, inflation picked up at

regular weekly intervals. At the beginning of 1989, there was an

extraordinary jump of the daily index as merchants increased prices in

response to an expected price freeze that did materialize with the Summer

Plan. Soon controls were lifted and once again inflation was on the rise.

                              III. INFLATIONARY FINANCE

This section builds up a model of inflationary finance and explores the role

of price controls on inflation behavior.

          Consider an economy where government expenditures, C, are financed

by money creation, Ht -



(1)                            C —   Ht      Rtl


           Dividing both sides of equation (1) by nominal income, assuming

zero real growth and using the definition of the inflation rate, we obtain:5



(2)                            h —   g + htl (1/(1t)



where: g is the share of the real budget deficit in real income and h is the

ratio between real cash balances and real income.

           Our next question concerns the dynamics of inflation. The

inflation rate accelerates whenever aggregate demand exceeds the full

employment output level. For a given fiscal stance and real exchange rate,

there is a unique real interest rate at which aggregate demand equals full

employment output. Accordingly, equation (3) shows that inflation increases

whenever the actual real interest rate, i -        it,   is below the full employment

real interest rate, p:



 (3)                      -      —
                                          [p(g)   -
                                                      (i(ht)   -
                                            16




where p is a function of the share of government expenditures in GD?. We

also assume that the nominal interest rate moves in order to clear the money

market all the time. The demand for real cash balances is inversely related

to the nominal interest rate. Thus, we can write the actual interest rate,

       as a function of real cash balances in the equation above, Note that

equation (3) implies the existence of both inflation inertia and a scope for

monetary policy to affect inflation.

              Figure 3 illustrates steady state equilibria. In steady state, the

inflation rate is constant. We represent the steady state inflation rate in

figure 3 as the schedule6 showing itt       —




(4)                              p—i(h) -it

                                  [PLACE FIGURE 3 HERE



              In steady state, the ratio of real cash balances and real income

 is also constant:




 (5)                           h it   —g   (1-4-it)




              We represent the steady-state budget constraint in figure 3 by the

 schedule showing ht —

              There are two equilibria: El and E2. The low inflation
 equilibrium, El, can be stable. The nature of the time path around the low

 inflation equilibrium is one of oscillations as in the cobweb model. The
                                       17




high inflation equilibrium, E2, is unstable.7 This model exhibits the

essential property that, in the transition to a sustained increase in money

growth, the inflation rate, on average, exceeds the growth rate of money.



Price Controls

In the context of a budget deficit financed by money printing, price

controls would reduce inflation temporarily. Continuous money growth in the

presence of price controls increases real cash balances reducing interest

rates. As a consequence, once price controls are removed, inflation picks up

again. Through oscillations, inflation would then return to its initial

level, if the initial equilibrium was stable.

           We can simulate the path of inflation by assuming specific

functional forms for money demand and values for the parameters in equations

(l)-(3). We make: i —   j - vh,   with j —   0.62 and v — 4. We also assume that
  — 0.05, p — 1 percent per month and g — 1.5 percent. Thus, in the initial

stable steady state: ir — 15 percent per month and h —   0.115.
           Figure 4 compares two situations. In the first one, the government

freezes prices during one period. In the second, it uses guideposts rather

than a price freeze. Once controls are removed, the price freeze leads to a

bigger overshooting of the inflation rate than in the case of loose

controls. Under both circumstances, the inflation rate finally returns to

the 15 percent steady state level. In this model, price controls can only

lead to an explosive inflation race under two circumstances. The first

situation corresponds to one with an unstable initial equilibrium. The
                                     18



second situation corresponds to one where the inflation rate, in response to

the price freeze, moves out of the stability region.

Cuttinz the Budget Deficit

           Figure 5 compares equilibria for different fiscal deficits. A cut

in government expenditures shifts the steady state budget constraint

downwards. It also reduces the full employment real interest rate,   thus


shifting the schedule irtirt1 to the right.



                               [PLACE FIGURE 5 HERE I



                                                                               the
            Assume that, consistent with a 0 real interest rate per month,

 reduced budget deficit share in output, g, is 1 percent. In the new stable

 steady state the inflation rate will be 8 percent per month and the real

 cash balances share in income will be 0.135.

            How does the economy move from the initial 15 percent inflation to

 the new 8 percent final equilibiriurn? If policy-makers could precisely

 determine both the new steady state inflation rate and the size of the

 desired real cash balances consistent with it, they could cut the deficit

  and at the same time increase money by the right amount and choose adequate

  price controls. Under these very special circumstances,   they could

  immediately bring the economy to the new steady state.8 Unfortunately,

  perfect information and synchronization do not exist. Thus, we must compare
                                         19




less perfect but more realistic policies. We compare the inflation path that

follows the   adoption   of:

• a budget deficit cut with and without price controls;

• a budget deficit cut with and without a change in the money stock.



Price Controls in the Presence of a Fiscal Contraction

Figure 6 compares the inflation path in response to a cut in the budget

deficit in three different situations:

• no controls

• loose controls during five periods

• a price freeze during five periods.



                                   [PLACE FIGURE 6 HERE]



              Figure 6   shows that loose controls produces a deceleration of

inflation   sooner than would    have taken place in its absence and it also

reduces   the size of the cycles around the new steady state. By contrast, in

the case where the inflation rate is not zero in the new steady state, the

price freeze exaggerates the size of the cycles.

              This exercise helps to understand the success of loose controls in

the 1965-68 stabilization in Brazil.



 Combtnin2 Fiscal and Monetary Austerity

 Figure 7 shows that a cut in the budget combined with a monetary squeeze is

 overkill. The inflation rate declines faster, but the recession and the

 following cycles are made more acute.

Monetizing Public Debt

Fiscal and monetary austerity were not part of the economic package adopted

in Brazil with the Cruzado Plan. On the contrary, fiscal policy was left

untouched in the immediate aftermath of the Cruzado Plan and monetary policy

was expansionary.

           Figure 8 shows the path of real cash balances in response to an

increase in the money stock with and without price controls. This figure can

be compared with the figure showing the actual behavior of real Ml in Brazil

(figure 9). The acceleration of inflation in Brazil, once price controls

were removed after the Cruzado Plan, does not need a very elaborate

explanation.

                    IV. THE CAUSES OF INFLATION

Section III clarified two processes. First, the model in section III showed

how price controls, in the presence of a sustained budget deficit,

ultimately increases inflation instability. Second, we argued that a

monetary expansion combined with a price freeze clearly was one of the

factors of inflation acceleration after the Cruzado Plan. Questions

concerning the link between domestic and external debts with inflation have

to be answered in the context of a model more complex than the one described
                                     21




in section III. We now develop a model to study the inflationary impact of

financing the budget deficit in different ways and of depreciating the

exchange rate

          Montiel (1989) divides recent analyses of inflation into a

"fiscal' view and a "balance of payments" view. Followers of the 'fiscal"

persuasion point to movements in the budget deficit as the fundamental

source of monetary emission that moves the economy to higher inflation

rates. Supporters of the "balance of payments" theory link inflation to

exchange rate depreciation triggered by balance of payments crises.

Computing historical decompositions of the Brazilian inflation rate based on

vector autoregressions, Montiel concluded that movements in base money and

the nominal exchange rate have played an important role in determining the

time path of the rate of inflation in Brazil between 1983:1 and 1985:4.

Brazilian inflation for most of that period resulted in good part from

inertia and increased because of new shocks deriving from exchange rate

depreciation. Monetary shocks had an important role only in the last two

quarters of 1985.

           Rodriguez (1978) offered a starting point for the discussion of

 the devaluationinflation spiral in a model where the government finances

 the budget deficit through central bank credit creation.9 He showed that

 under these circumstances, while casual observation would indicate that

 inflation is preceded by devaluation and monetization of the resulting

 balance of payments surpluses, the conclusion that the external sector is

 the cause of inflation would be inappropriate:

     Although it is correct that over a short period following the
     devaluation external sector developments lead the movement in domestic
                                       22




   prices, over the entire typical cycle the price level follows the path of
   the money supply, which is determined entirely by domestic credit
   creation to finance the fiscal deficit.(. . .) Both the price level and the
   exchange rate (are) led by developments in the monetary sector, which are
   in turn determined by the monetization of the.internal fiscal deficit.'

             The situation described by Rodriguez can be complicated if

external credit rationing follows a period of external borrowing by the

government. Consider, for example, a situation where a government has a

large external debt. Suddenly, deprived of foreign capital inflows needed to

finance interest payments and non-interest deficits, it will have to foster

trade surpluses to produce the needed exchange resources to service the

external debt. In order to produce these trade surpluses, the exchange rate

is greatly depreciated in real terms. The government now has to finance

domestically the purchase of foreign exchange it needs to service the

external debt. In the absence of a cut in the budget, there will be more

government credit creation. Moreover, depreciation has an important impact

on the domestic cost of servicing the external debt. Debt service measured

in domestic currency increases and thus the budget deficit measured in that

currency also increases. This, in turn, increases money creation and hence,

inflation.

             Observe that the inflationary impact of the trade surpluses does

not necessarily come from an increase in foreign reserves, as in Rodriguez

(1978). If the trade surplus is used to pay interest on government debt and

is not counterbalanced by an increase in taxes, it will increase money

creation, even if reserves remain unchanged.

             Under these circumstances, what "caused" inflation to rise? The

disappearance of the external source of finance? The exchange rate
                                          23




depreciation? The deterioration of the budget that resulted from the

depreciation? The monetization of budget deficits that were previously

financed by external borrowing and counterbalanced by trade deficits?

              The answer, of course, is all of the factors mentioned above. In

the absence of a budget deficit neither external credit rationing nor

exchange depreciation would cause a persistently higher inflation rate. On

the other hand, without credit rationning and depreciation, the inflation

rate would not increase.

              We now explore this situation formally. Our first question

concerns the fiscal budget and its financing. The government finances the

budget deficit by borrowing abroad, by issuing domestic debt and by creating

money. We assume that the current account is financed either by commercial

loans or by changes in foreign reserves. All external borrowing is done by

the public sector. The appendix shows how we can combine the equations for

the budget constraint and the balance of payments to obtain:10




(6)                          g++ib—h+b
where: g — share in output of the primary budget deficit

          —   share in output of net exports
        i —   nominal interest rate
       b —     ratio   between domestic debt and income

       h —     ratio between   the monetary base and income

          —    growth rate of the monetary base
        w — growth rate of domestic debt.
                                        24




           Net exports are equal to the interest payments on the public

external debt in the special case where, after a decade of external

borrowing by the government, there is external credit rationing and no

change in foreign reserves.11

           Domestic agents hold money, domestic bonds and inventories of

goods. Demand for real cash balances is inversely related to the interest

rate, i, and inversely related to the inflation rate, it:




(7)                     h —     -       - .12iT



           The demand for domestic bonds depends positively on the interest

rate and inversely on the inflation rate:




(8)                     b—0+fl1i -


           The government follows a "passive' monetary rule, letting money

growth match the inflation rate when inflation is stable, but reducing the

money growth rate when the inflation rate increases:


                                    .

 (9)                    M—ir - air



            The growth rate of domestic debt is endogenous. Substituting (7)-

 (9) in (6) we   obtain the equation that describes the behavior of the real
 domestic debt through time:
                                                             25



                                                                                          S

where: i —   (b-0482ir)/fl1


             Our next step is to re-interpret equation (3) from section II that

describes the dynamics of inflation. As before, the equilibrium nominal

interest rate is part of the real interest rate which influences inflation

dynamics. In the goods market, inflation increases whenever the actual real

interest rate,i -     it, is         below the full employment real interest rate, p,

which is now a function of both the share of government expenditures and of

net exports in income:

where: j —   (b-fl0-f82it)/1


             We can represent the model as done in figure 10. The schedule

           the budget constraint in steady state:12

           There are two steady state equi1ibria. The high inflation

equilibrium, point B in figure 10, is unstable. At the high inflation

equilibrium, any disturbance will move inflation onto an explosive path. The

low inflation equilibrium in figure 10, point A, can be stable. The nature

of the time path around the low inflation equilibrium is one of oscillations

as in the cobweb model.



Comparative Dynamics: External Credit Rationing Changes the Source of

Finance of the Budget Deficit

If external finance dries up and the government responds by depreciating the

exchange rate, there is an increase in the trade surplus, .   The increase in

the trade surplus shifts the schedule representing the steady state budget

constraint downwards as shown in figure 11. On the other hand, the increased

 trade surplus requires a higher full employment real interest rate, i.e., a

higher domestic debt/income ratio. Thus, the schedule that represents steady

 state inflation shifts upwards.



                                 (PLACE FIGURE 11 HERE]
                                      27




           The economy moves from the initial equilibrium, A, to a new one,

A', where the domestic debt and the inflation rate are higher than before.

With the increase in the trade surplus, the economy moves, with

oscillations, to the higher inflation equilibrium. Initially, the inflation

rate increases ahead of the nominal interest rate and the real, interest rate

falls, stimulating activity and pushing up the inflation rate. Gradually,

the interest rates exceed inflation rates, increasing the real interest rate

and. the domestic debt.

           An increase in the budget deficit generates exactly the same

results as those described above. A reduction of the external finance of the

budget, requiring a devaluation and an increase in the trade surplus, is

thus equivalent to an increase in the budget deficit.

           Because there is a limit to the budget deficit that can be

financed by seigniorage, or to the trade surplus that can be monetized,

further increases in the budget deficit or in the trade surplus might rule

out any crossings of the two schedules, denying the existence of an

equilibrium solution to the model.

           We also observe that in response to an increase in the budget

deficit, or in response to a reduction in the external finance of the budget

deficit, both the inflation rate and the ratio of domestic debt to income

increase. The debt crisis in Brazil manifests itself not only in rising

inflation but also in the rapid growth of domestic debt. (Table 7.A). The

rapid domestic debt growth results in part from the financing of both the

primary deficit and of debt service. In 1989, problems were made more acute

by the high real interest rates, shown in figure 12.
                                     28




                              [PLACE FIGURE 12 HERE)



          During the last two quarters of 1989, the goal was to maintain a

restrictive monetary policy and, in practice, this was translated into very

high real interest rates. Nonetheless, the public could effectively write

checks on their overnight deposits which were backed by the government debt.

That implied that open market operations traded non-paying-interest- money

for money paying interest and thus they did not affect liquidity. The high

interest rate avoided the flight into dollars and real assets and the

government continued to enjoy financing for the deficit. But without debt

relief, fighting current inflation with tight monetary policy must

eventually lead to higher future inflation or debt repudiation of some kind.

In the case of Brazil the situation is made more serious because of the

extremely short maturity of the debt.



                               V. CONCLUSIONS

Several factors explain inflation in Brazil. Between 1979 and 1983 its

acceleration resulted from supply shocks and large real depreciations in the

context of an indexed economyJ5 Because of a large external debt, the

 fiscal imbalance also increased in this period with real depreciations and

 the increase in foreign real interest rates. After 1984, when the government

 could not finance the deficits externally anymore, monetization of deficits

 and acceleration of money growth became important inflationary factors.

 Despite the decline of inflation-corrected budget deficits, the
                                        29



disappearance of external sources of finance made the fiscal deficits more

inflationary because they had to be financed domesticallyJ6 Moreover, the

perception of unsustainable fiscal imbalances led to financial adaptation

and flight from money, further aggravating the inflation problem.17

           Table 2 summarizes the stylized facts that our model has tried to

replicate. In the two years that followed the Cruzado Plan, the average

monthly inflation rate was about the same as it had been in the two years

that preceded the Cruzado Plan. Instability nonetheless increased, as

measured by the coefficient of variation of inflation, by the premium in the

black market for dollars and by the coefficient of variation of the index of

the Sao Paulo stock market.

           The very fast acceleration of inflation after 1988, as well as the

recent sharp increase in real interest rates, cannot be directly attributed

to the failure of the Cruzado Plan alone. The culprits are several attempts

 to control inflation through price freezes and, more recently, by tight

monetary policy alone, all the while avoiding the necessary fiscal

 adjustment.
               There are four important lessons to be learned from the Brazilian

 experience.

               • The first lesson derives from the inadequacy of the public

 sector savings effort. What occurred in the 1980s can be characterized as an

 "accoinodation" to the disappearance of external sources of finance rather

 than a structural adjustment. External debt reduction through different

 types of swaps coupled with large budget deficits,     financed by expensive

 domestic debt have evolved into a massive fiscal problem.
                                     30




           Inflation stabilization now requires a major fiscal effort. In the

Brazilian case it requires action on three fronts. Foremost the position of

the public sector in Brazil continues to be badly compromised by the need to

extract resources from the private sector for the service of the external

debt. To obtain fiscal consolidation without a major recession, Brazil need

to reduce the transfer of resources abroad. Today that means debt reduction

and postponement of debt service.

           Domestic debt has also grown to finance the budget deficit as well

as to pay for large subsidies granted to public enterprises and the private

sector itself. The maturity of this debt is explosively short. Budget

equilibrium requires the consolidation of the domestic debt. This could be

achieved by privatization with the proceeds used to retire debt and by a

forced lengthening of the maturity of the remaining instruments.

           Moreover, solving the two debt problems will not be enough to

restore stability. Fiscal consolidation requires major cuts in subsidies and

better tax adsiinistration.

           • The second lesson concerns the use of price controls. In the

absence of fiscal consolidation, price controls increase inflation

instability. They stimulate demonetization and increase the financial

vulnerability of the economy. These effects are not easily reversed after

stabilization.

           Here one should also notice the difficulty of managing neutral

disinflation. In 1986 real wages were increasing at the expense of profit

margins, helping to provoke shortages, black markets and disorderly growth.
                                       31




           • Third, even if fiscal and monetary policies are just right

for stabilization, the problem of the transition from a situation with

high inflation to one with a low inflation rate still has to be dealt

with. In that case, price guideposts will help to smooth transitton.

           • Finally, it   is   too easily   asserted   that getting rid of

indexation is essential to achieve inflation stabilization. This is

wrong, as demonstrated by the excessive boldness of the Cruzado Plan in

aiming for zero inflation and abolishing indexation. While indexatlon

contributes to the propagation of inflation, it also protects against the

kind of volatile inflationary acceleration that occurred at the end of

1986 and beginning of 1987. Indexation establishes inertia at a lower

inflation rate, locking in disinflation gains. A good example are the

years of low and stable inflation rates in Brazil between 1968—74.

Indexation also facilitates political acceptance of a stabilization

program, an attribute that cannot be overestimated.

APPENDIX II: How to obtain equation (6)



The government budget constraint is:


                                                 S        S       •
(A.l)              (G-T) + j*ED +       iB   — E D +      B   +   C



where:
G-T — the primary budget deficit.
     interest
i*ED —               payments on the external debt; E is the exchange rate.
iB — interest        payments on the domestic debt.

D       — external borrowing.
S
B           domestic borrowing
S
C       —   domestic credit creation, equal to the change in the monetary
                 base, H minus the change in foreign reserves, F:

                                    S        S        S
(A.2)                               C—H-EF
           Consider now the balance of payments in dollars under the
asswsption that only the government borrows abroad:

                                                              .

(A.3)                            F —NX- i*D+D
where: NX — net exports.
We substitute (A.2) and (A.3) in (A.l), to obtain (A.6):


(A.4)                   (G-T) + E(NX) +          iB —             H   +   B

                Dividing both sides of (A.4) by income, Y, and defining:
(G-T)/1g,                   ENX/Y.b,                                  H/Y—h,


we obtain:

(A.5)                            g++ib—h+b

  See Table l.A in the Statistical Appendix.

  Surprisingly, the deficit corrected for inflation in 1983 is practically

the same as the PSBR. Here the reason might well be large subsidies given

through the monetary authorities and excluded from PSBR but not from the

deficit corrected for inflation.

  For detailed analyses of the Cruzado Plan see, for instance, Arida and

Resende (1985), Barbosa and Simonsen (1989), Cardoso and Dornbusch (1987),

Cardoso and Fishlow (1990), Modiano (1988) and Simonsen (1988).

  We divide (1) by PY to obtain: (C/PY)_(Ht/PtY)(Ht..l/Pt.lY)(Pt1/Pt),

where we substitute: lrt —                - 1.   We assume that government can

choose g. And, of course, H is endogenous.

 6 The slope of the schedule representing steady state inflation is given by

 dir/dh —   Si/&h < 0.   In drawing figure 2 we assumed a linear relationship

 between i and h, i.e., we assumed: i —          j   -
                                                         vh,    with j—.62 and v—4.

    For stability, it is necessary that the schedule ht —                  h..i   cuts the

 schedule       —   t-1 from below, i.e.: -(Si/&h) >           ir/(h-g).
 8This policy mix entails a credibility problem. Increasing money by the

 rig1t amount may be interpreted by the public as a phase of expansionary

 monetary policy despite the cut in the budget deficit.

 9see also Dornbusch (1987) and Ize and Ortiz (1987).
                                                   39




10 For simplicity, we use continuous time.

     We assume that policy makers set expenditures and taxes, and thus choose

g. We also assume that they set the nominal exchange rate and its

devaluation rate. Given that there is inflation inertia, they actually set

the rate of real devalution, and thus can choose .

12 The slope of v—li    is   db/dic —                            -




Observe that db/di > 0        for small IT     and db/dr.(O for large Jr.

13
     The slope of u—U   is   db/dit —   - (2   -



14 The necessary condition for stability, as shown by the arrows in

figure 10 is that the schedule representing the steady state budget

constraint cuts the schedule representing the steady state inflation rate

 from below.

 15 Table 2.A in the Statistical Appendix shows a sharp real depreciation at

 the end of the 1970s and another one in 1983.

 16 Between 1982 and 1988, the ratio of the consolidated debt of the public

 sector/GDP more than doubled. The ratio of the external debt/GDP           increased

 sharply in mid-1980s and declined in recent years. See Table A.3 in the

 Statistical Appendix.

 17 Velocity shows a growing demonetization of the economy between 1970 and

 1985, a remonetization in 1986, and a fast demonetization since 1987.
