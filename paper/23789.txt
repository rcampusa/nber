                                           ABSTRACT

The Great Recession and the Global Financial Crisis have left many developed countries with
low interest rates and high levels of public debt, thus limiting the ability of policymakers to fight
the next recession. Whether new fiscal stimulus programs would be jeopardized by these already
heavy public debt burdens is a central question. For a sample of developed countries, we find that
government spending shocks do not lead to persistent increases in debt-to-GDP ratios or costs of
borrowing, especially during periods of economic weakness. Indeed, fiscal stimulus in a weak
economy can improve fiscal sustainability along the metrics we study. Even in countries with
high public debt, the penalty for activist discretionary fiscal policy appears to be small.

I. Introduction
The Great Recession ended more than eight years ago, making the current expansion long by
historical standards. But the recession has left many scars and much has changed about the monetary
and fiscal policy landscape. For example, despite attempts to set economies on normalization paths
after the Great Recession and the Global Financial Crisis, the scope for countercyclical monetary
policy remains limited: benchmark interest rates have continued to hover near or even below zero.
This constraint on monetary policy coincides with a resurgence in activist fiscal policy (Auerbach
and Gale, 2009), which has moved from a focus on automatic stabilizers to a stronger reliance on
discretionary measures, reflecting not only necessity but also growing evidence of the effectiveness
of such policy to fight recessions (e.g., Auerbach and Gorodnichenko, 2012, 2013). In the current
low-interest-rate, low-inflation environment, an even greater reliance on fiscal policy may be needed
to address the next recession, whenever it begins.
       At the same time, the prolonged recession and the countercyclical fiscal measures adopted
to address it have left the United States and other leading economies with substantial increases in
public debt (see Figure 1). These elevated debt levels raise several important questions about the
conduct of fiscal policy. In particular, to what extent does the increase in public debt limit the
“fiscal space” available to fight recession? Do high debt-to-GDP ratios limit the strength of fiscal
multipliers (e.g., Perotti, 1999), or alternatively can expansionary policy actually improve the
fiscal picture and reduce debt-to-GDP ratios, especially when interest rates are low (DeLong and
Summers, 2016)? Should high-debt countries consider fiscal consolidation, even during a period
of economic weakness (Alesina et al. 2015)? And how is the scope for fiscal policy altered by the
large implicit liabilities from unfunded pension and health care programs in the United States and
other economies with rapidly aging populations?
       To address these questions, our analysis takes a route that is more direct than much of the
existing literature, which has typically concentrated on how fiscal conditions affect fiscal
multipliers, how the mix of fiscal policies influences the effects of fiscal consolidations, and the
conditions under which expansionary fiscal policy might be adopted without leading to an increase
in deficits and debt, relative to GDP. Adapting an approach used in our own previous work on
fiscal multipliers (Auerbach and Gorodnichenko 2013), we estimate the effects of fiscal shocks on
debt as well as other measures of fiscal pressure, such as benchmark interest rates and CDS



                                                                                                   1
spreads. Using CDS spreads may be particularly useful for gauging comprehensive effects on
fiscal sustainability, which may be inadequately represented by short-term debt dynamics.
        To illustrate our approach, consider the standard law of motion for a country’s national debt,
𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡 = (1 + 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 )𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 where 𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡 is the stock of national debt in real terms outstanding at the end
of year t, 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 is the government’s primary deficit during year t, and 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 is the real interest rate on
national debt in year t. A fiscal shock taking the form of an increase in the primary deficit in year t
can influence the stock of debt 𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡 in a number of ways, including (1) changing output, leading to
further adjustments in taxes and spending (either automatic or discretionary) and hence the primary
deficit in year t; (2) a change in the nominal interest rate on government debt, which affects 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 ; and
(3) a change in the inflation rate, which also affects the real interest rate 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 . Rather than estimating
the impact on 𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡 by looking separately at each of these components, we simply estimate the effects
of fiscal shocks on 𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡 directly, as well as on future values, 𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡+1 , 𝐵𝐵𝑡𝑡+2 , and so on. While
understanding the channels through which fiscal shocks affect public debt is useful, estimating this
relationship directly has the advantage of addressing directly the question that is fundamentally of
interest, without the need to specify the exact relationships of the intermediate steps, such as how
fiscal policy changes in response to fiscal shocks.
        We utilize a variety of data sets and measures of fiscal shocks, varying by frequency,
sample period, country coverage and the method of identifying fiscal shocks. For example, we
use the following approaches to identify unanticipated shocks to government spending: (1) the
standard recursive ordering identification as in Blanchard and Perotti (2001); (2) professional
forecasts to remove predictable changes in government spending as in Auerbach and
Gorodnichenko (2012, 2013); and (3) narrative identification as in Devries et al. (2011).
        Consistent with our earlier work, we find that the effects of government spending shocks
depend on a country’s position in the business cycle. Expansionary fiscal policies adopted when the
economy is weak may not only stimulate output but also reduce debt-to-GDP ratios as well as interest
rates and CDS spreads on government debt, while the outcomes when the economy is strong are
more likely to have the conventional effects. When we examine responses of various measures of
fiscal stress to government spending shocks across different levels of public debt, we find that these
shocks may indeed increase stress when debt levels are high, but the increase is quantitatively
modest. The results are broadly similar when we consider interactions of the state of the economy
and the level of public debt. These results suggest that fiscal stimulus in a weak economy could be

                                                                                                             2
an effective tool to boost the economy and that the penalty from doing so in terms of elevated debt
levels and borrowing costs is likely modest for the countries we study.
         Our work is related to several strands of previous research. The first strand examines
effects of fiscal shocks on macroeconomic aggregates (e.g., Blanchard and Perotti 2002, Ramey
2011, Auerbach and Gorodnichenko 2012, 2013, Jorda and Taylor 2016, Ramey and Zubairy,
forthcoming). In agreement with earlier studies, we find that government spending shocks
generate expansions and the government spending multiplier is larger when economy is weak than
when economy is strong. 1
         The second strand focused on investigating how the level of public debt can influence the
ability of government spending shocks to stimulate the economy. Previous studies tend to report
mixed results with some (e.g. Ilzetzki et al. 2013) finding a lower fiscal multiplier in high-debt
countries and some (e.g., Corsetti 2012) showing no difference across low- and high-debt
countries. Consistent with the latter set of results, we find little difference in the responses across
low- and high-debt states.
         The third strand of research measures sustainability of fiscal policies across time and
countries.     For example, Auerbach (1994) computes fiscal gaps based on initial debt and
projections of different components of government expenditures and tax revenues over extended
horizons. Related research examines cyclically adjusted fiscal deficits to establish whether a
country is on a sustainable path (see Escolano 2010 and Bornhorst et al. 2011 for more discussion).
In contrast to this work, we focus on the dynamics of debt-to-GDP ratio and the cost of borrowing
conditional on a government spending shock.
         Born et al. (2017) is the paper closest in spirit to our analysis of the effects of fiscal policy
changes on fiscal sustainability. Specifically, Born et al. examine how CDS spreads react to fiscal
consolidations identified as in Devries et al. (2011) at the annual frequency. In contrast to the sample
in our study (effectively, large OECD economies), the Born et al. sample covers 38 countries
including such emerging economies as Argentina and South Africa. Another important difference
across the studies is that we use the debt-to-GDP ratio as a measure of state (fiscal sustainability)
while Born et al. (2017) use the default premium as the state variable (fiscal stress). Born et al. report
that a fiscal consolidation (a cut in government spending) increases the premium (especially if the


1
  While Ramey and Zubairy (forthcoming) argue that output multipliers are smaller than those found in other studies,
they, too, estimate larger multipliers when the economy is weak than when it is strong based on postwar data.

                                                                                                                       3
premium is already high, that is, the economy is experiencing fiscal stress) but in the long run the
premium declines. This result is consistent with our finding that an increase in government spending
does not generate large increases in CDS spreads in the short run.
          The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we document that many
developed economies have strained fiscal positions that might limit their governments’ ability to
implement discretionary fiscal countercyclical programs. Section 3 describes the data we use to
study responses of key macroeconomic variables and fiscal indicators to government spending
shocks. Section 4 discusses identification of unanticipated, exogenous government spending shocks.
Section 5 lays out our econometric framework to study dynamic responses. In Section 6, we present
estimated impulse responses for various identification schemes and time frequencies. Section 7
explores how responses vary with the level of public debt. Section 8 presents concluding remarks.


II. The Growing Challenge of Fiscal Sustainability
Since the beginning of the Great Recession and the Global Financial Crisis, leading economies
have accumulated considerable national debt. Based on data from the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), Figure 1 shows the evolution of net general government debt-to-GDP ratios for the G-7
countries in recent years, comparing the end of 2007, just as the worldwide recession began, to the
end of 2016. 2 With the exception of Germany, all countries experienced an increased debt-to-
GDP ratio. For several countries, including the United States, the increase was quite substantial.
          These short-term levels and trajectories clearly are relevant. But debt-to-GDP ratios alone
typically do not tell us how long countries have before they must make fiscal adjustments or how
large these adjustments need to be. Some countries, for example Japan, have maintained relatively
high debt-to-GDP ratios for some time. Also, whatever the determinants of short-run budget
dynamics, current debt and deficits may provide an inadequate picture of underlying fiscal
imbalances. Indeed, the factors contributing to short-term debt accumulation differ substantially
from those that will affect debt accumulation over the longer term, which often relate more to the
demographic change of population aging and the associated changes in government spending and
tax collections.
          One method of measuring a country’s fiscal imbalance that takes longer-term commitments
into account is the fiscal gap associated with them, typically expressed as a share of GDP. As

                                                                                                   4
defined, for example, in Auerbach (1994), a fiscal gap, say ∆, over a horizon from the end of the
current period, t, through a terminal period, T, would equal the required increase in the annual
primary surplus, as a share of GDP, relative to those projected under current policy that would be
needed for the terminal debt-to-GDP ratio to achieve some desired value, or


                           1 + 𝑔𝑔 (𝑇𝑇−𝑡𝑡)                       1 + 𝑔𝑔 (𝑠𝑠−𝑡𝑡)
                𝑏𝑏𝑡𝑡 − �          �         𝑏𝑏𝑇𝑇 + ∑𝑇𝑇𝑠𝑠=𝑡𝑡+1 �        �       𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠

where 𝑏𝑏𝑡𝑡 is the outstanding debt-to-GDP ratio at the end of year t, 𝑏𝑏𝑇𝑇 is the target debt-to-GDP
ratio at the end of period T, 𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠 is the primary deficit-to-GDP ratio in year s, g is the GDP growth
rate, and r is the relevant interest rate, with both growth and interest rates assumed constant for the
sake of simplicity. The target debt-to-GDP ratio is often taken to be the current value, although in
cases where a country starts with an elevated debt-to-GDP ratio this conventionally assumed target
value likely understates the size of the required adjustment, to the extent that long-run stability
would be difficult at such a high value of this ratio.
       Figure 2 presents estimates of fiscal gaps for the G-7 countries. To form these estimates,
we start with the estimated 2016 ratios of net publicly held debt- to-GDP in Figure 1, and then add
projections for primary surpluses as a share of GDP from 2017 through 2022 from the IMF April,
2017 World Economic Outlook Database. For years after 2022, it is necessary to make some
assumptions as to the further evolution of primary surpluses, and we take an approach that
separates “normal” components from those related to aging and health. For shares of GDP
accounted for by revenues and non-interest spending in areas excluding health care and public
pensions, we set values equal to those in 2022. For the remaining expenditure components, we
incorporate recent projections underlying the summary tables in the April, 2017 IMF Fiscal
Monitor.    For these calculations, we assume a real discount rate of 3 percent and a real GDP
growth rate of 2 percent. Since these projections run only through 2050, we limit our fiscal gap
estimates to a 34-year horizon, i.e., with year T = 2050.
       In Figure 2, the first bar represents the fiscal gap when the terminal debt-to-GDP ratio is
set equal to the 2016 debt-to-GDP ratio. The U.S. estimate is the highest, at over 9 percent of
GDP. That is, according to these calculations, the United States would have to reduce non-interest


                                                                                                     5
spending or increase revenues by over 9 percent of GDP relative to baseline projections in order
to hit its current debt-to-GDP ratio in 2050. The gap for Japan is nearly 5 percent, while those for
the other G-7 countries range from 1.3 percent for Germany to 3.3 percent for the United Kingdom.
The alternative fiscal gap based on a terminal debt-to-GDP ratio of 60 percent, a figure often used
in such calculations (and, for example, used as a target in Europe’s original Stability and Growth
Pact), indicates a much bigger challenge for Japan, given the required reduction over the period
from its current debt-to-GDP ratio.
        One can illustrate the relative importance of existing debt and current and future primary
surpluses to the fiscal gaps shown in the figure by considering how much of the fiscal gap is due to
the initial stock of debt, and how much is due to current and future primary surpluses. The second
bar for each country in Figure 2 shows what the fiscal gap would be without any initial debt. In a
sense, the difference between these two series represents the share of the fiscal gap attributable to
past fiscal policy, in the form of past deficits that together led to the initial level of debt on which the
calculation is based. For countries with high initial debt-to-GDP ratios, such as Italy and Japan, the
difference between the first and second series is quite large, while for countries, such as Canada,
with low initial debt-to-GDP ratios, the difference is small. The third bar in Figure 2 illustrates the
importance of the growth in implicit liabilities associated with health care spending and public
pensions. For each country, it shows what the fiscal gap would be if, in addition to there being no
initial debt, there were also no increase relative to GDP in spending on health care or pensions after
2022. This calculation indicates how much of the fiscal gap comes not from past deficits, just
considered, or the present, in the form of current and near-term primary deficits, but the future, in
the form of increases in primary deficits, as a share of GDP, relative to their near-term values. For
all countries, this assumption reduces the estimated fiscal gaps, and for Germany it eliminates the
gap entirely. The incremental effect of this factor is especially large for the United States, for which
assumed growth in health care costs is very large in the IMF projections.
        These estimates are, of course, sensitive to a variety of assumptions. For example, although
real interest and growth rates of 3 and 2 percent may be historically reasonable, the gap between
the real interest and growth rates has recently been lower, and assuming a smaller short-term gap
would reduce the cost of debt service included in the calculation. In addition, projections of future
entitlement costs, especially for health care, are subject to considerable uncertainty. Finally,
determining the path of primary deficits under current policy, even through 2022, relies on

                                                                                                          6
assumptions regarding short-term policy actions. 3 Thus, the numbers in Figure 2 should not be
interpreted as precise, but rather as providing an indication of the relative challenges facing
different countries and the relative importance of different components of these countries’ fiscal
gaps. It should be kept in mind, in particular, that achieving fiscal balance may provide a greater
challenge in the future than in the past not only because of higher initial debt-to-GDP ratios but
also the added costs associated with demographic change.


III. Data
For our remaining empirical analysis, we use publicly available data on leading economies
obtained from a variety of sources. Most of our data come from the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), the IMF, and the Bank for International Settlements
(BIS). In this section, we briefly describe and discuss pros and cons of the data. Availability of
series is summarized in Appendix Table 1. Appendix Table 2 reports descriptive statistics for
select variables.


Government Debt. We draw series on general government debt (in local currency) from a number
of sources, including the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Credit to the Non-Financial
Sector database and the Eurostat Quarterly Government Debt database. The main source of our
data is a new BIS dataset on gross general government debt, constructed by BIS researchers
(Dembiermont et al. 2015) to facilitate cross-country comparisons of public indebtedness under a
consistently defined measure of general government debt. This debt measure is on a consolidated
basis and covers loans, debt securities and deposits and is available at a quarterly frequency.
Wherever necessary, we seasonally adjust debt series with the U.S. Census Bureau’s X-13
algorithm. To convert the BIS data to a semiannual frequency, we use end-of-semester (i.e. the
second and fourth quarter) observations. For each country, the database provides nominal (face)
and market values of debt.



3
  Using estimates from the most recent long-term and 10-year CBO projections and various assumptions about what
constitutes current policy, Auerbach and Gale (2017) estimate a U.S. fiscal gap through 2047 of just 3.4 percent. Some
of this is due to smaller assumed primary deficits at the end of the 10-year period – around 3 percent rather than around
6 percent – and most of the remainder is due to a lower assumed growth rate in medical and pension spending. A partial
explanation for these differences may be that the IMF data cover all levels of government whereas Auerbach and Gale
consider only the federal government. Even the estimates by Auerbach and Gale, however, show much larger fiscal gaps
when the horizon is extended, reaching as high as over 9 percent on an infinite-horizon basis.

                                                                                                                       7
         To increase sample coverage, we also use data from Eurostat, the statistical office of the
European Union (EU), which provides quarterly general government debt series for countries in the
EU. The public debt series provided by Eurostat is as defined by the Maastricht Treaty: consolidated
public debt at face value. The measure of debt reported by Eurostat is directly comparable to the
database constructed by the BIS (see Dembiermont et al. 2015, p. 78).
         For Germany and Italy, we were able to augment these data with general government debt
series obtained directly from the Deutsche Bundesbank and the Banca D'Italia, for the periods
1980-99 and 1986-99, respectively. For both series, the data are on a quarterly basis and the
instrument coverage is comparable to the BIS and Eurostat series (Loans, Debt Securities, and
Currency and Deposits on a consolidated basis). While these data are somewhat different from
the BIS data in terms of definitions, the time series are highly correlated over the period where
both sources are available.
         In a few cases, the time series for government debt can be extended using the accounting
identity relating debt and deficit observations: 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡+1 = 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 + 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 where 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 is
taken from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics (IFS) and is defined as the (seasonally
adjusted) net operating balance minus the net acquisition of nonfinancial assets (or the gross
operating balance minus the net acquisition of nonfinancial assets that also excludes consumption
of fixed capital).
         We measure the debt-to-GDP ratio as 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 /𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 where i and t index countries and
time. Note that we lag the denominator by one period to ensure that the contemporaneous reaction
of the ratio to a government spending shock is driven by changes in debt rather than output.

Interest rates: We collected short- and long-term interest rate series (STI and LTI, respectively)
from the OECD Key Short-Term Economic Indicators database. These interest rates measure
local-currency returns on short- and long-term government debt.

Credit Default Swaps (CDS): The credit default swap (CDS) spreads data come through
Thomson Reuters Datastream, which contains data coming directly from Credit Market Analysis
Limited (CMA) and Thomson Reuters. Spreads prior to 2008Q1 are from CMA and spreads after
2010Q2 are from Thomson Reuters. An average of the two series is used for the overlap period to
construct a single, continuous series. To eliminate exchange rate risk from CDS series, we use
only dollar-valued spreads.

                                                                                                                   8
Macroeconomic data: We generally take macroeconomic data from the OECD Economic
Outlook (EO) database. We use nominal GDP (value, market prices, OECD mnemonic GDP)
measured in local currency to scale debt series. To measure the growth rate of output, we use real
GDP (volume, market prices, OECD mnemonic GDPV). The inflation rate is measured as the
percent change (semester on the corresponding semester in the preceding year) in the consumer
price index (IMF IFS mnemonic PCPI_PC_CP_A_PT). The growth rate of real government
consumption is computed using OECD EO data (mnemonic CGV). For a subset of countries,
OECD also provides data on real government investment (IGV). Whenever, both CGV and IGV
are available, we use CGV=IGV+CGV to measure government spending. In other cases, we use
CGV alone. Accordingly, the share of government spending in GDP is computed as either
GV/GDPV or CGV/GDPV.


Forecasts for government spending: Each June and December, the OECD releases its Economic
Outlook which includes forecasts for macroeconomic variables (e.g., GDP, unemployment rate,
government spending). While the method used to prepare forecasts varies across countries, the
definitions of variables are comparable across countries. The OECD utilizes its regional/country
network to obtain feedback from local economists about proposed forecasts. The projections are
extensively discussed with local government experts and policy makers. As a result, forecasts
incorporate local knowledge and have a significant judgmental component. Vogel (2007) and
Lenain (2002) report that OECD forecasts have a number of desirable properties and perform
similar to forecasts provided by private forecasters. These forecasts are available since 1987.
Unfortunately, forecasts are available only for aggregate government spending and therefore we
are not able to study effects of various types of government spending (e.g., military vs.
infrastructure) on economic outcomes.


Data filters: To minimize adverse effects of noise and gyrations in the data, we exclude countries
that satisfy one of the following criteria: (1) population is less than 2 million (Estonia,
Luxembourg, Iceland, Malta, Cyprus); (2) national official statistics are known to be of potentially
dubious quality (Greece); and (3) there are too few observations (Slovakia, Slovenia, Turkey). In
addition to this filter, we winsorize all variables with significant variation at high frequencies (e.g.,



                                                                                                       9
CDS, interest rates, GDP growth rate) at the bottom and top two percent. We do not winsorize
slow-moving variables such as the debt-to-GDP ratio.


IV. Fiscal Shocks
We employ several approaches to identify government spending shocks. 4 Our first approach is to
use the conventional approach of Blanchard and Perotti (2002), which relies on recursive ordering
of variables with government spending shocks not responding contemporaneously to
macroeconomic variables such as output, inflation, etc. Intuitively, Blanchard and Perotti (2002)
argue that fiscal policy has long decision lags and that, given this inertia, it is unlikely that
policymakers can use fiscal tools to respond to economic developments at high frequencies. The
key advantage of this approach is the minimal data requirement since government spending series
are available for a broad spectrum of countries. We refer to shocks identified with this approach
as BP shocks.
        At the same time, the Blanchard-Perotti approach has several limitations. First, it requires
data at high frequencies (and much of our data are at the semiannual frequency). Second,
interpretation of government spending shocks at high frequencies may differ from the
interpretation of government spending shocks we would like to have. For example, Auerbach and
Gorodnichenko (2016) argue that high-frequency shocks may reflect changes in the timing of
spending (e.g., a shift in spending from one period to another shortly before or after) rather than
changes in the level of government spending.                     Finally, Ramey (2011), Auerbach and
Gorodnichenko (2012, 2013) and others argue that many changes in government spending are
anticipated, even if unpredictable based on lagged aggregate variables. As a result the Blanchard-
Perotti approach may mix effects of anticipated and unanticipated shocks to government spending,
thus potentially attenuating the size of the estimated effects of government spending on output and
other macroeconomic aggregates.
        In light of these limitations, we follow our previous work (Auerbach and Gorodnichenko,
2013) and use professional forecasts to purge predictable variation from the innovations to
government spending. Specifically, we calculate the unpredictable innovation to government

4
  In our analysis, we focus on government spending shocks and omit tax shocks because identification of exogenous,
unanticipated shocks to taxes has much higher data requirements (e.g., one needs to remove the component of tax
revenues that contemporaneously varies in response to changes in output). In addition, one would expect the effects
of tax changes to vary considerably according to their characteristics (e.g., increases in transfer payments versus
reductions in corporate tax rates).

                                                                                                                10
spending at time 𝑡𝑡 (forecast error 𝐹𝐹𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑡|𝑡𝑡−1 ) as the difference between the actual growth rate of
government spending at time 𝑡𝑡 and the OECD forecast of the growth rate for time 𝑡𝑡 made at time
𝑡𝑡 − 1. This forecast error has a number of desirable properties (e.g., 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 is serially uncorrelated).
The quality of 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 shocks can be further improved by projecting it on lags of macroeconomic
variables and taking the residual from this projection as a shock. This latter step can be
implemented by including lags of macroeconomic variables as controls in a regression where 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹
is one of the regressors. We take 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 shocks as the baseline measure and refer to these shocks as
AG shocks.
          In contrast to Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2013), however, we scale forecast errors so
that shocks to government spending are measured as a percent of GDP. While in principle it would
be preferable to use potential output to scale changes in government spending to avoid scaling by
a cyclical measure (Gorodnichenko 2014), available measures of potential output are sensitive to
business cycle fluctuations (Coibion, Gorodnichenko, and Ulate 2017). To circumvent this issue,
                                                               𝑔𝑔  ���������

Blanchard-Perotti approach.
          To explore the robustness of our results, we also employ fiscal consolidation shocks
constructed by Devries et al. (2011) and updated by Alesina et al. (2016). These are narrative
shocks identified as in Romer and Romer (2010) and are measured as a percent of GDP. The
shocks are available for 17 OECD countries and cover the period between 1980 and 2014. In
contrast to other fiscal shocks we use, the fiscal consolidation shocks are available only at the
annual frequency. Because fiscal consolidations can include adjustments on both revenue and
spending sides, we use only spending consolidations to make the series comparable to the series
generated in the Blanchard-Perotti and forecast-error approaches. Given that the initial series of
fiscal consolidation shocks was constructed by a team of IMF researchers, we refer to these as IMF
shocks.
          Because fiscal consolidation shocks for government spending are coded as positive values in
Devries et al. (2011) and Alesina et al. (2016), we recode the series so that the sign of the shocks is
negative whenever shocks take a non-zero value and thus estimated impulse responses show

                                                                                                                              11
dynamics after an increase (one percent of GDP) in government spending. This recoding may be
problematic since the effects of government spending cuts are not necessarily symmetric to the
effects of government spending increases (see Riera-Crichton et al. 2015). Thus, one should bear in
mind the caveat that, although we interpret results as showing responses to increases in government
spending, the estimated responses are based only on cuts in government spending.


V. Econometric Specification
Following Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2013), we use the Jorda (2005) local-projections method
to estimate effects of fiscal shocks on economic outcomes. There are several key advantages of
this approach over more conventional VAR-based approaches. First, this approach allows fast
estimation of models with many parameters and imposes no restrictions on the shape of estimated
responses. Second, it can be easily extended to estimate potentially nonlinear effects of shocks.
Third, it is well-suited to handle error terms correlated across countries and time.
        A generic linear specification is

where 𝑖𝑖 and 𝑡𝑡 index countries and time (measured in semesters), 𝑦𝑦 is a variable of interest, 𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜
is a measure of a fiscal shock, 𝑿𝑿 is a vector of controls, and 𝛼𝛼 and 𝜅𝜅 are country and time fixed
effects. The vector of controls 𝑿𝑿 includes the GDP growth rate, the inflation rate, the growth rate
of government consumption spending, and the short-term interest rate. The interest rate is included
to control for the stance of monetary policy. The impulse response of 𝑦𝑦 to 𝑠𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 is constructed
       (ℎ)   𝐻𝐻

                                                                                (0)
is varied from zero to a maximum horizon 𝐻𝐻. The impact response is given by 𝜙𝜙�0 and the average

response is given by (1 + 𝐻𝐻)−1 ∑𝐻𝐻   � (ℎ)
                                 ℎ=0 𝜙𝜙0 .

        Note that by using the coefficients on the contemporaneous shocks we effectively impose
the Blanchard-Perotti ordering of variables in a VAR (that is, innovations to government spending
do not respond to other macroeconomic variables). Given the potentially complex correlation
structure of the error term 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ with possible dependence across countries and time, we use the


                                                                                                                             12
Driscoll and Kraay (1998) standard errors to make statistical inferences. Here and in what follows,
we set the number of lags in expression (2), 𝐾𝐾 = 3 to ensure that the error term is approximately
uncorrelated at ℎ = 0.
             Since we control for country and time fixed effects, this approach can attenuate estimated
effects of fiscal shocks that influence not only a given country but also the rest of the world. In a
similar spirit, estimated responses for interest rates and some other variables can be interpreted as
responses of interest rate spreads relative to a benchmark/global interest rate rather than level
responses of interest rates.
             Recent research documents that the effects of policy shocks (e.g., Auerbach and
Gorodnichenko 2012, 2013, Jorda and Taylor 2016, Tenreyro and Thwaites 2016) can vary over the
business cycle. This variation is interesting and important to examine because countercyclical fiscal
policy is typically about effectiveness of fiscal stimulus programs in recessions rather than “on
average.” To allow for state dependence in how a fiscal shock may influence fiscal sustainability,
we follow our earlier work and consider the following modification to specification (2):

the economy being in a recession/slump. That is, 𝐹𝐹(𝑧𝑧𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) = 1 can be interpreted as the economy

output that is insensitive to business cycle fluctuations. Unfortunately, potential output is not
available for many countries and, as discussed above, there are a number of issues with the
available measures of potential output.      Given these constraints, we follow Auerbach and
Gorodnichenko (2013) and use the Hodrick-Prescott filter with a high smoothing parameter (𝜆𝜆 =
10,000) to ensure that the trend does not follow actual output and large downturns such as the
Great Recession. Note that, by construction of the Hodrick-Prescott filter, 𝑧𝑧𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 has mean zero. We
normalize deviations from the trend to have unit variance so that variation in 𝑧𝑧𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 is comparable
across countries and we can apply the same value of 𝛾𝛾 in the transition function for all countries.
Specifically, we use 𝛾𝛾 = 1.5, as in Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2013).
       As we discuss below, specification (3) can be further modified to include other nonlinear
effects. Our baseline estimation is done at the semiannual frequency. For the narratively identified
shocks we aggregate data to the annual frequency and run specifications (2) and (3) on annual data.
Given the short time dimension for the annual data, we set 𝐾𝐾 = 1 for regressions estimated at the
annual frequency.
       Our reduced-form approach is aimed to impose as few restrictions as possible on the
dynamics of the responses. While this approach can limit our capacity to do counterfactual policy
experiments, our findings could be used as inputs to discipline structural models as in Christiano
et al. (2011), Coenen et al. (2012), and House and Tesar (2015).


VI. Results
In this section, we study the dynamic responses of key macroeconomic and fiscal variables to
identified government spending shocks. We present estimates for the responses using the linear
and nonlinear specifications.    The main objective of the exercise is to determine whether
government spending shocks lead to deterioration of fiscal sustainability.
VI.A. Semiannual data
As a first pass at the data, we examine reactions of standard macroeconomic variables to identified
innovations to government spending, using our semiannual data set. Figure 3 shows responses of
GDP and the price level (Panels A and B) to our benchmark AG government spending shocks.
Table 1 reports point estimates and standard errors for the estimated impact and average (over five
years) impulse responses. Consistent with our earlier work, we find that responses vary with the
state of the economy and the standard linear response estimated in specification (2) can provide an


                                                                                                  14
“average” estimate across states. Specifically, the response of output to a government spending
shock is larger in a weak economy than in a strong economy and on “average” (that is, in the linear
specification (2)) government spending generally stimulates output. The response of the price
level is generally similar in the two regimes but confidence bands are wide. Similar to the AG
government spending shocks, BP government spending shocks (Figure 4 and Table 2) generate a
stronger response of output in a slump than in a boom. Relative to AG shocks, BP shocks tend to
be more inflationary in expansions than in recessions. The weak response of the price level to
government spending shocks is consistent with the notion that prices may be rigid in the short run
and most of the adjustment in the economy happens via quantities and that, generally, inflationary
pressure is stronger when the economy operates at full capacity.
       With AG shocks, the response of government spending (Panel C, Figure 3) is stronger and
more persistent with the economy at full employment than in a weak economy. By construction,
BP shocks have the same unit response on impact in any state of the economy and we find smaller
variation in the response of government spending to a shock over the business cycle (Panel C,
Figure 4).
       Note that in nearly all cases the estimates are imprecise, which contrasts with relatively
high precision of estimates in our earlier work which did not include data from the period of the
Great Recession and its aftermath. Thus, statistical evidence should be interpreted as tentative
because the confidence bands are too wide to allow conclusive inference about the size of the
response or its variation with the state of the business cycle. Furthermore, given the bands, we
typically cannot rule out that responses obtained with one set of shocks (e.g., AG shocks) are
different from the responses obtained with another set of shocks (e.g., BP shocks). This finding
reflects limited variation in the data (e.g., we have only a handful of recessions for each country)
as well as dramatic size and heterogeneity in shocks hitting economies.
       Having established that our baseline government spending shocks produce sensible results
for main macroeconomic aggregates, we move to study the behavior of variables measuring
sustainability of fiscal policy interventions. Panels D and E in Figure 3 and 4 show impulse
responses of short- and long-term interest rates. High interest rates are often interpreted as making
public debt less sustainable. For example, during the Global Financial Crisis, a rapid increase in
interest rates for countries like Italy and Portugal created a heavier debt servicing burden for these
countries, thus raising concerns about whether they had adequate resources to maintain their

                                                                                                   15
government spending programs. Therefore, an increase in the level of interest rates in response to
a positive government spending shock (fiscal stimulus) may be understood as a sign of reduced
fiscal sustainability of the stimulus. We fail to find clear evidence that short- and long-term interest
rates increase after an identified shock. If anything, point estimates suggest that the rates may fall.
For example, the fall in the long-term interest rate is greater in a weak economy than in a strong
economy when we use AG shocks (Panel D, Figure 3). This result suggests that markets may view
fiscal stimulus as a way not only to accelerate the economy but also to reduce risks associated with
a prolonged slump (e.g., self-defeating austerity policies, populist governments, defaults, etc.). In
any case, the estimated impulse responses allow us to rule out extreme hikes in interest rates.
These results suggest that effects on fiscal sustainability through the cost of government borrowing
may be not particularly important.
       While interest rates provide an important metric of how sustainable government spending
shocks can be, the responses of interest rates could capture a mixture of policy responses (e.g.,
monetary policy may accommodate or offset fiscal policy).               A more direct measure of
sustainability is the CDS spread on sovereign debt. Although this measure may be more useful,
one should bear in mind that CDS data are generally available only after the mid-2000s, a period
dominated by the Great Recession and the Global Financial Crisis. Therefore, our estimates may
be driven by these specific events. With this caveat in mind, we find (Panel F in Figures 3 and
Figure 4) that CDS spreads show only weak reaction to government spending shocks in the linear
specification: we cannot reject at a 10 percent significance level the null hypothesis of zero
response for any horizon. However, this weak response “on average” masks important cyclical
heterogeneity.
       In particular, we find that after a government spending shock CDS spreads fall in recessions
and rise in expansions. The fall could be consistent with the view that by stimulating the economy
the government improves business conditions thus averting a larger crisis. In other words, fiscal
stimulus in a weak economy may reduce spreads rather raise them. The rise of spreads in
expansion may indicate that financial markets perceive spending shocks as wasteful when the
economy operates at full capacity. The qualitative patterns are similar but the magnitudes are
larger when we use the BP identification. These findings are consistent with the dynamics of




                                                                                                     16
interest rates thus indicating a potentially low cost of fiscal stimulus programs when resources in
the economy are underutilized. 5
         Panel G in Figures 3 and 4 shows responses of the debt-to-GDP ratio to a government
spending shock. As highlighted in our initial discussion, this ratio is widely used to gauge fiscal
sustainability. It is also useful in assessing the effectiveness of stimulus programs. In a nutshell,
a persistent increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio can be interpreted as signaling limited success of a
program even if it stimulates output because, in this case, a series of recessions and fiscal stimulus
programs can push public debt to unacceptable levels. On the other hand, if the ratio declines
(perhaps after a temporary increase), then fiscal stimulus does not have long-term consequences
for the capacity of the government to use countercyclical fiscal policy or increase the need for
fiscal consolidation during expansions.
         We find that the debt-to-GDP ratio does not rise significantly in response to a government
spending shock in the linear specification. Furthermore, we find that, for the AG shock, the ratio
falls in slump and rises in boom. As discussed in DeLong and Summers (2012), this pattern is
consistent with the view that a fiscal stimulus in recession can pay for itself: when economy is
strong, additional government spending is unlikely to increase output considerably and thus a
spending shock adds to debt without much improvement in the denominator of the ratio. In
contrast, when the economy is weak, a spending shock has a stimulatory effect so strong that the
ratio decreases, both as a result of a lower numerator (due to e.g. automatic stabilizers, i.e., less
countercyclical spending and higher taxes) and a higher denominator (higher GDP). With the BP
identification of spending shocks, the ratio also falls in recession, although in this case the
magnitude of the response is much larger and the ratio does not rise in expansion. These results
are qualitatively consistent with simulations in Gaspar et al. (2016).
         In summary, we find that government spending shocks tend to stimulate the economy and
to have little adverse effect on a variety of measures of fiscal sustainability. Specifically, estimated


5
  Another metric we can use is the debt price, measured as the ratio of market value of debt to nominal (face) value of
debt. In contrast to CDS spreads, the debt price is harder to interpret because the price can change over time due to
variation in investors’ perceptions about default probabilities, liquidity conditions, inflation expectations, changes in
maturity structure of government debt, etc. Similar to the reaction of CDS spreads, we find that “on average” (that is,
in the linear specification) debt prices exhibit weak if any response to government spending shocks. There is also
weak evidence that, after a government spending shock, debt prices tend to fall in a slump and rise in a boom, but the
differences are not statistically significantly different from zero. The lack of a strong fall in the price of government
debt suggests that financial markets do not punish the government implementing a fiscal stimulus with higher
borrowing costs

                                                                                                                     17
impulse responses show that neither interest rates nor debt-to-GDP ratios increase discernably in
response to government spending shocks. Although the estimates are not sufficiently precise to
permit clear inference about the magnitude of the response, the evidence is strong enough to
exclude the possibility of heavy punishment for fiscal stimulus on average or in weak economy.


VI.B. Annual data
Studies estimating responses of macroeconomic variables to fiscal shocks tend to utilize high-
frequency data to sharpen identification of fiscal shocks. However, there could be some benefits
in using annual data for our investigation. For instance, governments tend to organize budgets and
fiscal plans on an annual basis, and thus identified annual fiscal shocks may have better alignment
with the frequency at which governments make decisions. Perhaps more importantly for us, by
working with annual data, we can employ narratively identified fiscal consolidation (IMF) shocks.
Given that these shocks exploit different sources of information, consistency in the results across
identification approaches can provide assurance that our findings are not driven by a particular set
of assumptions about what constitutes a government spending shock.
       To have a benchmark for comparison across identification approaches at the annual
frequency, we aggregate AG shocks by adding up shocks identified for the first and second
semesters of a given year to obtain the corresponding annual series. For the BP approach, we use
annual series for government spending. Results based on the annual data for AG and BP shocks
are reported in Appendix Tables 3 and 4 and Appendix Figures 1 and 2. We generally find that
time aggregation does not change the qualitative results.
       In the next step, we construct impulse responses to IMF shocks (Figure 5 and Table 3). We
find that increased government spending stimulates output, with the response being stronger in a
weak economy. The response of prices is somewhat larger in a weak economy but the estimated
impulse responses are not statistically different from zero and from each other. Government
spending is similarly persistent in the weak- and strong-economy states. While long-term interest
rates decline in a weak economy and exhibit no material change in a strong economy, short-term
rates tend to increase in a weak economy and fall in a strong economy (although the latter effect is
short-lived). CDS spreads go up when the economy operates at full capacity and fall when the
economy is not utilizing resources fully. For both states, the price of debt tends to rise while the
debt-to-GDP ratio declines (the decline being somewhat stronger in a weak economy).


                                                                                                 18
           We view these results as being in general agreement with our findings for the AG and BP
identification, at least regarding results for a weak economy. Specifically, macroeconomic
responses to cuts to government spending (recall that IMF shocks are fiscal consolidations) do not
appear to lead to beneficial results in terms of reduced borrowing costs or persistently lower debt
burdens. This pattern is similar to our findings for AG and BP shocks that an increase in
government spending does not yield discernable increases in debt-to-GDP ratio or cost of
borrowing.


VII. Public Debt and Fiscal Sustainability
While our analysis of how fiscal sustainability varies with the economy suggests that there could be
little cost in pursuing countercyclical fiscal policies, one may expect that the cost could be greater in
some circumstances, when one considers other sources of heterogeneity in the data. In particular,
recent research (e.g., Ilzetzki et al. 2013) documents that fiscal stimulus may be less effective in
economies with a public debt overhang. Intuitively, attempts of the government to jump start the
economy with more government spending may backfire in a high-public-debt environment where
economic agents are skeptical about the ability of the government to pay back its debt thus raising
the cost of funds for the government and potentially private borrowers. Casual inspection of cross-
country variation in borrowing costs and the level of public debt (e.g., Japan has large public debt
and low CDS spreads costs while Switzerland has moderately high public debt and relatively high
CDS spreads) suggests that the relationship between the two may be complex.
           To shed more light on how the level of debt may influence sustainability of fiscal stimuli,
we consider the following modification of specification (3):

where 𝐷𝐷∗ is a measure of debt burden. While a conventional approach in the literature is to use
the debt-to-GDP ratio as a measure of debt burden, we use a slight variation of this measure.


                                                                                                                                                    19
Specifically, we note that there is apparent variation in what level of public debt a country may
sustain. For example, Japan operates smoothly with a debt-to-GDP ratio greater than 200 percent
while a country like Italy would likely not be able to do it. Also, countries vary in the extent to
which gross debt (the measure we used based on availability) exceeds net debt (which, by netting
out government holdings, may provide a better measure of sustainability). Thus, absolute levels of
public debt may provide a distorted sense of a government’s capacity to issue and service public
debt. To address this concern, we focus on within-country variation in public debt, that is, we
compare Japan (Italy) when it had low public debt to Japan (Italy) when it had high debt. We
define the debt state as


                                                             𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚

where 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is debt-to-GDP ratio for country 𝑖𝑖 at time 𝑡𝑡, and 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 and 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 are the minimum and
maximum values of the ratio over the sample period. By construction, 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖∗ varies between 0 and 1
                                                                                                                  𝐻𝐻

(max debt) environments, respectively. The estimated responses to AG government spending
shocks (semiannual frequency) are reported in Table 4 and Figure 6. 6
          We find relatively little variation in the size of the output response across low- and high-debt
states. Likewise, the response of government spending is similar across states. On the other hand,
prices tend to increase more in the high-debt state than in the low-debt state. The cost of borrowing
measured by interest rates and CDS spreads generally increases more in the high-debt state but the
magnitudes are relatively small. For example, after an AG shock, the change in the CDS spread is
50 to 100 basis points higher at a maximum level of debt than at a minimum level of debt. On
average, the difference between the maximum and minimum values of debt-to-GDP ratio across
countries is approximately 40 percentage points. Thus, even a dramatic increase in the ratio yields
only modest increases in the cost of borrowing for countries in our sample. Finally, a government

spending shock has no effect on the debt-to-GDP ratio in the low-debt state but it induces a persistent
increase in the high-debt state: the point estimate for the average response is a 1.374 percentage point
increase, which, however, is not statistically significant at the 10 percent level. In summary, while
a fiscal stimulus program in a high-debt country may hurt fiscal sustainability, the estimated effects
are generally small. We observe no material effects for the low-debt state.
         These results are reminiscent of our findings for the cyclical variation in the influence of
government spending shocks on fiscal sustainability. This pattern is not entirely surprising as the
debt-to-GDP ratio (𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) and the weakness of the economy (𝐹𝐹(𝑧𝑧𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 )) are positively correlated (see
Appendix Figure 4). However, there are instances when countries pursued aggressive debt
(deficit) reduction policies even in weak economic environments (e.g., the U.K. during the Global
Financial Crisis). We can exploit this heterogeneity to differentiate variation in the responses due
to the state of the economy and the level of public debt. To this end, we use the flexibility of the
Jorda (2005) approach and consider another modification of specification (3):

responses, in Panels A and B of Table 5 respectively. 7
             Since this specification is particularly demanding on our data, we estimate few statistically
significant responses. With this caveat, we can note, however, that available evidence suggests
that, while there is variation in how active fiscal policy can influence fiscal sustainability across
states, this variation is not sufficiently strong to suggest considerable adverse effects of fiscal
stimulus programs on fiscal sustainability.


VIII. Discussion and Concluding Remarks
Although economists do not believe that expansions die from old age, the prolonged U.S.
expansion will end sooner or later and there is serious concern about the ability of policymakers
in the United States and other developed countries to fight the next economic downturn. Indeed,
the ammunition of central banks is much more limited now than before the Great Recession and it
is unlikely that expansionary monetary policy can be as aggressive and effective as it was during
the crisis. Available evidence (e.g., Martin and Milas 2012) suggests that additional rounds of
quantitative easing may run into diminishing returns. Likewise, it is hard to expect that moderate
decreases of interest rates (perhaps breaking zero lower bound on nominal interest rates and even
venturing well below zero) can turn the tide.
             While fiscal policy had a countercyclical component during the Great Recession, it was
not used to full potential, given the depth of the recession (e.g., Coibion et al. 2013). With tight
constraints on central banks, one may expect—or maybe hope for—a more active response of
fiscal policy when the next recession arrives. This expectation, however, may be too optimistic
since governments in developed countries have amassed high levels of debt over the past decade.
Whether new fiscal stimulus programs would be jeopardized by these already heavy public debt
burdens is a central question. It is certainly conceivable (see e.g. Aguiar et al. 2017) that a
significant fiscal stimulus can raise doubts about the ability of a government to repay its debts and,
as a result, increase borrowing costs so much that the government may find its debt unsustainable
and default. Hence, it is critical to establish how government spending shocks influence not only

output and prices but also indicators of fiscal sustainability such as the debt-to-GDP ratio and
interest rates on public debt.
       We find that in our sample expansionary government spending shocks have not been
followed by persistent increases in debt-to-GDP ratios or borrowing costs (interest rates, CDS
spreads). This result obtains especially when the economy is weak. In fact, a fiscal stimulus in a
weak economy may help improve fiscal sustainability along the metrics we study. There is
evidence that this effect is undercut when the debt-to-GDP ratio is elevated, although the penalty
for a high debt-to-GDP ratio does not appear to be high at the debt levels experienced historically
for developed countries.
       Given the nature of the sample analyzed, our results should not be interpreted as an
unconditional call for an aggressive government spending in response to a deteriorating economy.
Indeed, the experience of Greece and other countries in Southern Europe is a grave warning about
the political risks and limits of fiscal policy. Bridges to nowhere, “pet” projects and other wasteful
spending can outweigh any benefits of countercyclical fiscal policy. Perhaps more importantly,
we face considerable uncertainty about how economies will respond to fiscal stimulus programs
given levels of public debt rarely seen in recent history, as well as large unfunded liabilities. In
other words, we have to make out-of-sample predictions with data that may not be representative
of the future economic environment.        It is possible that fiscal institutions that help make
government commitments to eventual fiscal adjustments credible will take on even more
importance in the future. We hope that further research on the matter will be able to utilize longer
and more detailed historical series, covering greater variation in levels of public debt and more
disaggregated categories of government spending, and structural models to provide more
conclusive inference and clearer policy prescriptions.

Notes: The table reports estimated responses of macroeconomic and fiscal variables to government spending shocks identified as in Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2013), that is,
forecast-error shocks. The average response is calculated over five years (10 semesters). The impact response is calculated for horizon ℎ = 0. Standard errors are constructed using
Driscoll and Kraay (1998). P-value in columns (4) and (8) shows p-values for the test that responses are the same in slump and boom.

Notes: The table reports estimated responses of macroeconomic and fiscal variables to government spending shocks identified as in Devries et al. (2011). The average response is
calculated over five years. The impact response is calculated for horizon ℎ = 0. Standard errors are constructed using Driscoll and Kraay (1998). P-value in columns (4) and (8)
shows p-values for the test that responses are the same in slump and boom.

Notes: The table reports estimated responses of macroeconomic and fiscal variables to government spending shocks identified as in Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2013), that is,
an innovation to government spending not predicted by standard macroeconomic variables. The average response is calculated over five years (10 semesters). The impact response
is calculated for horizon ℎ = 0. Low (high) debt corresponds to the minimum (maximum) level of debt for a given country in the sample. Standard errors are constructed using
Driscoll and Kraay (1998). P-value in columns (4) and (8) shows p-values for the test that responses are the same in high- and low-debt environments.

Notes: The table reports estimated responses of macroeconomic and fiscal variables to government spending shocks identified as in Auerbach and Gorodnichenko
(2013), that is, an innovation to government spending not predicted by standard macroeconomic variables. Column (1) presents estimates for specification (1).
Columns (2)-(3) and (5)-(6) present estimations for specification (3’’). The average response is calculated over 5 years (10 semesters). The impact response is
calculated for horizon ℎ = 0. Low (high) debt corresponds to the minimum (maximum) level of debt for a given country in the sample. Standard errors are
constructed using Driscoll and Kraay (1998). P-value in columns (4) and (8) shows p-values for the test that responses are the same in boom and slump.

  Notes: The table reports mean and standard deviation (SD) for select macroeconomic and fiscal variables. AG government spending shock is the unanticipated, exogenous innovation
  to government spending identified as in Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2013). IMF fiscal consolidation shocks are narratively identified cuts in government spending and are taken
  from Devries et al. (2011).

Notes: The table reports estimated responses of macroeconomic and fiscal variables to government spending shocks identified as in Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2013), that is,
forecast-error shocks. The average response is calculated over five years (10 semesters). The impact response is calculated for horizon ℎ = 0. Standard errors are constructed using
Driscoll and Kraay (1998). P-value in columns (4) and (8) shows p-values for the test that responses are the same in high- and low-debt environments.

Notes: The table reports estimated responses of macroeconomic and fiscal variables to government spending shocks identified as in Auerbach and Gorodnichenko (2013), that is,
an innovation to government spending not predicted by standard macroeconomic variables. The average response is calculated over five years (10 semesters). The impact response
is calculated for horizon ℎ = 0. Column (1) presents estimates for specification (1). Columns (2)-(3) and (5)-(6) present estimations for specification (3’’). In contrast to Error!
Reference source not found., this table uses the absolute (rather than normalized) level of debt. Standard errors are constructed using Driscoll and Kraay (1998). P-value in columns
(4) and (8) shows p-values for the test that responses are the same in high- and low-debt environments.

Notes: The figure plots impulse responses to government spending shocks identified as forecast errors (AG shocks) for linear specification (2) and for nonlinear specification (3’).
90% confidence bands are constructed using Driscoll-Kraay standard errors. The horizontal axis shows response horizon measured in semesters. In contrast to Figure 6, debt
burden is measured as the raw debt-to-GDP ratio.
