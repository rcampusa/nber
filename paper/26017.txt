                                          ABSTRACT

We study the effects of traditional cigarette tax rate changes and e-cigarette tax adoption on use
of these products among U.S. adults. Data are drawn from the Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System and National Health Interview Survey data over the period 2011 to 2017.
Using a differences-in-differences model, we find that higher traditional cigarette taxes reduce
adult traditional cigarette use and increase adult e-cigarette use, suggesting that the products are
economic substitutes. E-cigarette tax adoption reduces e-cigarette use, with some heterogeneity
across groups, and dilutes the own-tax responsiveness of traditional cigarettes.

1. Introduction

         As of 2017, 34.4 million adults (14.0%) in the United States smoked traditional cigarettes

and 6.9 million (2.8%) used electronic cigarettes (‘e-cigarettes’), which include electronic

cigarettes and other ‘vaping’ (i.e., using an e-cigarette1) devices delivering nicotine (Wang et al.

2018). 2 E-cigarettes may represent a healthier alternative to traditional cigarettes for smokers

who cannot quit, by delivering nicotine (the addictive ingredient in tobacco products) without

carcinogens and other toxicants found in traditional cigarettes. The U.S. Surgeon General has

concluded that, while e-cigarettes are not harmless, these products contain fewer toxicants than

traditional cigarettes (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2016).

         The potential substitutability of traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes presents a unique

challenge to policymakers. On one hand, taxing and restricting access to e-cigarettes may help

to reduce overall nicotine intake within the population. On the other hand, such measures may

be detrimental to the health of those who smoke by discouraging them from switching to a less

harmful source of nicotine (i.e., e-cigarettes) or using e-cigarettes as a cessation device (Hajek et

al. 2019). Localities within the U.S. have taken a variety of approaches toward e-cigarette

regulation. Early regulations focused on youth access and curtailing use in some public places.

More recent regulations include taxes. As of the end of 2018 all but two states have prohibited

youth from purchasing e-cigarettes, 3 15 states have banned the use of e-cigarettes in some public

  We note that individuals can vape products besides e-cigarettes, but we refer to the act of vaping as exclusive to e-
cigarette use throughout the paper. We also refer to the act of smoking as exclusive to traditional cigarette use.

  E-cigarettes are also referred to as e-cigs, vapes, e-hookahs, vape pens, electronic nicotine delivery systems, and
ENDS. There are three types of e-cigarettes: disposable single use products, kits that include a rechargeable device
and cartridges containing liquid nicotine, and tank or mod systems used to vaporize liquid nicotine. In this paper,
we follow the U.S. Surgeon General’s convention in referring to all of these products as e-cigarettes (U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services 2016). While most vaping devices include nicotine, we note that some
vaping products do not include this ingredient.
3
  Regardless of state law, we note that the Food and Drug Administration’s 2016 Deeming Rule established a federal
minimum legal sales age of 18 in that year.

places, and nine states have passed e-cigarette excise taxes (Centers for Disease Control and

Prevention 2019).

       In this study, we leverage cross-state over-time variation in traditional cigarette excise tax

rate increases in 18 states that occurred between 2011 and 2017, as well as the implementation of

e-cigarette taxes in eight states and two counties, to examine own- and cross-product tax

responsiveness. We utilize two national large-scale health survey data sources – the Behavioral

Risk Factor Surveillance System and National Health Interview Survey – that include detailed

information on both smoking and vaping. We have several key findings. First, traditional

cigarette taxes reduce smoking among adults over the period of 2011 to 2017. Second,

traditional cigarette taxes increase e-cigarette use among adults, suggesting that the products are

economic substitutes. Third, we find some evidence that e-cigarette taxes reduce e-cigarette use,

particularly for males. Fourth, the introduction of an e-cigarette tax appears to reduce traditional

cigarette own tax-elasticity. This could be because increasing the price of e-cigarettes

disincentivizes smokers from trying to quit by using e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation device

or transitioning to e-cigarettes as a source of nicotine, which are less harmful, when faced with a

traditional cigarette tax rate increase. This finding implies that policymakers attempting to

develop an overall tobacco control strategy that involves targeting both traditional cigarettes and

e-cigarettes should carefully consider spillovers from one policy to another.

       The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 offers a review of the related literature. Data

and variables are described in Section 3, and our methods are discussed in Section 4. Results are

reported in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes.




                                                 3
2. Related literature

         Our paper builds on the existing bodies of work on the own- and cross-price elasticities

of traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes among U.S. adults. 4 Below we discuss the existing

literature on these topics as well as our specific contributions.

2.1 Own-price elasticity of traditional cigarettes

         A voluminous economics literature estimates the price elasticity of traditional cigarettes

across various countries and time periods. Chaloupka and Warner (2000) review studies prior to

2000, concluding that smoking is responsive to price but relatively inelastic, with most estimated

price elasticities of total demand falling in the -0.3 to -0.5 range for adults. A more recent

review by the Community Preventive Services Task Force (2014) estimates a traditional cigarette

total demand price elasticity of -0.37 for adults, which is approximately equally split by effects

on the extensive and intensive smoking margins.

         The endogeneity of traditional cigarette prices is a potential concern with these estimates,

as prices are determined by changes in demand and supply factors, which could lead to omitted

variable bias in regression coefficient estimates and associated elasticity calculations (Gruber

and Köszegi 2001, Gruber and Frakes 2006). A large number of more recent economics studies

use traditional cigarette taxes rather than prices to reduce these endogeneity concerns. 5 In 2018,

state taxes represented 23% of the weighted retail price for traditional cigarettes (Orzechowski

and Walker 2018), suggesting that an adult price elasticity of demand of -0.40 converts to a state-

level tax elasticity of demand of approximately -0.10.




4
  There is also a literature on the effects of various e-cigarette policies, particularly minimum age laws, on youth
smoking (Dave, Feng, and Pesko 2019, Friedman 2015, Pesko and Currie 2019, Pesko, Hughes, and Faisal 2016).
5
  While tax rates are not as directly determined by demand as prices, they are nonetheless established within the
state’s political economy and thus not purely exogenous (Besley and Case 2000).

                                                          4
        Our contribution to the literature on the own-price elasticity of demand for traditional

cigarettes is to calculate an adult smoking participation tax elasticity during the period of time in

which e-cigarettes were widely available. Given this objective, benchmarking adult traditional

cigarette tax responsiveness for comparison with our findings is important.6 We identify several

studies calculating traditional cigarette tax rate responsiveness for adults using nationally

representative U.S. data just prior to the wide availability of e-cigarettes. We contend that these

studies are the most relevant to our own work while acknowledging that they do not reflect the

universe of studies estimating traditional cigarette demand equations.

        Cotti, Nesson, and Tefft (2016) use household scanner data from 2004 to 2012 to

calculate a tax elasticity of -0.16. Similarly, Nesson (2017) finds an elasticity of -0.15 using the

1988 to 2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, Bishop (2018) documents an

elasticity of -0.18 using 1999 to 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data, and

Callison and Kaestner (2014) estimate an elasticity range from -0.06 to -0.03 using data from the

1995 to 2007 Current Population Survey Tobacco Use Supplements. By examining more recent

data, we explore whether the introduction of e-cigarettes into U.S. tobacco product markets may

have altered traditional cigarette tax responsiveness by providing smokers with a popular

smoking cessation product. The availability of a close substitute lowers the disutility from

quitting smoking, perhaps enabling some smokers to quit smoking or switch to e-cigarettes as a

nicotine source as cigarette taxes rise when they would not have been able to do so otherwise.




6
 Though our focus here is on prime age adults, we note that there is also a literature using quasi-experimental
methods to estimate the tax elasticity of cigarettes among youth (DeCicca, Kenkel, and Mathios 2002, Carpenter and
Cook 2008, Hansen, Sabia, and Rees 2017, Courtemanche and Feng 2018) and older adults (DeCicca and McLeod
2008, Maclean, Kessler, and Kenkel 2016).

                                                        5
2.2 Own-price elasticity of e-cigarettes, and cross-price elasticity between traditional cigarettes

and e-cigarettes

           Several recent studies estimate the own-price elasticity of e-cigarettes along with the

cross-price elasticity between traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes. To the best of our

knowledge, all studies use e-cigarette prices generated from retail scanner data; that is,

researchers construct aggregated, area-level price measures based on prices that retailers in that

area scan at purchase. 7 As we discuss later in the manuscript, localities in the U.S. have only

recently implemented e-cigarette taxes, thus earlier studies were not able to exploit this source of

plausibly exogenous variation and instead relied on prices, which are likely vulnerable to similar

endogeneity concerns noted by Gruber and Köszegi (2001) and Gruber and Frakes (2006) in the

context of traditional cigarette prices.

           Three studies evaluate the effect of these e-cigarette prices on traditional cigarette and e-

cigarettes sales. Huang et al. (2018) use data from 2007 to 2014 to estimate e-cigarette own-

price elasticities for rechargeable e-cigarettes of -1.4 and for disposable e-cigarettes of -1.6.

Zheng et al. (2017) use data from 2009 to 2013 and document an e-cigarette own-price elasticity

of demand of -2.1, a cross-price elasticity of traditional cigarette prices on e-cigarettes sales of

1.9, and a cross-price elasticity of e-cigarette prices on traditional cigarette sales of 0.004.

Stoklosa, Drope, and Chaloupka (2016) use European data from 2011 to 2014 to estimate an e-

cigarette own-price elasticity of demand of -0.8 and a cross-price elasticity of traditional

cigarette prices on e-cigarette sales of 4.6.

           Survey data has also been used in four studies to estimate the effect of e-cigarette prices

on e-cigarette use. Saffer et al. (2018) use data on adults from the 2014 to 2015 Tobacco Use



7
    These prices include excise taxes but do not include sales taxes.

                                                             6
Supplement of the Current Population Survey to estimate an e-cigarette price elasticity of vaping

participation of -1.2. Pesko et al. (2018) use two years of the Monitoring the Future Survey data

of middle and high school students and find a -1.8 own price elasticity of days vaping. Pesko

and Warman (2017) use National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) data from 2011 to 2015 to

show that higher e-cigarette cartridge (the fixed component of a rechargeable e-cigarette) prices

reduce youth e-cigarette use and increase current traditional cigarette consumption (substitution),

especially for males and for older teenagers. Finally, Cantrell et al. (2019) use national

longitudinal cohort data on a sample of 15 to 21 year olds from 2014 to 2016 and find no effect

of e-cigarette prices, but a cross-cigarette-price elasticity of 0.9.

        Discrete choice experiments (DCE) have also been applied to estimate price-

responsiveness of traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes. DCEs are a stated preference method in

which respondents are presented with hypothetical purchasing decisions when product attributes

such as prices are varied. Marti et al. (2019), for example, use a sample of adult smokers who

are asked to choose between traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes when price, relative health of

e-cigarettes, effectiveness of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid, and coverage of smoking

bans in public places are varied. While the probability of selecting an e-cigarette declines as its

hypothetical price increases, health reasons appear to be more important than prices for adult

smokers’ e-cigarette choices. Another recent study suggests more of a role of price in the choice

of traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes (Pesko et al. 2016), with an estimated e-cigarette own-

price elasticity among current adult smokers of 1.8.

        One study explores the effects of traditional cigarette taxes on adult e-cigarette use.

Cotti, Nesson, and Tefft (2018) use Nielson household scanner data to show that traditional

cigarette tax increases lead to a decline in purchases of both products. This finding implies that



                                                    7
the products are economic complements, which contrasts the results from the majority of studies

discussed above which suggest substitutability across the products.

        We contribute to the literature on the own-price elasticity of e-cigarettes by providing, to

the best of our knowledge, the first exploration of the effect of e-cigarette taxes – rather than

prices – on e-cigarette use. Our study also makes three distinct contributions to the literature on

cross-price effects. First, we provide the first analysis of the effect of e-cigarette taxes (rather

than prices) on adult smoking. Second, we use survey data to examine the impact of cigarette

taxes (rather than prices) on adult e-cigarette use.

        Finally, we investigate the potential interactive effect of traditional cigarette and e-

cigarette taxes, which has not been explored. The intuition is similar to that discussed above

regarding the possibility that the widespread availability of e-cigarettes may have altered

traditional cigarette own-tax responsiveness. Increasing the price of e-cigarettes implicitly

reduces their availability, 8 which could inhibit some smokers from quitting or switching to the

less harmful product as a source of nicotine as traditional cigarette taxes rise. This question is

interesting from both an economics perspective and from a practical standpoint. From an

economics perspective, this question explores whether price elasticities are potentially a function

of the prices of related goods. Additionally, policymakers often adopt both traditional cigarette

and e-cigarette regulations as part of an overall tobacco control strategy (Maclean et al. 2018). If

these policies have interactive effects, then policymakers may wish to consider how policies

operate jointly when selecting the optimal set of regulations for their jurisdiction. Put



8
  Through standard price effects: when the price increases the quantity demanded should decrease. We note that
there are other non-price pathways from taxes to changes in tobacco product use. For instance, taxes may signal to
consumers that the taxed product is unsafe. This phenomenon has been documented in other health behavior
contexts, for example soda taxes. See an excellent discussion of this issue by Gostin (2017). We are not able to
distinguish between these alternative mechanisms. However, at the market level both predict that consumption
should decline following a tax hike.

                                                         8
differently, if taxing both products enhances the effectiveness of either tax, then policymakers

should consider developing tobacco control strategies that incorporate both policies. On the

other hand, if taxing one product mutes the effectiveness of the alternative tax, then

policymakers may wish to consider adopting just one tax to maximize the social objective (e.g.,

reducing smoking within the population).

3. Data

         We use data for the period 2011 to 2017 from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance

System (BRFSS) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). 9 These data sources are

used by the U.S. federal government to track health behaviors such as vaping and smoking, and

are commonly used by health economists (Barbaresco, Courtemanche, and Qi 2015, Miller and

Wherry 2017, Horn, Maclean, and Strain 2017, Pesko 2014). We use geocoded versions of the

BRFSS and NHIS available through federal statistical research data centers. Thus, we have

access to granular geographic information not available in the public use files which allows us to

accurately study sub-state taxes.

         We combine these two data sources to maximize data on e-cigarette use, which have only

recently been added to national surveys. We note that combing data sets in this manner is not

uncommon within economics (Maclean, Tello-Trillo, and Webber 2019, Webber 2016, Farber et

al. 2018, Altonji, Kahn, and Speer 2016, Miller 2012). The BRFSS surveys over 400,000 adults

annually and the NHIS surveys approximately 33,000 adults annually as part of its adult sample,

which is the module in which e-cigarette information is queried. Traditional cigarette use and e-


9
  We begin our study period in 2011 due to a change in the BRFSS survey frame. Prior to 2011, the BRFSS, which
is a telephone survey, only conducted surveys on landlines. Beginning in 2011, cellphones were added to the survey
frame to better capture a population that represented the U.S. This change lead to a compositional shift in survey
respondents and thus we follow CDC recommendations and do not combine pre- and post-2011 data. In addition,
the focus on relatively recent years also enables us to isolate the period in which e-cigarettes were widely available
in U.S. tobacco product markets, which is our main contribution to the traditional cigarette tax elasticity literature.

                                                          9
cigarette questions are available in both data sources. To measure traditional cigarette use,

respondents are first asked if they have smoked at least 100 traditional cigarettes in their lifetime,

and if so, if they now smoke every day, some days, or not at all. E-cigarette questions were

added to the BRFSS in 2016 and were added to the NHIS in 2014. In both data sources,

respondents are asked if they have ever used e-cigarettes and if so, if they now use e-cigarettes

every day, some days, or not at all.

       We make two sample restrictions. First, we exclude individuals ages 18 to 20 to avoid

confounding from Tobacco 21 laws that were being enacted during this time period (Winickoff,

Gottlieb, and Mello 2014). Second, we drop the state of Alaska because of limited geographical

information, even in the restricted versions of these files that we use; full details are available on

request. Relatedly, the years of data differ across our smoking and vaping outcomes based on

data availability in the BRFSS and NHIS. We use 2011 to 2017 for our smoking outcomes in

both data sources. For our vaping outcomes, we use 2014 to 2017 in the NHIS and 2016 to 2017

in the BRFSS; these are the years for which we have vaping information.

       We create harmonized demographic variables across the two data sources, which we

include in our empirical models. More specifically, we include the following individual-level

control variables in our regressions: sex (female and male), education (less than high school,

high school or graduate education development [GED], some college, and college or more, and

missing), race (white, black, Asian, Native American/Alaskan Native, other, and missing),

marital status (married, divorced, widowed, separated, never married, and missing), age, health

insurance status (insured, not insured, and missing), employment (currently employed, not

currently employed, and missing), and income.




                                                  10
       While most variables in the data sources are very similar, an exception is income

information. In particular, BRFSS collects household income while NHIS collects personal

income. We account for this difference in the following manner. Separately for each data

source, we convert the categories into a pseudo-continuous variable and then impute missing

values using state-year means. We control for the differences in income across data source by

interacting the harmonized income variable with an indicator for data source. We also control

for separate indicators for the top income category, the amounts of which vary across the data

sources. Our results are insensitive to including/excluding income as a control variable;

regression results without income as a control are not shown but are available on request.

       We obtain dates of state cigarette excise tax changes from the Centers for Disease

Control and Prevention (2019). We also obtain sub-state traditional cigarette excise tax changes

affecting localities with 100,000 people or more using proprietary data obtained from the

American Non-Smokers Rights Foundation. Effective dates of e-cigarette taxes are collected

from the CDC State System (2019) and the Vapor Products Tax Data Center (2018).

       Appendix Table 1 provides a list of the localities that changed their traditional cigarette

tax rate between 2011 and 2017, and Appendix Table 2 lists localities that levied an e-cigarette

tax by the end of 2017. Figures 1 and 2 depict these taxes graphically, and Figures 3 and 4 report

the number of traditional cigarette changes and e-cigarette tax adoptions in each year of our

study period. While there is some clustering of higher traditional cigarette taxes in the West and

the Northeast, we do have reasonable variation in these taxes across the country. In terms of e-

cigarette tax adoption, there is no obvious clustering in specific geographic areas and we observe

adopting localities in all four regions of the country. Traditional cigarette tax changes are




                                                 11
relatively homogenous across years while e-cigarette tax adoptions are more concentrated in the

latter half of the study period.

        While traditional cigarette excise taxes are standardized across localities (i.e., a dollar

value per pack of 20 traditional cigarettes), localities levy e-cigarette taxes in different ways. Of

these 11 localities levying an e-cigarette tax through by the end of 2017, five use an ad valorem

tax on the wholesaler, five use an excise tax, and one uses a sales tax. 10 Given the difficulty of

comparing the magnitudes of these different types of taxes, in our regression models we simply

use an indicator for whether or not a locality has levied an e-cigarette tax. We note this variable

construction as a limitation of the study.

        We also control for several time-varying area-level factors in our regression models:

county-level percent of the population covered by indoor vaping restrictions in bars, restaurants,

and private workplaces (Cooper and Pesko 2017); state-level bans on smoking in restaurants,

private workplaces, or bars (separate indicators) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

2019); beer taxes (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism 2019); medical

marijuana laws (Sabia and Nguyen 2018); marijuana decriminalization laws (Pacula, Chriqui,

and King 2003); 11 prescription drug monitoring programs (Ali et al. 2017); Affordable Care Act

Medicaid expansion status (Maclean, Pesko, and Hill 2019); and unemployment rates

(University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research 2019). All monetary values are Consumer

Price Index (CPI)-adjusted to 2010 dollars. We link area-level variables to the combined BRFSS

and NHIS data set using year/quarter and county/state information available in both data sources.




10
   Both Chicago and Cook County have adopted an e-cigarette tax. We assume that the earlier tax in Chicago affects
all of Cook County, since we cannot separate Chicago residents from the rest of Cook County in our data.

   We thank Rosalie Pacula for sharing an updated version of the marijuana decriminalization variable with us.

        Descriptive statistics for both data sources combined are presented in Table 1, and

separately for the BRFSS and the NHIS in Appendix Tables 3 and 4 respectively. For each

table, variable means are presented separately for all respondents, respondents residing in

localities that have levied an e-cigarette tax by the end of 2017, and respondents residing in

localities that have not levied such a tax by the end of 2017. Overall, 15.8% of respondents use

traditional cigarettes, 11.4% of respondents use traditional cigarettes daily, 3.1% of respondents

currently use e-cigarettes, and 1.1% currently use e-cigarettes every day. The average traditional

cigarette excise tax rate is $1.45 per pack and the share of respondents residing in a locality that

had adopted an e-cigarette tax by 2017 is 6.3%.

        Among respondents residing in localities adopting an e-cigarette tax, current traditional

cigarette use is 0.1 percentage points (‘ppts’) higher and current e-cigarette use is 0.2 ppts lower

than use rates among respondents residing in localities not adopting such a tax. Localities

adopting e-cigarettes taxes are more racially/ethnically diverse, younger, and lower income that

non-adopting localities. The localities adopting e-cigarette taxes also have lower traditional

cigarette and beer taxes and more restrictions on marijuana use (both recreational and medical)

While there are some differences in policies and demographics across groups, they do not appear

to be substantial. Moreover, we control for these differences in all regression models.

4. Methods

        We estimate differences-in-difference (DD) regression-style models. Specifically, we

estimate the regression model outlined in Equation (1):

(1)     𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 = 𝑎𝑎 + 𝛽𝛽𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 + 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 + 𝑍𝑍𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 ∅ + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 𝜃𝜃 + ɣ𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠 + 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡

i indexes an individual interviewed in year-quarter t, who resides in county c of state s. 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 is

an indicator for whether the individual smokes, smokes every day, vapes, or vapes every day.


                                                                         13
𝑍𝑍𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 includes the time-varying state- or county-level policies. 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 includes demographics, an

indicator for whether the observation was surveyed in the BRFSS or the NHIS, and an

interaction between data source and income. We control for county fixed effects (ɣ𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠 ), which

mitigate potential bias from time-invariant, county-specific factors. Note that county fixed

effects incorporate state fixed effects. Including these fixed effects allows us to leverage within

locality (county or state) variation in tobacco and e-cigarette taxes for identification of treatment

effects. We also control for year-quarter fixed effects (𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 ) that account for time varying factors

affecting the nation as a whole, such as the general decline in smoking and sharp increase in the

popularity of e-cigarettes that occurred over our study period.

        𝛽𝛽 and 𝜕𝜕 are our primary coefficients of interest and capture the effect of tobacco and e-

cigarette taxes on our outcomes. We expect own-taxes will reduce current use of these products,

but the cross-tax effects are a-priori ambiguous. Cross-tax effects will be positive if the goods

are substitutes, negative if the goods are complements, and zero if the goods are unrelated. As

discussed in Section 2, the literature has not yet reached consensus on whether these products are

complements or substitutes among adults, although most studies to date suggest substitution.

        A necessary assumption for the DD model to recover causal estimates is that the

treatment (i.e., localities changing traditional cigarette taxes or adopting e-cigarette taxes) and

the comparison (i.e., localities not changing traditional cigarette taxes or adopting e-cigarette

taxes) groups would have followed the same trend in the post-treatment period had the treatment

localities not been treated (i.e., not changing the traditional cigarette tax or adopting an e-

cigarette tax). This assumption is referred to as ‘parallel trends.’ Clearly this assumption is

untestable as treated localities were treated in the post-period, preventing us from observing

counterfactual trends. Instead, we follow the economics literature and provide suggestive


                                                     14
evidence on whether the parallel trends assumption is satisfied in our data by modifying

Equation (1) to conduct an event study (Autor 2003).

         To implement the event study, we replace the traditional cigarette tax rate with an

indicator variable for if the traditional cigarette tax increased by $0.50 or more at any point

during the study period following; we refer to such a change as a ‘large’ traditional cigarette tax

increase (Callison and Kaestner 2014).12 For both the large traditional cigarette tax increase and

e-cigarette tax adoption variables, we create mutually exclusive policy lead variables for >2

years in advance and 2 to >1 year in advance of the tax. We include one lag indicator for the

post period. The omitted category is the year prior to the tax adopting (1 to >0 years). 13 We

code all non-adopting localities as zero for all event-time indicators (Lovenheim 2009). All

other variables are as defined in Equation (1). If the policy lead coefficients are small in

magnitude and statistically indistinguishable from zero, this pattern of results suggests that there

were no changes in smoking or vaping prior to adoption of the policy. Such results can be

interpreted as providing suggestive evidence that a covariate-adjusted version of the parallel

trends assumption is met and that our DD models can recover causal estimates.

         To further assess the validity of our design, we follow Pei, Pischke, and Schwandt (2018)

and test for balance across treatment and comparison groups by separately regressing traditional

cigarette and e-cigarette taxes on all covariates in Equation (1); we aggregate demographic

variables to the county-level. If the covariates are uncorrelated with our tax variables, we can




12
   Eleven states passed a cigarette excise tax increase of ≥ $0.50 during the study period and no states passed more
than two such increases. Due to local taxes, both Cook County and Philadelphia County had more than one $0.50
excise tax increase, in which case we study trends prior to the first large increase.
13
   We exclude three states (Illinois, Massachusetts, and Minnesota) that passed large cigarette tax increases between
2011 and 2013 to ensure that our policy lead coefficients are not reflecting any compositional effects in the
population of tobacco product users. This exclusion also removes the only locality passing an early e-cigarette tax
and is therefore a treated control (Minnesota passed an e-cigarette tax in 2010, prior to our study period).

                                                         15
interpret this finding as providing suggestive evidence that treatment and comparison groups are

conditionally balanced and that our data satisfy the conditional independence assumption (CIA).

        We also test whether the adoption of an e-cigarette tax alters traditional cigarette tax

responsiveness. The relatively new availability of e-cigarettes offers smokers another option for

smoking cessation and recent clinical trial evidence suggests that e-cigarettes are an effective

option for some smokers (Hajek et al. 2019). Higher traditional cigarette taxes could therefore

result in a steeper decline in smoking if people that would otherwise not quit in the absence of e-

cigarettes now do so, implying that traditional cigarette tax responsiveness may be larger in

more recent years as e-cigarettes have become more widely available and the potential of these

products as smoking cessation devices is better understood. On the other hand, e-cigarette taxes

could reduce the ability of individuals to purchase these products, therefore restricting smoking

cessation opportunities, leading to a smaller traditional cigarette own-tax elasticity. To explore

this hypothesis, we estimate a version of Equation (1) that includes an interaction between the

traditional cigarette tax rate and e-cigarette tax adoption variables. As documented in Appendix

Tables 1 and 2, most of the localities adopting an e-cigarette tax also implemented changes to

their traditional cigarette tax rate during the study period, providing useful variation to explore

the effect of traditional cigarette taxes in localities with and without an e-cigarette tax.

        We estimate unweighted linear probability models. We cluster standard errors at the

level of the state (Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan 2004); we use both county- and state-level

variation in taxes and thus the most appropriate level at which to cluster is unclear. In

unreported analyses, we have clustered at the level of the county and results are similar.




                                                  16
5. Results

5.1 Effects of traditional cigarette and e-cigarette taxes on adult tobacco product use

        Our main DD results are reported in Table 2 for all individuals in both data sources. We

also report results generated in the BFRSS only (Table 3) and the NHIS only (Table 4). A $1

increase in the traditional cigarette tax reduces current traditional cigarette use by 0.3 ppts and

everyday traditional cigarette use by 0.4 ppts, which represents a 1.9% and 3.5% reduction

compared to the smoking rates in the sample. Given a mean traditional cigarette state excise tax

rate of $1.45, these estimates imply a modest own-tax elasticity of demand of -0.03 for current

smoking and -0.05 for daily smoking. Our modest tax elasticity estimates are in line with

Callison and Kaestner (2014) who report elasticities of -0.03 to -0.06. We note, however, that

our elasticities are lower than other recent estimates of -0.15 to -0.18 (Cotti, Nesson, and Tefft

2016, Nesson 2017, Bishop 2018). In sum, we do not find evidence that traditional cigarette tax

responsiveness is greater as e-cigarettes have become more available.

        A $1 traditional cigarette excise tax increase also increases current vaping by 0.3 ppts

(9.7% of the mean) and everyday vaping by 0.1 ppts (9.1% of the mean), suggesting that the two

products are economic substitutes. We do not find any statistically significant evidence that e-

cigarette taxes influence traditional cigarette use, however. These findings depart from previous

work using scanner data (see Section 2). We suspect that we are potentially under-powered to

detect these effects. For instance, five times more people report current smoking than current

vaping in our data, which implies that the vaping market is much smaller. All else equal, the

researcher is more likely to detect statistically significant effects of a tax change when the market

is larger, 14 which could explain why we were able to measure statistically significant increases in


14
  As an illustrative example, imagine a hypothetical market in which 50% of individuals purchase product A and
10% of individuals purchase closely related product B. Further, the cross-tax elasticity of demand for both products

                                                         17
the effect of cigarette taxes on e-cigarette use but not the reverse. We suspect that, over time

given current trends in e-cigarette use, the market size will increase and future studies will

provide more insight on this question. Nonetheless, given the regulatory action on the part of

numerous localities across the U.S., providing an early evaluation of e-cigarette taxation effects

is important and useful.

         Adoption of an e-cigarette tax leads to a 0.2 ppts (6.5% of the mean) reduction in vaping,

but this estimate is not statistically significant. However, in looking strictly at the BRFSS data in

Table 3, we find that adoption of an e-cigarette tax reduces current e-cigarette use by 0.3 ppts

(9.7% of the mean) and this estimate is statistically distinguishable from zero. The NHIS data in

Table 4 suggests a 0.2 ppt decrease in e-cigarette use (6.5% of the mean), which is nearly

identical in magnitude to what we observe in the BRFSS, although like in our combined sample

this estimate is not statistically significant.

         While we cannot fully explore why estimates are more precise in the BRFSS than in the

combined BRFSS and NHIS or NHIS datasets, one possibility is that the data sources use

somewhat different sources of variation. E-cigarette questions were added to BRFSS in 2016

and NHIS in 2014. Later e-cigarette taxes (and changes in these taxes for early adopters, since

several early adopters later changed the rate) could plausibly have been more impactful than

earlier taxes. Appendix Table 2 provides some suggestive support for this hypothesis. Several

tax changes contribute to the identifying variation in the NHIS sample years but not the BRFSS

sample years, including those in Washington, DC; Montgomery County, Maryland; Louisiana;

and North Carolina. The e-cigarette taxes levied by these early adopters appears smaller than



is 0.1. A 10% increase in the taxes of product A would therefore increase consumption of product B by five ppts
(50%), whereas a 10% increase in the taxes of product B would increase consumption of product A by only one ppt
(2%). Therefore, it is much easier in this illustrative case to detect statistically significant product A cross-tax
effects than product B cross-tax effects.

                                                         18
taxes levied by later adopting localities, in particular the $0.05 excise taxes per fluid milliliter in

Louisiana and North Carolina is smaller than all subsequently enacted initial excise tax levels.

        The results in Table 4 (which rely exclusively on the NHIS) suggests larger effects of

taxes on traditional cigarette use. For example, a $1 increase in traditional cigarette taxes

reduces current traditional cigarette use by 0.8 ppts (4.5% of the mean) and daily traditional

cigarette use by 0.7 ppts (5.2% of the mean). Adoption of an e-cigarette tax increases current

traditional cigarette use by 0.4 ppts (2.3% of the mean). While this final result is not statistically

significant, the point estimate suggests substitution. However, these taxes have little effect on e-

cigarette use in the NHIS data.

5.2 Internal validity of the research design

        In Table 5 we report estimates and associated standard errors for our tobacco and e-

cigarette use outcomes generated using our event study. The reference period is the year

immediately prior to adoption of a large traditional cigarette tax increase and adoption of an e-

cigarette tax. For both the large traditional cigarette tax and e-cigarette tax adoption leads,

coefficient estimates are statistically indistinguishable from zero and small in magnitude. We

interpret these null findings to suggest that our data are potentially able to satisfy a covariate-

adjusted version of the parallel trends assumption.

        Compared to the year immediately prior to a large traditional cigarette excise tax

adoption, such an increase in this tax reduces everyday traditional cigarette use by 0.3 ppts (2.6%

of the mean) and increases current vaping by 0.4 ppts (12.9% of the mean). We note that we lose

precision for some of our lag estimates (vs. estimates generated in our DD-style model). We

attribute the precision loss to the fact that event studies are more data hungry than DD-style

models. Reassuringly, the overall pattern of results is comparable across the two specifications.



                                                  19
       We also assess the ability of our data to satisfy the CIA by following Pei, Pischke, and

Schwandt (2018) and regressing both taxes on all other right hand side variables. In results not

shown, but available on request, we observe that demographics do not predict cigarette tax rates

or e-cigarette tax adoption, suggesting that individuals do not migrate in observable ways in

response to changes in tobacco taxation. Tobacco control policies and medical marijuana laws

do predict the traditional cigarette tax rate. Given that these policies all attempt to regulate

addictive substances, the observed correlations may reflect overall strategies adopted by

localities to reduce substance use. Under the hypothesis of an overall strategy adopted by a

locality, these correlations are potentially not unexpected. In terms of e-cigarette adoption, only

the traditional cigarette rate predicts this outcome, which plausibly reflects localities adopting

broader tobacco control efforts to reduce nicotine consumption (Maclean et al. 2018). We

acknowledge that our data display some evidence of policy imbalance, in particular in terms of

regulation of related goods, but we are able to control for all variables in our regression models.

5.3 Heterogeneity in tax effects on adult tobacco product use

       In Tables 6 to 8, we explore if subgroups differ in responsiveness to these taxes. Given

differences in use of these products (Wang et al. 2018) and perceptions regarding their health

harms (Glasser et al. 2017), tax responsiveness may also vary. For both men and adults less than

35 years of age, we document similar traditional cigarette tax effects. Among men, a $1 increase

in the traditional cigarette tax reduces current and daily smoking by 0.6 ppts; 3.4% and 4.8% of

the respective means. A $1 increase in this tax reduces current and daily smoking among adults

under 35 years by 0.5 ppts (2.3% of the mean) and 0.6 ppts (4.1% of the mean). This tax hike

also increases current and daily vaping among men by 0.5 ppts (13.9% of the mean) and 0.2 ppts

(15.4% of the mean). E-cigarette tax adoption reduces current vaping by 0.5 ppts among men



                                                  20
which corresponds to 13.9% of the mean. Women do not appear to change their smoking or

vaping patterns following traditional cigarette tax rate changes or e-cigarette tax adoption.

5.4 Interactions between traditional cigarette and e-cigarette taxes

        In Table 9 and 10, we report results from our interactive model (i.e., interacting the

traditional cigarette tax with an indicator for e-cigarette tax adoption). This specification allows

us to explore if e-cigarette tax adoption alters traditional cigarette tax responsiveness by reducing

the financial incentive to use a popular alternative nicotine product that can be used for smoking

cessation purposes (i.e., e-cigarettes). We explore the effect on both current and daily traditional

cigarette use, for all respondents and by subgroups defined by sex and age.

        The traditional cigarette tax main effect captures traditional cigarette tax responsiveness

in the absence of an e-cigarette tax. Summing the traditional cigarette tax coefficient and the

interaction coefficient estimates reveals traditional cigarette tax responsiveness in the presence of

an e-cigarette tax. If the interaction coefficient estimate is positive, this pattern of results can be

interpreted to imply that a traditional cigarette tax hike reduces traditional cigarette use to a

lesser degree than if the e-cigarette tax had not been adopted.

        For current traditional cigarette use in Table 9, the interaction term is positive for all

groups, although only reaching statistical significance for males. For everyday traditional

cigarette use in Table 10, the coefficient estimate on the interaction term is statistically

significant and positive for all groups. These results collectively suggest that adoption of an e-

cigarette tax dilutes traditional cigarette tax responsiveness. For example, the ratio of the

traditional cigarette tax main effect coefficient estimate to the interaction term coefficient

estimate, for daily smoking among all respondents, suggests that e-cigarette tax adoption reduces

approximately two-thirds of the effect that traditional cigarette taxes would have on daily



                                                  21
smoking absent an e-cigarette tax. However, the e-cigarette tax main effect is negative and

roughly the same magnitude as the interaction coefficient. This finding suggests that only once

the traditional cigarette excise tax exceeds $1 does an e-cigarette tax begin to reduce traditional

cigarette tax responsiveness.

6. Discussion

       In this paper, we provide the first evidence on the effects of traditional cigarette taxes on

traditional cigarette use and e-cigarette use in a time period when e-cigarettes were widely

available in tobacco markets, and the effects of e-cigarette taxes on these outcomes. To do so,

we combine data from two large-scale survey datasets, BRFSS and NHIS, and detailed

information on state and county traditional cigarette and e-cigarette taxes with a differences-in-

differences design. Overall, we observe that, as has been documented in previous studies

estimating traditional cigarette demand equations, smoking declines when traditional cigarette

tax rates increase. We also find evidence that adults are more likely to use e-cigarettes when

traditional cigarette taxes rise, which mirrors evidence from retail sales data using variation in e-

cigarette prices (Zheng et al. 2017, Stoklosa, Drope, and Chaloupka 2016). We observe some

evidence that adoption of an e-cigarette tax reduces vaping, but this finding is somewhat

sensitive to sample definition and sub-group. In particular, evidence gleaned from the BRFSS

only suggests that e-cigarette use propensity declines post-e-cigarette tax adoption, but not in our

combined data set or the NHIS in isolation. Regardless of the data source, we observe that men

reduce their e-cigarette use following an e-cigarette tax adoption. Finally, traditional cigarette

taxes appear to be less effective – in terms of reducing smoking – when a locality has also

adopted an e-cigarette tax.




                                                 22
       The finding that e-cigarette adoption appears to dilute the effectiveness of traditional

cigarette taxes, a standard policy lever used to reduce smoking, is important from both an

economic and a practical standpoint. We hypothesize that adoption of an e-cigarette tax

increases the price of a potential smoking cessation device (Hajek et al. 2019), which dissuades

some smokers from attempting to quit or reduce smoking by taking up vaping in response to a

traditional cigarette tax increase. Indeed, traditional smoking cessation devices (e.g., Food and

Drug Administration-approved nicotine replacement therapies such as Zyban, Chantix, or

Nicotrol) are expensive (Maclean, Pesko, and Hill 2019), particularly without insurance, and

may not be feasible for smokers, who are on average lower-income (Remler 2004). Moreover, e-

cigarettes are perceived as effective smoking cessation devices, and more effective than

traditional smoking cessation options among some groups of smokers (Glasser et al. 2017,

Harrell et al. 2014). Therefore, when the price of e-cigarettes is increased following adopting of

a tax, smokers may be less likely to attempt smoking cessation (Saffer et al. 2018) or smoking

reduction. Overall, without speaking to specific pathways, this finding suggests that the

combination of a traditional cigarette tax hike and e-cigarette tax prevents smokers for either

quitting or switching to a less harmful product, both actions would improve smoker health by

minimizing exposure to carcinogens and other toxins contained in traditional cigarettes.

       From the perspective of the policymaker, understanding policy interactions is important

for developing the effective strategies to achieve social goals. Previous economic studies have,

for example, documented policy spillovers in the context of Medicaid (Burns and Dague 2017),

minimum wages (Page, Spetz, and Millar 2005), workers compensation (McInerney and Simon

2012), and medical marijuana laws (Bradford and Bradford 2018). Failure to consider such

potential spillovers can lead to sub-optimal policies.



                                                 23
       We suspect that our focus on (primarily) the extensive margins of traditional cigarette

and e-cigarette use likely leads us to understate the tax effects. That is, following a traditional

cigarette tax hike or adoption of an e-cigarette tax, some individuals may reduce the quantity

demanded on the intensive margin (e.g., number of traditional cigarettes smoked or e-cigarettes

vaped per day) but not quit completely. While we do examine daily smoking and vaping, we are

unable to fully capture this margin given information available in both data sources.

       We note that our findings depart from a seminal and related study by Cotti, Nesson, and

Tefft (2018). Whereas we document that traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes are economic

substitutes, Cotti, Nesson, and Tefft (2018) provide evidence of complementarity between the

two products. While our data will not allow us to fully explore differences in findings, we can

propose potential hypotheses.

       First, Cotti, Nesson, and Tefft (2018) use data from 2011 to 2015 and we use data that

includes 2016 and 2017, in which nine additional localities increased their traditional cigarette

excise taxes; the states passing such taxes are: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Louisiana,

Minnesota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and West Virginia. The locations passing

traditional cigarette taxes in 2016 and 2017 are different from the locations passing such taxes

over the period 2011 to 2015. In particular, California is a treatment state in our study because

they enacted a cigarette tax increase in April, 2017, but California, a very large state with a

historically strong tobacco control program, was a control locality during the time period

investigated by Cotti, Nesson, and Tefft (2018).

       Second, there are important differences in measures of use captured by the survey data

compared to household purchases captured by the scanner data. In the scanner data, Cotti,

Nesson, and Tefft (2018) document that 9.5% of households report purchasing traditional



                                                  24
cigarettes over the last quarter, compared to 15.8% that report currently smoking in our survey

data. Thus, current smoking is 66% more common than household purchasing of traditional

cigarettes. One potential explanation for this difference is that smokers may cluster in the same

households, which would cause household purchasing rates to be smaller than individual use

rates. For example, Sterba et al. (2011) surveys partnered smokers who called a quitline; 54.1%

of callers report that their partner also smokes. Another potential explanation is that some

individuals may use e-cigarettes without purchasing them (e.g., ‘bumming’). Further, in the

scanner data, only 0.3% of households report purchasing e-cigarettes while we estimate a current

vaping rate of 3.1% using survey data. Thus, our vaping use rate is ten times the household

purchase rate estimated by Cotti, Nesson, and Tefft (2018) and likely well outside the range that

could be explained by clustering of people that vape in the same household. One remaining

potential explanation is that individuals may be much more likely to ‘bum’ e-cigarettes than

traditional cigarettes; for example, by sharing a communal vaping device such as a tank system.

Therefore, these differences between use measures captured in our data and household purchases

captured in retail data may also contribute to differences in our findings.

       Our study has limitations. First, because e-cigarette questions have only recently been

added to large-scale health surveys, we have limited data on e-cigarette use. Second, while we

can measure daily smoking and vaping, we cannot – due to information collected in our data

sources – fully examine effects on the extensive margin of tobacco product use. As noted earlier,

this data feature likely leads us to understate tax effects. Third, we rely on self-reported

traditional cigarette and e-cigarette use which may be measured with some error. Fourth, due to

substantial heterogeneity in the manner in which localities have adopted e-cigarette taxes, and no

obvious way to standardize these taxes, we include an indicator for a tax rather than a tax rate as



                                                 25
is common in economic analyses of traditional cigarettes. Finally, we note that our data sources

are not representative at the level of treatment for all traditional cigarette tax changes and e-

cigarette tax adoptions that occurred during our study period. For example, some of the policy

changes we leverage occurred at the sub-state level (city or county) and our data sources are not

representative at that level, which can lead to empirical issues (Maclean, Tello-Trillo, and

Webber 2019). We believe that our ability to combine two large data sources may mitigate this

issue, but acknowledge that ideally we would have access to data that is representative at the

level of treatment for all included localities.

        Our research contributes further evidence from differences-in-differences methods that

regulating e-cigarettes have the unintended consequence of raising traditional cigarette use;

while neither product is harmless, the clinical literature strongly suggests that e-cigarettes are the

less harmful product. With few exceptions (Abouk and Adams 2017, Cotti, Nesson, and Tefft

2018), this finding has been documented for youth (Dave, Feng, and Pesko 2019, Pesko, Hughes,

and Faisal 2016, Pesko and Currie 2019, Friedman 2015), pregnant women (Cooper and Pesko

2017, Pesko and Currie 2019), and now for the first time adults. These results suggest caution in

regulating e-cigarettes because they may increase smoking of traditional cigarettes.
