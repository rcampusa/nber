                                         ABSTRACT

We investigate the strength of the Penn effect in the most recent version of the Penn World
Tables (PWTs). We find that the earlier findings of a Penn effect are confirmed, but that there is
some evidence for nonlinearity. Developed and developing countries display different types of
nonlinear behaviors. The nonlinear behaviors are likely attributable to differences across
countries and do not change when additional control variables are added. We confirm earlier
findings of large RMB misalignment in the mid-2000’s, but find that by 2011, the RMB seems
near equilibrium. While the Penn effect is quite robust across datasets, estimated misalignment
can noticeably change from a linear to a nonlinear specification, and from dataset to dataset.

1.      Introduction


The issue of currency misalignment is a perennial one. As long as countries strive to
reallocate aggregate demand in their own favor, disputes will arise regarding the degree
to which currency values are “fair”. The problem, of course, is what constitutes such a
fair value; each different model yields its own valuation.


One key strand of methodologies involves the comparison of price levels as a means of
inferring the proper currency value. Absolute purchasing power parity is one particularly
simple, and particularly inappropriate, price criterion. After all, the proposition that
similar bundles of goods should be equally priced when denominated in a common
currency is one of the most frequently violated ones.


A more commonly used criterion is the Penn Effect. One of the most well-documented
empirical regularities in the international finance literature, the finding that the price
level is higher in countries with a higher per capita income is consistent with a variety of
theoretical frameworks, including a Balassa-Samuelson mechanism, and demand side
forces including a preference for nontradable goods at higher incomes (i.e., non-
homotheticity). 1


In this paper we seek to document whether indeed the Penn effect is as robust as is
typically conceived. In particular, testing for the Penn effect has been hampered by the
imprecision with which the price data are measured. This means that new versions of
the data set can lead to substantially different results. 2 Further, we investigate the
presence of a non-linear Penn effect; a quadratic link between income and real
exchange rate.


1
 The necessary conditions for demand side factors to matter are laid out in De Gregorio, et al. (1994).
2
 See Chen and Ravallion (2010) for discussion of how the estimated Penn effect various over the different
vintages of the International Comparison Project based data sets. Estimates of misalignment also vary
depending on vintage, as shown by Cheung, et al. (2007).

                                                   1
To anticipate our results, we find that the elasticity of the relative price level to per
capita income is fairly consistently estimated, across data sets. However, there is some
evidence that the relationship is nonlinear; a statistically significant quadratic term,
implying a U-shaped relationship, is estimated.


The nature of the nonlinearity displayed by the developed and developing economies
differs. For the developed economies, the quadratic term implies an inverted U-shaped
relationship between real exchange rate and income. The developing economies, on the
other hand, display a U-shaped relationship. Additional analyses suggest that the
nonlinearity is likely driven by variation across countries rather than by variation within
a country. The estimated quadratic term is robust to the addition of select economic
covariates in the regressions.


The inclusion of a significant quadratic term, unsurprisingly, has implications for the
magnitude of the estimated degree of misalignment. We focus on the example of China
as a means of highlighting the point. In terms of the Chinese currency – the renminbi
(RMB), it appears that the RMB was fairly valued by 2011. In contrast, the RMB’s value
was undervalued in 2005, and overvalued in 2014 if, for instance, one uses a one
standard error threshold, not so if one uses a conventional two standard error
convention. Hence, depending on one’s perspective regarding the proper significance
level to apply to policy questions, the deviation was statistically significant (Frankel,
2006) or not (Cheung et al., 2007).


2.     Background


At the heart of the debate over the right way of determining the appropriate exchange
rate level are contrasting ideas of what constitutes an equilibrium exchange rate, what




                                              2
time frame the equilibrium condition pertains to, and, not least, what econometric
method to implement.


Most of the extant studies fall into some familiar categories, either relying upon some
form of relative purchasing power parity (PPP) or cost competitiveness calculation, the
modeling of deviations from absolute PPP, a composite model incorporating several
channels of effects (sometimes called behavioral equilibrium exchange rate models), or
flow equilibrium models. These alternative approaches are reviewed in, for example,
Cheung et al. (2007, 2010a).


In this study, we appeal to a simple, and apparently robust, relationship between the
real exchange rate and per capita income. We then elaborate the analysis by stratifying
the data by level of income, and by adding in other variables that might alter one’s
assessment of the fundamental equilibrium level of the exchange rate. 3


First, we consider the basic framework of analysis. Consider the law of one price, which
states that the price of a single good should be equalized in common currency terms
(expressed in logs):


          pi ,t = st + pi*,t                                                                        (1)



where st is the log exchange rate, pi ,t is the log price of good i at time t, and the

asterisk denotes the foreign country variable. Summing over all goods, and assuming the
weights associated with each good are the same in both the home country and foreign
country basket, one then obtains the absolute purchasing power parity condition:


          pt = st + pt*                                                                             (2)

3
 Dunaway, et al. (2009) conduct an extensive analysis, highlighting the sensitivity of the results to
differing assumptions.

                                                      3
where for simplicity assume p is a arithmetic average of individual log prices. As is well
known, if the weights differ between home and foreign country baskets (let’s say
production bundles), then even if the law of one price holds, absolute purchasing power
parity need not hold.


The “price level” variable in the PWTs (Summers and Heston, 1991), and other
purchasing power parity exchange rates, attempt to circumvent this problem by using
prices (not price indices) of goods, and calculating the aggregate price level using the
same weights. Assume for the moment that this can be accomplished, but that some
share of the basket (α) is nontradable (denoted by N subscript), and the remainder is
tradable (denoted by T subscript). Then:


          pt = αp N ,t + (1 − α ) pT ,t                                                                       (3)


By simple manipulation, one finds that the “relative price level” is given by (the inverse
of the real exchange rate, conventionally defined):


         rt ≡ −( st − pt + pt* ) = −( st − pT ,t + pT* ,t ) + α [ p N ,t − pT ,t ] + α [ p *N ,t − pT* ,t ]   (4)


Rewriting, and indicating the first term in (parentheses), the intercountry price of
tradables, as rT ,t and the intercountry relative price of nontradables as ωt ≡

[ pN ,t − pT ,t ] − [ p*N ,t − pT* ,t ] , leads to the following rewriting of (4):



         rt = rT ,t + αωt                                                                                     (4’)


This expression indicates that the real price level can rise as changes occur in the
relative price of traded goods between countries, or as the relative price of


                                                            4
nontradables rises in one country, relative to another. In principle, economic factors can
affect one or both.


Most models of the real exchange rate can be categorized according to which specific
relative price serves as the object of focus. If the relative price of nontradables is key,
then the resulting models – in a small country context – have been termed “dependent
economy” (Salter, 1959, and Swan, 1960) or “Scandinavian” model. In the former case,
demand side factors drive shifts in the relative price of nontradables. In the latter,
productivity levels and the nominal exchange rate determine the nominal wage rate,
and hence the price level and the relative price of nontradables. In this latter context,
the real exchange rate is a function of productivity (Krueger, 1983: 157). Consequently,
the two sets of models both focus on the relative nontradables price, but differ in their
focus on the source of shifts in this relative price. Since the home economy is small
relative to the world economy (hence, one is working with a one-country model), the
tradable price is pinned down by the rest-of-the-world supply of traded goods. Hence,
the “real exchange rate” in this case is (pN-pT).


By far dominant in this category are those that center on the relative price of
nontradables. These include the specifications based on the approaches of Balassa
(1964) and Samuelson (1964) that model the relative price of nontradables as a function
of sectoral productivity differentials, including Hsieh (1982), Canzoneri, Cumby and Diba
(1999), and Chinn (2000a). They also include those approaches that include demand side
determinants of the relative price, such as that of DeGregorio, Giovannini and Wolf
(1994). They observe that if consumption preferences are not homothetic and factors
are not perfectly free to move intersectorally, changes in per capita income may result
shifts in the relative price of nontradables.


This perspective provides the key rationale for the well-known positive cross-sectional
relationship between relative price level and relative per capita income levels. We


                                                5
exploit this relationship to determine whether the Chinese currency is undervalued.
Obviously, this approach is not novel; it has earlier been implemented by Frankel (2006)
and Coudert and Couharde (2007). However, we will expand this approach along several
dimensions. First, we augment the approach by incorporating the time series
dimension. 4 Second, we consider both linear and quadratic income effects. Third, we
explicitly characterize the uncertainty surrounding our determinations of currency
misalignment. Fourth, we examine the stability of the relative price and relative per
capita income relationship using a) subsamples of certain country groups and time
periods, and b) control variables.


It is important to clarify the nature of “equilibrium” we are associating with our measure
of the “normal” exchange rate level. Theoretically, the equilibrium exchange rate in the
Balassa-Samuelson approach is the one that is consistent with both internal and
external balances. In reality, however, the co-existence of internal and external balances
is not guaranteed. Thus, the estimated exchange rate measure is properly interpreted as
a long-run measure and is ill-suited (on its own) to analyzing short run phenomena. 5


3.      Data and Estimates


        3.1 Data


We rely upon price level and per capita income data, primarily derived from the PWT 8.1
(Feenstra, et al., 2013). The two most widely used sources in international
macroeconomics are PWTs and the World Development Indicators (WDI), both of which
are underpinned by the International Comparison Program (ICP). The ICP is a global
statistical enterprise involving 199 countries. The goal of the ICP is to provide

4
  Coudert and Couharde (2007) implement the absolute PPP regression on a cross-section, while their
panel estimation relies upon estimating the relationship between the relative price level to the relative
tradables to nontradables price index.
5
  Frankel (2006) discusses whether one can speak of an “equilibrium exchange rate” when there is more
than one sector to consider.

                                                    6
comparable data on the level of GDP and its components across countries. It specifically
aims to provide estimates of PPP. The PWT8.1 and the most recent WDI are based on
ICP 2011, which involved 177 participating economies (World Bank, 2015). However,
PWT and WDI differ in numerous ways. Basically, WDI adheres closely to the
methodology adopted by ICP. 6 The differences between the two sources suggest that
users should keep cautious when trying to draw conclusions from either source (Ram
and Ural, 2014). Consequently, we compare the results derived from PWT8.1 with the
results from WDI and also PWT7.0 as robustness checks.


As noted by Feenstra et al. (2013), for over four decades, various incarnations of the
PWTs have provided information regarding GDP and its components in a manner that
can be compared over across countries, and over time. In principle, the price of the
same bundle of goods and services is reported. Our basic dataset encompasses 158
countries over the 1970 – 2011 period. 7


We estimate the Penn Effect relationship between the national price level (where the
US level is normalized to 1) and the relative per capita income ratio (US to country I to
the US). Note that, under the ICP nomenclature, the national price level refers to a
relative price, which is the inverse of the real exchange rate. We, for brevity, also call it
price level. The regression equation can be represented by equation (5):


𝑟𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑦𝑖,𝑡 + 𝑢𝑖,𝑡                                                               (5)



6
  PWT uses the Geary-Khamis (GK) procedure to go from the basic heading level to consumption and
investment and the GK procedure to combine these to total GDP, while WDI uses the GK procedure in
most regions and the Iklé-Dikhanov-Balk (IDB) procedure in Africa (Feenstra, et al., 2013). GK procedure
will tend to understate PPPs in poor countries and thus the prices it gets could be biased towards rich
country prices (Deaton and Heston, 2010).
7
  The PWT 8.1 covers 167 countries over the 1950 – 2011 period. For our analysis, we exclude small
countries and oil exporters with extreme values. We also take out countries that suffer from
hyperinflation. Including the extreme observations in the regressions does not change the results, which is
available upon request. Excluded countries include: Bahrain, Bermuda, Brunei, El Salvador, Equatorial
Guinea, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia in 1990, and Zimbabwe from 2008-2011.

                                                    7
where 𝑟 is the log national price level, and 𝑦 is per capita income relative to the United
States. Because of missing observations, the panel is unbalanced. We investigate a
variety of specifications, including allowing for fixed effects, nonlinearities, and
additional covariates.


          3.2 The Basic Bivariate Results


The full sample scatter plot is shown in Figure 1. A quick glance confirms, even the data
are quite dispersed, the positive relationship that has been repeatedly found in previous
studies. We first estimate the real exchange rate—income relationship using a pooled
time-series cross-section (OLS) regression. The results are reported in table 1. A pooled
OLS regression forces the intercepts across countries to be the same, and assumes that
the error term is distributed identically over the entire sample. Results of fixed effects
and random effects will be discussed in the next section.


The pooled OLS linear regression for the full sample yields a 0.24 estimate for the
elasticity of the price level with respect to per capita income, which is close to previous
studies’ estimate that ranges from 0.25 to 0.39 using WDI dataset (see Frankel 2006;
Cheung et al., 2007). This simple linear model explains 29 percent of the overall
variation of price level across countries and over time.


While there is a clear positive association between the price level and relative income,
it’s not so clear that it’s a linear relationship. Adding a quadratic term to the regression
yields:


                          2
𝑟𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑦𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝑦𝑖,𝑡 + 𝑢𝑖,𝑡 .                                                 (6)


The inclusion of the quadratic term improves the overall fit of the model, which
captures 35 percent of the variations of price level. The coefficients for the linear term


                                              8
and the quadratic term are 0.62 and 0.10 respectively, and are both statistically
significant. It suggests that relative price level falls initially and rises afterwards as per
capita income increases. The corresponding scatter plot with a quadratic fit that
provides a visual U-shaped fit with standard error bands is presented in Figure 2. This
non-monotonic relationship between price level and per capita income echoes results in
Hassan (forthcoming) and Subramanian and Kessler (2014). 8


Following Hassan, we also conduct a formal test for the presence of a U shape using the
test suggested by Lind and Mehlum (2009).9 The results indicate that absence of a U-
shaped relationship can be rejected at the 1 percent level. The extreme point is -3.25,
which matches Bangladesh’s relative per capita income in 2009. The results of the U-test
are reported in Table 1.


This finding of a U-shaped relationship is interesting. One potential explanation,
forwarded by Hassan (forthcoming), relies on the concept of structural transformation,
à la Chenery and Syrquin (1975). Since poor countries’ economies rely heavily on
agriculture, which is nontradable at the early stage of development and occupies a large
share of expenditure, the productivity growth of agriculture sector reduces the relative
price of nontradables, and hence the overall price level. 10


         3.3 Robustness Tests: Comparing the Results from PWT 8.1 with PWT 7.0 and
             WDI




8
  In both studies, the absolute level of per capita income is used instead of relative per capita income.
9
  They argue that the test for the exact necessary and sufficient conditions for a U shape requires the
slope of the curve is negative at the start and positive at the end of the observed data range. In contrast,
the statistical significance of the quadratic term is a weak criterion by which to judge the presence of a U-
shaped relationship.
10
   Dekle and Ungor (2013), for example, offer an alternative perspective on the role of agriculture sector
productivity in assessing the Penn effect.

                                                      9
The non-monotonic relationship between price level and per capita income has been
little discussed in previous literature. That suggests checking the robustness of the
coefficient on the quadratic term. In Table 2 we report the results derived from PWT 7.0
and WDI as robustness check. For a clearer comparison, we only maintain a common set
of country-year observations in the regressions. Regressions with full sample do not
change the primary results.


While the coefficient magnitudes vary across different datasets, the signs of coefficients
are consistent, and most importantly, the quadratic terms and the presence of a U
shape are statistically significant. The results further provide empirical evidence for the
quadratic income effect; price levels decline and then rise as per capita income
increases. 11




        3.4 Stratification by level of development


In the following, for brevity we focus on the PWT 8.1 data set. There is reason to
believe, given the results in for example Cheung et al. (2007), Fujii (2015), and Kravis
and Lipsey (1987), that the developed and developing economies do not constitute a
homogeneous grouping. That finding motivates investigation by stratifying the sample.


The elasticity of the price level with respect to per capita income may be different for
developing countries and developed countries. For example, the manufacturing-services
productivity differential is presumably more pronounced in developing countries, and as
a consequence it would make sense that the Balassa-Samuelson effects are more
pronounced in developing countries. Nevertheless, Cheung et al. (2007), Fujii (2015),


11
  The results are largely unchanged if the analyses are restricted to data associated with benchmark
years. Hence, the findings are not driven by interpolated data. On the other hand, what is true is that
cross-section estimates of linear and quadratic terms differ between benchmark years (1985, 1993, 2005,
2011), according to an F-test.

                                                  10
and Kravis and Lipsey (1987) indicate that the price elasticity exhibited by developed
economies is larger than developing economies. Possibly, the price-income interactions
are affected by different factors in these two country groups.12


We define developed countries as high-income countries listed by the World Bank in
1990, and fix countries’ income status over time. We use 1990 as a reference date since
it is roughly halfway through the full sample period. 13 Table 3 reports the results for
developing and developed countries. Both the linear and quadratic specifications
(columns 35 and 46) fit the data from developed countries better than data from
developing countries, according to R-squared statistics.


In the absence of the quadratic term, the slope for developing countries is flatter than
that of developed countries; that is, the price level is more sensitive to per capita
income for developed than for developing countries. The result is consistent with the
results in, for instance, Cheung et al. (2007), Fujii (2015), Kravis and Lipsey (1987), and
Hassan (forthcoming). One possibility is that the negative relationship between price
level and per capita income when income is low – as indicated in the U-shaped curve in
Figure 2 - flattens the slope for developing countries. Scatter plots with linear fits for
developing and developed countries are presented in figure 3 and figure 4. These figures
affirm the relatively “flatness” result for developing countries.


An interesting result is that the quadratic term is statistically significant for both
developing and developed countries, but with different signs. The data from developing
countries display a U-shaped income effect while developed countries an inverted U-
shaped one. Scatter plots with quadratic fits for developing and developed countries are
presented in figures 5 and 6. The U-shaped income effect for the developing countries is


12
   The developed and developing economies can also display different patterns of exchange rate
misalignment estimates (Cheung and Fujii, 2014a).
13
   As a robustness check, we test our results using income status classification in 2011. The results do not
change substantively as a consequence of this alternative reference date.

                                                     11
visually more obvious than the inverted U-shaped one for developed countries. The
formal test indicates that the presence of a U shape for the developing countries is
significant at the 1 percent level while the inverted U-shape relationship for developed
countries is significant at the 5 percent level.


The quadratic term implies that the elasticity of the price level with respect to per capita
income depends on the level of GDP per capita. For example, compared to the 0.242
elasticity from the linear specification in Table 1, including the quadratic term decreases
the 2011 implied elasticity for Nigeria to 0.109 but increases the implied elasticity for
Korea to 0.539.


Since quadratic terms of the data from developed and developing countries have
different signs, the nonlinearity effect has different implications for the elasticity of the
price level with respect to per capita income for countries at different income levels.


In passing, we note that, in the presence of a quadratic term, the developing countries
have a coefficient estimate of the linear income term larger than the developed
countries; a reverse of the relative linear income effect displayed under columns (1) and
(3). Also, one might think that in the full sample, a higher order relative income term
would capture the attenuation of the Penn effect at top income levels. However, the
inclusion of a cubic in relative income fails to exhibit statistical significance.




4       Alternative Specifications


        4.1 Fixed effects


One potential problem arising in dealing with cross-country data is unobserved
heterogeneity. We employ fixed effects and random effects address this issue. The fixed


                                               12
effects approach assumes that the individual specific effects are correlated with the
independent variables, and random effect approach assumes that the individual specific
effects are uncorrelated with the independent variables. The Hausman test, however,
rejects the random effects specification. Thus, for brevity Tables 4 and 5 only present
results pertaining to fixed effects specifications; Table 4 is for the full country sample
and Table 5 is for the income-stratified samples. 14


The fixed effects within and between estimators provide discernably different income
elasticity estimates. At the risk of over-simplification, the within estimator is driven by
data variations over time within individual countries, and the between estimator by
cross-country differences. Table 4 show that, for the sample including all the economies,
estimates from the between specification are qualitatively similar to those in Table 1.
The within specification, on the other hand, can yield different and even statistically
insignificant estimates.


Apparently, it is the cross-country variation that underpins the observed linear and
quadratic Penn effects. Alternatively, we interpret that these results indicate that the
Penn effect is more pronounced between countries than within a country during
different stages of development. In passing, we note that the between estimator is
based on country-average-variables; the averaging process can mitigate country-specify
measurement error. 15


Table 5 shows that the inclusion of within and between features has different
implications for data from developed and developing countries. Turning first to the
developed economies, one finds that the inclusion of fixed within country effects has


14
   Another potential problem is serial correlation, as observations in this period within a country may be
correlated with observations in the previous period. To address this problem, robust standard errors
clustered by countries are used for inference.
15
   The implications of measurement errors for Penn regression and related misalignment estimation are
illustrated by Cheung and Fujii (2014a). Further the averaging can alleviate the biases from serial
correlation in the data which can affect the within estimator.

                                                    13
little impact on the results for the linear specification. However, the inclusion eliminates
the effect of the relative income variables in the quadratic specification. The only
statistically significant coefficient is that on the quadratic term, for the between
estimator; moreover, the estimated coefficient has a negative sign that is the same as
the one in Table 3.


For the developing economies, it is the between specification but not the within
specification that gives linear and quadratic income effects similar to the corresponding
ones in Table 3. That is, the U-shaped income effect is likely to be driven by differences
across developing countries, and is carried over to the sample that has both developing
and developed countries.


The specifications with both country and time fixed effects yield results that are
qualitatively similar to those in Table 5; they are not reported for brevity, and are
available upon request.


        4.2 Controlling for Economic Factors


Results in the previous subsection suggest that both the linear and quadratic Penn
effects are likely to be a cross-country phenomenon. 16 Are these effects proxies for
differences of country characteristics? Are there economic variables that determine
what affects the price level? For instance, one commonly heard argument is that the
corruption raises prices. Extensive capital control might impede trade and hence price
arbitrage. Finally, commodity exporters – in particular oil exporters – might exhibit
different price behavior.


We now investigate whether these particular aspects are of measurable importance in
the determination of national real exchange rates, and if so, whether our conclusions
16
  Note that the so-called Penn effect is documented across cities within a country (Cheung and Fujii,
2014b).

                                                    14
regarding RMB misalignment are altered as a consequence. To this end, we consider the
following augmented equations:


           𝑟𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑦𝑖,𝑡 + Γ𝑋𝑖,𝑡 + 𝑢𝑖,𝑡 ,                                       (7)


and


                                 2
       𝑟𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑦𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝑦𝑖,𝑡 + Γ𝑋𝑖,𝑡 + 𝑢𝑖,𝑡 .                                 (8)


The vector 𝑋𝑖,𝑡 contains economic control variables, including an indicator variable for
oil exporters, a financial openness measure, a corruption measure, and an interaction
term between the last two. The indicator variable takes on a value of “1” for oil-
exporters. The financial openness variable is the index of capital account openness
developed by Chinn and Ito (2006). We use the International Country Risk Guide’s
(ICRG) Corruption Index as our measure of institutional development (where higher
values of the index denote less corruption).


Table 6 presents results of estimating (7) and (8) for the developed and developing
countries (columns 1-2, 5-6, respectively). Constrained by data availability, the sample
sizes are smaller than those considered in Table 3. The inclusion of these additional
explanatory variables does not qualitatively change linear and quadratic income effects
reported in Table 3; for instance, a U-shaped income effect and an inverted U-shape are
again found, respectively for developing and developed economies.


The astute reader will note some of the income effect estimates are quantitatively
different from their counterparts in Table 3. However, it is hard to draw a precise
comparison as the sample sizes considered are different in these two tables.




                                                  15
For the added variables, only two of our control variables are significant. Interestingly,
being an oil-exporter increases the price level for developing countries but has the
reverse effect on the price level for developed countries, controlling for other variables.
At the same time, in the presence of relatively higher level of corruption, the price level
is lower, controlling for other variables. The estimated corruption effect is different
from the usual perception that corruption raises price level. Capital account openness
and the interaction between corruption and openness do not have significant impact on
price level in our results.


The presence of a U shape is less pronounced in the augmented models. The failure to
detect a significant U-shaped relationship is partly due to the decrease of the sample
size. Also, the position of the extreme point plays a role in the test for a U shape. The
minimum for the developing countries is -5.08, but we have few observations to the left
of the extremum. For developed countries the extreme point is 0.42, but the number of
observations to the right of the extremum is very limited.


In sum, the nonlinear income effect is robust to these control variables, although the
test for a U shape now fails to reject the null hypothesis.


One factor omitted from the previous analysis is some measure of intercountry
transportation costs. In order to check whether the results are sensitive to this omission,
we include remoteness, which is a trade weighted distance measure calculated for
several years by UN DESA (2015). There is an additional increment to account for
landlocked countries. Since we only have remoteness data for select years, we opt to fix
on 2006, and convert the remoteness variable into a binary variable taking on a value of
one when the value exceeds 0.75, which matches Nepal’s remoteness value in 2006.
The results are reported in columns 3 and 4 of Table 6. 17


17
  Since no advanced economy is “remote” by the criterion we use, the advanced economy results are
unchanged.

                                                 16
The estimated income parameters are largely unchanged, although now the relationship
between income and the price level is monotonically increasing.18 The other coefficients
are qualitatively unaffected. However, in line with expectations, remote countries do
exhibit substantially higher price levels – by 11%.




5        Estimating Exchange Rate Misalignment


Studies such as Cheung, Chinn, and Fujii (2010b) and Cheung and Fujii (2014a) show that
very different exchange rate misalignment estimates can be obtained from different
data vintages, and there is a considerable amount of uncertainty surrounding these
estimates. Our exercise highlights another source of uncertainty – the specification
uncertainty. Here we use the Chinese currency, the renminbi (RMB), to illustrate the
point.


Table 7 reports the estimates of misalignment for the Chinese RMB using the Penn
effect as a criterion. The linear and quadratic specifications ((equations (5) and (6)) for
the full sample or the sample of developing economies are considered. 19 Misalignment
estimates derived from PWT 7.0 and WDI datasets are included to highlight the
implications of differences in data vintage and data source. Undervaluation
(overvaluation) is indicated by a negative (positive) sign.


One commonality is that an undervaluation is indicated for 2005. That being said, there
is considerable disagreement on the extent, even for the linear specification and the full
sample: from -23.2% to -61.2% (Panel A). For the quadratic specification (Panel B), the
misalignment estimates spread from -5.53% (WDI, developing) to -48.9% (PWT 8.1
developing). Interestingly, a quadratic specification typically generates a RMB

18
  The implied turning point is below the lowest income level.
19
  To retain comparability with other estimates, we rely on estimates from specifications omitting the
remoteness variable.

                                                   17
undervaluation estimate that is smaller than one from a linear specification. It is true for
all misalignment estimates presented in Panels A and B of Table 7.


Moving forward to 2009 the year the last data available for all three data sets, the
diversity persists. For the linear specification applied to full samples, the estimates
ranges from -27.7% to -5.83%. Using the developing sample, one estimate from the WDI
suggests the RMB was overvalued by 7.12%. The quadratic specification gives a small
level of RMB undervaluation – indeed, the WDI data indicate the RMB was overvalued
by more than 10% by 2009 based on either full sample or data from developing
countries.


In Figure 3, we show the trajectory of the Chinese RMB over the sample period (in red),
against the scatterplot of developing economies from PWT 8.1. The RMB was more than
one standard error below predicted in 2005, but already by 2010 the RMB was at
predicted. Figure 5 that depicts the situation under the quadratic specification
essentially tells a similar story - the RMB is about correctly valued by 2010. In other
words, the same inferences are obtained using linear vs. quadratic.


2011 onward, the extent of RMB overvaluation is growing. The WDI data uniformly
indicate overvaluation: from 6.97% (2011, full sample) to 27.1% (2014, sample of
developing countries). A much milder overvaluation trend is provided by the PWT 8.1
dataset, though.


The possibility of a RMB overvaluation seldom garnered media attention until 2015. In
May of that year, the International Monetary Fund stated that the RMB was at a level
that is “no longer undervalued.” 20 While the “no longer undervalued” assessment was
shared by a long-time critic of China’s foreign exchange policy (Cline, 2015), this
conclusion was not in line with the U.S. Treasury Department, that reiterated its view

20
     International Monetary Fund (2015).

                                             18
that the RMB was still substantially undervalued (U.S. Treasury, 2015); however, no such
mention of undervaluation was made in the most recent report (U.S. Treasury, 2016).


Table 8 reports the results when the linear and quadratic models are augmented with
control variables. Compared with the estimates in Table 7, the presence of control
variables in most cases weakens the evidence of RMB undervaluation (or strengthens
the evidence of RMB overvaluation). The evidence of RMB overvaluation in 2011
obtained from the PWT8.1 dataset does not differ substantially from those obtained
from Table 7. However, the big differences arise when using the WDI dataset – the RMB
was overvalued by more than 30% 2011 and thereafter. Again, quadratic specifications,
compared with linear ones tend to yield larger estimates of RMB overvaluation.


From these results, we can infer that, in addition to data vintage and data source, the
choice of a linear or a quadratic specification has implications for estimates of exchange
rate misalignment. In the case of RMB, a quadratic specification tends to yield a lower
level of undervaluation estimate or a larger overvaluation estimate. 21


6       Conclusion


In this paper we document whether indeed the Penn effect is as robust as is typically
conceived. Specifically we assess the presence of a nonlinear Penn effect. We focus on
the recently available PWT 8.1 dataset, though results from alternative data sources are
also discussed.


We find that the elasticity of the relative price level to per capita income is fairly
consistently estimated, across data sets. However, there is some evidence that the



21
  The implications for misalignment assessment differs across countries. Cheung and Fujii (2014a), for
example, shows misalignment estimates can be affected by a few economic variables and measurement
related factors.

                                                  19
relationship is nonlinear; a quadratic term, implying a U-shaped relationship that is
apparent from visual inspection of the data.


The nature of the nonlinearity displayed by the developed and developing economies
differs. For the developed economies, the quadratic term implies an inverted U-shaped
relationship between real exchange rate and income. The developing economies, on the
other hand, display a U-shaped relationship. Additional analyses suggest that the
nonlinearity is likely driven by variations across countries rather than by changes of data
within a country, and is robust to the presence of selected economic covariates in the
regression specification.


Our empirical results re-affirm the prevalence of the income and real exchange rate link,
which is revealed in different versions of dataset. The documented nonlinear Penn
effect; especially the differential nonlinear behaviors exhibited by developed and
developing countries, nevertheless, warrants further theoretical and empirical
investigations.


While the estimated elasticity is fairly consistently estimated across data sets, the
implied degrees of misalignment do differ substantially. In addition to data vintage and
data source, the choice of a linear or quadratic Penn effect can affect the assessment of
exchange rate misalignment. We focus on the example of China as a means of
highlighting these points.


As anticipated, the choice of specification has implications for estimating the degree of
misalignment. In the case of China, a quadratic, instead of a linear, Penn effect
specification tends to yield weaken (stronger) evidence of RMB undervaluation
(overvaluation). Our estimates show that the RMB may have embarked on its
overvaluation trend as early as 2011, if not 2009.




                                            20
In general, our results suggest that particular care must be taken when making
inferences regarding the degree of currency misalignment.




Appendix 1:    Data and Sources


The primary source for the data is PWT8.1. A secondary data source is PWT7.0, and the
World Bank’s Development Indicators. The price level is the price level ratio of PPP
converted factor to market exchange rate (PPP/XR), in logs terms and relative to the
U.S.


The basic sample drawn from PWT8.1 encompasses 150 countries over the 1970-2011
period. In our statistical analysis, we exclude small countries and oil exporters with
extreme values, and countries that experience a bout of hyperinflation. Excluded
countries include: Bahrain, Bermuda, Brunei, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Kuwait,
Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia in 1990, and Zimbabwe from 2008-2011.


The capital controls index is from Chinn and Ito (2006), and the (inverse) corruption
index is drawn from the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG).


Remoteness is calculated for 2006, 2009, 2012, and 2015, and is drawn on UN
Department of Economic and Social Affairs (2015). We use the 2006 values, and convert
the continuous variable into a binary one by converting into a dummy variable the
remoteness variable, taking on a value of 1 when remoteness exceeds 0.75, and 0
otherwise.
