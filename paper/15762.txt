1       Introduction
This paper investigates the macroeconomic implications of downward nominal wage rigidi-
ties in a low inflation environment via a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model
where forward-looking agents optimally set their wages under the downward constraint.
A closed-form solution for the long-run Phillips curve is derived. The inflation-output
gap trade-off is virtually vertical at high inflation and flattens at low inflation, implying
progressively larger output costs of reducing inflation. Macroeconomic volatility (among
other factors) shifts the curve outwards, generating output and employment costs, and
suggesting the need for stabilization policies. The trade-off declines with the degree of
wage flexibility but remains non-negligible.
    The conventional view argues against the presence of a long-run trade-off and in favor
of price stability: the attempt to take advantage of the short-run trade-off would only
generate costly inflation in the long run, so that price stability should be the objective of
central banks.1 Recent monetary models exhibit a long-run relationship between inflation
and real activity, mainly due to symmetric nominal rigidities and asynchronized time-
dependent price-setting behavior in an intertemporal setup (see among others Goodfriend
and King, 1997, and Woodford, 2003).2 Nonetheless, this literature indicates that the
optimal long-run inflation rate should be close to zero and unemployment at the natural
rate.3 However, virtually no central bank adopts a policy of zero-inflation, and the two
traditional reasons relate to the zero nominal interest bound and the presence of downward
nominal rigidities.
   This paper emphasizes the role of the downward nominal rigidities, quite a novel fea-
ture in the aforementioned literature.4 The traditional view suggests that a lower bound
on wages and prices keeps them from falling and induces a drift: a negative demand
shock would just reduce inflation if inflation remains positive, but would reduce output
and employment if prices needed to fall. Price stability could be achieved only at sub-
stantial costs in terms of output and employment, thus entailing significant benefits from
“greasing” the labor market via inflation. An extensive discussion is offered by Akerlof et
    1
      After the seminal contributions of Phillips (1958) and Samuelson and Solow (1960), various authors
have cast serious doubts on the validity of the Phillips curve (Friedman, 1968, and Lucas, 1973). The
empirical controversy has yet to settled down (see Ball et al., 1988).
    2
      State-dependent pricing (Golosov and Lucas, 2007) would weaken the long-run relationship, as price
rigidities would no longer be binding at high inflation. For a recent critical survey see Blanchard (2008).
    3
      Because inflation would induce firms to set a high markup to protect future profits, and would create
costly price dispersion (see Khan, King and Wolman, 2003, and Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe, 2004). See
Wyplosz (2001) for an empirical analysis on this topic.
    4
      Since Keynes, numerous authors (for example, Tobin, 1972, and Akerlof, 2007) stressed their impor-
tance for the existence of a trade-off between inflation and unemployment.

al. (1996), who derive a trade-off between unemployment and inflation via a static model
with downward wage rigidities.
   There is now a strong body of microeconometric evidence indicating the presence of
downward wage rigidities across a wide spectrum of countries, often even at low inflation.5
Recent studies, some based on cross-country evidence, find that downward wage rigidities
have a negative impact on employment (Dickens et al., 2008, and Messina et al., 2008,
Knoppik and Beissinger, 2003). Indeed, while Card and Hyslop (1997) find only a weak
evidence in favor of a “grease” effect of inflation for the U.S., Loboguerrero and Panizza
(2006) find that the “grease” effect of inflation is more relevant in countries with highly
regulated labor markets, in line with the fact that wage rigidities are stronger in countries
with heavier labor market distortions (Holden, 2004, and Dickens et al., 2007). The
effect of downward rigidities is potentially a contributor to recent U.S. labor market
developments: annual growth rate in private industry total compensation declined only
from about 3% in the first quarter of 2008 to about 1.5% in the last quarter of 2009, while
unemployment rose from about 5% to 10% over the same period.
    In this paper, we introduce downward wage rigidities in an otherwise dynamic stochas-
tic general equilibrium model with forward-looking optimizing agents that enjoy consump-
tion of goods and experience disutility from labor when working for profit-maximizing
firms. Labor markets are characterized by monopolistic competition, goods markets are
perfectly competitive, and goods prices are fully flexible. The economy is subject to both
idiosyncratic sectorial shocks and aggregate shocks (to productivity and nominal spend-
ing), which generate the need for both intratemporal (as in the traditional discussion of
the Phillips curve) and intertemporal price adjustments. Extensions to the benchmark
model relax and endogenize the downward rigidity constraint, in part to address concerns
about the empirical relevance of wage rigidities at low inflation.6 Indeed, even if we allow
the degree of downward rigidities to vary across agents, or with inflation and macroeco-
nomic volatility, or following large shocks, the inflation-output trade-off remains sizable
for reasonable parametrizations of the model.
       The most important novelties of our contribution are the derivation of a closed-form
   5
     See for example Lebow et al. (2003), Dickens et al. (2007) and Du Caju et al. (2008), and numerous
references cited by Akerlof (2007, footnote 61) and Holden (2004, section V). Gottschalk (2004) and
Barattieri, Basu, and Gottschalk (2009) find that measurement error in wages reported in surveys may
even lead to a substantial underestimation of the extent of downward wage rigidity. Several explanations
have been put forward for the existence of such rigidities, such as fairness, social norms, and labor market
institutions (see, for example, Bewley, 1999, and Holden, 2004).
   6
     Several authors (see Ball and Mankiw, 1994, and the comments to Akerlof et al., 1996) have conjec-
tured that downward wage rigidities may vanish in a low inflation environment. However, recent evidence
shows that even at lor inflation such rigidities are binding (Agell and Lundborg, 2003, for Sweden; Fehr
and Gotte, 2005, for Switzerland; Yasui and Takenaka, 2005, for Japan).


                                                     2
solution for a non-linear relationship between the long-run averages of wage inflation and
output gap (the long-run Phillips curve), and the derivation of how such a curve would
shift outward with macroeconomic volatility.7 The output-inflation trade-off flattens at
low inflation, a result which suggests that the flattening of the Phillips curve observed in
several industrial countries in recent years may not need to be ascribed to globalization
(see IMF, 2006; Borio and Filardo, 2006), but may simply be due to the decline in inflation.
The results also suggest that the possible end of the Great Moderation coupled with low
inflation–if not deflation–may inflict a compounded negative effect on the economy, which
would substantially reduce output and employment unless offset by more wage flexibility,
stronger stabilization policies, or higher productivity growth.
    The policy implications are quite different from those offered by standard monetary
models. First, the optimal inflation may not be zero (as recently argued) or negative (as
suggested by Friedman, 1968). Moderate inflation may help ”grease” intratemporal and
intertemporal relative price adjustments, especially in countries with substantial macroe-
conomic volatility. Second, not every country should target the same inflation rate, but
those experiencing larger volatility may find it desirable to target a higher inflation rate.
Third, as the degree of volatility changes persistently over time, the inflation target may
need to be adjusted. Fourth, policymakers can improve the output-inflation trade-off via
stabilization policies aimed at reducing macroeconomic volatility, thus lowering the output
and employment costs of maintaining low inflation or of reducing it. This result contrasts
with the view that the gains from stabilization policies are negligible (as in Lucas 1987,
2003). Simulations based on the model presented in this paper indicate that an advanced
economy enjoying a low macroeconomic volatility (say 2%) and low inflation (say 2%)
might face a long run output gap of minus 1.2%. The end of the Great Moderation (say
bringing macroeconomic volatility to 5%) might widen this estimate to minus 1.6%.
    Beside the work of Akerlof et al. (1996), our paper is related to a few recent con-
tributions. Elsby (2009) offers a partial equilibrium model where downward nominal
rigidities arise from negative effects of wage cuts on firm’s productivity, and highlights
the endogenous tendency for upward rigidity of wages in a dynamic model. Kim and
Ruge-Murcia (2007), and more recently Fahr and Smets (2008) and Fagan and Messina
(2008), present a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with asymmetric costs
to wage adjustments, but do not derive a closed-form solution for the long-run Phillips
curve.8
   7
      An equivalent formulation in terms of inflation and unemployment is offered in Benigno and Ricci
(2008).
    8
      Andersen (2001) presents a static model which can be solved in a closed form, while Bhaskar (2003)
offers a framework that endogenizes downward price rigidities. Our model also shares similarities with


                                                   3
    The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model. Sections 3 and
4 present the solutions under flexible and downward-rigid wages, respectively. Section
5 solves for the long-run Phillips curve. Section 6 relaxes the degree of wage rigidities.
Section 7 draws conclusions.


2     The model
The closed-economy model is populated by a continuum of infinitely lived households and
sectors (both in a [0,1] interval). Each household derives utility from the consumption of a
continuum of goods and disutility from supplying a continuum of varieties of labor, which
are specific to the households and to the sector in which they are employed. The model
assumes the presence of downward nominal rigidities: wages are chosen by optimizing
households under the constraint that they cannot fall (this assumption will be relaxed in
Section 6). In each sector, firms operate in a competitive market to produce one of the
continuum of consumption goods. The economy is subject to two aggregate shocks: a
productivity and a nominal spending shock. The productivity shock is denoted by At ,
whose logarithmic at is distributed as a Brownian motion with drift g and variance σ 2a

                                        dat = gdt + σ a dBa,t                                 (1)

where Ba,t denotes a standard Brownian motion with zero drift and unit variance. The
nominal spending shock is denoted by Ỹt whose logarithmic ỹt is also distributed as a
Brownian motion, now with drift θ and variance σ 2y

                                         dỹt = θdt + σ y dBy,t                               (2)

where dBy,t is a standard Brownian motion with zero drift and unit variance that might
be correlated with dBa,t .
    The economy is also subject to a continuum of idiosyncratic preference shocks that
affect directly the disutility of supplying the varieties of labor among the different sec-
tors. The logarithmic value of each shock ξ t (i), with i belonging to the [0,1] interval, is
distributed as a Brownian motion with zero drift and variance σ 2ξ (i)

                                      d ln ξ t (i) = σ ξ (i)dBξ,t (i)                         (3)

where dBξ,t (i) is a standard Brownian motion with zero drift and unit variance that might

where cjt (i) is household j’s consumption of the variety of good i produced in the respective
sector. An appropriate consumption-based price index is defined as
                                                                            R1
                                                                                 ln pt (i)di
                                                         Pt ≡ e             0                     ,

where pt (i) is the price of the single good i.
   The utility flow is logarithmic in the consumption aggregate. Given (5), each household
j supplies a continuum of varieties of labor, each specific to a sector i of the economy.
Hence, lt (j, i) is the variety of labor supplied by household j to sector i. The disutility
of exerting labor efforts is separable across the different varieties i and assumed to be
isoelastic with η ≥ 0 measuring the inverse of the Frisch elasticity of labor supply; the
shock ξ t (i) affects in a multiplicative way the disutility that household j faces when
supplying the variety of labor (j, i) to sector i.9 Household j’s intertemporal budget
constraint is given by
                    ½Z    ∞                    ¾              ½Z        ∞                ·Z       1                                  ¸     ¾

where Qt is the stochastic nominal discount factor in capital markets where claims to
monetary units are traded; wt (j, i) is the nominal wage for labor of variety (j, i) offered
by household j, and Πjt is the profit income that household j derives from the ownership

    These preferences are consistent with a balanced-growth path since we are assuming a drift in tech-
nology.


                                                                             5
of the firms operating in the economy (in equilibrium, profits will be zero).
   Starting with the consumption decisions, household j chooses goods demand, {cjt (i)},
to maximize (5) under the intertemporal budget constraint (7), taking prices as given.
The first-order conditions for consumption choices imply

where the multiplier χ does not vary over time. The index j is omitted from the con-
sumption’s first-order conditions, because we are assuming complete markets through a
set of state-contingent claims to monetary units. The optimality condition (9) implies the
equalization of the consumption expenditure among the different goods.
    Before we turn to the labor supply decision, we analyze the firms’ problem. In each
sector i, firms produce goods in a competitive market using the varieties of labor i supplied
by the continuum of household j. However, each household j has a monopoly power in
supplying each variety (j, i) of labor. In particular the labor used to produce each good i
is a CES aggregate, L(i), of the continuum of individual types of labor of variety i defined
by
                                            ·Z       1                            ¸ θ−1

                                                                       θ−1

with an elasticity of substitution θ > 1. Here ltd (j, i) is the demand for labor of type i
supplied by household j. As the production function of each sector i exhibits “love for
variety” in types of labor j, every household sells labor to every sector. Given that each
differentiated type of labor is supplied in a monopolistic-competitive market, the demand
for labor of type (j, i) on the part of wage-taking firms is given by
                                                µ                  ¶−θ

Since in equilibrium y(i) = c(i), the conditions (9) and (12) imply the following equalities

where Ỹt denotes nominal spending whose logarithmic follows the process (2).

wages. In deriving π(·) we have used (8), (10) and (13).11 Note that π(·) is homogeneous
of degree zero in (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i)), and that Ỹt (i) is the product of the nominal
spending shock and the sectorial idiosyncratic shock (Ỹt (i) ≡ Ỹt ξ t (i)).


3      Flexible wages
We first analyze the case in which wages are set without any friction, so that they can be
moved freely and fall if necessary. With flexible wages, maximization of (14) corresponds
to per-period maximization and implies the following optimality condition

                                   π w (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i)) = 0

where π w (·) is the derivative of π(·) with respect to the first argument. Since all wage
setters in sector i face the same problem, the equilibrium is symmetric, wt (j, i) = Wt (i) for
each j. Given our preference specification, nominal wages in sector i, denoted by Wtf (i),
are proportional to the combination of the aggregate nominal spending shock and the
idiosyncratic shock
                                               1
                                  Wtf (i) = µ 1+η Ỹt ξ t (i)                       (15)

where the factor of proportionality is given by the wage mark-up, defined by µ ≡ θ/(θ−1),
and by the elasticity of labor supply. We can also obtain the flexible-wage equilibrium
level of labor in sector i, Lf (i), using (13) and (15)

                                                          1
                                      Lf (i) = (µ)− 1+η ξ t (i)−1 ,

which depends on the wage mark-up as well as on the labor elasticity and is negatively
related to the idiosyncratic shock ξ t (i). Aggregate labor, Lf , defined by

                                                   R1
                                                        ln Lf (i)di
                                          Lf ≡ e    0



and is therefore constant at
                                                              1
                                           Lf = (µ)− 1+η ,
  11
     The productivity shock At does not enter in the objective function because of three assumptions:
i) the log utility in consumption, which is compatible with a balanced-growth path; ii) the flexibility
of prices (which allow us to isolate the effect of the downward rigidity constraint in wages); iii) the
exogeneity of the process of nominal spending (notice that assumptions i) and iii) are also in Golosov
and Lucas, 2007). Productivity would of course affect the optimization problem insofar as it influence
nominal spending growth. Adding menu cost pricing would enrich the model and would open the way
for an additional effect of productivity.



                                                    8
because of the assumption (4). Note that aggregate labor does not depend on the produc-
tivity shock, because of the log-utility, and does not depend on the idiosyncratic shocks,
which instead shift wages and employment across sectors

                                            Lf (i)     ξ t (i0 )   Wt (i0 )
                                                     =           =          .
                                            Lf (i0 )   ξ t (i)     Wt (i)

Consumption and output follow from the production function and in particular the flexible
level of output is given by
                                                    Ytf = At Lf ,

which moves proportionally to the productivity shock. With flexible wages and prices,
output is always at potential and the Phillips curve is vertical.


4       Downward nominal wage rigidity
When nominal wages cannot fall below the level reached in the previous period, an ad-
ditional condition needs to be taken into account: the constraint that dwt (j, i) should be
non-negative (Section 6 explores alternative models).12 The objective is then to maximize
(14) under
                                                    dwt (j, i) ≥ 0                                                                 (16)

with wt0 (j, i) > 0. In other words, agents choose a non-decreasing positive nominal wage
path to maximize (14). Let us define the value function V (·) for this problem as
                                                              ½Z      ∞                                                    ¾
                                                                              −ρ(τ −t)
       V (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i)) =      max         Et               e              π(wτ (j, i), Wτ (i), Ỹτ (i))dτ       ,
                                          {wτ (j,i)}∈W            t


where W is the set of non-decreasing positive sequences {wτ (j, i)}∞
                                                                   t . Optimality condi-
tions require
                             Vw (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i)) = 0 if dwt (j, i) > 0,

                             Vw (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i)) ≤ 0 if dwt (j, i) = 0,

where Vw (·) is the derivative of V (·) with respect to the first argument. Moreover the
maximization problem is concave and the above conditions are also sufficient to charac-
terize a global optimum as shown in the appendix. It follows that all wage setters in
sector i are going to set the same wage, wt (j, i) = Wt (i) for all j. As we further show
  12
    The downward-rigidity constraint is purely exogenous in this model and could be rationalized by
considering every worker as associated with a union that does not allow the wage to decline for reasons
related to fairness and social norms (Bewley, 1999, and Akerlof, 2007).

                                                              9
in the appendix, the solution to this problem corresponds to finding a function W (Ỹt (i))
which satisfies appropriate boundary conditions and represents the current desired wage
taking into account future downward-rigidity constraints, but not the current one (i.e. if
agents were free to choose the current wage, even below the previous-period wage, but
considering that future wages cannot fall). The agent will set Wt (i) = W (Ỹt (i)) whenever
dWt (i) ≥ 0, so that actual wages (Wt (i)) are the maximum of previous-period wages and
current desired wages W (Ỹt (i)).
    It follows that actual wages cannot fall below current desired wages, i.e. Wt ≥
W (Ỹt (i)). Either they are above the desired level, when the downward-rigidity constraint
is binding, or they are equal, when an adjustment occurs. We also show that the desired
wage is always lower than the flexible-equilibrium wage by a factor ci (·):13

                                                                         1

                                     µ                                                 ¶ 1+η

with γ(·) being the following non-negative function
                                                     q

as derived in the appendix.14
    Hence, agents’ optimizing behavior in the presence of exogenous downward wage rigidi-
ties implies an endogenous tendency for upward wage rigidities, as indicated by ci (·) being
≤ 1. Indeed, optimizing wage setters try to offset the inefficiencies of downward wage in-
flexibility, as they are worried about being stuck with an excessively high wage should
future unfavorable shocks require a wage decline or a fall in employment. As a conse-
quence, they refrain from excessive wage increases when favorable shocks require upward
  13
    We use interchangeably ci (·) for c(θ, σ 2 (i), η, ρ).
  14
    It is possible that the desired wage, W (Ỹt (i)), falls below the one associated with full employment.
While temporary overemployment is not unrealistic, in Benigno and Ricci (2008) we also solve the model
with the additional constraint lt (j, i) ≤ 1 for each j.

adjustment, thus keeping current wage low and pushing current employment above the
flexible-case level.15
    Note that actual wages (unlike desired wages) are not necessarily below the flexible-
equilibrium wage. Indeed, when the downward-rigidity constraint is binding, actual wages
are higher than desired wages and are likely to be higher (and employment lower) than
with flexible wages. As we will see in the next section, in the long run, the average output
gap is negative and a lower ci (·) would help reduce its size.
    The desired wage level is a lower fraction of the flexible-equilibrium wage (i.e. ci (·)
is low) when: the variances of nominal expenditure growth and/or of the idiosyncratic
shocks are high (σ 2 (i) large), as it is more likely that negative shocks would force wages
to hit the lower bound; when the mean of nominal expenditure growth is small (θ small),
as it is more likely that even small shocks would push wages to hit the lower bound;16
  15
     This result is consistent with the theoretical argument and empirical evidence offered by Elsby (2009).
While he emphasizes the importance of idiosyncratic shocks, we also stress the importance of macroeco-
nomics volatility.
  16
     When the drift in nominal spending growth becomes very large, it is unlikely that downward wage
inflexibility is going to be binding, so that ci (·) gets close to 1 and the flexible-wage level of employment


                                                     11
when agents discount less the future (ρ low), as they are more concerned with the future
negative consequences of current wage decisions; and when the elasticity of labor is higher
(η low), as agents are willing to accept larger fluctuations in hours worked in order to
ensure a higher average employment.
    In Figure 1 we plot ci (·) as a function of the mean of the log of nominal spending
growth, θ, with different assumptions on the overall standard deviation of the shocks,
σ(i), ranging from 0% to 20% at annual rates. The parameters’ calibration is based on a
discretized quarterly model. In particular, the rate of time preference ρ is equal to 0.01 as
standard in the literature implying a 4% real interest rate at annual rates; and the Frisch
elasticity of labor supply is set equal to 0.4, as it is done in several studies, therefore
implying η = 2.5.17 When σ(i) = 0%, ci (·) = 1. With positive standard deviations,
ci (·) decreases as θ decreases (i.e. the gap between desired wages and flexible-equilibrium
wages widens when inflation is lower). The decline in ci (·) is larger the higher is the
standard deviation of the nominal spending shock and/or of the idiosyncratic shock, as
previously discussed.


5     The Phillips curve
We can now solve for the equilibrium level of output and characterize the long run
inflation-output trade-off in the presence of downward nominal wage rigidities. We define
the output gap as the difference between output under downward wage rigidity and output
under flexible wages and prices, which is equal to the difference between the corresponding
employment levels. In logs terms we can write:
                                                                    Z       1

Equation (13) implies that
                                                                 Ỹt

To compute the equilibrium output gap, it is convenient to define the variable Xt (i) such
that Xt (i) ≡ ξ t (i)Lt (i), from which it follows
                                      Z       1                     Z       1

Since we have shown that Wt (i) ≥ ci (·)µ 1+η Ỹt (i), it is the case that 0 ≤ Xt (i) ≤ Lf /ci (·).
The existence of downward wage rigidities endogenously adds an upward barrier on the
variable Xt (i). Since ỹt (i) ≡ ln Ỹt (i) follows a Brownian motion with drift θ and variance
σ 2 (i), also xt (i) = ln Xt (i) is going to follow a Brownian motion with the same properties,
when dWt (i) = 0, but with a regulating barrier at ln(Lf /ci (·)). The probability distri-
bution function for such process can be computed at each point in time.18 We are here
interested in studying whether this probability distribution converges to an equilibrium
distribution when t → ∞, in order to characterize the long-run probability distribution
for employment, and thus the output gap. Standard results assure that this is the case
when the drift of the process ỹt (i) is positive, i.e. θ > 0.19 In this case, it can be shown
that the long-run cumulative distribution of xt (i), denoted with P (·), is given by

                                      P (x∞ (i) ≤ z) = e σ2 (i) [

for −∞ ≤ z ≤ ln(Lf /ci (·)) where x∞ (i) denotes the long-run equilibrium level of the
variable xt (i). We can also evaluate the long-run mean of xt (i) obtaining

Integrating across the sectors i, we obtain
                      Z       1                                       Z       1                   Z       1

We can then substitute (21) into (18) using (19) to obtain

       To construct the long-run Phillips curve, a relationship between average wage inflation
and output gap, we need to solve for the long-run equilibrium level of wage inflation.20

     See Cox and Miller (1990, pp. 223-225) for a detailed derivation.
  19
     When θ ≤ 0, the probability distribution collapses to zero everywhere, with a spike of one at zero
employment. However, a negative average nominal spending growth, θ, is not realistic.

     While the original formulation of the Phillips curve was in terms of unemployment and wage inflation


                                                                      13
From the equilibrium condition (13), we note that

where π w is the rate of wage inflation in the economy. Since E(dỹt ) = θdt and dxt (i)
converges to an equilibrium distribution for each i, implying E(dx∞ (i)) = 0, the long-run
mean wage inflation rate is given by

                                                           E[π w

Substituting (22) into (20), we obtain the following closed-form solution for the long-run

a relation between mean output gap and mean wage inflation rate.
    The long-run Phillips curve is no longer vertical and the “natural” rate of output is not
unique, but depends on the mean inflation rate. There are two components (influenced
by the parameters of the model η, ρ and σ 2 (i)) which explain the long-run Phillips curve
and act on opposite directions. The first integral on the right hand side captures the
forward looking reaction of wage setters to the presence of downward wage rigidities,
which induces them to set a wage lower than the flexible one when adjusting their wage
(as captured by ci (·) ≤ 1), and hence generates a positive output gap. Such a gap would
be larger the lower is ci (·). The second integral depends on the variance-to-mean ratio
and captures the cost of downward wage rigidities in the presence of a need for relative
price adjustments, which is the standard argument supporting the presence of a Phillips
curve.21
                                                                                  f
    The resulting output gap is always non-positive in the long run (i.e. E(y∞ − y∞ ) ≤ 0),
(Phillips, 1958), this paper defines it as the trade off between the output gap and wage inflation. The
output gap has indeed been widely used in modern macro models as a measure of slack. Benigno and
Ricci (2008) present the equivalent formulation in terms of unemployment-inflation trade-off.
   21
      Note that our dynamic framework introduces not only the need for intratemporal price adjustments,
due to σ 2ξ (i), as in Akerlof et al. (1996), but also the need for intertemporal price adjustment, arising
from σ 2y .




                                                                       14
because the second component dominates, since − ln ci (·) ≤ σ 2 (i)/(2E[π w
                                                                          ∞ ]).
                                                                                              22
                                                                                                   Also, the
output gap is larger when the volatility is higher and when the mean of inflation is low,
because the downward wage constraint is more likely to be binding and more costly in
terms of lower employment. Indeed, when the mean wage inflation rate becomes very high,
the average output gap converges to 0, as the two components of the gap get close to zero:
ci (·) becomes close to 1, and the costs of downward rigidities become small. Hence, for
high inflation rates, the Phillips curve is almost vertical, and there is virtually no long-
run trade-off between inflation and output gap. When instead wage inflation is low, a
trade-off emerges (the Phillips curve is flatter) and depends heavily on the volatility of
the economy. If there is no uncertainty, σ 2 (i) = 0 and ci (·) = 1, then the long-run output
gap is zero. In the stochastic case, the higher the variance of nominal-spending growth
and of the idiosyncratic shocks (σ 2 (i)), the more a fall in the inflation rate would worsen
the average output gap (generating a more negative gap), and flatten the Phillips curve.23
These patterns are evident in Figure 2, which plots the long run Phillips curve for different
levels of volatility.24
    As an illustrative example, the model would suggest (on the basis of the parametriza-
tion underlying Figure 2) that a country that is subject to low macroeconomic volatility
(say a standard deviation of nominal GDP growth equal to 2%) may experience a wors-
ening of the output gap equal to 0.4% of flexible-wage GDP when average wage inflation
declines from 6 to 3 percent and equal to 4.6% when inflation goes from 4 to 1 percent
(see Table 1). However, a country with a significant macroeconomic volatility (say 10
percent) may face much larger costs (about -1.2% and of -11.8% respectively).25
    Our model therefore suggests that a reduction in the macroeconomic volatility as a
consequence of better stabilization policies can have important first-order effects, unlike
the arguments of Lucas (1987, 2003), and substantially improve the output gap, especially
at low inflation (as shown in Table 2). At a wage inflation rate of 2%, reducing the
macroeconomic volatility from 5% to 0% improves the output gap by about 0.5%. The
  22
      Benigno and Ricci (2008) show that in the short run the Phillips curve may also imply a positive
(rather than negative) output gap.
   23
      In Lucas (1973) higher volatility reduces the information content of relative price dispersion. Intro-
ducing such an effect would steepens the short-run Phillips curve.
   24
      The standard deviation of the idiosyncratic shocks is set at 10% for all sectors, such that (for a σ y
in the order of 5% to 10%) the overall σ 2 (i) would roughly imply the standard deviation of annualized
changes in wages observed in microstudies (Barattieri, Basu, and Gottschalk, 2009; Card and Hyslop,
1997). The other parameters are as in Figure 1.
   25
      In reality, macroeconomic volatility of nominal GDP growth is likely to decline as inflation comes
down, which would imply a steeper Phillips curve. However, the decline should be less than proportional
(mainly because of the real GDP component; see Benigno and Ricci, 2008, for simple supporting evidence),
so that even at zero inflation volatility would persist. Moreover, the volatility of idiosyncratic shocks is
likely to be affected even less than the aggregate one when inflation declines.

improvement is four times larger if the volatility is reduced from 10% to 5% (for the same
level of inflation), while it is more than three times larger if volatility declines from 5%
to 0% when the wage inflation rate is at 1%.
   A few additional implications arise from the model.26 First, the probability that
wages remain fixed depends on the level of inflation and on the degree of macroeconomic
volatility. When wage inflation is very low or the variance of the shocks is high, the
probability that wages remain rigid even upward is close to one. The probability declines
when inflation increases (in line with the evidence of Card and Hyslop, 1997, that the
fraction of wages subject to rigidities is higher when inflation is low), and it declines faster
when macroeconomic volatility is lower.
    Second, a long run trade-off between volatility of inflation and volatility of output gap
emerges, for given distributions of the idiosyncratic shocks. Indeed, at low inflation there
is more adjustment via employment and less via wages, while the opposite emerges at
high inflation. Trade-offs of this nature have been generally assumed in monetary policy
analysis over the past thirty years (see Kydland and Prescott, 1977; Barro and Gordon,
  26
       Benigno and Ricci (2008) provide a more extensive discussion.

1983). Woodford (2003) has recently provided microfoundation for these trade-offs and for
their link to monetary reaction functions widely employed in inflation-targeting models
(although he derives the trade-off as a local approximation, while in our model it is a
feature of the global equilibria).


6     Relaxing the downward rigidity constraint
The benchmark model presented in the previous sections encompasses nominal wage rigidi-
ties as a constraint which is homogenous across agents and is independent of the level
of inflation, the degree of macroeconomic volatility, or the presence of large shocks. The
reality is more nuanced, and this section explores various ways in which to relax this


                                               17
assumption. First, we consider the case in which the threshold for wage changes at which
downward wage rigidities become binding may be negative (rather than zero) and may
depend on inflation and volatility. This corresponds to the idea that when agents expect
the constraint to be more relevant, they could adjust their behavior and set wages more
flexibly. Second, we allow for some heterogeneity, by considering the case in which only
some agents are subject to the constraint. Finally, we offer a setup in which wage rigidities
may not be binding when high-variance shocks occur.


6.1      Varying the degree of downward rigidities
The main criticism of an approach that includes downward wage rigidities is that this
inflexibility should disappear as the inflation rate declines toward zero (see the comments
to Akerlof et al., 1996, and Ball and Mankiw, 1994). As we discussed in the introduction,
there is now more evidence that downward wage rigidities persist even during low inflation
periods. Nonetheless, it is valuable to explore the implications of a link between the degree
of downward rigidities and inflation, by replacing the assumption dwt (j, i) ≥ 0 with

                                           dwt (j, i) ≥ −κ(θ, σ 2 (i))wt (j, i)dt                                         (24)

which nests the previous model. Nominal wages are now allowed to fall, but the percentage
decline cannot exceed κ(θ, σ 2 (i)), where κ(θ, σ 2 (i)) is a decreasing function of the mean
of nominal-spending growth, θ (so that at lower inflation, wages can fall more), and also
an increasing function of the variance of the aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks, σ 2 (i)
(with higher variance wages can fall more). 27 The solution of the model is similar to the
previous case except that now θ should be replaced by λ(θ, σ 2 (i)) ≡ θ + κ(θ, σ 2 (i)).28 In
particular, the long-run Phillips curve becomes
                            Z       1                                                Z       1

                                                                                                        ∞ ], σ (i))


since it is still true that E[π w
                                ∞ ] = θ. Obviously the way in which the rigidities endogenously
decline (i.e. the functional form of κ(θ, σ 2 (i))) is crucial in shaping the Phillips curve. For
example if the percentage decline could not exceed a fixed amount κ1 (hence κ(·)=κ1 ), then
the Phillips curve would simply shift down by κ1 (when compared to the one presented in
Figure 2). Under more general assumptions for κ(θ, σ 2 (i)), the effect of inflation would be

  28
    In this case, the condition ensuring that the probability distributions converge in the long run to
a non-trivial distribution becomes λ(θ, σ 2 (i)) > 0. A supplementary appendix that presents the model
solution under this general case is available upon request.

to tilt the Phillips curve counter clockwise at low inflation, while an increase in volatility
would steepen the curve (as the downward wage rigidities become less binding).29 For
illustrative purposes, Figure 3 shows the Phillips curve resulting from equation (24) and
the following function

for two different levels of volatility, and compare these curves with the benchmark ones
from Figure 2.30 The cost of low inflation in terms of output gap would decline, but would
remain non negligible. Reducing inflation from 5% to 2% worsens the output gap by 0.6%
when σ y = 5% and σ ξ (i) = 10% compared to the benchmark case in which the reduction
  29
      Obviously, if κ(θ, σ 2 (i)) were to be very large for any theta, then the Phillips curve would become
virtually vertical. However, as discussed extensively in the introduction, there is substantial evidence
that downward wage rigidities persist even at low inflation.

      We set κ1 and κ2 such that κ1 σ(i) = 1% at annual rates and κ2 σ(i) = 0.1 under the assumption
σ y = 5% (for comparability, the same κ1 and κ2 are maintained when σ y = 10%). Other parameters
as in Figure 2. Note that the various Phillips curves associated with different levels of volatilities would
now cross, as a change in volatility not only shifts the curve outwards, but also steepens it.

reduction was 3.1%.


6.2    Heterogeneous rigidities
This subsection allows for some heterogeneity in the way the rigidity affects agents, in line
with recent findings of Barattieri, Basu and Gottschalk (2009) suggesting the presence of
heterogeneity across occupations. To preserve simplicity, we make the assumption that a
fraction of wage setters, of type i and measure α (0 ≤ α ≤ 1), is constrained by downward
rigidities while the remaining fraction 1 − α can set wages flexibly. It can be easily shown
that the long-run Phillips curve in this case becomes
                                   Z       α                                      Z       α

where the only difference is that integrals are taken over a different interval [0, α), i.e.
across the sectors which are affected by downward-wage rigidities. The presence of some

flexible wages generates a more vertical Phillips curve (see Figure 4 for various degrees of
wage flexibility in the case of moderate volatility, σ y = 5%). Still the costs are significant
even when α is small. For example, when α is just 0.2, meaning that 20% of firms are
constrained by downward wage rigidities, then lowering inflation from 5% to 2% still
produce costs equal to 0.3% which are obviously smaller than the 1.4% found in the
benchmark case, but not negligible. The two boundary values for α nest the models
presented in Sections 3 and 4: the flexible case when α = 0, and the rigidity constraint
case when α = 1.


6.3     Adjustment under high-variance shocks
This subsection extends the benchmark model to the case in which high-variance shocks
warrant a wage adjustment, by introducing two additional features. First, we assume,
on top of the aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks, the presence of additional idiosyncratic
shocks that hit the individual wages less frequently but with large variations. When
wages are affected by such high-variance idiosyncratic shocks, wage setters can adjust
their wages either upward or downward in an optimal way. When instead agents do not
face these infrequent idiosyncratic shocks, they are subject to the usual downward wage
rigidity constraint.31
    Second, we introduce the probability of switching between the low and the high prob-
ability regime, which captures the frequency of occurrence of high-variance shocks. This
is indeed an important parameter in order to study the relevance of the real effects of
monetary policy.32 If the large shocks were occurring very frequently, then wages would
adjust often and the Phillips curve would be quite vertical. With infrequent large shocks,
wages would be more subject to the downward wage rigidity constraint and the Phillips
curve would be flatter, as in the benchmark model. We will discuss below how micro-data
evidence on the frequency of wage adjustment and on the wage distribution can help to
discriminate between these two views.
    To model such probability of switching, we add a process {st } that follows a two-state
  31
      The idea that wages can adjust in a state-contingent way following high-variance shocks is borrowed
from the menu-cost literature on firms’ pricing (see in particular Gertler and Lehay, 2008, and Golosov
and Lucas, 2007). To preserve simplicity, we approximate the implications of an Ss model by introducing
a regime-switching model for the idiosyncratic shocks between a low and a high volatility regime. The
approximation is accurate to the extent to which an Ss model would trigger an adjustment for most of
the shocks of the high-volatility regime, which is more likely when the variance of such shocks is high.
   32
      In the Golosov and Lucas (2007) model, large shocks are very frequent so the real effects of monetary
policy are small. On the contrary, Gertler and Lehay (2008) shows that with infrequent idiosyncratic
shocks is still possible to characterize the response of the economy to aggregate shocks through a Phillips
curve.

Markov chain taking values 1 and 2. These two states are associated, respectively, with
the benchmark situation of downward wage rigidities and with the case in which wages
can freely adjust. We assume that the process {st } has matrix of transition probabilities
between time t and t + dt given by
                                         "                         #

                                                                       ,
                                               φdt       1 − φdt

where λdt is the inter-period probability of switching from state 1 to state 2; 1 − λdt is
the probability of remaining in state 1; φdt is the probability of switching from state 2
to 1; and 1 − φdt is the probability of remaining in state 2.33 Given this structure, we
assume that the idiosyncratic shock ξ t (i) is now given by two multiplicative components,
ξ t (i) = ξ v,t (i)εt (i) where ξ v,t (i), as in the benchmark model, exhibits its logarithmic
distributed as a Brownian motion with zero drift and variance σ 2ξ (i)

                                       d ln ξ v,t (i) = σ ξ (i)dBξ,t (i)

while the additional term is given by the shock εt (i) whose log is distributed as

                                       d ln εt (i) = σ ε (i, s)dBv,t (i)

where

                                             σ ε (i, s = 1) = 0
                                             σ ε (i, s = 2) > 0,

dBv,t (i) might be correlated with dBξ,t (i), and both are standard Brownian motion with
zero mean and unitary variance. In state 1, the time-variation of the shock εt is zero so
that it does not move; in state 2, instead, its variation follows a Brownian motion with
variance σ 2ε (i).
   In light of these two additions to the model, wage setters still maximize the objective
function (14) but now they take into account the possibility of freely adjusting wages when
state 2 occurs, while in state 1 they continue to face the downward rigidity constraint;
moreover, they anticipate the possibility of switching across states. Optimality conditions
requires that the derivative of the value function with respect to wages in state 2 is equal
to zero, i.e. Vw (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i), s = 2) = 0, since in this state is possible to relax
  33
       It is assumed that 0 ≤ λdt ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ φdt ≤ 1.



                                                       22
the downward rigidity constraint, where now we have defined Ỹt (i) ≡ Ỹt ξ v,t (i)εt (i). In
state 1, instead, Vw (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i), s = 1) · dwt (j, i) = 0 and dwt (j, i) ≥ 0 as in the
benchmark case since the downward wage rigidity constraint applies.
    In state 1, the value function follows the following functional equation (see the Ap-
pendix)34
                                                                    1
                  (λ + ρ)v1 (·)dt = π w (·)dt + v1,y (·)θdt + v1,yy (·)σ 2 (i)dt                  (26)
                                                                    2
under the appropriate boundary conditions, where we have defined the derivative of the
value function with respect to wages as v1 (·) ≡ Vw (Wt (i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i), s = 1). By inspec-
tion, this is similar to the functional equation characterizing the benchmark model and
is associated with the same boundary conditions. The only difference is in the discount
factor which is now higher and given by (λ+ρ) because workers internalize the probability
of switching to the flexible-wage regime.35 It follows that in state 1, wages are set at the
                                            1
level Wt (i) = c(θ, σ 2 (i), η, λ + ρ) · µ 1+η Ỹt ξ v,t (i)εt1 (i) whenever dWt (i) ≥ 0, where εt1 (i)
represents the realization of εt (i) at time t1 , with t1 < t, which is the last time before t
at which state 2 occurred. In other words, desired wages are again proportional to the
flexible wages, but with a higher proportional factor: the same function ci (·) now depends
on a higher discount factor (λ + ρ).
    In state 2, instead, wages can be freely adjusted so that the derivative of the value
function with respect to wages is set to zero, v2 (·) = 0, and the optimality condition in
this state simplifies to
                                 π w (·)dt + φv1 (·)dt = 0,                           (27)

as it is shown in the appendix.36 However, this does not correspond to the optimality
condition under fully flexible wages since in state 2 wage setters take into account the
probability of reverting to state 1, given by φdt. In the appendix, we show that wages in
state 2 are set proportionally to the level that would prevail in the permanently flexible-
                                                     1
wage case (Wtf (i)) and such that Wt (i) = c̃i (·)µ 1+η Ỹt ξ t (i)εt (i), where now ci (·) < c̃i (·).37
    The results are quite intuitive. In state 1, i.e. when the downward rigidities are
binding, the desired wage is closer to the flexible-wage case than in the benchmark case
of Section 4, because agents internalize the positive probability of a readjustment when
  34
     These are standard optimality conditions associated with problems of switching regimes. (See
Øksendald and Sulem, 2004, pp. 52-57.) See Driffil et al. (2003) and Guo et al. (2005) for related
problems in the irreversible investment literature.
  35
     The value function in state 2 does not enter into (26) because wages can freely adjust in that state.
  36
     Notice that the composite state variable Ỹt (i) is continuous when switching from state 2 to state 1,
but jumps from state 1 to state 2.
  37
     We further note that the model of this section nests the benchmark model under the assumption that
λdt = 0 and the flexible-wage model under the assumption that φdt = 0.

the state switches. In state 2, i.e. when the downward rigidities are not binding, wage
setters will also internalize the fact that with positive probability they will enter state 1
in which the downward wage rigidity constraint is binding (indeed, as v1 (·) ≤ 0, we obtain
π w (·) ≥ 0); hence they will set wages below the flexible-wage level, but above the case in
state 1.
     The implications of this model for the steepness of the Phillips curve and for the
output gap-inflation trade-off depend crucially on λdt, i.e. the probability of switching
from the normal state where downward wage rigidities are binding to an exceptional state
where major shocks warrant wage flexibility. One can expect this parameter to be quite
low. For example, λdt = 0.1 would imply that wages become flexible during one quarter
out of two and a half years, while λdt = 0.01 would imply that wages becomes flexible
during one quarter out of twenty-five years.
   One way to calibrate λdt is to ask the model to match some key empirical patterns
uncovered by the micro literature on individual wage setting. For example, Card and
Hyslop (1997, table 2) show that in the presence of low inflation the fraction of rigid

wages (zero change) at a one-year horizon is around 16%. The fraction decreases to 8%
at a two-year horizon and to 5% at a three-year horizon (during the period 1985-88, when
inflation was about 3 percent). Moreover there are negative wage changes. In Figure 5 we
show the frequency distribution implied by our model for the wage changes over one-year,
two-year, three-year, four-year horizons, when we adopt the following calibration: θ = 4%,
σ y = 5% , σ ξ = 10%, σ ε (i, s = 2) = 65%, all at annual rates, φdt = 1, ρ = 0.01 on a
quarterly basis, and η = 2.5. The fraction of zero wage changes implied by the model over
the four horizons considered is 16.5%, 8.6%, 4.9%, and 3.8%, respectively, which is in
line with the evidence presented by Card and Hyslop. Moreover, the fraction of negative
wage changes on a year horizon is equal to 11% (or less than 3% on a quarterly basis), so
that our model is consistent with some wage decreases. To get these results, we calibrate
λdt = 0.06.
   In Figure 6, we allow λdt to vary in the (0.00, 0.12) interval, i.e. a range surrounding
the value calibrated above, in order to study the implications of this model for the shape

of the long-run Phillips curve.38 When the probability of switching to state 2 increases,
wages are on average more flexible: the Phillips curve moves inward and becomes more
vertical. In the case of λdt = 0.06 , reducing inflation from 5% to 2% would increase
the output gap by about 0.3 percent of GDP, about 1 percentage point less than in the
benchmark case, but still by a sizable amount. For countries or during period where the
high variance shocks are more (less) frequent, hence λdt is higher (lower), the trade-off
would be better (worse) and the costs would be lower (higher).

This paper offers a theoretical foundation for the long-run Phillips curve, by introducing
downward nominal wage rigidities in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model
with forward-looking agents and flexible-goods prices. Downward nominal rigidities (the
main difference with respect to current monetary models) have been advocated for a long
time as a justification for the Phillips curve, and have recently received theoretical and
empirical support (see discussion in the introduction).
    The model generates a closed-form solution uncovering a highly non-linear relationship
for the long-run trade-off between average wage inflation and output gap: the trade-off
is virtually inexistent at high inflation rates, while it becomes relevant in a low inflation
environment. The relation shifts with several factors, and in particular with the degree
of macroeconomic volatility.39 In a country with significant macroeconomic stability, the
Phillips curve is virtually vertical also at low inflation. However, a country with moder-
ate to high volatility may face a substantial costs in terms of output and employment if
attempting to reach price stability. Higher productivity growth would tend to make the
Phillips curve more vertical, as it would feed into higher nominal spending growth. The
Phillips curve would also steepen if the degree of wage rigidities declines. Indeed, the
benchmark model is extended to allow for the possibility that downward wage rigidities
may be heterogenous across agents, and may be endogenous to inflation, macro-volatility,
or to the occurrence of large shocks. Nonetheless, for reasonable parameter values, down-
ward rigidities continue to generate a non-negligible long run trade off between inflation
and the output gap. Further work would be necessary to achieve a deeper understanding
  38
     In particular we assume that σ y = 5% and σ ξ = 10% at annual rates whereas σ ε (i, s = 2) = 65% at
annual rates. Note that the latter assumption does not affect the shape of the long-run Phillips curve.
We also assume that φdt = 1 meaning that that state 2 is not persistent at all and once a high-variance
shock occurs then the state switches back immediately to state 1.
  39
     With respect to the other parameters of the model, the Phillips curve would flatten when labor
elasticity is lower and agents heavily discount the future; and it would shift outward if labor and goods
market competition weakens.

of the labor market and of the wage setting behavior, which is crucial to assess the extent
and the implications of downward wage rigidities.
   Several important implications arise. First, the optimal inflation rate may not be zero,
but positive, as inflation helps achieving the intratemporal and intertemporal relative price
adjustments, especially in countries with substantial macroeconomic volatility. Second,
the ideal inflation rate would differ across countries (and in particular it would be higher
in countries with larger macroeconomic volatility), and may change over time. Third,
stabilization policies, can play a crucial role, as they can improve the inflation-output
trade-off.
    Additional theoretical implication arise. First, the overall degree of wage rigidity
is endogenously stronger at low inflation rates and disappears at high inflation rates,
unlike in time-dependent models of price rigidities where prices remain sticky even in a
high-inflation environment. This arises from the endogenous tendency for upward wage
rigidities (as in Elsby, 2009), resulting from forward looking agents anticipating the effect
of downward rigidities on their future employment opportunities. Second, this endogenous
wage rigidity introduces a trade-off also between the volatility of the output gap and the
volatility of inflation, as at low inflation adjustments occurs mainly via changes in output
and at high inflation via change in wages. Third, the Phillips curve may arise not only
from the need for intratemporal relative price adjustment across sectors in the presence of
downward rigidities (as in the traditional view), but also from the need for intertemporal
relative price adjustment, which opens the way for the important role of macroeconomic
stabilization policies discussed above. Fourth, nominal shocks can have high persistent
real effects, suggesting that introducing downward wage inflexibility in menu-cost model
á la Golosov and Lucas (2007) would likely change their conclusion that nominal shocks
have only transient effects on real activity at any level of inflation. Fifth, prolonged
periods of low inflation or deflation may prove very costly in terms of output and possibly
employment, a result which is consistent with the Japanese experience according to Yasui
and Takenaka (2005).
    Regarding the empirical implications, the long run output gap with respect to the
flexible-wage output is not zero in our model, but depends on the extent of inflation and
volatility of the economy. This implies that standard empirical methods deriving an esti-
mate of the output gap as a deviation from filtering series may be misleading, as such a
measure would, by construction, average out to about zero in the long run. Indeed, in our
model, the long run output gap should simply be a mirror image of the unemployment
rate above the frictionless unemployment rate. Moreover, empirical studies of the Phillips
curve might prove inaccurate unless they properly account for macroeconomic volatility,


                                             27
especially in a low inflation environment. For example, the “Great Moderation” experi-
enced by the U.S. until recently may have significantly steepened the Phillips curve over
the past two decades, thus potentially strengthening the case for the conventional view
of a vertical long-run curve in this country. However, this does not need to apply to
periods where volatility becomes persistently higher or to countries with generally higher
macroeconomic instability.

A.1      Derivation of conditions (17)
Let W the space of non-decreasing non-negative stochastic processes {wt (j, i)}. This is
the space of processes that satisfy the constraint (16). First we show that the objective
function is concave over a convex set. To show that the set is convex, note that if x ∈ W
and y ∈ W then τ x + (1 − τ )y ∈ W for each τ ∈ [0, 1]. Since the objective function is
                                  ½Z     ∞                                                            ¾

                                        t0


and π(·) is concave in the first-argument, the objective function is concave in {wt (j, i)}
since it is the integral of concave functions.
    Let {wt∗ (j, i)} be a process belonging to W that maximizes (14) and V (·) the associated
value function defined by
                                                                ½Z       ∞                                                    ¾
                                                                                 −ρ(τ −t)
     V (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i)) =        max         Et                  e              π(wτ (j, i), Wτ (i), Ỹτ (i))dτ       .
                                        {wτ (j,i)}∈W                 t


We now characterize the properties of the optimal process {wt∗ (j, i)}. The Bellman equa-
tion for the wage-setter problem can be written as

ρV (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i))dt = max π(wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i))dt+Et {dV (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i))}
                                    dwt (j,i)
                                                                                                                              (A.1)
subject to
                                                      dwt (j, i) ≥ 0.                                                         (A.2)

At optimum we search for a process {wt∗ (j, i)} that satisfies

                           Vw (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i)) = 0 if dwt (j, i) > 0,

                           Vw (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i)) ≤ 0 if dwt (j, i) = 0.

Differentiating (A.1) with respect to wt (j, i) we get

ρVw (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i))dt = π w (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i))dt + Et {dVw (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i))}

since dwt (j, i) has finite variation and so also dWt (i) implying (dWt (i))2 = dWt (i)dỸt = 0.
We have defined θ0 (i) ≡ θ+ 21 σ 2 (i) and σ 2 (i) ≡ σ 2y +σ 2ξ (i). From the first to the second line,
we have used the super-contact conditions (see Dixit, 1991, and Dumas, 1991) requiring

                                        vw (Wt (i), Ỹt (i))dWt (i) = 0.

It follows that we can write (A.4) as

                                                                      1
      ρṽ(Ỹw,t (i)) = π̃ w (Ỹw,t (i)) + ṽy (Ỹw,t (i))Ỹw,t (i)θ0 + ṽyy (Ỹw,t (i))Ỹw,t
                                                                                         2
                                                                                             (i)σ 2y (i)   (A.5)
                                                                      2

since we have noticed that v(Wt (i), Ỹt (i)) = ṽ(Ỹw,t (i))/Wt with Ỹw,t (i) ≡ Ỹt (i)/Wt and
π w (Wt (i), Ỹt (i)) = π̃ w (Ỹw,t (i))/Wt where
                                                        ·         ³        ´1+η ¸
                                π̃ w (Ỹw,t (i)) ≡ kw       1 − µ Ỹw,t (i)       .


                                                         33
     The problem boils down to looking for a function ṽ(Ỹw,t (i)) and a regulating barrier
ĉ(i) such that ṽ(Ỹw,t (i)) ≤ 0 and
                                      ṽ(1/ĉ(i)) = 0                                 (A.6)

                                                 ṽy (1/ĉ(i)) = 0.                                 (A.7)

A particular solution to (A.5) is given by

while in this case the complementary solution has the form

                                                                γ(i)

When Ỹw,t (i) → 0, the length of time until the next wage adjustment can be made
arbitrarily long with probability arbitrarily close to one, then it should be the case that

                                      lim [ṽ(Ỹw,t (i)) − ṽ p (Ỹw,t (i))] = 0
                                   Ỹw,t (i)→0

A.2      Derivation of equations (26) and (27).
The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in state 1 is given by

ρV1 (·)dt = π(wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i))dt + V1,w (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i))dwt (j, i)
                +V1,W (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i))Et dWt (i) + V1,y (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i))Ỹt (i)θ0 (i)dt
                1                                                      1
                  V1,yy (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i))Ỹt2 (i)σ 2 (i)dt + V1,W W (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i))Et (dWt (i))2
                2                                                      2
                +V1,yW (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i))Et dWt (i)dỸt (i) + λV2 (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt0 (i))dt +
                −λV1 (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i))dt

where V1 (·) = V1 (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i)) which results from the standard application of
Ito’s Lemma, with the addition of the last two terms that account for the possibility of
switching to state 2 where Ỹt0 (i) denotes the level of the state variable Ỹt (i) in state 2.
In deriving the above equation, we have used the fact that in state 1, dwt (j, i) has finite
variation implying (dwt (j, i))2 = dwt (j, i)dWt (i) = dwt (j, i)dỸt (i) = 0. At the optimum,
V1,w (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i))dwt (j, i) = 0. Differentiating the above equation with respect to
wt (j, i), we obtain

ρV1,w (·)dt = π w (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i))dt + V1,W w (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i))Et dWt (i)
                                                                   1
              +V1,yw (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i))Ỹt (i)θ0 (i)dt + V1,yyw (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i))Ỹt2 (i)σ 2 (i)dt
                                                                   2
                 1
              + V1,W W w (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i))Et (dWt (i))2 +
                 2
              +V1,yW w (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i))Et dWt (i)dỸt (i) +
                  λV2,w (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt0 (i))dt − λV1,w (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i))dt.

We can now use the fact that the equilibrium will be symmetric across all j, so that
dwt (j, i) = dWt (i) which implies that also dWt (i) has finite variation. We can then
simplify the above expression to

      ρv1,w (Wt (i), Ỹt (i)) = π w (Wt (i), Ỹt (i)) + v1,y (Wt (i), Ỹt (i))Ỹt (i)θ0 (i)
                                   1
                                + v1,yy (Wt (i), Ỹt (i))Ỹt2 (i)σ 2 (i) + λv2,w (Wt (i), Ỹt0 (i)) +
                                   2
                                −λv1,w (Wt (i), Ỹt (i)),

where we have defined v1,w (Wt (i), Ỹt (i)) ≡ V1,w (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt (i)) and used the smooth-
pasting condition v1,w (Wt (i), Ỹt (i))dWt (i) = 0. Finally, noting that v2,w (Wt (i), Ỹt0 (i)) = 0
in state 2 because wage setters can adjust their wages, we can then obtain equation (26)
in the text.

                                                      36
    The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in state 2 is given by

                 +φV1 (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt0 (i))dt − φV2 (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt0 (i))dt.

where we have defined V2 (·) = V2 (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt0 (i)), θ00 (i) = θ + 1/2 · σ 2a (i) and σ 2a (i) =
σ 2ξ (i) + σ 2y + σ 2v (i) and noted that the state variable Ỹt0 (i) from state 2 to 1 is continuos.
      Optimality condition requires V2,w (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt0 (i)) = 0 (and so they are zero also
the second derivatives) and simplifies the above condition to

ρV2 (·)dt = π(wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt0 (i))dt + V2,W (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt0 (i))Et dWt (i) +
                                                                  1
            +V2,y (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt0 (i))Ỹt0 (i)θ00 (i)dt + V2,yy (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt0 (i))(Ỹt0 (i))2 σ 2a (i)dt
                                                                  2

                 +φV1 (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt0 (i))dt − φV2 (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt0 (i))dt.

By taking the derivative with respect to wt (j, i) and noting that the resulting equilibrium
is symmetric we can obtain

ρv2 (Wt (i), Ỹt0 (i))dt = π w (Wt (i), Ỹt0 (i))dt + v2,w (Wt (i), Ỹt0 (i))Et dWt (i) +
                                                                     1

where we have defined v2 (Wt (i), Ỹt0 (i)) ≡ V2,w (wt (j, i), Wt (i), Ỹt0 (i)). Since v2 (Wt (i), Ỹt0 (i)) =

                                     π w (Wt (i), Ỹt0 (i)) + φv1 (Wt (i), Ỹt0 (i)) = 0                                  (A.13)

which is condition (27) in the text.
   We can further elaborate on equation (A.13) noting that we can write it as
                    Ã              !1+η 

where we have used the results of the previous subsection of the appendix. Indeed they
still apply to derive v1 (Wt (i), Ỹt0 (i)) as discussed in the text with the caveat that now the
total discount factor to is (ρ + λ) instead of ρ. Clearly, a solution of the above equation
is of the form
                                        Wt (i) = c̃(i)Ỹt ξ t (i)εt (i)

which determines the wages in sector i in state 2 where c̃i solves the equation

where
                k(i)                     (1 + η)µ

                       γ(i) (ρ + λ) − θ (i)(1 + η) − 2 (1 + η)ησ (i)
Note again that in state 1, in the case of adjustment, wages are adjusted to

                                               Wt (i) = ĉ(i)Ỹt ξ t (i)εt1 (i)

where εt1 (i) represent the realization of εt at time t1 < t, which is the last time before t
at which state 2 occurred. In particular ĉ(i) solves the following equation
