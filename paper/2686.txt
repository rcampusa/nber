                                  I.   Background



A.   Firm Pension Plan Provisions.

      Approximately 75 percent of American workers are covered by defined
benefit pension plans.    These plans proaiee the employee a benefit at

retirement that is typically based on age, years of service, and his final

salary (or an average of earnings in the last few years of employment).

Within this general framework,   the benefit formulas of most plans provide a

large incentive to remain with the firm until some age and then a substantial
incentive   to leave the firm at some later age.     The specific provisions of

firm plans, however, vary enormously.    Thus the incentives for retirement or

departure   from the firm vary widely among firms.    Jhe incentives of plan

provisions and their variation among plans are described in detail by

Kotlikoff and Wise [1985]      Because the incentives vary so greatly among

plans, to analyze the effects of plan provisions on retirement,     it is

necessary to account for the precise provisions of an employee's plan.       It is

also critical to have information on past and current earnings in the firm.

For these reasons, we rely on firm personnel   records for this analysis.

     The easiest way to understand the incentive effects of pension plans is

to consider the relationship between age and total compensation -   -

Notes: All values are in 1980 dollars, calculated assuming a 5 percent
inflation rate. Income forecasts were computed using the estimated
income forecasting equation shown in appendix B. The individual was 50
years old on January 1, 1981, the date to which these calculations
correspond; he will accumulate 30 years of experience during the       in
which he reaches age 60. The adjusted pension benefits are paid year
                                                                 until
he is 65, and are only available if he retires between ages 55 and 65.
The social security benefits are unavailable until he is 62; the
reported benefits correspond to the benefits he would receive if he
collected them starting at age 62, or during the first year of his
retirement, whichever is later.  Source:  Authors' calculations.

 until age 55, early retirement benefits can be taken immediately and the
                                                                          early

 retirement reduction    factor is much less than actuarial.    In addition, the
 benefit formula includes a Social
                                   Security offset after age 65; pension

 benefits are reduced depending on the person'a Social
                                                       Security benefits.           but

 the offset is not applied to benefits received between 55 and
                                                               65, the normal

 retirement age.    This is a second important feature of the plan.      These

provisions    mean that there is a large incentive to stay in the firm until        55.

After 55, the incentive    ia reduced.   For the person represented    in the graph,

there is a sharp reduction    in the accrual of pension benefits at age 60, due

to the third important    feature of the plan.     If the person has 30 years of
service at age 60, he is entitled to full normal retirement
                                                            benefits.            That
is,   by continuing to work he will no longer gain from fewer years of early
retirement reduction,    as he did before age 60.     Other plan provisions   are not

discussed here, but are described in detail in Kotlikoff       and Wise [1987]



3.    Prior Emphasis on Social Security Provisions.

       The incentive effects inherent in the firm
                                                  pension plan provisions        are

much more important than thoae resulting from Social
                                                     Security provisions.
Indeed, this is typically the case.      Yet most prior research on retirement

behavior has been directed to the effects of Social
                                                    Security provisions.
Recent examples are Blinder, Gordon and Wise [1980]  Burkhauaer
                                                         ,               Hard

                                                                       [1984]
Burtlesa    [1986], Hauaman and Wise [1985].   With few exceptions, (Hurd and
Boakin [1981] end, to some extent, Hauaman and Wise [1985]), these studies

suggest only a modest effect of Social Security provisions      on retirement
behavior.    In contrast, there has been very little work
                                                          relating retirement

behavior of covered workers to the retirement incentives provided by their

pension plans.2        The apparent ceason for this lack of attention has been the

absence of appropriate data.

     Figure   1.
                   suggests three key requirements for analysis of the retirement

effects of pension provisions.           First, the data must include the precise

provisions of the individual's pension plsn, together with information               on

prior earnings records.         Second, the estimation method must account for sharp

jumps or drops in pension accrual in future years.          For example, in

                                                               is critical to
considering whether a person will leave the firm at age 50, it

account for the large "bonus" that he will get if he remains until age 55;

consideration      only of total compensation at age 50 is not sufficient.           Third,

the estimation method needs to account for the fact that individual

circunistancea, auth as the level of wage earnings, change over time.            Such

changes in turn affect future pension and Social Security accrual.             The

combination of firm data and the estimation method proposed here is intended

to meet these requirements.




C.   Prior Eatimation Methods.

      To date, in addition to least squares regression, two basic approaches

have been used to analyze retirement behavior.          The first is the method of

estimation developed to analyze the choices of individuals who face

discontinuous      or kinked budget constraints.     The second approach is the

continuous time failure rate or hazard model.           Since retirement   ia typically a

discrete outcome, but also has a time dimenaion          (age) which not only

characterizes     retirement but may also affect the desire for it, it is natural

to describe retirement within the context of a continuous time
                                                               qualitative

choice model.     These two approaches are described briefly in turn.

     The adaptation of non-linear budget constraint analysis to retirement                    may

be called the "lifetime budget constraint" approach.                   The central feature of

this method is a lifetime budget constraint analogous                 to the standard labor-

leisure budget constraint, but with annual hours of work replaced
                                                                  by years of
labor force participation,         snd annual earnings replaced by cumulative         life-

time compensation.       The optimal age of retirement            is determined by a utility

function defined over years of work (post-retirement years of leisure) and

cumulative compensation.         A   careful application of this approach to retirement

is by Burtlers    [1986] , who analyzed        the    effects   of changes in Social Security

benefits on the retirement.3

     While appealing         in many respects, this procedure has an important

drawback.     It implicitly assumes that individuals know with certainty the

opportunities    --   like   wage rates   --   that    will be available to them in the

distant future.       Although it is plausible to assume that so individual knows
his wage rate for the purposes of
                                  estimating annual labor supply, the simple

extension    of this idea to construct a lifetime budget constraint is not as

plausible.      How much does s 50-year-old person know about his wage at 67?

Concomitant with this assumption, the method makes no allowance for
                                                                    updating
of information about future opportunities as the individual
                                                            ages.


     3An analogous model was used by Venti and Wise [1984] to describe the
rent paid by low income families faced with discontinuous budget constrsints.

constraint specifications.       It is natural under this specification, however,

to update information as individuals age.       For example, if an individual has

                                                                         snd

                           II.    The Option Value Model




     The model proposed here incorporates the advantages of both of the

approaches   described above.    It allows updating of information, as does the

traditional hazard model, but also considers potential compensation many years

in the future, as does the nonlinear budget constraint approach.       Antecedents

of our work begin with Lazear and Moore [1988], who argue that the option

value of postponing retirement     is the appropriate variable to enter in a

regression equation explaining retirement.5     Our model is close in spirit to

the stochastic   dynamic programming model of Rust [1988a]   .   A dynamic


     5lndeed it was their work and analysis of military retirement rates by
Phillips and Wise [1987] that motivated us to pursue this approach.


     6Rust'a ]1988a    model poses substantially greater numerical    complexity
than ours and has not yet been estimated for retirement. In principle, he
observes not only the individual's retirement age, but subaequent consumption
decisions as well.  Thus his model allows the individual to optimize over age
of retirement and future consumption jointly. The choices are assumed to be
equivalent to the solution to a dynamic programming problem. As in our case,
the individual's expectations are conditioned on current known variables like
income. The idea is to recover the parameters of a utility function specified
in terms of these choice variables. In practice, though, he uses income to
describe consumption (Rust [l988b]), with a value funetion similar to ours,

specified in terms of income.  To simplify the solution to the dynamic

programming problem in his model, he assumes that random unobserved      individual
components   are independent over time, whereas we allow such terms in our model

(representing differences among individuals in health status, desire for
leisure, and the like) to be correlated.  In short, Rust has described a
solution to a more complicated choice than ours, but with uncorrelated errors,
whereas ours is a solution to a less complex problem, but with correlated
errors.

and Stern [l988].        Neither Rust nor Berkovec and Stern, however, have

information on private pension plan provisions,       the focus of our analysis.

Our strategy is to simplify the general stochastic programming problem to

facilitate its otherwise burdensome       econometric implementation.         These


simplifications      reduce the computational requirements   substantially while

retaining     the key forward-looking   features of the dynamic programming

approach.

       The key ideas of the model can be summarized briefly.             It is intended to


capture an important empirical regularity, the irreversibility             of the

retirement decision.       Although it is not uncommon to work   -   -   at   least part-

time   --   after   "retirement," it is rare to return to the job from which one has

retired.     The model focuses on the opportunity cost of retiring or,

equivalently,       on the value of retaining the option to retire at a later date.

It has two key aspects.       The first is that a person will continue to work at

any age if the option value of continuing work is greater than the value of


     7Berkovec and Stern's analysis is also in progress. They consider
transitions among three employment states over time. To simplify the solution
to their optimization problem, they, like Rust, assume that disturbance terms
are uncorrelared over time.        Their anslysis is in terms of individual
attributes like education,       race, health status, and age. Oovernment benefits
like Social Security are not explicitly modeled, whereas these benefits,               as

well as firm pension benefits play the central role in our analysis. We
estimate a discount, or weighting factor, whereas they obtain estimates of
other parameters conditional on an assumed discount rate. Age itself is used

explicitly to estimate retirement. As will be emphasized below, age is not a
direct determinant of retirement in our model. This has important
implications if the model is to be used to predict the effect of changes in
firm pension plan or Social Security provisions on retirement.

 immediate retirement.        In effect, the person compares the heat of expected

 future posaihilities    --   the option vaiue of     continuing   to work --      with      the

value of retiring now.        The second is that the individual reevaluates this

 retirement decision as more information about future
                                                      earnings
                                                                            -   - and   thus

 future retirement benefits -- becomes available with                 For example, a

decline in the wage between ages 56 and 57 will cause the individual                    to

reassess future wage earnings, and thus future
                                               pension benefits and Social

Security accrual as well.        Thus retirement may seem more advantageous upon

reaching 57 than it was expected to be at age 56.           Retirement     occurs when the

value of continuing work falls below the value of
                                                  retiring.

       Because the model is somewhat complex in its details, it is useful to

know whether a simpler model could capture the important features of this one:

in particular, whether a model that is easier to implement could predict

retirement   outcomes as well as the more complex model.           Ic is shown in

appendix A that a simplified version of the model developed here has an almost

direct hazard model counterpart.        Indeed, as is shown in the appendix,              the

proportional hazard model can be interpreted in terms of utility maximization,

contrary to a common misperception.          Hazard models are very simple to

estimate,    Unfortunately,     the hazard model is obtained only after
                                                                        imposing

precise specification as set forth in this paper is guided by two

considerations:    first, by the features of the firm data that are used in

estimation, and second, by the primary goal of the model, to
                                                             predict the

A.     The model.

        Consider an individual at the beginning of year t, who has not yet

retired.     Looking ahead, he will receive wage income
he continues to work; if he is retired in year        a,   he will receive real

retirement benefits 8.        (We adopt the convention     that if a is the firat

calendar year during which the person has no wage earnings, he is assumed to

have left the firm during the previous year, at the age that he was on January

1 of year a.)       Let r denote the first full year of the individual's retirement

             the first year in which the individual has no wage earnings).          As
(that is,

described above, these benefits will depend on the person's age and years of

service at retirement, and on his earnings history;          thus we typically write

Indeed, non-housing bequeathable wealth is reduced very little as the elderly
age (e.g. Venti and Wiae [1988], Bernheim [1987]). Thus there is substantial
evidence that the typical retired person is living largely from Social

Security and pension benefits.

        To develop a decision function relative to retirement, suppoae that the

individual    indirectly derives utility Uw(Ys) from the real income earned while

working, and utility Ur(Bs(t))          from the pension benefits received while

retired.     Suppose that in deciding whether to retire the individual weights

future income (or utility) by the discount factor                   fi,   and that   with probability

one he will die by year S.           If he retires at age          r, the weighted,      or

discounted, value received over the remainder of his life is:




(2.1)        V(r)     XLfi5tUw(Ys) +


Thus the value function Vt(t) depends on future earnings and retirement

benefits, which in turn depend on the age r at which he retires.

        The individual must choose either to work during year t, so thst r > t,

or to retire, so that r —       t.     Assume that he makes the decision by comparing

the expected value he would receive were he to retire now, at r                         t,    with the

greatest of the expected values from possible retirement                      dates r > t in the

future.     Let        denote the individual's expectation about future

circumstances,    based on information available to him at the beginning of year

t.   (With this convention,         real income             earned during year t is not known at

the beginning     of year t.)

        The expected gsin, st time t, from postponing retirement to age t is then

given by




(2.2)       G(r) — EtVt(r)      -
                                    EtVt(t).

      In the firm that provided our data, retirement is msndatory at age 70.

Thus we assume that the individual considers potential                       retirement ages between

t+l and the year of his seventieth birthday, t70.                      Let r* be the retirement

that, for a given individual, there should be considerablepersistence                          in

random individual effects follow a Markovian or first order autoregressive

B.      The probability of retiring.

         I.   Retirement probabilities for a single year.                The year in which an
individual retires is a random variable; we call it R.                     The probability that

an individual in the sample in year t-l retires in year                     t, that is   Pr[R =   t]
is the relevant probability when using cross-sectional                    data for a single year

t.      The probability        that the individual chooses not to retire is Pr(R > t]

From (2.4), an individual will retire in year t if       < 0 for all
                                                   Ct(r)
re[t+l          T).    Thus:




(2.12)         Pr[R—tJ —       Pr[Ct(r)   < 0 V re(t+l        T)J

                           =
                               Pr[g(r)+K(r)v <          0 V re(t+l       T)J

                           =
                               Pr[g(r)/IK(r) <           V re{t+l        T)].



Alternatively,        the final expression in (2.12) can be written:




(2.13)        Pr[R=t] =        Pr[g(r)/K(4)         <



where
         4    is the value of r that solves

Because the individual either retires at t or he

       2.   Retirement probabilities         for multiple years.             The data set analyzed


below contains data on individual retirement decisions for several consecutive

years.      To analyze these data tequires computing the probability that the

individual tetires in year r.              In general, suppose that the retirement status

is observed for years t               T.   An individual in the sample in year t-l
                                                                                  it
retires in year          rct      T) if there is no earlier age when he considers

                                        to retire in year r based on equation
optimal to retire, and if it is optimal
                                                                                      would have been,
(2.4).      If it had not been optimal to retire in year                  t, there


at time     t,    at least one future r with G(r) >              0.     This would occur if and only

if it were true for the          r   that maximized         g(r)/K(r),      evaluated    at year t.


That is, it requires that                               > -vt.        The same would have to be
                                     g(r)/K(r)
true for every year t through year r-l.                     In year r, however, retirement is

                                           < -v.       Thus
optimal,     so that       g1/K(r)

                                     g(r)/K7(r) <

            T.        The remaining possible event is that the individual               does not

 retire during the period of the data.                 The probability of this event is

        The retirement model thus reduces to a multinomial discrete choice

problem, with dependent error terms v5.                          Thus far, the only assumption about
the individual        effects is that they are Markov.                          Empirical    implementation,

however, requires additional distributional                           assumptions.          We assume that

variance of v. for          r      t   is     ÷ (r-t)o.              Thus there are two equivalent

ways to see that uncertainty about the future is reduced as the planning

horizon is shortened, presumably                as the person approaches                    typical retirement

ages.     First, their are fewer future random components                               of utility to cumulate
in the K(r) term (see equation 2.10).                       Second, the uncertainty about the

value of future random effects is reduced                        -   - the Msrkov assumption yields

decreasing var(u) as the planning horizon is shortened.                                     In particular, in a

given calender year, the uncertainty about the retirement decisions of younger

persons is greater than the uncertainty about older employees.                                    This property

          The option value model has been estimated based on a sample of 1500

salesmen 50 years of age or older on January                   1, 1981,     selected at random from

the firm data.        All persons in the sample are men performing similar jobs.                          To

facilitate      earnings forecasts,      the sample was restricted to persons who had at

least three years of service before 1980, the first year of our retirement


future income streams. However, the pension and Social Security calculations
are quite cumbersome. Beyond its substantial computational advantages, a
justification for the approximation that we use is that the benefits
calculations involve the entire earnings history of the individual. At least
for values of r in the near future, the unknown elements in these calculations
are small.

work.    The weight given to current versus future income in the retirement

decision is indicated by    ,   estimated    to be .847.     All of the parameters are

measured quite precisely, with the possible exception of $            (with a   standard

error of .032),   and each of the estimates seems quite plausible          to us.


Although a strong interpretation of the parameters of the model might treat $

aa a general measure of individuals' pure rate of time preference,              independent

from the decision to which it applies, it is probably more realistic to think

of it as a weight specific to the retirement decision.            Under either

however, estimated    directly in the option value model.          The estimated value is

undoubtedly   sensitive   to the model specification;       but under either

interpretation    it is nonetheless   surprising to us that it is measured as

precisely ss it is.

versions 3 and 4.     The only estimated parameter in model 3 is the varisnre

        Yet judging by the large difference in the likelihoodvalues the option

value model fits the data much better than the specification            based on a full

set of age dummy variables,     as reported in model 2.         Thus there is substantial

information    in the option value measures.          With age dummy variables,    the

astimsted    average departure rate for each age matches the actual rate.                The


option vslue specification      does not assure such a match.        But because


departure    rates very greatly among persons of the same age, the option value

model fits much better.      The option value model captures the variation, given

age; the dummy variable model does not.

        2.    The Model Fit

        The model fit is demonstrated by comparing actual and predicted

retirement      rates, shown in table 3.       Both the predicted annual rates and

predicted cumulative retirement are very close to the actual values.             In

particular,      the model captures each of the important jumps in the departure

rates.       The actual retirement   race at 55 is .078; the predicted rate is .075.

Of persons who are employed at age         50,   the actual proportion that has left by

age 54 is .139, as shown in the forth column of the table.           The model

                is .116.    The actual proportion that has left
prediction                                                      jumps to .206 at 55,
the predicted proportion to .182.         Again at age 60, the actual proportion

jumps from .488 to .599, the predicted proportion from .483 to .583.             At age

62,   the actual proportion jumps from .675 to .824 snd the predicted
                                                                      proportion
from .680 to .823.         Only at ages 65 and 66 do the predicted rates differ

noticeably from the actual ones, but chere are very few observations at these

ages.     In sddicion, only about 5 percent of persons employed at 50 would still

be employed at 65, based on the actual departure rates.

        To provide an external check of the predictive validity of the model,

parameter estimates based on 1980 retirement decisions were used to predict

1981 departure     rates, thst on average were higher than in 1980.       Actual versus

predicted cumulative departure rates, based on actusl versus predicted

departure rates by age, provide a summary of the results.           At ages 60 and 62,

they are as follows:12



        12The 1981 comparison is based on 1305 observations.

year, but also captures the noticeable increase in departure

1980 and 1981.        The actual increaaes were apparently due to changes in

expected future earnings or to differences in the distribution of seniority by

age, both of which enter the option value caculations.13



B.    Three Consecutive     Years

       1.   Parameter Estimates

       Estimates in this section are based on the same sample of employees used

to obtain the single-year estimates reported above, but those who don't leave

the firm in the first year are followed for two more years.                      Four outcomes are

possible:     a person retires in the first, the second, or the third year, or he

does not retire during the three-year period.                  Estimated parameters       of three

versions of the model are shown in table 4.                The first estimares pertain to

the model specification       as described       in section IT-E-2, with p           1.    In this

case, the only difference between the multiple- and single-year versions of

the model is that there are two error variances                  in the multiple-year      version:

                                                                          --   1980 in this case,
      the variance in the first of the observation years

and   r,    the variance of the "innovation"              in   the relationship     v5    V1   +


       13Real earnings of firm employees were in fact declining over this
period.

--   ia   much greater than the uncertainty about the option value of continued

work today.      This contributes            to greater uncertainty          about current departure

decisions     when comparison is made with more distant future retirement agea,

that is, when departure rates of younger employees are conaidered.                               (See the

diacuaaion following equation (2.17).)                  On the other hand, given °al' the

uncertainty about v5 is less than the uncertainty about 051.

      A    measure of the persiatence            in the individual disturbance is indicated

by the correlationbetween the v's in the first and second periods of the

sample; with the random walk specification;                      it is given by

rL/(r2Y(r2 +                   This correlation is .748 based on the model 1

estimates      in table   4.        Less persistence    is allowed by estimating p.               Parameter

estimates      based on this specification are shown in model                     2   in table   4.   The

estimated value of p is              .786.    Judging by the likelihood values in models I

and   2, the       statistic relative           to the hypothesis           that p is 1 ia 28.74 with

one degree of freedom.               Thus the strict random walk assumption is clearly

rejected.       On the other hand, the estimated variancea increase so that the

correlationbetween the first and second disturbance terms does not change

much.      In this case, it is given by pc3/(o)4(p2o3 +                       g)½ Its      value,

based on the model 2 estimates in table                     4,   is .708,    compared with a

with this observation, predicted average departure rates based on the two

models are very similar.

     Unlike other empirical retirement models, age is not a variable in the

option value model; ft enters only indirectly through the survival

probabilities   ir(slt),   the wage earning forecasts, and the firm pension plan

and Social Security rules.      A general test of the extent ro which retirement

behavior is        determined by the monetary variables       in the option value model

is the gain in the model fit when age itself is added.           We implement such a

teat by parameterizingk ma a function of age, allowing the relative value of

income without work to income with work to depend on age, independent of the

income variables    in the model.    In addition, this parameterizationis a way to

recognize   that the alternative to work at the firm may be another job, instead

of retirement, and thus that the systematic portion of the model may

undervalue the "retirement" option for some employees, especially at younger

ages.14 The model 3 estimates in table 4 are based on the specification

is this aspect of the specification that allows the model to fit departure
rates at younger ages, as shown in table 3 for the single-year model.

     2.   The Model Fit

     Like the single-year model, the fit of the three-yearversion can be

evaluated by comparing predicted versus actual departure rates.                The cesults

are shown in table     5.   It is analogous to the comparisonpresented in table               3,

based on the single-year model.      The annual retirement rate in table           5,   for

persons of a given age, is the average of the rates over the three estimation

years.    The cumulative figures are based on these average annual rates.                 Three

aspects of the results stand out:        First, the modal fits the data very well.

Second, there is little difference between the p a           1   and the p-estimated

versions of the model, although the p-estimated specification fits somewhat

better than the p a 1 model at older ages and somewhat less well at the

younger ages.   Thus even though the likelihood values in table 4 indicate that

the second version fits the data better, for practical purposes,               the strict

random walk assumption appears to be as conaistent with the data as the more

genersl specification.15      Third, the model may underpredict         the retirement


     15The x2  statistic is a more formal way to compare the model fits.
statistics  have been calculated for each of the three years, based on three
methods of estimation:   (1) The three-yesr model with p a 1, model 1 in table
4.   (2)  The three-year model with p estimated, model 2 in table 4. (3)
Independent estimates for each of the three years, with p a 1.   For example,
using the sample of persons that is still in the firm after 1980, estimates
are obtained for 1981, and similarly for 1982. The statistic is
                                                                 a(Aa
         where a indexes age, A is the actual number of persons that retired,
and E is the expected number, based on the model estimates. The results are
as follows:

rates of the few persons that remain in the firm at older ages.          In

particular,    both models underpredict retirement rates at      65.   Even with p

estimated,    the model eatimates   imply substantial persistence in individual

valuations of the option value of continued work, consistent with the behavior

of the vast majority of the sample.      For example,   if a person chooses not to

retire at 62 when there was a reasonable ex ante probability that he would,

the model uses this information to adjust downwsrd the probability            that he

will retire in the next year.       The results seem to suggest that this sssumed

persistence    of tastes may not carry through age 65.    There may be an age-65


"customary    retirement age" effect.    The sample size of older persons is so

small, however--only 2.5 percent of the sample is 64 or older--that

verification of this possibility will have to await estimation with larger

samples of older employees;    the current evidence can only be taken as

better than the p   1 model. And, although the indpendent estimate for i981
fits better than the p-estimated version of the three-year model_for that

year, it is not clear that that would be generally true in repeated
replications.  The independent estimate is worse for 1980 and only slightly
better for 1982. A tentative conclusion is that the p-estimated version of
the three-year model reproduces      the data very accurately.


     16Another variant of predicted versus actual departure rates shows the

probability that a person will rstire during the thtee year period that he is.
The conslusions are similar to those discussed above. In general, both
specifications fit the data very well. For example, of persons who were sga
55 on January 1, 1981, 24.8 percent left the firm between January 1, 1980 and
December 31, 1982. The predicted retirement rate based on the specification
with p    1 is 23.5 percent; it is 22.8 percent based on the specification with
p estimated.

                              IV.   Illustrative        Simulations

      To demonstrate the importance of firm pension plan provisions on

departure     rates, the effects of two alternatives are simulated.             The first is
a simple variant of the existing plan, increasing the early retirement age

from 55 to     60.   The second represents     a more fundamental change,                    the
                                                                          replacing

existing defined benefit plan with a defined contribution plan.                 In both

cases, the effects are quite dramatic.             The simulations are based on the

single-year     estimates   (model 5 in table 2, with p          1).    Additional

simulations,     chat compare the effects on retirement of changes in pension

versus Social Security provisions, are reported in Stock and Wise [1988].



A.   Increasing the Early Retirement Age

     Although retirement rates beginning at age 62 are very high, by that age
moat of those employed at age 50 have already left the firm.                 It is evident

that this is due in large part to the plan's early retirement provisions.                    To

quantify the importance of early retirement, we have simulated retirement

behavior under an alternative provision.               Early retirement under the

alternative    is at 60 instead of 55.        Otherwise the alternative is like the

existing plan.       Persons who are employed at 60 or older face the same
                                                                           options

under the alternative as under the existing plan.

     The results are reported in table 6.              The base retirement rates are the

single-year    model predictions    under the existing plan.           Under the existing

plan, almost half of those in the firm at age 50 have left before age 60.

Only 30 percent would have left if early retirement had been at age 60 instead
of 55, according to the simulation results.              With the existing plan, 36.7

percent of those employed at 50 leave the firm between 55 and 59.                With early

retirement at 60, only 11.5 percent would leave at these ages.            Almost no one

leaves just before age 60.      On the other hand, departure rates before 55, are

larger under the alternative, with a cumulative rate at 54 of .185,            versus

.116 under the existing plan.      This reflects the longer wait before the early

retirement bonus can be claimed.      Still, the net reduction       in departure rates

before age 60 is very substantial.



B.   A Defined Contribution versus The Defined Benefit Plan

      The incentive    effects inherent in the firm's age-compensation       profile are

largely the result of the provisions        of the pension plan.     An alternative td    a
defined benefit plan is a defined contribution plan.            Under a typical defined

contribution plan an amount equivalent to a certain percentage of an

employee's annual wage earnings is put in a pension fund.            Once vested,   the

amount that the employee has in the fund depends only on the contributions on

his behalf and on the return on these contributions.            Retirement benefits are

then based on the employee's accumulated assets in the fund at the time that

he retires.

     The effect of a change from the existing defined benefit to a defined

contribution plan is illustrated under two assumptions.            The first assumption

is that the defined benefit contribution rate is such that for a person who

has 30 years of service at age 60, the fair annuity value of the amount in the

defined contribution fund is the same as the present value of the retirement

benefits that the person would receive from the defined benefit plan were he

to retire at 60.      This requires that the contribution to the defined

contribution plan be equal to 7.5 percent of earnings.             The second assumption

is thst the contribution is equal to        5    instead of 7.5 percent of earnings.

The results are shown in table 7.

     Consider first the annual departure rates based on the 7.5 percent

contribution level.     Again, the comparison is with the predicted departure

rates based on the model 5 single-year estimates              shown in table 2.    There are

two important   features of the results:        First, the discontinuities        in the

departure   rates at 55 and at 60 are eliminated.             Departure   rates increase

smoothly between ages 50 and 61.     The jump at 62, due to Social Security

provisions,   remains, however.   The effect of the Social Security provisions             at

65 is now noticeable;   it was not before.          Second,    although retirement rates
after age 60 are lower under the defined contribution plan, departure rates at

earlier ages are much higher.     There is now no need to stay in the firm to

receive the "retirement bonus" at 55, or to receive full benefits at 60 with

30 years of service.    The net result is that more employees have left the firm

by age 60 under the defined contribution than under the defined benefit plan.
These results are consistent with the view that the defined benefit plan keeps

employees   in the firm until certain ages and then provides an incentive to

leave.   The defined contribution plan does not encourage them to stay, but if

they do, neither does it encourage them to leave.              Like departures under the

current firm plan, it should be sssuined that a large proportion of persons who

leave the firm at the younger ages under the simulated plan do so for another

job, whereas at older ages most ace leaving the labor force.                The results with

the 5 percent contribution rate are similar to those with the 7.5 percent

level, except that the departure rates are lower.




                           III.   Summary and Conclusiona



     We have presented a model of retirement based on the option value of

continued work.   A person continues to work if the option of selecting a

                                       -   31   -
better age of retirement in the future is worth more than the value of

retiring now.     The model is both forward looking at a point in time and allows

                about future eventa to be updated ma individuals age.               It thus
expectations

incorporated the advantages of non-linear budget constraint formulations of

the retirement    decision and the advantages of continuous time hazard model

formulations.     The Markovian   specification of the individual           random effects,

or the random walk special case of      it,   is an important component          of the model.

Single- and multiple-year     versions of the model yield very similar results.

     Predicted departure     rates based on the model match actual departure               rates


very closely.      In particular, discontinuous jumps in retirement rates at

specific ages are captured by the model predictions.               Out of sample


predictions     lend support to the predictive         validity of the model.

     Simulations of the effects of alternative pension plans show that plan

provisions have very dramatic effects on retirement rates.                  For example,

increasing     the early retirement   age from 55 to 60 would reduce by almost 40

percent the proportion of those employed at age 50 that has left the firm

before age 60.      At the same time, it would increase departure rates between 50

and 55, reflecting the longer wait until the early retirement "bonus" can be

claimed.

     Switching from the defined benefit to a defined contribution plan would

have even greater effects on firm departure rates.               The defined contribution

formulationhas no incentive effects.           Annual departure rates of persons 60

and over would be reduced substantially.               But, the departure    rates between 50

and 54 would be increased from around 3 to about 10 percent, close to the

departure    rate between 55 and 59, after the early retirement age, under the

existing plan.      It is also close to the departure rate of employees who are

under 50 and have just become vested in the existing firm plan.                  The net

                                          -   32   -
effect is to increase significantly    the proportion of those employed st age 50

who have left the firm before age 60.     These results support the view that

defined benefit plans provide a strong and effective incentive for employees

to stay in the fira until some age and then a strong and effective incentive

to retire at some later age.     The defined contribution plan does neither.

     Although these results are based on the retirement decisions of employees

in only one large firm, it is important to understand that the incentive

effects inherent in this firm's pension plan are very typical of defined

benefit plans.   Nonetheless,   we will in future work determine whether the

results are supported in similar analysis based on data from other firms.

 exponential distribution.                 Contemplating            the development below, suppose that

 S=t9(u)du is the utility gain from retirement at age                                   r.   The hazard rate is

                  H(r)j   =

 of the utility of retirement at time                       r.

        We adopt the convention that H(r) corresponds to the continuous time

probability in (Al), and Hr corresponds to its discrete time counterpart when
 r   is an integer.           With this notetion, for integer r (Al) can be written as



 (Al)         H      1

did not retire. If r          + e is the utility gain from retirement,

versus continued work, at age                r,       then the hazard model haa a standard utility

interpretation.           This interpretation will always be true for some

specification of the utility of retirement versus continued work.                                     Suppose
that              is monotonically increasing with r.                           Then retirement will

                            -                        >   -e]
                        1   -
                                exp[g(r)/K(r)]
                   =   I    -
                                exp(-1O5) exp(g(r)/K(r)
                   where

                                                               -
                                       g5(r)/K5(r)


Note   that the assumption that                                    is non-increasing implies that
                                g5(r)/k5(r)
   is non-negative.              Given thia, the condition for the second expression in

(AS) to be between 0 and 1 is that                                        0.    This initial term
                                                     g(r)/K(r)
is computed by the option value model.                     In the hazard model, however, this

would correspond to an intercept that can always be chosen so that this

condition      is satisfied.


       Numerical       values for the terms in (AS) would come from                             the
                                                                    evaluating

expressions      like those for V in the text, but in the
                                                          option value model the                      V
terma would clearly not be non-negative.                       In the proportional hazard model

would typically be expressed as                       where f(t) is a function
                                 f(t).exp(Xfl).h(Zm),
of age, X is a vector of variables that remain constant over time, and     are

variables      that change over time.        The latter variables              could in principle
include a variable like our                       but without estimating its parameters.
                                       Gt(r*),
The parameters would be assumed and estimation of the hazard model would
                                                                         yield
an estimated coefficient on the computed        values.
                                         Gt(r*)

       Comparison of (A.2) and (AS) shows that the option value model reduces

to the proportional hazard model if the error                          is ssaumed to be degenerate

over time with a unit exponential distribution, if g5(r)/k5(r)

                                         is set to zero.     In this case, the unit

averaged hazard rate is equal to the change, during
value of being retired.

     The assumption that g5(r)/K5(r)            be non-increasingis used to obtain

the closed form (AS).         This could be relaxed, however, by using (A.4) to

calculate    the probabilities,     although this would yield a non-standard hazard

model.   Similarly,     the assumption    of the unit exponential distribution could

be replaced by (say) the assumption of normality,            in which case (A.4) implies

that O. =    (-min[g0(r)/K(r)              g(rj)/K7(r)1), where '(.) denotes

the standard normal distribution.

     The similarity between (A.2) and (AS) has two implications.              On the one

                                                                      hazard
hand, it suggests chat an appropriate formulation of the proportional

model might be used to describe retirement behavior, avoiding the multiple

integrals    inherent in (2.15) and (2.16).           On the other hand, the derivation

makes clear how restrictive the assumptions underlying the proportional hazard

specification    are.    The derivation also provides a link between the utility

maximization problem discussed in section II and the conventional proportional

hazard model, which is typically presented in an ad-hoc manner with little

economic motivation.       While this derivation suggests covariates for its

estimation (namely those entering g(r)), it also makes its weaknesses more

 apparent.

        The estimation procedure uses earnings forecasts to compute the expected

value of the utility of future income, both when employed and after

retirement.     Pension benefits depend on the entire earnings history of the

individual at the firm up to the date of retirement.         Thus pension benefits

for future dates of retirement are in genecal based on both earnings history,

known to the individual at the current date, and forecasts of future earnings.

For example,    in 1981, estimates of the pension benefits that would be received

were retirement in 1986 involve known earnings through 1981 and forecasts for

the remaining years.

        The income forecasting equation, shown in table 8-1, was estimated
                                                                           using

98,465 observations,    including multiple observations for the same person,

taken from a panel of individuals in the same job category in the same firm as

the 1500 individuals that were used in the estimation        results reported in the

text.     The earnings data covet 1969-1984.     Nominal earnings were converted to

1980 dollars using the consumer price index.
                                                     St and At respectively denote
years of service at the firm and age; 072, 073, etc. are dummy variables for
the indicated years.     Income forecasts were computed using the average of the

coefficients on the dummy variables    for 1978-1980, where the 1980 coefficient

is normalized to be zero.

        The data set contains earnings from 1969 on.     Thus earnings before 1969

(for those who joined the firm before 1969) were back-cast using a

specification similar to the forecasting equation in table 8-1.        The estimates

(not reported here) were obtained using the same specification,        except that
time was reversed in the sense that all lags were replaced by leads.
