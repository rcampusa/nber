                                           ABSTRACT

We perform an econometric analysis of the effect of new drug launches on longevity, using data
from the IMS Health Drug Launches database and the WHO Mortality Database. Our data cover
virtually all of the diseases borne by people in 52 countries during the period 1982-2001, and enable

us to control, to an unusually great extent, for the effects of other potential determinants of
longevity, e.g. education, income, nutrition, the environment, and "lifestyle". We find that launches

of new chemical entities (NCEs) have a strong positive impact on the probability of survival.
Launches of (older) drugs that are not NCEs do not increase longevity. NCE launches account for
a significant fraction of the long-run increase in longevity in the sample as a whole. Between 1986
and 2000, average life expectancy of the entire population of sample countries increased by almost

two years. Our estimates imply that NCE launches accounted for 0.8 years (40%) of the 1986-2000
increase in longevity. The average annual increase in life expectancy of the entire population
resulting from NCE launches is .056 years, or 2.93 weeks.

         Longevity has increased throughout the world during the last half century.
According to the United Nations, life expectancy at birth increased from 46.5 years in
1950-55 to 65.0 years in 1995-2000 (Figure 1). 1 The rate of increase in the last quarter of
the 20th century was only half as great as the rate of increase in the previous quarter; still,
life expectancy at birth increased 5.2 years from 1975-1980 to 1995-2000. Moreover,
longevity in less-developed regions has grown much more rapidly than longevity in more
developed regions (Figure 2). In the last two decades, the gap has narrowed by 3.5 years.
Unlike per capita income, longevity is converging.
         Until recently, there appears to have been a consensus among health economists
(or at least authors of health economics textbooks) that the contribution of medical care to
longevity increase and other health improvements has been quite modest. Consider these
quotations from four textbooks:

         the empirical evidence indicates [that] the overall contribution of medical care to
         health is rather modest at the margin…education, lifestyle, the environment, and
         income [are] the major contributing factors (Santerre and Neun (2000, p. 69)).

         increase in life expectancy [has] been much more influenced by economic
         development than improvements in medical care…the most important medical
         advances are being brought about by improvements in information technology,
         not pills and scalpels (Getzen (1997, p. 330)).

         Research on the relationship between health status and medical care frequently
         has found that the marginal contribution of medical care to health status is rather
         small…any significant improvements in health status are more likely to originate
         from factors other than medical care…Factors that determine the level of health
         include income and education, environmental and life-style factors, and genetics
         (Henderson (1999, p.142)).

         The historical declines in population mortality rates were not due to medical
         interventions because effective medical interventions became available to
         populations largely after the mortality had declined. Instead, public health,
         improved environment, and improved nutrition probably played substantial roles
         (Folland, Goodman, and Stano (2001, p. 118)).




1
  Referring to the U.S., Nordhaus (2002, p. 17) estimated that, “to a first approximation, the economic
value of increases in longevity over the twentieth century is about as large as the value of measured growth
in non-health goods and services.”
                                                                                              4


         But some recent research has indicated that technological innovations in medicine
have had important positive impacts on health. Cutler and McClellan (2001) reviewed
case studies of technological change in the treatment of five conditions (heart attack, low-
birthweight infants, depression, cataracts, and breast cancer) in the U.S. They concluded
that “in most of the cases we analyzed, technological innovations in medicine are on net
positive. Technology often leads to more spending, but outcomes improve by even
more” (p. 23).
         In this paper, we will perform an econometric analysis of the effect of new drug
launches on longevity. Bresnahan and Gordon (1997) argue that “new goods are at the
heart of economic progress.” Investment in research and development (R&D) is a
prerequisite for new good development, and the pharmaceutical industry is the most
research- intens ive industry in the economy. Drugs are much more research- intensive
than most other goods and services utilized in the health care sector. As the data in the
following table show, in the U.S. in 1995 pharmaceutical industry R&D expenditure
accounted for almost a third of total health R&D expenditure and more than half of
industry health R&D expenditure.


       Total health R&D expenditure                                       $35.8 billion
       Industry health R&D expenditure                                    $18.6 billion
       Pharmaceutical industry R&D expenditure (NSF estimate)             $10.2 billion
       Pharmaceutical industry R&D expenditure (PhRMA estimate)           $11.9 billion

         Clinical studies of specific drugs have shown that these drugs increase longevity.
Here are three examples:
   •     Stenestrand et al (2001) studied the impact on survival of statin treatment
         following acute myocardial infarction. They found that 1-year mortality was
         9.3% in the no-statin group and 4.0% in the statin treatment group.
   •     Grier et al (2003) found that adding two experimental drugs to the standard four-
         drug chemotherapy regimen has significantly improved survival in patients with
         non- metastatic Ewing's sarcoma, a highly malignant bone cancer of children and
         young adults. The overall survival rate increased from 61 percent to 72 percent
         for Ewing's sarcoma patients with localized disease who underwent the
         experimental six-drug chemotherapy.
   •     The journal U.S. Pharmacist (2002) reported that patients suffering from
         advanced metastatic melanoma who were treated with a combination of an
                                                                                                      5


         investigational agent, Ceplene, and interle ukin-2 (IL-2) had twice the survival rate
         as patients who were treated with IL-2 only. The patients were enrolled in a three-
         year study. The study also showed that the Ceplene/IL-2 combination
         significantly increased survival in a subpopulation group of advanced metastatic
         melanoma patients with liver metastases. The rate of survival in this group was
         six times that of the group given IL-2 only.

         My objective is to assess the average or aggregate contribution of all new drug
introductions. The data I will analyze cover all of the drugs introduced in, and diseases
borne by people in, 52 countries during the period 1982-2001. Fortunately, launches of
new drugs in these countries have been carefully tracked since 1982 by IMS Health. 2
Moreover, we can determine the (primary) disease associated with each new drug.
Hence, we can measure the entry of new drugs, by disease, country, and year. Using data
from the World Health Organization, we can also measure mortality (the age distribution
of deaths) by disease, country, and year. Analysis of the relationship between new drug
launches and mortality using longitudinal, disease- level data from 52 countries enables us
to control, to an unusually great extent, for the effects of other potential determinants of
mortality, e.g. education, income, nutrition, the environment, and “lifestyle”.
         The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section I outlines an
econometric framework. Measurement issues and data sources are discussed in Section
II. Empirical results are presented in Section III. Implications of the estimates are
discussed in Section IV. Section V contains a summary.

    I.       Econometric framework

         We hypothesize that the age distribution of deaths from disease i in country j in
year t depends on the numb er of drugs launched to treat disease i in country j by year t-k,
and on other factors:

         AGE_DEATHijt = β ln(N_DRUGij,t-k ) + γ Xijt + ε ijt                           (1)

where

         AGE_DEATHijt = a statistic based on the age distribution of deaths from disease i
         in country j in year t

2
 Corresponding data on the launch of non-drug medical innovations (e.g. medical devices or surgical
procedures) do not seem to be available.
                                                                                                             6



        N_DRUGij,t-k = the number of drugs launched to treat disease i in country j by
        year t-k

        Xijt = a vector of other factors (e.g. education, income, nutrition, the environment,
        and “lifestyle”) affecting the age distribution of deaths from disease i in country j
        in year t

        Eq. (1) may be viewed as a health production function. AGE_DEATH is an
indicator of “health output”. N_DRUG may be viewed as an indicator of the level of
medical technology. 3 We specify AGE_DEATH to be a function of the logarithm of
N_DRUG because we hypothesize that there are diminishing returns to additions to the
stock of drugs. We specify a k- year lag in the relationship to allow for gradual diffusion
of new drugs to consumers; we will estimate the model using different assumed values of
k (k = 0, 1, 2,…).
        We hypothesize that many of the “other factors” affecting the age distributio n of
deaths from disease i in country j in year t (e.g. per capita income, public health
expenditure, and environmental quality) are invariant across diseases within a country
and year, invariant across countries within a disease and year, or invariant across years
within a country and disease. For biological reasons, people tend to die at younger ages
from some diseases than from others in a given year, in all countries. For economic and
other reasons, people tend to die at younger ages in some countries than in others in a
given year, from all diseases.
        Without loss of generality, we can decompose Xijt as follows:

        Xijt = α’it + δ’jt + θ’ij + ν’ijt                                                         (2)

where

        α’it = a fixed effect for disease i in year t

        δ’jt = a fixed effect for country j in year t

        θ’ij = a fixed effect for disease i in country j

3
 In his model of endogenous technological change, Romer (1990) hypothesized the production function Y
= (A L)1-α K α, where Y = output, A = the “stock of ideas”, L = labor used to produce output, K = capital,
and 0 < α < 1. The cumulative number of drugs launched (N_DRUG) is analogous to the stock of ideas.
                                                                                             7



Substituting (2) into (1),

        AGE_DEATHijt = β ln(N_DRUGij,t-k ) + γ (α’it + δ’jt + θ’ij + ν’ijt ) + ε ijt

                               = β ln(N_DRUGij,t-k ) + α it + δ jt + θij + uijt        (3)
where

        α it = γ α’it

        δ jt = γ δ’jt

        θij = γ θ’ij

        uijt = (γ ν’ijt + ε ijt )

        For example, suppose, as previous authors have argued, that environmental
quality is an important determinant of AGE_DEATH, and also that environmental quality
is correlated with N_DRUG. If environmental quality is invariant across diseases within
a country and year, then its effect on AGE_DEATH is completely controlled for by δ jt . If
environmental quality varies across diseases, but deviations from country-year means are
constant over time, then its effect on AGE_DEATH is completely controlled for by δ jt
and θij. If environmental quality varies across diseases, and deviations from country-year
means are not constant over time, estimates of β will be consistent as long as the
deviation of environmental quality from its mean deviation from country- year means is
uncorrelated with the deviation of ln(N_DRUGij,t-k ) from its mean deviation from
country-year means. The same argument applies to other potential determinants of
AGE_DEATH (income, education, etc.).
        While we can measure the stock of drugs by disease, country, and year, due to
data limitations, we cannot measure the availability of medical devices (or of diagnostic
surgical procedures). If changes in the stock of devices are uncorrelated across diseases
with changes in the stock of drugs, the drug-stock coefficient is unbiased. If changes in
the stocks of devices and drugs are correlated (controlling for the fixed effects in eq. (3)),
the drug-stock coefficient could be biased. The direction of bias depends on the sign of
the correlation. If the change in the stock of devices is negatively correlated across
diseases with the cha nge in the stock of drugs, the drug-stock coefficient is downward
                                                                                                            8


biased. Some evidence suggests that this correlation may indeed be negative.
Lichtenberg (1996, 2001) presented evidence that use of newer drugs is associated with
lower utilization of hospital care. Since use of some medical devices, such as stents and
artificial hearts, requires hospitalization, drugs and devices may be substitutes rather than
complements. Moreover, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
(2002), in 1999 the number of Americans using prescription drugs (172 million) was over
eight times as large as the number with any hospitalizations (20 million).
         If pharmaceutical companies are more likely to launch drugs in
product/geographic markets where they will have the largest impact on AGE_DEATH,
then eq. (3) could result in an overestimate of the average longevity impact of new drug
launches. While this possibility cannot be entirely ruled out, there are reasons to doubt
substantial overestimation of the average longevity impact. First, previous studies of the
determinants of drug launch have not found any evidence that pharmaceutical companies
are more likely to launch drugs in product/geographic markets where they will have the
largest impact on AGE_DEATH: Danzon et al (2003) and Kyle (2003) both found that
market size (population) and the regulatory regime are important determinants of the
probability of drug launch. 4 Second, if pharmaceutical firms tend to launch in markets
where the benefit of launch is greatest, they are likely to launch in markets with the
highest total, rather than average, longevity benefit. Suppose that the expected effect of
a new leukemia drug on mean age at death in country A is 6 months, and that the
expected effect in country B is 1 month. If 10 times as many people suffer from
leukemia in country B as do in country A, then the social (and presumably private)
benefits to launch in country B is higher, even though the benefit per patient is lower.
Changes in AGE_DEATH reflect the average, rather than total, longevity benefit.




4
 These determinants are likely to be well controlled for by the fixed effects in eq. (3). Kyle found that firm
characteristics (e.g. whether the firm was a domestic firm) and other factors also played a role.

    II.      Measurement

Drug launches

          We used data from the IMS Health Drug Launches database 5 to construct
estimates of the number of drugs launched to treat disease i in country j by year t-k. This
database has tracked new product introductions worldwide since 1982. In August 2001
the database contained over 165,000 records of individual product introductions between
1982 and 2001. 72 countries are covered; many have been tracked since 1982. Data on
product introductions is gathered from the IMS Health network of offices around the
world and reflects the information on the product at the time of launch into each country.
          Each record in the database contains the following information: the date and
country of product launch, the active ingredient(s) of the product, a dummy variable
indicating whether the product’s ingredient is a new chemical entity (i.e. whether no
products containing this ingredient have been launched anywhere before), and the
therapeutic class of the product. The IMS therapeutic classification is extremely detailed;
we recoded (aggregated) therapeutic classes into 11 therapeutic areas (e.g. nervous
system drugs, respiratory drugs).
          We constructed a list of all of the ingredients occurring in the database. This list
contained information about two ingredient attributes: (1) whether the ingredient was a
new chemical entity (i.e. was not launched anywhere in the world before 1982), and (2)
the therapeutic area most frequently associated with the ingredient. 6
          We also constructed, for each country, a list of the active ingredients contained in
products launched anytime during 1982-2002, and the first year in which that ingredient
was observed in that country. We then merged the list of ingredients by country with the
list of ingredient attributes. This enabled us to determine, for each country and
therapeutic area, the total number of ingredients launched, and the number of new
chemical entities launched.
          The IMS Health Drug Launches database yields reliable estimates of the number
of new (post-1981) drugs, but not of the number of old (pre-1982) drugs, or of the total
5
 IMS Health Drug Launches is now known as IMS Lifecyle New Product Focus.
6
 A drug can be associated with more than one therapeutic area. For example, 6 products containing
cefmenoxime were classified as infectious/parasitic disease drugs, and 5 products containing cefmenoxime
were classified as sensory organ drugs.
                                                                                                      10


(new + old) number of drugs. This is due to the fact that the launch data are right-
censored: the IMS Health Drug Launches database does not cover products that were
launched before 1982. Suppose that products launched in a country before 1982
contained a certain ingredient, but that no products launched since 1982 did. Provided
that the products launched before 1982 are still on the market, that ingredient is still
available to consumers, but we would not count it as an available ingredient. We can
accurately measure the number of new drugs since, if an ingredient is identified by IMS
as a new chemical entity, it could not have been launched prior to the initial launch date
provided in the database.
        If an ingredient is designated an NCE, then we can be confident that the date of
the earliest observed launch of that ingredient in that country is the initial launch date.
However, if an ingredient is not designated an NCE, then the date of the earliest observed
launch of that ingredient in that country may not be the initial launch date—the ingredient
may have been launched in that country prior to 1982. 7 In other words, NCE launches
are guaranteed to be initial launches, but non-NCE launches may be either initial
launches or re- launches; we suspect they are predominantly the latter.
        To address the censoring problem, we will estimate two different models:


        AGE_DEATHijt = β NCE ln(CUM_NCEij,t-k ) + α it + δ jt + θij + uijt                     (4a)

        AGE_DEATHijt = β NCE ln(CUM_NCEij,t-k ) + β NON ln(CUM_non-NCEij,t-k )

                                                   + α it + δ jt + θij + uijt                  (4b)
where
        CUM_NCE = the cumulative number of NCEs launched
        CUM_non-NCE = the cumulative number of non-NCEs launched


        In eq. (4a), AGE_DEATH depends only on the cumulative number of NCEs
launched, whereas in eq. (4b), it depends on both the cumulative number of NCEs
launched and the cumulative number of non-NCEs launched. We hypothesize that β NCE


7
  Numerous products containing the same ingredient may be launched (e.g. by branded and generic firms)
in a given country.
                                                                                              11


> β NON, i.e. that increases in the stock of NCEs increase AGE_DEATH more than
increases in the stock of NCEs. While one might expect β NON to be positive, or at least
nonnegative, we can think of a reason why β NON might be negative. Our basic hypothesis
is that the greater the proportion of people consuming NCEs, the higher mean age at
death will be. It is plausible that the proportion of people consuming NCEs is positively
related to the number of NCEs launched and negatively related to the number of non-
NCEs launched. Suppose, for example, that β NON = - β NCE ; then eq. (4b) reduces to


          AGE_DEATHijt = β NCE ln(CUM_NCEij,t-k /CUM_non-NCEij,t-k )

                                                   + α it + δ jt + θij + uijt

AGE_DEATH depends on the ratio of NCEs to non-NCEs approved. The higher this
ratio, the higher the probability that a person is consuming an NCE, as opposed to a non-
NCE drug.

Age distribution of deaths

          We obtained data on the age distribution of deaths, by disease, country, and year,
from the World Health Organization (WHO) Mortality Database. 8 These data enable us
to compute the fraction of deaths that occur above (or probability of survival until)
certain ages, such as 55 and 65 years of age.
          We wish to provide estimates of the impact of new drug launches on life
expectancy (at various ages, and for the population overall), as well as on survival
probabilities. While complete life tables (which include life expectancies and survival
probabilities) are available at the country level for various years, there are no disease-
specific life tables, e.g. there are no published data on life expectancy of people with
heart disease. However, we believe we can use aggregate life tables to translate our
estimates of the impact of new drug launches on survival probabilities into estimates of
the impact of new drug launches on life expectancy.
          We obtained two different samples of country- level life tables: a time-series of
decennial life tables for the U.S. for the period 1900-2000, and a cross-section of life

life expectancy (years of remaining life) at age a (LEa, a = 0, 5, 10,…, 100), and the
probability of survival from birth until age 65 (SURV65). The data suggest that SURV65
is a fairly good “sufficient statistic” for characterizing changes or differences in life
expectancy. This is illustrated by Figure 3, which graphs life expectancy at two different
ages (birth and age 30) against SURV65, using data from the 11 decennial U.S. life tables
during the period 1900-2000. The R2 of the regression of life expectancy at age 30
(LE30 ) on SURV65 is .974, and the slope is 30.9, indicating that a .01 increase in
SURV65 is associated with a 0.31-year increase in LE30 . The R2 of the regression of life
expectancy at birth (LE0 ) on SURV65 is even higher (.997), and the slope is 66.0,
indicating that a .01 increase in SURV65 is associated with a 0.66-year increase in LE0 .
         We computed the regressions of life expectancy at each age (LEa, a = 0, 5, 10,…,
100) on SURV65, using both the time-series U.S. sample of life tables, and the cross-
sectional international sample. The regression coefficients are plotted in Figure 4. The
estimates yielded by the two samples are fairly consistent with one another. For example,
the slopes of the age-0 U.S. and international regressions are 66.0 and 60.3, respectively,
and the slopes of the age-30 regressions are 30.9 and 34.3, respectively.
         Suppose that we estimate eq. (4a), where AGE_DEATHijt is defined as
PCT_GT65ijt —the percent of deaths from disease i in country j in year t that occurred
above the age of 65. PCT_GT65 is presumably a reasonable estimate of SURV65.
Hence β NCE ≈ δ SURV65 / δ ln(CUM_NCE). To estimate δ LEa / δ ln(CUM_NCE), we
simply multiply β NCE by the regression coefficient shown in Figure 4. For example,
using the U.S. estimate, δ LE0 / δ ln(CUM_NCE) = 66.0 * β NCE .
         In addition to estimating the impact of new drug launches on life expectancy at
given ages, we can estimate the impact on the overall life expectancy of the
population(LEPOP ),9 by calculating the weighted average of the regression coefficients
shown in Figure 4, weighting by the share of the population in each age group. The
resulting life-expectancy multipliers are as follows:10


9
  LEPOP = (Σa wa LEa ), where wa is the share of the population in age group a.
10
   We used the age distribution of the U.S. in 1995 to construct the U.S. figure, and the age distribution of
the world in 1995 to construct the international figure.

To convert an estimate of the effect of a change in ln(CUM_NCE) on SURV65 to an
estimate of its effect on life expectancy of the overall population, simply multiply by 33!

Linkage of drug launches to diseases

        The drug launches documented in the IMS Health Drug Launches database are
classified by therapeutic category. The classification system used by IMS is very
detailed, but hierarchical. At the lowest (most detailed) level, there are more than 500
therapeutic classifications, e.g. prostaglandin antiulcerants (A2B3), and ACE inhibitor
combinations with calcium antagonists (C9B3). At the highest level, there are 16
categories, e.g. Alimentary Tract And Metabolism (A), and Cardiovascular System (C).
        The deaths documented in the WHO Mortality Database are classified by cause
(disease), using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). 11 Like the drug
classification system, the ICD is very detailed, but hierarchical. At the highest level,
there are 17 disease categories, e.g. Neoplasms (ICD10 codes C00-D48) and Diseases of
the circulatory system (I00-I99).
        The high- level IMS drug classification corresponds quite closely to the high- level
ICD disease classification. 12 For example, cardiovascular system drugs obviously
correspond to (are used to treat) diseases of the circulatory system. We defined 11 broad
disease categories, and classified drug launches and deaths into these categories as
follows:




11
   From 1982 to 1993, all deaths were classified using the ninth revision of the ICD (ICD9). In 1994, some
countries began to report mortality data using the tenth revision of the ICD (ICD10). By 2001, most
countries reported mortality data using the ICD10.
12
   Establishing a correspondence between the two classifications at a more detailed level is far more
difficult.

Descriptive statistics

       The IMS Health Drug Launches data indicate that 864 NCEs were introduced
worldwide during 1982-2001. Figure 5 shows the number of NCEs introduced in each
year. The annual number ranged from 34 to 59.
       Figure 6 shows the distribution of NCEs launched, by principal therapeutic class.
The four largest classes account for 54% of all NCEs launched. As shown in Figure 7,
the distribution of deaths, by cause (each cause corresponds to a therapeutic class), is
much more skewed. One cause—circulatory diseases—accounts for almost half (48%) of
all deaths. The next three largest causes are neoplasms (27%), respiratory diseases
(10%), and digestive/endocrine/nutritional/metabolic diseases (8%). The four largest
causes account for 93% of deaths.
       Table 1 shows the number of NCEs launched, by country, for countries covered in
the database from 1982 to at least 2001. The three countries with the largest number of
NCE launches (over 400) were Italy, Japan, and the U.S. Even in these countries, fewer
                                                                                                        15


than half of NCEs launched worldwide were launched. In six of the 40 countries—
Malaysia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Pakistan, and Indonesia—fewer than 200
NCEs were launched.
            Table 2 shows the number of deaths, and the percent of deaths at age greater than
or equal to 65, by country, in the most recent year for which mortality data for that
country were available.

     III.      Empirical results


            Estimates of eqs. (4a) and (4b) are shown in Table 3. The dependent variable in
all equations is the fraction of deaths that occurred at age 65 and over. 13 All equations
were estimated using data on 11 diseases in 52 countries over a maximum of 20 years
(1982-2001). All equations included complete sets of country*year, disease*year, and
country*disease interaction effects. For example, the zero- lag equation (k = 0), which
was estimated using 4678 observations, included 496 country*year effects, 189
disease*year effects, and 502 country*disease effects. The equations were estimated via
weighted least squares, using the number of deaths in that disease-country- year cell as the
weight.
            The first column of Table 3 shows the regression of AGE_DEATHijt on
ln(CUM_NCEijt ), i.e. a regression on the contemporaneous stock of NCEs, without
controlling for the stock of non-NCEs. The estimate of β NCE is positive and statistically
significant, which is consistent with the hypothesis that NCE launches increase longevity.
The second column of the table shows the regression of AGE_DEATHijt on both
ln(CUM_NCEijt ) and ln(CUM_non-NCEijt ). Controlling for the stock of non-NCEs has
very little impact on the estimate of β NCE . The estimate of β NON is negative and
marginally significant, suggesting that, conditional on the cumulative number of NCE
launches, the greater the cumulative number of non-NCE launches, the lower the
probability of survival to age 65. This is consistent with the view that increasing the ratio



13
   We also estimated models using the log-odds of survival until age 65, i.e. log(PCT_GT65/(1 –
PCT_GT65)), and using a different age threshold (55 instead of 65). The results were qualitatively similar
to those reported in the text.
                                                                                                         16


of non-NCE to NCE launches reduces the fraction of people consuming NCEs, which in
turn reduces longevity. The difference (β NCE - βNON) is positive and significant.
         The remaining columns of Table 3 present regressions that are similar, except the
regressors are lagged, rather than contemporaneous, values of the stocks of NCEs and
non-NCEs. The third column of Table 3 shows the regression of AGE_DEATHijt on
ln(CUM_NCEij,t-1 ), i.e. a regression on the stock of NCEs in the previous year, without
controlling for the stock of non-NCEs. The estimate of β NCE is about 50% larger than it
is in column 1, suggesting that longevity is more closely related to the lagged stock of
NCEs than it is to the contemporaneous stock, presumably due to gradual diffusion of
NCEs following launch. The fourth column of the table shows the regression of
AGE_DEATHijt on both ln(CUM_NCEij,t-1 ) and ln(CUM_non-NCEij,t-1 ). As before,
controlling for the stock of non-NCEs has very little impact on the estimate of β NCE . The
estimate of β NON is also about 50% larger than it is in column 2, as is the estimate of the
difference (β NCE - βNON).
         The fifth column of Table 3 shows the regression of AGE_DEATHijt on
ln(CUM_NCEij,t-2 ), i.e. a regression on the stock of NCEs two years earlier, without
controlling for the stock of non-NCEs. Once again, the estimate (and t-statistic) of β NCE
increases by about 50%. The sixth column of the table shows the regression of
AGE_DEATHijt on both ln(CUM_NCEij,t-2 ) and ln(CUM_non-NCEij,t-2 ). The estimate of
βNON is slightly smaller, and less significant, than it was in column 4.
         The remaining columns of Table 3 show estimates of the model for higher (3- to
6-year) lags between the stock of drugs launched and the age-65 survival probability.
The estimate of β NON is not significantly different from zero when the lag is 3 or more
years. 14 As summarized in Figure 8, the estimate of β NCE increases as the lag increases
from 0 to 3 years, and then levels off. This suggests that it takes three years for new NCE
launches to have their maximum impact on survival rates. We hypothesize that this is
due to the gradual diffusion of drugs to consumers following launch.
14
  The insignificance of βNON suggests that the launch of generic drugs does not increase longevity. This
might seem surprising, since generic launches might be expected to increase access and utilization of drugs.
However Berndt, Kyle, and Ling (2003) found that utilization of H2 -antagonist drugs by Americans
declined following patent expiration; this may be due to the fact that branded firms cut back considerably
on marketing efforts beginning several years prior to patent expiration. Moreover, the ratio of generic
prices to branded prices may be much higher outside the U.S. than it is in the U.S.
                                                                                                          17


             If NCEs diffuse gradually following launch, this might be reflected in
pharmaceutical expenditure behavior. An increase in the stock of NCEs is likely to result
in an increase in per capita pharmaceutical expenditure, via both increased utilization and
higher prices. From the OECD Health Database, we obtained data, by country and year,
on per capita pharmaceutical expenditure, expressed in U.S. dollars, evaluated at PPP
(Rx_expend). 15 After linking these data to the IMS Health Drug Launches data, we
estimated the following equation for different values of k (k = 0, 1, 2,…,6):

             ln(Rx_expend jt ) = β expend ln(CUM_NCEj,t-k ) + δt + θj + ujt                 (5)

The estimates are shown in the following table.


lag                  0            1             2            3             4            5             6

s.e.               0.0132      0.0134       0.0135        0.0140       0.0161        0.0189        0.0230

p-value            0.5104       0.861       0.2849        0.0211       0.0097        0.0239        0.0848

For k < 2, β expend is not significantly different from zero. This suggests that increases in
the stock of NCEs have no impact on per capita pharmaceutical expenditure within two
years. However, for 3 < k < 5, β expend is positive and statistically significant: increases in
the stock of NCEs increase per capita pharmaceutical expenditure after three years.
These results seem consistent with the time profile of the estimated effect of β NCE (the
impact of the NCE stock on survival probability). Estimates of β NCE and β expend at
different lag values are plotted in Figure 9. It takes three to five years for an increase in
the stock of NCEs to have its full impact on both pharmaceutical expenditure and
survival rates.


       IV.       Implications of the estimates


             Our estimates can be used to provide answers to several important questions:


15
     Unfortunately, these data are not available by disease, and are only available for OECD countries.
                                                                                                    18


     •   How much of the cross-country variation in longevity in a given year (e.g. 2000)
         is explained by international variation in the stock of NCEs launched since 1982?
     •   How much of the long-run increase in longevity in the sample as a whole is due to
         the launch of NCEs?
     •   What is the cost per life- year gained from the launch of NCEs?


To answer these questions, we will use the estimate of β NCE from column 9 of Table 3,
i.e. we will assume that (∆PCT_GT65ijt / ∆ln(CUM_NCEij,t-4 )) = .0065. Recall that this
estimate controls for all other factors affecting PCT_GT65 that are invariant across
diseases within a country and year, invariant across countries within a disease and year,
or invariant across years within a country and disease. Also, as argued above, the effect
of NCE launches on life expectancy at birth (LE0 ) can be approximated by (63.2 * .0065)
= 0.4105, and the effect of NCE launches on average life expectancy of the entire
population (LEPOP ) can be approximated by (33.0 * .0065) = .2145.


Cross-sectional differences


         Heterogeneity with respect to NCE launches appears to explains very little of the
international variation in longevity. 16 As shown in Table 1, the countries with the highest
and lowest number of NCE launches during the period 1982-2001 were Italy (422 NCE
launches) and Malaysia (122 NCE launches), respectively. According to our estimates,
the predicted difference in life expectancy at birth resulting from this launch differential
is ∆LE0 = 0.4105 * ∆ln(CUM_NCE) = 0.4105 * ln(422/122) = .51 years. This is only 9%
of the difference between life expectancy at birth in Italy (78.7) and Malaysia (73.0) in
2000-2005.17




16
   Sample selection bias could conceivably lead us to underestimate the role of NCE launches in
international longevity variation. WHO monitors mortality in 191 countries; IMS monitors drug launches
in only 72 countries. Perhaps the number of NCEs launched in countries not monitored by IMS tends to be
much lower than the number of NCEs launched in countries monitored by IMS.
17
   As reported in the United Nations World Population Prospects Database.
                                                                                                       19


Time-series differences


        In contrast, NCE launches appear to account for a significant fraction of the long-
run increase in longevity in the sample as a whole. To measure this contribution, we
adopted the following procedure. First, we inferred the average growth of PCT_GT65
from estimates of the year effects (δ t ‘s) from the following equation:


        PCT_GT65ijt = δt + θij + uijt

(δt - δ1986) is an estimate of the change in the survival rate (and 33.0 * (δ t - δ1986 ) is an
estimate of the change in LEPOP ) between 1986 and year t (t = 1987, 1988,…, 2000),
controlling for country*disease effects. Second, we inferred the average rate of growth
of CUM_NCE from estimates of the year effects (λt ‘s) from the following equation18 :


        ln(CUM_NCEijt ) = λt + ψ ij + vijt

(λt - λ1986) is an estimate of the change in the log of the stock of NCEs between 1986 and
year t, controlling for country*disease effects. Finally, the contribution of NCE launches
to the increase in survival rates between 1986 and year t is equal to (.0065* (λt - λ1986 )),
and the contribution of NCE launches to the increase in LEPOP is equal to (33.0 * .0065*
(λt - λ1986)).
        These calculations are summarized in Figure 10. Between 1986 and 2000,
average life expectancy of the entire population increased by almost two (1.96) years.
(The fraction of deaths that occurred at or above age 65 increased by 6 percentage
points.) Our estimates imply that NCE launches accounted for 0.79 years (40%) of the
1986-2000 increase in longevity. The average annual increase in life expectancy of the
entire population resulting from NCE launches is .056 years (= 0.79 / 14), or 2.93 weeks.
        These results suggest that launch delays reduce longevity. Suppose that drugs
tend to be launched much later in country B than they are in country A, so that country
B’s stock of drugs today is the same as country A’s stock 5 years ago. The estimates

18
   Both this and the previous equation were estimated via weighted least squares, weighting by the number
of deaths in that disease-country-year cell.
                                                                                           20


imply that this launch delay reduces the average longevity of the entire population in
country B by about 15 weeks. Danzon, Wang and Wang (2002) present evidence that
countries with lower prices or smaller market size experience longer delays in access to
new drugs.


Cost per life-year gained from the launch of NCEs


        The cost per life- year gained from the launch of NCEs appears to be extremely
low. OECD data indicate that in 1997, average per capita pharmaceutical expenditure in
OECD countries was about $250. The average annual increase in life expectancy of the
entire population resulting from NCE launches is .056 years. The ratio of these two
numbers—pharmaceutical expenditure per person per year divided by the increase in life-
years per person per year attributable to NCE launches—is about $4500. This is far
lower than most estimates of the value of a life-year (Nordhaus (2002), Murphy and
Topel (2003)). Moreover, since the numerator includes expenditure on old drugs as well
as on recently- launched NCEs, it probably grossly overstates the cost per life- year gained
from the launch of NCEs.

   V.        Summary

        Until recently, there appears to have been a consensus among health economists
(or at least authors of health economics textbooks) that the contribution of medical care to
longevity increase and other health improvements has been quite modest. But some
recent research has indicated that technological innovations in medicine have had
important positive impacts on health.
        In this paper, we have performed an econometric analysis of the effect of new
drug launches on longevity. Drugs are much more research- intensive than most other
goods and services utilized in the health care sector, so new drug introductions account
for a substantial fraction of medical innovations.
        Our sample included data on virtually all of the diseases borne by people in 52
countries during the period 1982-2001. Analysis of the relationship between new drug
launches and longevity using these data enabled us to control, to an unusually great
                                                                                              21


extent, for the effects of other potential determinants of longevity, e.g. education, income,
nutrition, the environment, and “lifestyle”.
         We used data from the IMS Health Drug Launches database to construct estimates
of the number of drugs launched to treat eleven different diseases in each country in each
year. This database has tracked new product introductions worldwide since 1982, and
contained over 165,000 records of individual product introductions. We obtained data on
the age distribution of deaths, by disease, country, and year, from the World Health
Organization (WHO) Mortality Database. These data enabled us to compute the fraction
of deaths that occur above (or probability of surviva l until) certain ages, such as 55 and
65 years of age.
         We found that launches of New Chemical Entities (NCEs) have a strong positive
impact on the probability of survival. The estimates indicated that it takes at least three
years for new NCE launches to have their maximum impact on survival rates. This is
probably due to the gradual diffusion of drugs to consumers following launch; data on
pharmaceutical expenditure were consistent with this interpretation.
         Launches of (older) drugs that are not NCEs—many of which may already have
been on the market—do not increase longevity. Indeed, some estimates indicated that,
conditional on the cumulative number of NCE launches, the greater the cumulative
number of non-NCE launches, the lower the probability of survival to age 65. This is
consistent with the view that increasing the ratio of non-NCE to NCE launches reduces
the fraction of people consuming NCEs, which in turn reduces longevity.
         Heterogeneity with respect to NCE launches appears to explains very little of the
international variation in longevity. But NCE launches appear to account for a significant
fraction of the long-run increase in longevity in the sample as a whole. Between 1986
and 2000, average life expectancy of the entire population of sample countries increased
by almost two (1.96) years. Our estimates imply that NCE launches accounted for 0.79
years (40%) of the 1986-2000 increase in longevity. The average annual increase in life
expectancy of the entire population resulting from NCE launches is .056 years, or 2.93
weeks.

       Previous authors have shown that countries with lower prices or smaller market
size experience longer delays in access to new drugs; our results imply that launch delays
reduce longevity.
       The cost per life- year gained from the launch of NCEs appears to be extremely
low. Pharmaceutical expenditure per person per year divided by the increase in life-years
per person per year attributable to NCE launches is about $4500--far lower than most
estimates of the value of a life-year. Moreover, since the numerator includes expenditure
on old drugs as well as on recently- launched NCEs, it probably grossly overstates the
cost per life- year gained from the launch of NCEs.

The dependent variable in all equations is the fraction of deaths that occurred at age 65 and over. All equations were
estimated using data on 11 diseases in 52 countries over a maximum of 20 years (1982-2001). All equations included
complete sets of country*year, disease*year, and country*disease interaction effects. For example, the zero-lag equation (k =
0), which was estimated using 4678 observations, included 496 country*year effects, 189 disease*year effects, and 502
country*disease effects. The equations were estimated via weighted least squares, using the number of deaths in that disease-
country-year cell as the weight.
