This paper consists of three parts. First, we briefly describe some key features of the labor market
in Denmark, some of which contribute to the Danish labor markets behaving quite differently from
those in many other European countries. The next two parts exploit detailed linked employer-employee
data. In the second part we document in some detail an important aspect of the functioning and flexibility
of the labor markets in Denmark: the high level of worker mobility. We show that mobility is about
as high, or even higher, as in the highly fluid U.S. labor market. Finally, we describe and examine
the wage structure between and within firms and changes therein since 1980, especially with an eye
on possible impacts of the trend towards a more decentralized wage determination. The shift towards
decentralized wage bargaining has coincided with deregulation and increased product market competition.
The evidence is, however, not consistent with stronger competition in product markets eroding firm-specific
rents. Hence, the prime suspect is the change in wage setting institutions.

Introduction


          The aim of this paper is threefold. First, we give a brief description of some key
features of the labor market in Denmark, some of which we argue contribute to the
Danish labor markets behaving quite differently from those in many other European
countries. Second, we document in some detail an important aspect of the functioning
and flexibility of the labor markets in Denmark: the high level of worker mobility.1 Third,
we describe and examine the wage structure between and within firms and changes
therein since 1980, especially with an eye on possible impacts of the trend towards a
more decentralized wage determination.


1 The Institutional Setting

        Although the Danish labor market in many respects resembles other labor markets
in Europe, and Scandinavia in particular, it has a number of distinguishing features of its
own. Below we briefly discuss some of them. More precisely we look at ten features of
labor markets in Denmark.2 These are:

        (i)        The high female labor force participation rate, which is among the highest
                   in the world,

        (ii)       The retirement age which used to be relatively high, but has during
                   relatively few years fallen substantially,

        (iii)      The replacement ratio of unemployment benefits for low-wage earners,
                   which to the best of our knowledge is the highest in the world. The
                   replacement ratio is considerably lower for high wage earners, but due to
                   the compressed wage structure, a non-negligible portion of the employees
                   has a very high replacement ratio.



1
    This is one of the cornerstones of the Danish “flexicurity” model for labor market policy which has
attracted a lot of attention in recent years; see e.g., chapter 2 in European Commission (2006).

    Some of these specific features make the labor market in Denmark in some, but absolutely not all,
respects look more like that in the United States than labor markets in other European countries.


                                                                                                     3
     (iv)      The relatively widespread eligibility for unemployment benefit.

     (v)       Voluntary membership of unemployment insurance funds.

     (vi)      Wage bargaining that used to be highly centralized, but has gradually
               become more decentralized.

     (vii)     Trade union membership and the coverage of unions are both high by
               international standards.

     (viii)    Weak job protection for blue collar workers and only a modest protection
               for white collar workers.

     (ix)      Indirect wage costs are internationally very low in Denmark, whereas the
               rate of direct taxation of wage income is among the highest in the world.

     (x)       Compared to many other countries, agreements between employers and
               trade unions constitute a more important regulatory mechanism than
               legislation and government interventions. This is one of the key elements
               in “the Danish model”.

Each of these aspects has consequences for the behavior of people, firms and their
employees, and for the functioning of the Danish labor market.


Female Labor Force Participation

     The high female participation is a well-known characteristic feature of the Danish
labor market. The growing female share of employment has been facilitated by a massive
growth in child-care facilities. Child-care is to a large extent provided by the public
sector; 6 out of 10 children in the age group 1-6 years are in publicly provided daycare.
Daycare used to be highly subsidized but is now less so. Female participation started to
grow in the 1970’s in close connection to the growth of the public sector and the creation
of the welfare state. Many of the jobs held by women, particularly in the public sector,
were originally part-time jobs. Today only about 8-9% of women in the age range 25 to
55 work part-time. The increase in female labor force participation has occurred in
parallel with a shift from part-time to full-time work. In recent years part-time work is




                                                                                           4
common among young women and older women and sectoral differences with respect to
the part-time work are small.


Pension Systems and Retirement

      Denmark has for many years had a pension system that provides the entire
population (and not only the working population) with old age pension, for men as from
the age of 67 and for women as from 65 (recently the old age retirement has gradually
been lowered to 65 also for men). This is a pay as you go system, where benefits are
regulated by the parliament and are paid out of current tax revenue. In 1979 an early
retirement program was introduced. All members of the UI system could as from the age
of 60 receive a benefit corresponding to the UI until the recipient is entitled to normal
pension. In addition, a publicly provided disability pension is available for all age groups,
where eligibility is determined on health grounds. The proportion of the labor force
receiving disability pension was in 2000 about 10 per cent. As a consequence of
especially the early retirement program the average retirement age has been falling over
time. Thus, in 2004, only a third of the age group 60-66 were in the labor force.

      The early retirement program has been particularly important for older workers
because employers are reluctant to hire unemployed workers in their late or mid-fifties
because they expect that they will go on early retirement as they become eligible. Bingley
and Lanot (2004) have shown that there is no firm effect with respect to the use of the
program, indicating that employers are not systematically pushing elderly employees into
early retirement. Rather it is other factors such as the work situation of the spouse that are
important.


Unemployment Benefits

      The unemployment benefit system is still partly organized according to
“Bismarckian principles”. Thus, workers can voluntarily choose to become members of
more than 30 different occupational unemployment insurance funds. Membership and
eligibility to unemployment benefits are both conditional on that the person has had a job
for at least one year. The unemployment benefit is 90% of the previous wage but with a



                                                                                            5
maximum of 1800        per month. Consequently, the replacement ratio for low-wage
workers is 90%, but is lower for higher income earners. Unemployment benefits are
taxed, but a special tax rate of 8% on all earned income does not apply to unemployment
benefits. Together, the high replacement ratio and the asymmetric tax treatment create an
incentive problem for low-wage workers as they earn little by working compared to being
unemployed. It has been shown that 23% of all employed women and 12% of all
employed men actually earn 80 less per week by working relative to what would have
received as unemployment benefit claimants; see Smith (1998).

     Unemployment benefits are obtained from the first day of unemployment and are
paid for one year without any other obligations than seeking work. After one year of
unemployment, the UI recipient has to take part in an active labor market policy program.
A high replacement ratio coupled with the fact that there is almost no experience rating
for neither employers nor workers imply that there are many short spells of
unemployment. Even in years of low unemployment more than 20% of all wage earners
have experienced at least one spell of unemployment. A high proportion of these spells
are concentrated around Christmas/New Year and other vacations. As a result, for low
pay workers total working hours are about 80% of the total normal hours (to be explained
below).

     The UI system is financed by general tax revenue but operated by the private UI
funds. The UI funds are formally unrelated to the trade unions, but membership of the UI
system is typically considered as part of a package, which also includes union
membership. As a consequence, about 80 per cent of the wage earners are members of
the UI system and about 85 per cent are members of trade unions (Neumann et al., 1991).



The Danish Model for Co-operation

     The overall labor market model in Denmark is often called “The Danish Model”.
The key ingredient in the Danish model is that the trade unions and the employers
federation (the social partners) make agreements on most regulatory issues, and the role
of the government is to “pick up and pay the bill”. The social partners take responsibility
for wage bargaining and wage setting. They also make agreements concerning normal


                                                                                         6
working hours, and set rules for labor protection with respect to overtime and work
environment.3 As a consequence there is no minimum wage legislation in Denmark.
Nevertheless, the social partners have agreed that no member firm will pay less than
89.50 DKK per hour plus 15% vacation pay, i.e., altogether 13.8 . Although the
employers’ organizations do not have full coverage, the unions are very keen on
identifying workplaces paying less. According to anecdotal evidence workers are being
paid less in the unorganized parts of the retail sector, and in the hotels and restaurant
industries.

        The role of the government in Denmark is to provide unemployment benefits and to
retrain workers who have lost their jobs because their productivity in their current job is
too low. The government also provides health care and disability pensions. In other
words, the government provides the safety net. This is also the case with respect to those
who are not covered by unemployment insurance. These workers are in general eligible
to social assistance, which is of the same size as the UI-benefit. The main difference is
that all payments are means-tested.

         The Danish labor market model has many features in common with the Swedish
model and because of the similarities they are sometimes grouped together under the hat
of “the Nordic Labor Market Model”. The main idea is that whenever a firm cannot keep
workers productive in their current job the government should take responsibility and
retrain workers. After retraining the workers should now be more productive and can
therefore be hired in a new firm and thereby increase overall productivity.

        There are, however, distinct differences between the Danish and Swedish models.
One of these is that the Danish model does not prohibit lay-offs, where the Swedish is
considerably more restrictive in this respect. The idea behind the Danish model is that
firms should not be forced to maintain a large workforce if it is no longer profitable to do
so. In such a situation it is better for society that firms can rehire workers where these
workers’ labor is more productive. This increases overall flexibility and productivity. Of

    When the current Liberal/Conservative government has made several propositions regarding work
environment, which is fairly general, both employers’ and workers’ organizations have been critical of state
intervention into the area.


                                                                                                          7
course, it also puts a burden on the workers and that is probably the main reason for the
relatively high unemployment benefit in Denmark (at least for the low-wage earners).
Another difference is that the Swedish model builds heavily on a tripartite cooperation
between government, unions and employers. So, in Denmark the government provides
income security, while the labor market organizations deliver flexibility. Hence, the
system is called “flexicurity”.


Working Hours

      In Denmark so-called “normal working hours” are determined as the outcome of
the general wage bargaining between the trade unions and the employers federation. As
elsewhere, the normal working times have been gradually shortened in Denmark, too.
The reduction has on average been about 0.7% per year (Andersen et al., 2001). Its
sources have changed over time. In the late 1960s and in the beginning of the 1970s the
reduction was in weekly hours, followed by a period when the annual vacation was
increased from 4 to 5 weeks. In the 1990’s the reduction was again implemented as a
reduction in the number of weekly hours; from 40 to 37 hours. Recently, a gradual
expansion of vacation weeks from 5 to 6 weeks has begun.

      Annual normal working hours in Denmark are among the lowest in the world. Only
the Germans work less than the 1690 hours per year worked on average by the Danes.
However, far from all work that much; especially the low-wage earners work less. The
average hours for low-wage-earners are only about 1140 hours in Denmark, while it was
about 1700 hours in the US in the same period. The main reason is no doubt that the
Danish UI system is not only subsidizing search between two jobs but also temporary
lay-offs.


Wage Bargaining

      Collective bargaining in Denmark has a long history – in fact, the first general
collective wage agreement was settled already as early as in 1889 – and for little less than
a century this was the predominant mode of wage determination. In recent years Danish
wage setting has undergone large changes, which are briefly described in the sequel.



                                                                                          8
         Until the beginning of the 1980s, wages were set in biannual national wage
negotiations. A key feature of wage determination was an automatic wage indexation
system, which linked hourly wages to the consumer price index net of indirect taxes and
subsidies. Twice per year, hourly wage increases were triggered by each three-point
change in the net CPI. Although the indexation was not complete, it accounted for a
large share of wage increases.

        General wage negotiations took place between the Danish Federation of Trade
Unions (LO) and the Danish Employers’ Federation (DA), typically every second year.
LO and DA set the pattern for the entire manual workers’ labor market. Although only
about 40 per cent of the private sector labor force was employed in firms where both the
employees and the employer were organized, the great majority of employers, and hence
also of all workplaces, applied the results of the general agreement. The negotiations and
the general agreement were split into general and specific issues such as working hours,
vacations and minimum wage tariffs.4 For the vast majority of white-collar workers and
public sector employees, the wage setting mechanism is quite similar regarding
negotiations, timing, etc. to that for the blue-collar workers. The difference has been that
these groups have never received as much in terms of wage drift between the general
contracts as blue collar workers, but have been compensated for the wage drift in the
form of larger wage increases in the central bargains.

        As from the beginning of the 1980s, there has been a tendency towards more and
more decentralization of wage bargaining and wage setting. A first step was the
abolishment of wag indexation in 1982. From 1987 to 1993 negotiations concerning
wages were done at the industry level. From 1993 onwards the general wage negotiations
have mainly focused on working hours, pensions, sickness pay and vacation. At the same
time wage bargaining proper has moved down to the industry or firm levels and an
increasing share of the wage agreements have been made at the individual employee




4
    As mentioned above, Denmark does not have a legally set minimum wage. However, the lowest tariff
wage agreed upon in the wage negotiations sets a floor for the wages to be paid, and changes in the
minimum wage tariff shifts the entire wage rate distribution.


                                                                                                  9
level. Already in 1993, 71 per cent of all agreements in the market for manual labor were
of this type.

      While the wage setting has been decentralized in the private labor market, wage
bargaining in the public sector is still highly centralized with biannual national-level
negotiations. However, a new wage system called “Ny-løn” (New-wage) has
considerably fewer wage tariffs than before and the intention is to move towards more
individualized pay according to qualifications, job functions and individual performance
also in the public sector. The performance pay element in public sector wages remains
rather small, however.


The Labor Market and the Macroeconomy

        Figure 1 describes the development of unemployment and annual percentage
changes in real GDP since 1980. As can be seen from the figure, the time series changes
in unemployment are chiefly driven by changes in GDP. As from the mid-nineties there
has been a long period of continuously decline in open unemployment, and so, at the end
of the period, Denmark is one of the not so numerous European countries that have
succeeded in lowering its unemployment rate to levels not experienced since the
seventies.

        It should be noted, however, that as active labor market policies have played an
increasingly important role, and as participants in active labor market programs are not
counted as unemployed, open unemployment has become a more and more dubious
measure of the state of the labor market. We have, therefore, in Figure 1 also included an
adjusted unemployment rate which includes individuals in active labor market programs
among the unemployed and consequently also in the labor force. The main difference is
in the levels, while the peaks and throughs are the same. It is worth noting, that whereas
the rate of unemployment during business cycle upturns is lower at the end of the period
than in the mid-eighties, this is not true for the adjusted unemployment rate.




                                                                                       10
Flexibility

     The institutional framework of the Danish labor market implies that there are few
barriers to mobility between firms. For the employers, the costs of laying off workers are
low because of the absence of severance pay legislation and experience rating in the
unemployment insurance system as well as the weak job security of particularly blue-
collar workers. For the employees, costs of changing employer or experiencing
unemployment spells are reduced by generous unemployment benefits, which are readily
available to insured employees and by the fact that many social benefits, pensions and
vacation are independent of the individual’s current employer and are hence transferable.
As a consequence, the Danish labor market is characterized by both high job mobility and
high wage mobility.


2 Data Sources

     The main data source used in the empirical analyses below is the so-called IDA-
database kept by Statistics Denmark. The IDA is a longitudinal database that contains
information about all individuals aged 15 to 74 (demographic characteristics, education,
labor market experience, tenure and earnings) and employees in all plants in Denmark
during the period 1980-2001. This information has been collected by merging
information from several registers in Statistics Denmark with the help of unique
identification numbers for individuals and plants. The persons and plants are matched at
the end of November in each year. Consequently, only changes between ends-of-
Novembers are accounted for (not intermittent changes). Statistics Denmark has
aggregated the plant-level information to the level of firms for the first time in the late
nineties for the Pay and Performance project at Aarhus School of Business and continues
to do so for the Center for Corporate Performance. With the help of the unique
identification numbers of individuals and plants (firms) additional information from other
registers as well as surveys to firms or individuals which have information about the
same identification numbers.

     The background data for the IDA consists of various registers supplemented with
data from the latest census in 1970. Thus, data on education come from the Census in



                                                                                        11
1970 and from reports from all educational institutions on their current population of
students and their completion. This means that the educational register contains status
and all upgrades after the census.

      The wage information is constructed as follows. The point of departure is register
data containing tax-based information on the total earnings paid to each individual
worker during the year. Earnings may consist of earnings from several employers. The
data are considered to be of high quality because the tax authorities use them to assess
each employee’s earnings. At the same time the wage records constitute deductible labor
costs for the employers.

      The number of working hours is estimated as follows. The employers’
contributions to a comprehensive pension scheme are determined by the number of hours
worked as a fraction of normal annual working hours. Thus, for hourly paid workers, i.e.
all blue-collar workers, pension contributions were up to 1993 proportional to the number
of hours worked. For monthly paid salaried employees the supplementary pension is
computed based on the normal length of the working day according to a three-step scale.
The IDA makes use of information about the employers’ contributions to the pension
schemes to compute the annual number of working hours for each individual. It should be
noted that these are estimates. One problem is that the supplementary pay for overtime
hours does not yield additional points for the pension schemes. Hence, overtime hours are
not properly accounted for.

      Hourly wage rates are calculated by dividing the earnings at a particular employer
with the estimated annual working hours at that employer. The estimated hourly wage
rates are most reliable for the hourly paid workers. However, after 1993 pension
contributions have gradually also been paid during sickness and unemployment spells.
Consequently, as from the mid-nineties, the quality of the hourly wage information is
likely to be of poorer quality.


3 Worker Mobility

       This section looks into worker mobility in somewhat more detail. We start by
considering the frequently used measures, entry and exit rates, calculated in the case of


                                                                                      12
entry rates as the proportion of new employees in the firm in end-of-November year t as
compared to end-of-November year t-1 and for exit rates the proportion of employees
who have exited from the firm since end-of-November in year t-1.5 Entry and exit rates to
and from Danish private sector firms during 1981-2001 are shown in Figure 2. We can
see that the entry and exit rates show no trend and fluctuate around 26 per cent. The
variations in the entry rate are clearly larger than for exits. The fluctuations appear to be
pro-cyclical for both entry and exit rates. Thus, hires and separation both increase in
upturns and decrease in downturns. On average about one third of all annual job exits are
to non-employment states; see Frederiksen and Westergaard-Nielsen (2006).

          Looking beyond the average entry and exit rates reveals that they differ
considerably between different parts of firms’ wage distributions. Figure 3 shows the
entry and exit rates in the top and bottom quartiles of the wage distribution in each firm.
Not surprisingly, mobility is substantially higher in the lowest quartile. In the lowest
quartile entry rates exceed exit rates with a wide margin, whereas the relative magnitudes
are reversed in the top quartile. Naturally, this reflects the fact that people tend to get
hired at the bottom and leave from positions further up in the wage distribution. Mobility
out of low paid work is in general high although it should be noted that a third of
transitions out of low-wage jobs is out of the labor force; see Bolvig (2004). The two
other thirds are to higher paid employment within the same firm and to jobs in other
firms, respectively. Notably, Bolvig also finds that firms with higher than average share
of low-wage workers have a lower workforce turnover than other firms. The entry rates
in the bottom quartile vary pro-cyclically and are quite volatile. Entry into the top quartile
displays the same pattern but the variation is less pronounced.


          Table 1 paints a picture of the composition and development of job spells and
their duration. The numbers refer to year 2000. We can see that in that year out of 1.6
million employees, almost half million had separated from a job since the previous year.
Nearly one third of all employees (a little over half a million) were in another job


5
    Since the comparisons are between end-of-Novembers, and thus neglect mobility between intermittent
short-term jobs, the entry and exit rates are downward biased.


                                                                                                   13
(actually, at another employer) compared to last year. From the third column it can be
seen that in a cross-section most people employed in Danish private sector firms – 63.2
per cent – are in jobs that had lasted less than five years. Less than ten per cent are in jobs
the duration of which exceeds 15 years. This does not, however, mean that merely about
ten per cent of employees end up in jobs lasting 15 years or more.

       The high turnover rates do not necessarily imply that all employees in the firms
leave with the same frequency and that, as a consequence of that, long-tenured jobs are
thin on the ground. There are a number of reasons for why the cross-sectional picture is
misleading; see Hall (1982). First, and trivially, in order to have been in a job lasting for
15 years or longer, the employee has to have been in the labor force for at least 15 years.
Second, an additional reason for why the “population at risk” is considerably less than the
total workforce is that most of job changes occur in the beginning of workers’ labor
market careers. Therefore, one should not expect to find many long-term employment
relationships before the employees have turned forty. As can be seen from the three last
columns in the table, the probability of staying in the same firm for one, five or ten
additional years increases with tenure. Thus, for instance, the probability that a person
with 10 years of tenure will remain with the same employer for five (ten) additional years
is 51 (27) per cent. Taking these features into account leads, as has been shown by Hall
(1982) for the US, to a completely different picture of the prevalence of long-term jobs:
despite high worker turnover, long job spells can be still be common. Does the same
apply also to the Danish labor market?

       Table 2 gives the proportion of five-year age groups with five years of current
tenure who go on to reach tenure for 20 years or more. These are calculated using the so
called contemporaneous retention method of Hall (1982). We have computed these shares
for two years, 1990 and 2000, respectively. Moreover, for comparison purposes we
include Hall’s estimates from U.S. in 1978. Three features of the table are worth noting.
First, the proportions of individuals whose eventual tenure will exceed 20 years were
higher in 1990 than ten years later and this was true for all age groups. Of course, this
difference may simply reflect the fact 1990 was a business cycle downturn year whereas
2000 was an upturn year. As we saw earlier, mobility is pro-cyclical. Second,
considerably higher proportions of the employees are in lifetime jobs than what is


                                                                                            14
observed in cross-sections. Thus, the high annual turnover rates, hovering between 25
and 30 per cent, are consistent with the observation that a considerable portion – between
25 and 35 per cent of prime age workers – of the employees land jobs in which they stay
for substantial parts of their working lives. Third, the shares for Denmark appear to be
somewhat lower than those for U.S. One should be cautious here, as the age structures of
the US and Danish labor forces differ somewhat. Still, it is clearly the case that the
proportion staying on longer is not larger, but rather smaller, in Denmark than in the U.S.
This accords with our arguments above that the institutional setup of the Danish labor
market strongly facilitates mobility.




4 The Changing Wage Structure

       Next we briefly consider some changes in the wage structure, and in particular
changes in the dispersion of wages. The wage concept used is real monthly wages
(expressed in 1990 prices), calculated by multiplying each individual’s hourly wage rate
by the number of a full-time employee’s monthly working hours. The population studied
is, unless otherwise is stated, the private sector firms with minimum 20 employees. In
order to reduce measurement errors in the monthly wages employees who have been in
their current jobs for less than one year are omitted.

       Figures 4a and 4b document changes in the distribution of individuals’ wages.
We may note a clear, albeit not strong, increase in wage dispersion during the twenty
years period. The increase has been about the same magnitude during both the eighties
and the nineties. The period when wage differentials widened the most is 1987-94, that is
the first period of a shift towards decentralized wage bargaining. In fact, the changes
during the second half of the nineties are relatively small, especially in view of the
changes in both wage setting and the increased adoption of new pay practices in firms
(Eriksson, 2003b). There has been an increase on both sides of the median, but during the
nineties wage dispersion below the median has been flat, whereas above median there is a




                                                                                        15
noteworthy jump in the mid-nineties leading to a stronger increase during that decade;
see Figure 4b.

           Changes in the dispersion of firm wages have followed a slightly different pattern:
from being virtually flat in the eighties, the distribution of firm wages has widened during
the second half of the period; see Figure 5.

           Turning next to a decomposition of the wage dispersion into within and between
firm components, we restrict the sample to firms with 50 or more employees in order to
make the within-firm dispersion concept meaningful. Two points emerge from Figure 6.
There has been a trend-wise increase in between firm variance in wages whereas wage
dispersion within firms fell during the eighties up to 1990 from which on it has been
increasing in tandem with that of between-firm wages. By 2000, within firm wage
dispersion has not reached the level of the early eighties. Thus, the observed increase in
overall wage dispersion is predominantly due to increasing wage differentials between
firms.




5 CHANGES IN WAGE SETTING IN LARGER DANISH FIRMS,
1980-20006


           As was discussed above, Denmark has during the two recent decades experienced
a shift in wage bargaining from a highly centralized system to a considerably more
decentralized wage setting. The end of the era of centralized wage bargaining came in
two steps: the first in 1987 when bargaining moved down to the level of industries, and
the second and more important one, involving a larger share of wage setting actually
being done at the level of firms, in years 1994-95. It seems plausible to assume that as a
consequence of the decentralization of the wage bargaining and wage setting processes,




6
    This section draws heavily on Eriksson (2003a).


                                                                                           16
the relative weights of employer and employee effects for the resulting wage structure
may have changed. The aim of this section is to describe and analyse these changes.
           A shift to more decentralised wage setting is, however, not the only possible
cause of changes in firms’ internal wage structure. The much discussed skill-biased
technological change suggests that not only do returns to observable skills increase, but
the returns to unobservable skills as picked up by the firm effects in a standard cross-
sectional earnings equation may increase as well (Katz and Autor, 1999). Thus,
inequality among employers should rise in tandem with rising returns to observable
skills. Another source of changes in firms’ wage structures is changes in firms’ local
monopoly power. Deregulation of several markets and increasing international
competition due to the implementation of the European Single Market Program in 1988-
92 and steadily falling transportation and information transmission costs can have eroded
firms’ product market rents. When this is the case, we would expect inequality among
employers to have declined over time.7


           How could decentralization contribute to changes? One way of thinking about it is
that under centralized wage setting, firm-specific bargaining is constrained and hence,
local bargaining power is in general low and varies little across firms. With weakening
centralized wage-setting institutions, local bargaining power rises and consequently, we
would expect to see an increase in the variability of the firm-specific component of
wages.


           Next we examine changes in wage setting in Danish firms from the perspective of
eventual changes in their internal labour markets. For this reason the analysis is restricted
to a sub-sample from the IDA database consisting of larger private sector firms. More
precisely, the sample we henceforth examine consists of 222 firms that have been above
the size of 200 employees in each year during the period 1980-2000.8 The number of
observations on individuals varied between 417,267 in 1995 and 457,821 in 1990.

7
    The prediction concerning the impact of increased competition on within-firm inequality is ambiguous;
see e.g., Cuñat and Guadalupe (2006).
8
    About half of the firms have less than 500 employees and about the same proportion of the firms are from


                                                                                                         17
         Wage equations with hourly wage rates as the dependent variable and using the
observable individual characteristics age, education, gender and tenure plus employer-
specific intercepts as explanatory variables are estimated. The estimations are carried out
for five different cross-sections: years 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2000. In the sequel we
briefly present and discuss some of the results obtained.


         It should be emphasized that not only does the population of firms differ from the
one examined in the previous section, also the wage concept, the hourly wage rate, is a
different one. This explains why we from Table 3 observe a somewhat different picture
of changes in the wage structure: wage dispersion first decreased during the eighties and
then increased during the nineties. In 2000, between-persons wage inequality was still
smaller than 20 years ago, but had almost returned to its 1985 level. As we will come
back to later, during the same period between-firm wage inequality has grown
considerably.


         From Table 4, where the estimates of the returns to the skill variables and gender
are collected, we can first of all observe that including the firm fixed effects into the
estimating equations does very little to change the estimates to the human capital
variables. On the other hand, we can see that some of the estimated returns to skill have
changed over time. Thus, during the eighties, the age-earnings profiles became
successively steeper but have not changed much since. Returns to tenure have also
increased, although it should be noticed that their magnitude is relative small: less than
one per cent per year.



the manufacturing sector, whereas the remaining 20 and 30 per cent are in the trade and services sectors,
respectively. The firms differ quite a lot with respect to employment growth; a little over 40 per cent has
experienced a decline in employment during the two decades. The workforces in the sample firms consist
to 60 per cent of males (differing from the whole Danish labour force where the gender shares are equal –
the difference is due to the fact that the firms are from the private sector) and their skill structures have
undergone considerable changes during period; with a notable decline in the share of unskilled blue-collar
workers. At the same the age structure has remained remarkably stable.


                                                                                                         18
           The largest changes have occurred with respect to returns to schooling. The
estimated return to one additional year of schooling has almost doubled during the
twenty-year period. The return started to grow from a very low level indeed and has at
the end of the period reached about the same magnitude as one additional year of labour
market experience. All in all, the estimates indicate that there has been an increase in the
returns to observable skills according to several dimensions during the period under
study.


           For the gender differential estimates it makes a difference whether the firm effects
are included or not, as entering them leads to a drop in the differential by about one third.
During the two decades, there was first a decrease in the male-female wage differential
but this decline seems to have levelled off during the nineties. This corroborates what has
been found in the gender gap studies. Most of that literature does not, however, account
for the demand side.9 The results in Table 4 demonstrate that this can be misleading.
Moreover, there is an interesting pattern insofar that the gender gap reduction is much
larger when firm fixed effects are controlled for.

           Table 5 displays the adjusted R2 statistics from estimations with the firm effects
only and with firm fixed effects and human capital, respectively. We may observe first,
that on their own the firm fixed effects explain an increasing portion of differences in
individual wage differentials. Second, the “full” model’s explanatory power has also
increased over time.


           The dispersion of “raw” firm fixed effects has increased; in fact, it has more than
doubled; see Table 6. The increase has been especially pronounced in the nineties.
Together with increases in returns to observable individual characteristics this is
consistent with firm fixed effects picking up sorting according to unobservable skills.10


9
    Datta Gupta and Rothstein (2005) is an exception using Danish data.
10
     Davis and Haltiwanger (1991) have found a similar pattern for US manufacturing during the sixties,
seventies and eighties.


                                                                                                    19
           Although part of the increase goes away when observables are controlled for, a
considerable portion remains. Thus, changes in observable skills are not able to explain
the whole observed increase in between-firm inequality. The observed pattern is,
however, also consistent with an increasing dispersion of bargaining power as a result of
weakening of centralized bargaining institutions. In contrast to the changes mentioned
above, the dispersion of the residuals of the wage equations displays no trend, but varies
around a stable mean. The fact that the dispersion of fixed effects has not decreased, but
rather increased, indicates that increasing competition has not lead to the predicted
decline in between employer inequality.


           Let us now consider what has happened to the persistence of firm effects over
time. Table 7a answers that question by measuring the “persistence” by means of
autocorrelations: corr (FE(f,t), FE(f,t-T)) for different time gaps T (5, 10 and 15 years,
respectively).11 The fixed effects are taken from the wage regressions that include human
capital controls.12 The key message from the table is that there have been no major
changes in the persistence in firm fixed effects over time. There is a slight decline in the
five-year correlations, but this provides only limited evidence of a weakening importance
of internal labour markets. The persistence is fairly strong and does not decay rapidly as
the time gap is widened. The same exercise was also carried out for rank correlations; see
Table 7b. The pattern with respect to changes over time is the same, except that the decay
associated with lengthening the time differences becomes stronger. At any rate, the
results of both tables indicate that firms that pay above (below) the average also are very
likely to continue doing that five or ten years later.


           Eriksson (2003a) also estimated the wage equations separately for each firm and
year and retained the coefficient estimates from each regression and used them as data.
The first thing looked at is the changes in their between-firm spread over time. The mean

11
     FE denotes the firm fixed effects.
12
     Excluding controls leads to somewhat higher correlations, but the pattern observed in Table 7a remains
intact.


                                                                                                        20
across firms estimates of the return to schooling, say, differs somewhat from those
reported in Table 4, which were based on estimating the equation on all firms. The
dispersion of the coefficients for age, schooling, tenure and gender is set out in Table 8.
From this it can be seen that not only has the mean returns to schooling increased, but its
dispersion has too. The development of the age coefficients is different; they first
increase and then decline. The gender wage gap coefficient, which on average has first
declined and then has stayed flat displays an increasing dispersion across firms over time.
Hence, overall there appears to have been a tendency towards an increase in the spread,
not only in firm fixed effects, but also in how firms reward different observable
individual traits of their employees.


       A second thing the estimated firm-wise coefficients are used for is to look at their
persistence, again by means of computed autocorrelations. The five-year autocorrelations
for age, schooling, tenure and gender are collected in Table 9. Strong internal labour
markets would imply highly persistent firm-specific returns. This is also what is found,
although the correlations are somewhat lower than for firm fixed effects. Moreover, for
schooling and gender a decline in the persistence can be observed. Consequently, there is
some indication of internal structures have become more flexible. The changes do not
appear to be large, however.

       Summarizing the analysis of the larger firms it was found that there has been a
clear increase in between-firm wage inequality. This is not consistent with the notion that
increased competition in the product markets erodes firm-specific rents. Between-
employee wage inequality first decreased but increased during the nineties, and at the
same time returns to human capital, in particular schooling, have increased. The
dispersion in firm-specific fixed effects has increased over time, which is consistent with
both skill-biased technological change and weakened centralized wage bargaining. The
employer effects are relatively persistent and there are no traces of significant changes in
this. The same holds for returns to human capital at the level of the firm. Both the
observable and the time-invariant unobservable worker and employer characteristics,
respectively, have become more important in explaining wage inequality.



                                                                                         21
6 Concluding remarks
       The key messages of this chapter are two. First, the institutional setup of the
Danish labor market differs not only from that found in most other European countries
but also from that in the neighboring Nordic countries. A main difference is the absence
of barriers to mobility. In a sense this is only natural as for almost a century Danish wage
setting was highly centralized and characterized by a very compressed wage structure
which left only limited scope for employers to adjust to changing labor market conditions
through wage adjustment. Worker mobility is indeed high. We show that mobility is
about as high, or even higher, as in the highly fluid U.S. labor market. But we also
document that although labor turnover rates are high, a considerable portion of workers
are in long-term employment relationships.


       Second, the ongoing process towards increasingly decentralized wage setting,
which began in the second half of the eighties, has given rise to an increase, albeit of
relatively modest magnitude, in the dispersion of wages. The widening wage distribution
seems to be predominantly due to increased wage differentials between firms, and
considerably less due to growing within firm wage dispersion. In parallel, the level and
between-firm variance in returns to human capital have increased. The shift towards
decentralized wage bargaining has coincided with deregulation and increased product
market competition. The evidence appears not to be consistent with stronger competition
in product markets eroding firm-specific rents. Hence, the prime suspect is the change in
wage setting institutions.
