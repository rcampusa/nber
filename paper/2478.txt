                          The Taxation of Income from Capital
                            in the United States, 1980-1986



                                       ABSTRACT




    Tax rules have changed almost yearly in the United States since 1980. In

particular, the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 reduced marginal tax rates and

shortened depreciation lifetimes, while the Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced

marginal tax rates, repealed the investment tax credit, and lengthened

depreciation lifetimes.

     This paper estimates marginal effective tax rates on income from capital

under each years tax law, using the methodology of King and Fullerton (1984) to

maintain comparability with earlier calculations for the U.S. and current

calculations for other countries. The 1981 law substantially reduced effective

tax rates, while subsequent changes raised them back again. A primary effect of

the 1986 law was to make diverse effective tax rates more uniform.

                    THE TAXATION OF INCOME FROM CAPITAL

                      IN THE UNITED STATES, 1980—1986




I. Introduction



    The revenue from capital income taxation as a fraction of total

government revenue has been declining in the past thirty years.

Nevertheless, the academic literature has been paying increasing attention

to the subject of capital income taxation, primarily because of the effects

on investment incentives. In a perfectly competitive world with no

uncertainty, and in the absence of any taxes, equilibrium would require that

investment projects at the margin would receive just the interest rate paid

to savers at the margin. In general, however, the government uses the tax

system both to generate revenue and to stimulate investment and

productivity. As a consequence, the returns to savers and investors

diverge, and the incentives facing them are obscured.

     A careful investigation of these incentive effects should account for

corporate and personal taxes as well as for the interaction of the two.

This interaction is essential because, for example, interest payments are

deductible at the corporate level but are taxed in the hands of the personal

sector upon receipt. Therefore, the effective tax rate becomes a combined

function of personal and corporate taxes. Moreover, the relationship

between investment and taxation depends on corporate financial policy and on

the pattern of ownership of corporate securities. There is no unique cost




                                      1
                                        —2 —




of   capital to the corporate sector that is independent of ownership pattern

or of capital structure.

       One study of the incentive effects of capital income taxes is the book

edited by King and Fullerton (1984, hereafter KF). They estimated marginal

effective tax rates in four countries with a common theoretical framework.

Using 1980 as a reference year, their interest focused on the international

comparisons offered by the different tax regimes. In this paper, we

concentrate on a slightly different issue. We apply the KF methodology to

the U.S. economy only, for the years 1980 through 1986. This time series

approach provides an illustration of the evolution of the tax treatment of

income from capital in our decade. In order to maintain strict

comparability of results with those of KF for 1980, and with those of other

researchers who apply the KF methodology to additional countries in more

recent years, we resist the urge to tinker with the model. We use exactly

the same computer programs that were used for the KF study. We collect tax

data and parameters for more recent years, but our results for 1980 exactly

match those in the book. We use the same set of 81 hypothetical projects,

the same weights, and the same assumptions about arbitrage and inflation.

We therefore concentrate on tax changes only.

       The underlying model follows along the lines of Hall and Jorgenson

 (1967) in finding the user cost of capital for each project. The net

private rate of return depends both on the source of finance used and the

 category of ownership of the returns. The proportional difference between

 the average of the pretax rate of return and the average of the posttax rate

 of return weighted over all the hypothetical projects constitutes the

 overall marginal effective total tax rate (METTR). An alternative approach

would be to measure effective tax rates by taking the ratio of observed
                                      —3—




taxes to income from existing investments. Although these "average"

effective tax rates would reflect adequately the cashf lows and tax burdens,

the METTRs are intended to capture the incentives to save and invest.' We

acknowledge the difficulties in using METTRs, as discussed for example in

Summmers (1987) or Bradford and Fullerton (1981), but we choose not to

review these complex issues in this paper. Instead, we proceed with a

previously discussed methodology from King and Fullerton (1984) to estimate

effective tax rates for 1980 through the Tax Reform Act of 1986. For each

year, we provide effective tax rates for the fully phased—in version of the

law as enacted.

     We find that the overall marginal effective total tax rate fell from 37

percent in 1980 to 23 percent under post—transition 1981 law, and remained

low until 1986 when the fully phased—in tax rate increased to 42 percent.

Furthermore, it showed a moderate tendency to rise with inflation. We also

find that the individual rates were distributed more uniformly in 1986 than

in any other year. The biggest difference in effective tax rates, that

between debt financed projects and equity financed projects, was

substantially reduced by the Tax Reform Act of 1986.

     The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes

 the underlying model. Section III provides detail on the parameters, the

 tax provisions, and the data used. Section IV analyzes our findings, and

 section V concludes.




 'Many other differences between average and marginal effective tax rates are
 discussed in Fullerton (1984).

II. The Methodological Framework



     The notation and methodology in this section follows King (1977) and

King and Fullerton (1984). Consider an economic environment in which there

is perfect competition, perfect mobility, and no uncertainty. A firm

contemplating a new investment project will, in equilibrium, equate the net

outlay to the present value of net returns. If the cost of the project is

one dollar, and the present discounted value of any grants or tax allowances

on the unit of investment is A, then the net outlay is



         C—i—A                  .                                           (1)


Assume that this dollar invested will generate returns whose nominal value

increases with inflation and decreases with the rate of depreciation. These

returns are then discounted at the firm's discount rate. Then the present

discounted value of the profit stream net of taxes is given by



                             drvir
         V     (l—'r)MRR —

                 p+b—
                                     —
                                         (i—T)w     '                    (2




where r is the corporate tax rate, MRR the marginal rate of return, v the
proportion of inventories on original cost accounting (FIFO as opposed to

LIFO), wc the corporate wealth rate, ir the inflation rate, p the discount

 rate and 6   the exponential rate of economic depreciation. The dummy
variable d takes the value 1 (one) for inventories and 0 (zero) for

 everything else.
                                                   —5 —




    Now, if the rate of return net of depreciation is



         p=MRR—5                      ,
                                                                           (3)


and we set the net outlay C equal to the present value of net returns V,

then we can solve (1), (2) and (3) to get



                [(1 —A)(p + S        —ir) + drvir]
          p— ________________ +wC —S                      .                (4)
                        (l—r)


To derive an expression for A, we assume that grants and allowances for

investment take one of three forms: (1) standard depreciation allowances;

(2) immediate expensing or free depreciation; and (3) cash grants. The

proportion of the cost of an asset that is entitled to standard depreciation

allowances is denoted by f1, and the present value of tax savings from

standard depreciation allowances on a unit of investment is Ad. Note, also,

that Ad is the product of the statutory corporate rate, r, times the present

value of allowances, A. If f2 denotes the proportion of the cost of the

project qualifying for immediate expensing at the corporate rate, then the

tax savings from this write-off is f2r. Finally, suppose that the

proportion qualifying for grants is denoted by f3 and the rate of grant

(equivalent to a tax credit) is g. Then,



                                                                            (5)
           A—f1A+f2T+f3                     .




There is no need to restrict the sum of f1, f2, and f3 to unity since at

certain times it can exceed one. For example, an investment tax credit may

or may not reduce the basis for capital consumption allowances.
                                      -6-




    Suppose r is the real interest rate and i = r-I-lr is the nominal

interest rate. The relation between the nominal market interest rate and

the return to the saver depends on the tax treatment of personal income.

Since the tax law defines the tax base to include the receipt of nominal

interest income, the posttax rate of return to the saver is given by



         s= (1 —m)(r+ ir) —ir —w            ,                              (6)


where m is the marginal personal tax rate on interest income, and w is the

personal wealth rate. Then the marginal effective total tax rate can be

expressed as (p—s)/p, the tax wedge as a fraction of the pretax returns.

     To complete the model, we have to link the firm's discount rate to the

market interest rate. This relationship will, in general, depend on the

source of finance. In the case of debt finance, where nominal interest

income is taxed but nominal interest payments are tax deductible,



         p—i(l —r)             .                                            (7)


 For new share issues, a potential investor would require a net rate of

 return equal to i(l —m) which reflects his opportunity cost. Then the

 project should yield a return p such that the net of tax dividend yield

 equals the individual's opportunity cost, p(l —m) =   i(1   —m). Hence, for

 new share issues



          p—i           .                                                    (8)
                                        —7 —




Finally,   for retained earnings, if z is the effective tax rate on accrued

capital gains, the project should yield a return p such that

p(l —z) =   i(l   —m). Thus



           _i(l_m)                                                            (9)
                  (1 —   z)

In this case the cost of capital depends on the personal tax rates which in

general differ for stockholders according to their tax brackets. Therefore,

the firm would have to equalize the net return to all these investors.

However, we can hypothesize a single representative investor or a "Miller

equilibrium", where the high tax investors hold equity and the low tax ones

hold debt only.2 Since neither assumption conforms with reality, we

calculate the cost of capital for retained earnings using the weighted

averages of the parameters in equation (9), where the weights are the

shareownership proportions of the different investors.

     Having summarized the model, we can now examine two alternative

assumptions about arbitrage that are employed in this paper. First, the

fixed—p case makes no assumption about arbitrage. We assume that all

hypothetical projects yield the same pretax rate of return, and we compute

the posttax return to savers for each project. In general, these posttax

returns differ across projects. This approach emphasizes the differences in

the tax treatment of different investments, and it provides a clear picture

of the incentives offered by the tax system. Naturally, we would expect

 funds to flow from the low yield (high tax) assets towards the high yield

 (low tax) ones. This reallocation of capital among the various projects

would continue until an equilibrium is established in which there exist no


    2See Miller (1977), and Auerbach and King (1983).
                                        -8-




further opportunities for mutually profitable transactions. In a second set

of assumptions, called the fixed—r case, we therefore assume that the real

rates of return on all projects are equalized for all investors before

personal taxes. Differences in personal tax rates will still generate

different net rates of return across investors. It must be stressed that

when arbitrage eliminates differences among projects in the real rate of

interest, there must be differences in the pretax rates of return on

different investments. Hence, the tax system distorts the allocation of

resources.

     The choice between the fixed—p and the fixed—r distributions of

marginal effective tax rates depends upon whether we are interested in the

tax schedule facing potential investors or in the proportion of marginal

factor income that is taxed away. The fixed—p calculations are a better

guide to the schedule of tax rates levied on different combinations, but it

is the fixed—r distribution of marginal tax rates that would determine the

welfare losses resulting from the distortionary nature of the taxation of

capital income. Also, the weighted averages in the fixed—r case are a

better guide to the ratio of additional taxes paid to additional profits

earned as a result of a small increase in the corporate sector capital

stock. Although we present selected results for both assumptions, we focus

mainly on the fixed-p case. This emphasis corresponds to that in KF, where

 the primary interest is in the effects of taxation on the incentives to

 invest.

      As a practical matter, in the fixed-p case, we take the gross rate of

 return, p, to be 10 percent. We then use equation (4) to calculate p which,

 through equations (7)—(9), will qive us an interest rate, i, for each case.

 Finally, we calculate r as i—lr   and substitute it into equation (6) to get
                                        -9-




the net rate of return. Alternatively, in the fixed—r case, we begin with

an r of 5 percent. Substitution into (6) provides s, substitution into

(7)—(9) provides the discount rate p, and substitution into (4) provides p.

    The interaction between inflation and the tax system is one of the most

important aspects of the effects of taxes on savings and investment. The

expected rate of inflation enters into both the p equation (4) and the s

equation (6). In order to accomodate these expectations, we calculate

effective tax rates for three different inflation rates (just as in KF).

First, a zero rate provides a benchmark against which to judge other

figures, and it describes the impact the tax system would have if it were

fully indexed. Second, we look at an inflation rate of ten percent as a

reasonable upper bound for the l980s. Finally, we use 6.77 percent as the

"actual" inflation for the U.S. ,   calculated   as the average rate of increase

of the price deflator for consumer and investment goods over the ten year

period 1970—79. We considered updating this figure by calculating the same

average over the period from 1975 to 1985, but the new "actual" inflation

rate turned out to be only about one percentage point lower. Since this

difference is small, we used 6.77 percent again for comparability with

results in ICF.   In addition, results for any inflation rate can be

approximated by interpolating between results for inflation rates of zero

and ten.

     Each hypothetical investment under consideration is described by a

unique combination of four characteristics. These characteristics include

 the asset in which funds are invested, the industry of the project, the way

 the project is financed, and the ultimate recipient of the returns. In

 turn, there exist three alternatives for each characteristic. More
                                     —10—




specifically, the first asset category is machinery, which includes plant,

equipment, and vehicles. The second asset is buildings, and the third asset

is inventories. We are only considering tangible reproducible assets and

thus exclude land, R&D, and other intangible assets.

     The first industry is manufacturing, which consists of the SIC industry

numbers 13—64. Second, other industry contains construction,

transportation, communications and utilities. Third, commerce, includes

trade and services and corresponds to SIC numbers 69 and 72—77.

     The three sources of finance are debt, which includes both bond issues

and bank borrowing, new share issues, and retained earnings. The three

ownership categories are households, tax—exempt institutions, and insurance

companies. The primary motivation for this three—way ownership

classification is the different tax treatments that they receive, even

though the funds are indirectly owned by households in all cases. The

household category includes the household ownership of funds through taxed

intermediaries such as banks. The second category includes indirect

tax-exempt ownership through pension funds, the pension business of life

insurance companies and charities. Finally, the third category includes

 funds invested as part of contractual savings made by households via the

medium of insurance companies, principally life insurance policies. In

 combination, with three assets, three industries, three sources of finance,

 and three ownership categories, there exist a total of 81 combinations of

 distinct investments that are examined.

      In section IV we compute the marginal effective tax rate for each

 combination as well as their distribution. In order to plot the

 distribution of tax rates, we need to know the proportion of investment

 identified with any given combination. We assume that the marginal increase
                                     —11—




in investment under consideration is proportional to the existing

distribution of net capital stocks among assets and industries. Further, we

assume that the saving required to finance investment is proportional to the

existing ownership patterns. This enables us to determine the weights that

apply to each combination. Thus, by aggregating with the appropriate

weights, we can calculate marginal effective tax rates for every subset of

investment projects.

     To illustrate, let k denote a particular combination involving debt

financed investment. There are 27 such combinations. If cEk denotes the

weight applicable to the kth combination, we can calculate effective tax

rates for capital income generated by debt financed investments in the

following way. The mean tax wedge for this subset is,




                                                                         (10)




Then the marginal effective tax rate is




                                                                           (11)
             p


     In a similar way, we compute the rates for all the other subsets. By

using the weights for all 81 combinations together, we get the overall mean

marginal effective tax rate.

III. Data and Parameters



       There have been two major tax reform acts in the 1980s that have

affected the treatment of the various assets and the distortions introduced

by the tax system. The Economic Recovery Tax Act (ERTA) of 1981 reduced

personal rates and assigned lifetimes for assets to a smaller number of

classes. These lifetimes were shorter for the most part, so the present

value of depreciation allowances were greater. The Tax Reform Act (TRA) of

1986 reduced personal rates, decreased the statutory corporate rate from

0.46 to 0.34, and repealed the investment tax credit. In the interim years,

a few other adjustments of the tax code took place. All these policy

changes will be described below.

       The capital stock weights are derived from Jorgenson and Sullivan

(1981) and Fraumeni and Jorgenson (1980), calculated by the perpetual

inventory method for the year 1977. We use the same weights as those in KF.

As shown in Table 111.1, about 44 percent of the capital stock is used in

manufacturing, 25 percent is in commerce, and the remaining 31 percent is in

 the other industry category. More than half (54 percent) of the total

 corporate capital excluding land is in buildings, whereas inventories and

 equipment share the rest equally.

        According to Table 111.2, three—fourths of the financing for

 investments in manufacturing comes from retained earnings, and only 20

 percent comes from debt.3 These proportions are more equal in commerce (40

 percent debt and 55 percent retained earnings) and other industry (48

 industry, as described in Gordon and Malkiel (1981) and KF.
                                           —13 —




percent   each). These proportions also come from KF, so that we can

replicate the results for 1980 before drawing comparisons to later years.4

     The proportions of debt and equity holdings of each ownership category

are shown in Table 111.3. Households and tax-exempt institutions hold

almost equal proportions of debt and equity, while insurance companies hold

mostly debt. In order to concentrate on tax changes by themselves, none of

these weighting parameters are allowed to vary during the time period. The

following subsections describe the other parameters and features of the tax

code that do change during the 1980—86 period.



A. The CorDorate Rates

     The top federal statutory rate of 0.46 is used for marginal corporate

income for all years until 1986. State corporate taxes are deductible at

the federal level, and the weighted average of the states' top brackets is

6.6 percent. Therefore, r    is   0.46 +   0.066(1 — 0.46) or 49.5 percent. The
1986 Act lowered the top statutory corporate tax rate to 0.34, so the same

calculation provides a combined rate of 38.3 percent. Although most

corporations do not reach the top statutory rate bracket, the bulk of

corporate capital is held by those that do.



B. Property and Wealth Taxes

     Thousands of local jurisdictions each set their own statutory property

tax rates. Using data from the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental

Relations, Jorgenson's 1977 capital stock matrix, and estimated tax payments



 4The low 5 percent proportion for new share issues reflects Flow of Funds
 data on actual financing and is consistent with the low weight on dividend
 taxes in the "new view" of Auerbach (1979), Bradford (1981), and King
 (1977). New investment might have to use proportionately more new share
 issues, however, reflecting the "old view" of dividend taxes.
                                     —14—




in 1977, we calculate the following average tax rates for businesses. For

equipment and inventories w is 0.00768, and for structures w is 0.01126.

These rates are assumed to hold for all seven years. In addition, the

personal wealth tax rates (w) are taken to be zero throughout. This

parameter could be used for estate taxes, but these are a very small source

of revenue in the U.S., and the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 raised the

estate tax exemption to $600,000.



C. The Personal Tax Rates

     The data on marginal tax rates for households is made available from

the Treasury and the TAXSIM simulations of the NBER.5 The procedures of the

NBER model are described in Feldstein and Frisch (1977) and in Feenberg and

Rosen (1983). Essentially, it weights marginal rates for 25,000 households

by each different source of income. Table 111.4 provides a summary of the

various rates for each year. The first row shows tax rates on wage income

for comparison purposes only. The second row shows the statutory rates

applicable to interest income. These include an additional 0.05 to account

for state taxes. Also, financial intermediaries hold corporate debt but do

not pay interest on demand deposits. Instead, they provide services to

depositors, a forts of return to households that is not subject to tax. We

therefore multiply the combined federal and state rate by the ratio of

 interest—bearing direct and indirect loans of households to corporations




   5The Treasury provided estimates of the household rates for all seven
years. However, for comparability with KF we want to use the TAXSIM rate
for 1980. We therefore use the Treasury estimates to indicate how the 1980
TAXSIM rate would change over the period. That is, later years' Treasury
numbers were multiplied by the ratio of the TAXSIM rate for 1980 to the
Treasury rate for 1980.
                                     —15—




divided by total direct and indirect loans of households to corporations.

This ratio was calculated to be 0.8738 in KF.° Implicit here is the

assumption that the same rate of interest applies both to borrowing and

lending. To take an example, for 1980, the federal rate on interest of

households was .275, and the combined federal and state rate was 32.5

percent. With the adjustment for banks, m is 0.285 as shown in the table.

In 1981 it became 25.8 percent and, under the TRA, 22.4 percent. The third

row in the Table 111.4 shows that the combined statutory rate for dividends

in 1980 is 47.5 percent, decreased significantly in 1981 and again in 1986.

     The statutory capital gains rate from the TAXSIM model for 1980 is 28

percent, but KF uses a 14 percent rate to account for step—up of basis at

death and the selective realization of losses and gains. Also, capital

gains are taxed only upon realization and thus offer a deferral advantage

that depends on the average length of the holding period. As explained in

KF (see pp. 23—24 and 222), the 14 percent rate is approximately halved due

to this advantage.

     The effective marginal tax rate on nonprofit institutions is assumed to

be zero. The reason is that contributions to retirement accounts are not

taxable at personal rates. Since savings and interest earnings are taxed

when retirement income is paid out, the treatment is equivalent to a

consumption tax provided the individual remains in the same bracket.

Contributions to nonqualified accounts are relatively small, and the




    6Two other alternative adjustments have been suggested but are not used
 here. The first takes explicit account of the interest ceiling on time
 deposits. The other was put forth by Feldstein and Summers (1979). Both of
 these are described in detail in KF.
                                       —16 —




taxation   of interest income can be postponed until retirement. In this case

the present value of those tax payments is very small.

     The taxation of income received through insurance companies follows

some complicated procedures described in KF (pp. 227—234). For our

purposes, the tax rates for the years 1980 through 1983 are shown in Table

111.5 to be 6.9 percent for dividends, 28 percent statutory rate for

retained earnings, and 0.149 + 3.88w for debt, where ir is the inflation

rate. In 1984 the complicated procedures were replaced by a simple 20

percent exclusion, so the effective rate on interest income is 80 percent of

the statutory 46 percent tax rate. Thus, it is taxed at 0.368, and the

dependence on inflation is e1iminated. The following year that rate

remained the salue, and in 1986 the 20 percent exclusion was repealed when

the statutory rate was lowered for all corporations to 34 percent.

Intercorporate dividends receive an 80 percent deduction from the corporate

rate in 1986, and are thus taxed at 6.8 percent. The special rate for

capital gains was repealed.



D. Investment Tax Credits

     All qualifying equipment and public utility structures received a

statutory investment tax credit (ITC) of 10 percent in 1980. Two—thirds of

 that credit was allowed for equipment with a 5 or 6 year life, and one—third

was allowed for equipment with a 3 or 4 year life. As shown in Table 111.6,

under ERTA the rate for autos increased from 0.033 to 0.06, while all other

 equipment received the full 10 percent ITC. The Tax Reform Act of 1986

 repeals the ITC altogether. We assume that the companies under

 consideration have enough taxable profits to enable them to use those
                                      —17--




credits, although in fact many companies do not.7 Since the whole investment

outlay qualifies for tax credit, the parameter f3 is set to one.



E. Inventory Accounting

     United States corporations are allowed to use any number of consistent

accounting methods including Last—in First—out (LIFO) and First—in First—out

(FIFO), but they are obligated to use the same method for profits reported

to shareholders as they use for profits reported to the taxing authorities.

In an environment with no inflation, the two methods yield identical figures

and the choice between them should leave the firm indifferent. With

inflation, however, FIFO profits appear to be higher than LIFO. Therefore,

although firm managers might like to report FIFO profits to shareholders,

taxes can be reduced by reporting LIFO profits to the IRS. Of the possible

values that exist for our parameter, v, we set it equal to zero, assuming

that firms act so as to minimize their tax liability. This assumption is

consistent with the use of minimum lifetimes and maximum acceleration in the

depreciation of assets, discussed below.



F. Depreciation Allowances

     Estimates of the actual economic depreciation of the different assets

are provided by Hulten and Wykoff (1981) and are shown in Table 111.7.

These are carefully distinguished from the tax lifetimes that are also shown

for each year in Table 111.7. The first twenty assets will be aggregated to

form our machinery category, while the next fourteen assets will form our




7See, for example, Jorgenson and Sullivan (1981). For the effects of
imperfect loss offsets, see Auerbach (1986) or Mayer (1986).
                                        —18—




buildings category. Inventories are not shown in this table because they do

not depreciate.

     The lifetimes reported for 1980 stem from the estimates of the

midpoints of the Asset Depreciation Range (ADR) found in Jorgenson and

Sullivan (1981). More specifically, the ADR system allowed 20 percent

longer or shorter lives for equipment (assets 1 — 20) and public utility

structures (assets 27 —   31).   Because of our assumption of optimizing tax

practice, these assets are assigned lives that are 80 percent of ADR

midpoints except where the use of a longer lifetime would reduce effective

taxes through eligibility for a higher investment tax credit. Hence, these

lifetimes are consistent with the ITC vector, shown for 1980 in Table 111.6

column one, in that the three— and five—year assets get one—third and two—

thirds of the full ITC, respectively.

     Under the 1980 law, also, equipment and public utility structures were

allowed double declining balance (DDB) with a switch to sum—of—the—years—

digits (SYD).8 Other structures (assets 21—26 and 32—34) received 150

percent declining balance with a switch to straight line. Since capital

consumption allowances are based on historical cost, we use the nominal

after tax discount rate, p, to calculate their present value, A. This

calculation accounts for the half year convention, annual allowances, and

continuous discounting (see KF pp. 210—211).

     The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 introduced the Accelerated Cost

Recovery System (ACRS) under which any depreciable asset fell into one of

 four classes and is given a tax life of three, five, ten, or fifteen years.

These lifetimes, which are shown in Table 111.7 column three, assigned a



   8This combination is used here as tax—minimizing practice because it can
be shown to provide the earliest possible depreciation deductions. See
Shoven and Bulow (1975).
                                        —19 —




three-year   life to autos, a five—year life to other equipment, a ten-year

life to some gas and other public utility structures, and a fifteen—year

life to railroads, telephone and telegraph, electric light and power, and

all other structures. Machinery and public utilities were to receive DDB

switching to SYD, as before, but depreciation was moved up from the last

half year. As a result, the three-year class depreciated in only 2.5 years,

the five-year class in 4.5 years, and so on. Other structures received 175

percent declining balance still switching to straight line.

        In 1982, allowances for machinery and public utilities were cut back to

150 percent declining balance, switching to straight line rather than SYD.

Further, the 1982 act decreased the depreciation basis by half of the

investment tax credit. Other changes in 1984 and 1985 lengthened lifetimes

for structures and are shown in Table 111.7. In 1986, autos were moved from

3 to 5 years, and some other assets were moved from 5 to 7 or 10 years, but

the depreciation method was accelerated to DDB. Some long—lived assets such

as public utility structures received 15 or 20 years with 150 percent

declining balance, while nonresidential structures got 31.5 year straight

line.

        All these changes in the tax laws are captured in the respective A

parameters for each of the 34 assets. These values are then weighted

appropriately to obtain the aggregate depreciation allowances for each of

our three categories.9 As explained earlier, each A is multiplied by the

statutory corporate tax rate, T, to provide the tax savings Ad. Finally,

the parameter f1 is set to one, indicating that all equipment and structures




   9Appendix D of King and Fullerton (1984) describes how we weight the 34
values of A to the three categories.
                                      —20—




depreciate for tax purposes as described above, and f2 is set to zero to

indicate no immediate free depreciation of investment.




IV. The Results



     Our primary findings for each year concern the fixed—p calculations for

the standard inflation rate of 6.77 percent. For 1980 the overall weighted

marginal effective tax rate on corporate capital income in the United States

is 37 percent. As anticipated, this figure matches exactly the one found in

KF. The interpretation is that if all, assets started with a gross return of

10 percent, and if all capital of all owners were increased by one dollar,

then the present value of the expected tax would be 37 percent of the

additional return. It is noteworthy that this effective rate is less than

the 46 percent statutory corporate tax rate, because the effective rate

incorporates many factors that tend to offset or increase overall taxes.

     Table IV.l shows the breakdown of this effective tax rate by asset,

industry, source of finance, and ownership category, for the three inflation

rates. The bottom row shows that the overall effective rate increases

somewhat with inflation, from 32 percent with zero inflation to 38.5 percent

with 10 percent inflation. To help explain this relationship, look at the

rates that correspond to the source of finance categories. The effective

rates for new shares and retained earnings increase steeply with inflation

since the returns are taxed in nominal terms, but debt financed investment

 is subsidized at rates that also increase with inflation. This subsidy

 arises because corporations can deduct nominal interest at a 49.5 percent

 rate while recipients include it at a much lower 23.6 percent rate (averaged
                                     —21—




over the three owners). The overall rates at the bottom of the table weigh

the rates for the three sources of finance according to the proportions

described in section III, so the two effects of inflation offset each other.

    Under the fully phased—in 1981 law, the overall effective rate for

actual inflation is shown in Table IV.2 to be a much lower 23.5 percent.

This reduction is attributed primarily to two sources. First, an across the

board reduction in personal tax rates was instituted by ERTA in an effort to

stimulate the economy. Second, there was a considerable reduction in the

depreciation lifetimes. As a result of these two factors plus the use of

double declining balance and the ITC, equipment receives a subsidy of 8.5

percent. In addition, structures were previously taxed at 41.2 percent but

under 1981 law are taxed at only 27.8 percent. A less significant decline

to 44.4 percent occurred for inventories. As pointed out by Fullerton and

Henderson (1984), the Economic Recovery Tax Act implied substantially

disparate tax treatments for depreciable assets on the one hand, and for

land and inventories on the other.

     In 1982, the method of depreciation was cut back to 150 percent of

declining balance for equipment and public utility structures, as reflected

in the higher effective tax rates for machinery and structures shown in

Table IV.3. Equipment moved from a 8.5 percent subsidy to an 8 percent tax,

and structures increased to 31 percent. Inventories, which do not

depreciate, were unaffected. As expected, then, the rates for all the

different category breakdowns are higher. In particular, the "other

 industry" group moves from a small subsidy in 1981 to a 9.7 percent tax in

 1982 because it includes public utilities. Thus the overall rate increased

 to 29 percent in 1982. Since there were no further changes the next year,

 the same rates are also applicable to 1983.
                                     —22--




     In evaluating the effects of the changes that took place in 1984, it

helps initially to look at the first column in Table IV.4 for the rates at

zero inflation. We want to abstract from the effect of inflation because

the tax rate on interest income earned by insurance companies through 1983

depended explicitly on the rate of inflation. We find that all the

effective rates have increased from the previous year for two reasons.

First, the tax lifetimes for most structures were increased from 15 to 18

years, thus reducing the present value of the depreciation allowances for

these assets. Second, the tax rate on interest income earned by insurance

companies rose to 36.8 percent. In addition, its previous dependence on the

rate of inflation was eliminated. Hence, moving to the rates under actual

inflation, we see that both the rate for insurance companies and the overall

rate have fallen from the previous year, to 14 and 28.4 percent,

respectively.

     The results for 1985 are very similar to those in 1984, but slightly

higher as seen in Table IV.5. The reason is that the lifetimes of all

structures besides public utilities were extended to 19 years.

Consequently, the effective tax rates for machinery and inventories remained

the same, whereas the rate for structures rose to 31.4 percent. This change

pushed the overall rate for 1985 to 28.6 percent.

     The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the differences in the tax treatment

of the various assets. In that spirit, the investment tax credit was

repealed. The statutory corporate rate was decreased to 34 percent, and the

lifetimes for most assets were lengthened. In the fixed—p case of Table

IV.6, these changes translate into much higher effective tax rates for

machinery, a smaller dispersion among the rates of the three asset classes,

and an overall rate of 42 percent. It is interesting that, for the first
                                       —23 —




time   in the seven years we examined, the overall effective rate is higher

than the statutory corporate rate. That is, largely because of ITC repeal,

the combination of corporate taxes and personal taxes is now greater than

the corporate rate by itself.

       As seen in Table IV.6, the returns to debt financed investments are now

taxed rather than subsidized, at low inflation rates, because corporations

deduct interest at a much lower corporate tax rate. This effect is

partially offset by the smaller reduction in the personal rates on interest

income. The effective rates for new share issues fell a little due to the

lower statutory rates on dividends of households and insurance companies,

while capital gains face a higher effective rate than before.

       Calculations for the fixed—r case in 1985 and 1986 are shown in Tables

111.7 and 111.8.10 These results show effective tax rates for an equilibrium in

which investors have been allowed to adjust their behavior in response to

the various incentives. As such, these rates become more relevant in

assessing the welfare loss due to the taxation of capital income.     The

rates for 1985 in Table IV.7 are higher than in the fixed—p case, for almost

every breakdown, but the same pattern persists. Debt is still subsidized at

rates that grow rapidly with inflation, and machinery is still taxed at

lower rates than the other assets. Effects of the 1986 law are also similar

to those in the fixed—p case. For 1986 compared to 1985, an overall rate of

50 percent instead of 42 implies an additional intertemporal distortion that

has to be weighed against the welfare gains arising from the more equal

treatment of the different assets."


 10 These results are comparable to those found in Fullerton (1987) for the
 individual arbitrage case.
   '1One could calculate Harberger (1966) triangles and measure the welfare
loss due to the distortion in the allocation of resources between the
corporate and the noncorporate sector, or between machinery and buildings.
                                     —24—




    One very interesting and important aspect of this study is not

demonstrated in the calculations presented thus far. The overall effective

tax rates conceal the distribution of individual tax rates within each year.

To illustrate these differences, we present histograms for the fixed—p case

and the actual inflation rate for 1985 and 1986. Figure IV.l shows the

histogram for 1985, where the height of each bar is the sum of the capital

stock weights for any individual combinations that are taxed at effective

rates falling in each 10 percent interval between —120 and +100 percent.'2 We

find that 22.6 percent of the capital stock is subsidized, while 32 percent

of the capital stock is taxed at rates 80 percent or higher. The highest

subsidy in 1985 is 114.7 percent, received by investment projects in assets

in the "other industry" category, financed by debt sold to tax—exempt

insitutions.

     The histogram for 1986 shown is in Figure IV.2. An important point is

that the dispersion is much smaller in 1986. This result suggests a

considerable reduction in the distortions introduced by the tax system.

Also, in 1985 the largest fraction of capital income, 28.6 percent, was

taxed at rates that fell between 70 and 80 percent. In 1986, despite the

increase in the overall mean effective tax rates, the largest fraction of

capital, 26.7 percent, is now taxed at rates that fall between 60 and 70

percent. In other words, the increase in the overall average comes from

reducing subsidies on some capital rather than from increasing the tax on

most capital.




Examples include Cravelle (1982), Shoven (1976), or Fullerton, Shoven, and
Whalley (1983).
         histogram for 1985 is fairly representative of all the preceding
 years as well. A histogram for 1980 is presented in KF.
                                     —25—




    Finally, we look at the effects of inflation on the effective tax

rates. Figure IV.3 shows how the overall rate changes as the rate of

inflation varies from zero to ten percent in the years 1980, 1985, and 1986.

The rates for 1980 and 1986 lie everywhere above the rate for 1985, and

exhibit a moderate tendency to rise with inflation. The schedule for 1985 is

almost flat.

     However, these schedules are weighted averages of the various

categories and thus suppress the considerable variation of rates among

categories. To illustrate, we present figures to show the sensitivity of

the rates for each of the three assets with respect to inflation. Figure

IV.4 shows that in 1985 the difference among the rates for the three assets

is very big at low rates of inflation. This difference decreases with

inflation. The rate for machinery rises, while the rate for buildings

remains the same and the rate for inventories falls slightly.

     The Tax Reform Act of 1986 brought the rates for the three assets very

close together. As seen in Figure IV.5, these rates differ much less than

in 1985 when there is no inflation, and they tend to converge as the rate of

inflation increases to ten percent. Once again, we see that the effect of

the reform was to eliminate much of the interasset distortion.



V. Concluding Remarks



     We examined the tax laws that affected capital income in the corporate

 sector of the U.S. economy from 1980 to 1986. We estimated marginal

 effective tax rates for hypothetical investment projects during that period

 in order to quantify the incentive effects of the tax system. From the
                                       —26 —




plethora   of numbers presented thus far, one can easily lose sight of the

important questions that we have been able to answer. We therefore

summarize the major findings of this study.

     Focusing on the overall effective rates under actual inflation in the

fixed—p case, we saw that they started at around 37 percent in 1980,

remained almost ten percentage points lower until 1986, and then rose back

to 42 percent. It would appear that in 1981, when the rates were lowest,

the tax system created a more favorable environment for investment and

caused fewer intertemporal distortions than in any other year. However, the

histograms provided in Figures IV.l and IV.2 suggest that the distribution

of rates needs to be evaluated as well.

     When a substantial proportion of the capital stock is being subsidized

at different rates, as it was in 1985, there may be considerable

misallocation of resources and biased economic growth. This misallocation

could imply substantial welfare losses. In 1986, the tax rates were

distributed more uniformly and hence may have removed a welfare loss.

      In addition, we found that equipment constantly received a more

 favorable tax treatment than the other assets because of the investment tax

 credit, until 1986. Debt financing was subsidized because of the

 deductibility of interest payments by corporations. Repeal of the ITC and

 reduction of the corporate tax rate in 1986 helped reverse both of these

 differences.

      Capital income accruing to insurance companies was taxed at rates that

 increased steeply with inflation. That effect was eliminated in 1984. In

 general, the overall effective tax rates do not show much sensitivity to the

 rate of inflation. However, this insensitivity is still the result of

 offsetting effects. Without indexation of depreciation or interest income,
                                       —27 —




inflation   still serves to raise the effective tax   rate   on assets depreciated

on a historical cost basis and to lower the effective tax rate on assets

financed by issuing debt.
