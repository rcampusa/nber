                                           ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes the role productivity growth had on disinflation in Chile during the 1990s. It

argues that productivity growth was key in avoiding the output costs of stabilization in a highly

indexed economy. Disinflation from the early 1990s through 1998 was costless. Among the many

external and domestic factors that contributed to good macroeconomic performance, which

combined simultaneously very high rates of growth and declining inflation, productivity stands high.

The simulations presented in this paper illustrate this point.

1. Introduction


       Chile enjoyed unprecedented economic success during the 1990s, in particular until
1998. Inflation, measured at the end of the year, declined from 27.3 percent in 1990 to 4.7
percent in 1998, and in every year of the decade, the inflation rate was below that in the
previous year. Since 1994, inflation has been in single digits, something previously seen
only on the eve of the 1982 crisis (briefly) and in the early 1960s. Meanwhile output grew
at a record annual rate of 7.6 percent from 1990 to 1998, which is impressive not only by
Chile’s own historical standards but by international standards as well (figure 1). In terms
of both output growth and inflation, the decade of the 1990s was the period of highest
achievement in Chile’s modern economic history.
       The surge in growth began before the decline in inflation, having started during the
recovery from the debt crisis in the mid-1980s. Indeed, in the seventeen years from 1985 to
2002, GDP grew at an average annual rate of 6 percent. The persistent decline in inflation,
by contrast, occurred only after 1990 (figure 2).
       Chile has long been a country with chronic moderate to high inflation. Between
1960 and 1990, the average annual inflation rate was 72 percent, although that average falls
to 26 percent when the years of three-digit inflation, 1972-76, are excluded. The slow but
persistent reduction of inflation is particularly impressive in that it was not accompanied by
output losses. Why was disinflation so successful in Chile? And why were there no output
costs in bringing down inflation in a country so used to high inflation?
       These questions have received two different answers. The first answer claims that
Chile’s success was the result of good macroeconomic policies, including a clear
commitment to reducing inflation, sound fiscal policy, and the adoption of an inflation
targeting strategy. However, there are at least three problems with this view. The first is
that Chile’s disinflation was not just accompanied by low output costs, but by no output
costs at all. Although the absence of output costs is consistent with a fully credible
disinflation à la Lucas and Sargent, in those models prices are fully flexible except for
informational problems, which can be overcome if there is sufficient policy credibility. In
contrast, there was a high degree of price stickiness in the Chilean economy, in particular



                                               1
through the widespread use of backward-looking indexation in labor contracts. Thus one
cannot explain a disinflation with no output costs at all (see, for example, De Gregorio,
1995). Second, one also has to account for the speed of the disinflation. A fully credible
disinflation is also a rapid one. But the decline of inflation in Chile was quite slow,
characterized by the sluggishness in prices that is the expected result of accommodation in
an economy that has lived so long with inflation. Finally, during this period there was no
clear subordination of macroeconomic policy to the anti-inflation strategy. Indeed, there
were several episodes in which control of inflation was subordinated to exchange rate
policy. In addition, the inflation target was set annually on a declining path, recognizing
the need to disinflate gradually, and the target was set at a level consistent with inflationary
trends. This is why Chile’s inflation target was difficult to distinguish from an inflation
forecast.
           The other answer that one hears is that Chile’s successful disinflation was due to
good luck: that the fall in inflation was the result of a highly favorable external
environment, which induced a large appreciation of the peso, which in turn ultimately
drove inflation down. 1 However, this view, too, is at best incomplete. It cannot explain
why, when the external environment turned sharply negative, as it did in the early 2000s,
inflation did not return to its previous high levels. This view fails to recognize that, given
its strong macroeconomic fundamentals, Chile should have had low inflation, and hence the
issue is how it made the transition from high to low inflation. The existence of an
independent central bank, with an explicit mandate of price stability, was essential to
inducing credibility in the declining path of inflation. Meanwhile the performance of fiscal
policy was also very strong. Between 1990 and 1998 gross public debt fell from 76 percent
to 34 percent of GDP, and net debt from 35 percent to 5 percent (figure 3). Relying only on
good luck to explain the success of disinflation ignores the argument that strong growth
performance was possible, among other things, because of Chile’s sound macroeconomic
policies.
           I take an intermediate view, arguing that strong output growth was a necessary
condition for Chile’s gradual and costless disinflation. The adoption of an inflation target,
coupled with strong fundamentals, provided room for achieving low inflation in the long

1
    This explanation is associated with Calvo and Mendoza (1999).

run, which was consistent with noninflationary backward-looking indexation. However,
the stickiness in wages and prices explains why the adjustment was very slow. It is in this
context that another factor, productivity growth, played a key role in speeding disinflation,
but above all in securing the systematic reduction of inflation. Thus, one can interpret the
inflation targeting of the 1990s as a commitment to a declining path of inflation consistent
with the prevailing slow adjustment of prices. Had productivity growth been slow, this
adjustment would not have been possible, since there was also the constraint of full lagged
wage indexation.
   In this paper I simulate a simple price adjustment in the presence of full indexation of
wages to past inflation. In such a scenario, if there is no growth, inflation reproduces itself,
and it is then impossible to reduce inflation without output losses. Thus a strong growth
performance is essential to avoid the stabilization costs to legitimate the disinflation as it
comes together with strong economic and social progress. The next section of the paper
presents the framework used for the simulations, which is based on a simple productive
structure of the economy with wage indexation. Section 3 presents the results, and section
4 concludes.


2. The Framework


   The exercise starts with the following demand function for labor in period t (lowercase
letters indicate the logarithm of the variable, and constants are normalized to zero):
                                      yt − lt = wt − pt ,                                (2.1)
where y is output, l is employment, w is nominal wages, and p is prices. The implicit
production function is Cobb-Douglas. This framework allows for prices to be a constant
markup over marginal costs, and, for normalization, the markup and the share of labor in
production are ignored.
       I assume 100 percent lagged indexation of wages. Nominal wages are increased by
inflation in the previous year, which in log terms implies that,
                                       wt = wt −1 + π t−1                                (2.2)

where π is inflation.




                                                 3
       The wage equation captures the simple idea that wages are fully adjusted for past
inflation. In order to be a reasonable working assumption a declining path of inflation is
needed. If inflation were rising, this would not be a sensible assumption. Although here I
assume a labor market at full employment and in which real wages equal the marginal
productivity of labor, the issue about the level of nominal wages is important to determine
the average real wage during the duration of the contract. Therefore, if inflation were
expected to rise, it would be unlikely that workers would tolerate a deterioration in their
real wages during the term of the contract, and hence they would demand a premium. In
Chile, however, with the central bank committed to declining inflation, the wage equation
(2.2) would entail real wage gains toward the end of the contract. One could add a real
wage drift to equation (2.2), but it would not change the basic mechanics of the simulations.
       Along similar lines, García (2003) has emphasized the distinction between expected
and unexpected productivity growth by assuming a wage equation with a drift based on
expected productivity gains. In contrast, in equation (2.2) I assume that unexpected shocks
are hedged by allowing adjustment of wages based on past inflation, as long as it is
expected that inflation will decline.
       Solving equation (2.1) for p and subtracting prices lagged one period on both sides,
we have


                              π t = wt−1 − p t−1 + π t− 1 − ( yt − lt )                (2.3)


But for real wages during t - 1 we can use equation (2.1) lagged one period to arrive at

                                      π t = π t−1 − ( yˆ t − lˆt )                     (2.4)

where a caret over the variable represents a rate of change. I will use this as a baseline
equation for the exercises below. However, to add more realism to the Chilean experience
of the 90s, one needs to add the exchange rate. I consider the exchange rate in what
follows.
       Consider an open economy that produces traded and nontraded goods, identified by
the subscripts T and N, respectively. A proportion α of the goods are nontraded, and the
remaining 1 - α are traded goods.




                                                      4
       Now consider that the inflation rate on the left-hand side of equation (2.4)
corresponds to inflation in nontraded goods (π N). In this case we need to add to the change
in inflation the change in the real exchange rate.
       We can write inflation as a weighted average of inflation in traded and inflation in
nontraded goods, with weights α and 1 - α, respectively. In addition, the real exchange rate
(q), defined as the price of foreign goods in domestic currency (sp*) relative to the price of
domestic goods (p), can be shown to be
                                         q = α ( pT − pN ) ,                              (2.5)
where the price of traded goods is pT = sp*, and s is the nominal exchange rate.
       It is easy to show that inflation in nontraded goods can then be written as
                                                     1 −α
                                        πN =π −           qˆ ,                            (2.6)
                                                       α
which, substituted into equation (2.4), leads to the following expression for inflation:
                                                              1−α
                                  π t = π t−1 − ( yˆ − lˆ ) +     qˆ ,                    (2.7)
                                                               α
Strictly speaking, productivity growth as in equation (2.7) should be productivity in
nontraded goods, but for the purpose of the simulations, and given some additional
assumptions, it is possible to justify the use of economy-wide productivity.
    One could add some other ingredients to this formulation. For example, one could
assume that wages are partly indexed, and partly based on expectations or the credibility of
the inflation target. Therefore wages would increase both with past inflation and with the
inflation target: wt = wt-1+ϕπ t-1+(1 - ϕ)π*. In addition, it is possible to link productivity to
the evolution of the real exchange rate along the lines of Balassa and Samuelson. However,
I do not pursue these extensions, because the simulations, rather than replicating the actual
path of inflation, attempt only to show a lower bound for inflation given an extreme
assumption of total indexation.


3. Results


    The two basic simulations are presented in figures 4 and 5. The simulations are static;
that is, to simulate period t, I use the actual values of inflation in t - 1, since at the moment



                                                     5
contracts were indexed, all past information was known, and in addition, the inflation target
was also set on a yearly basis.
   Two extreme assumptions are considered regarding the share of nontraded goods. In
figure 4 I assume the economy is closed, so that all goods are nontraded. This is the most
unfavorable scenario for the reduction of inflation, since the change in the real exchange
rate plays no role. In the other case I assume that half of all goods are traded, in which case
(1-α )/α is equal to 1. This is a case of a very open economy, since, as suggested by recent
research, even traded goods have an important nontraded component, mainly in the
distribution sector. Therefore the traded goods share is smaller than that implied by
classifying large economic sectors as traded or nontraded. In this case the contribution of
the change in the real exchange rate to disinflation is at its maximum.
   In the case of the closed economy (α = 0), figure 4 shows that, except for a couple of
minor deviations, the simulated mechanical rate of inflation derived from full backward
indexation was always until 1998 below actual inflation. Therefore the inflation path was
consistent with what the economy could actually achieve. In contrast, the dashed line
shows the simulation assuming no productivity growth. In this case the minimum possible
rate of inflation would have been the past rate of inflation. Of course, in the case of no
productivity growth one would need to have other reasons to explain the decline in inflation
over time. Precisely, what the figure highlights is that the trajectory of inflation that
occurred between 1990 and 1998 would have not been possible if actual inflation would
have not been below past inflation, and for that productivity growth was necessary.
   The other simulation, presented in figure 5, includes the contribution of the change in
the real exchange rate to disinflation. As expected, the minimum feasible rate of inflation
consistent with both productivity growth and the path of the real exchange rate is lower
than in the previous case, because of the additional impact of the real appreciation. And
again, the actual path of inflation was consistent with this lower bound. Of course, the
change in the real exchange rate was related to productivity growth, as well as the favorable
external conditions regarding the terms of trade and capital inflows. In this exercise,
however, I have considered productivity growth and the real exchange rate to move
independently.




                                                6
    What is interesting to note in figure 5 is that when only the real appreciation is
considered and no productivity growth is assumed (the dashed line), disinflation would
have not been possible under full backward indexation. This is clearly a conservative
estimate, since, as explained before, without productivity growth the appreciation would
have been lower, and hence the simulated rate of inflation would have been even higher.
The bottom line is that changes in the real exchange rate are not enough by themselves to
explain the disinflation; the increase is still necessary productivity.
    Finally, note also in figure 5 that the deceleration of growth and the real depreciation
that have taken place in Chile since 1999 would not have allowed a further decline in
inflation if full backward indexation had still been pervasive. Indeed, in the presence of full
backward indexation one would have expected inflation to go back up. Two additional
factors that were not present at the beginning of the disinflation must be considered when
analyzing macroeconomic developments since 1999. First, the decline in inflation in these
years did have output costs, as one would expect under normal circumstances, and they
have allowed a further reduction of inflation to historically low levels in Chile. But, in
addition, there is evidence that indexation has become much less important
    The deindexation process that has occurred in Chile is illustrated in figure 6. The figure
shows average growth in wage and labor costs across six-month periods as well as inflation
during the past six months, forwarded four months ahead. The data are smoothed using
quarterly moving averages. Thus the figure graphically aligns wages and labor costs with
the period of past inflation that is relevant for indexation purposes since 1990. If there
were widespread indexation, one would never observe inflation above wages and labor
costs. The figure thus suggests that indexation has been on the wane recently, in particular
since 2003. Of course, deindexation may have started much earlier, but the recent data
provide the most definitive evidence. As expected, indexation is a way of protecting wages
in an environment of high inflation. As inflation has come down and the economy is still
below full employment, wages have moved consistently with the inflation target, making
the indexation rigidities much less relevant. This later period coincides with the
implementation of a full-fledged inflation targeting regime, which has kept inflation low.

4. Concluding Remarks


    This paper has made a simple point: that the successful growth performance of the
Chilean economy in the 1990s was essential to Chile’s unprecedented disinflation.
Although the decline in inflation was slow by many standards, it was not accompanied by
output costs. Instead, just as indexation was putting constraints on the speed of disinflation,
productivity growth was at the same time relaxing those constraints. I have used a simple
framework where there is full backward- indexation. 2
    I do not discuss here the relationship between the inflation targets of the 1990s and the
actual reduction of inflation. What the exercise performed here shows is that the targets
were fully consistent with the actual rigidities in the economy. In addition, a commitment
to a persistent decline in inflation was necessary to achieve consistency between indexation
and wage setting. Backward-looking indexation and low inflation is much more difficult to
sustain in an environment were inflation is not actually declining.
    On the question of whether Chile’s disinflation was due to good luck or good policies,
one cannot deny that the 1990s were years of a very positive external environment for
emerging economies, which may have allowed for an extra growth bonus. However,
Chile’s persistent growth is to a large extent the result of good policies and good
institutions (De Gregorio and Lee, 2003). In particular, evidence has shown that low
inflation fosters economic growth. But the point made here is that growth in turn can make
a great contribution to disinflation, and the Chilean experience is a good example.




2
 In general, what matters for the costs and speed of stabilization is not indexation, but price inertia (Lefort
and Schmidt-Hebbel, 2002). In this paper, productivity growth reduces price inertia induced by the presence
of widespread indexation.
