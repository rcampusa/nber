Using a comprehensive sample of trades by Schedule 13D filers, who possess valuable private information
when they accumulate stocks of targeted companies, this paper studies whether several liquidity measures
reveal the presence of informed trading. The evidence suggests that when Schedule 13D filers trade
aggressively, both high-frequency and low-frequency measures of stock liquidity indicate a higher
stock liquidity. Importantly, measures that have been used as direct proxies for adverse selection, such
the Kyle (1985) lambda, the Easley et al. (1996) pin measure, and the Amihud (2002) illiquidity measure,
suggest that the adverse selection is lower when informed trading takes place. The evidence is consistent
with informed traders being more aggressive when measured stock liquidity is high.

Introduction

       An extensive body of theory suggests that stock liquidity, as measured by the spread
between the bid and ask quotes and by the price impact of trades, should be informative
about the magnitude of asymmetric information between market participants (Copeland
and Galai, 1983; Glosten and Milgrom, 1985; Kyle, 1985; Easley and O’Hara, 1987;
Admati and Pfleiderer, 1988). For example, in his seminal contribution, Kyle (1985)
shows how an insider hides his private information and optimally accumulates shares at
a rate inversely proportional to his price impact,3 Kyle’s lambda, which measures the
dollar change in price due to a dollar change in order flow. In the cross-section stocks
with more informed trading relative to noise trading experience larger price impact.
Specifically, Kyle’s lambda, which can be estimated from a regression of price change on
order flow, is higher for stocks with more informed trading (relative to liquidity trading).
       Following that literature there have been many attempts to measure trading costs
empirically, and to decompose such costs into different components such as a adverse
selection, order processing cost, and inventory cost (e.g., early papers include Glosten,
1987; Glosten and Harris, 1988; Stoll, 1989; Hasbrouck, 1991; Amihud, 2002). An
extensive empirical literature relies on adverse selection measures assuming they capture
information asymmetry (e.g., Barclay and Hendershott, 2004; Vega, 2006; Duarte et al.,
2008; Bharath et al., 2009; Kelly and Ljungqvist, 2011).
       Do these empirical measures of stock liquidity actually capture information asym-
metry?
       Most measures rely on some empirical estimate of price impact and its persistence to
identify the amount of private information in trades. There is an obvious endogeneity
issue with this approach. Ideally, one would want to separate informed from uninformed
trades ex-ante, and test their impact on price changes. Unfortunately, since we generally

   3
    The insider’s optimal trading strategy is to trade as a linear function of the difference between his
signal and the current price, at a rate inversely proportional to his price impact, and that increases as
maturity approaches so that all the information eventually makes it into prices.



                                                   2
do not know the traders’ information sets, this is hard to do in practice. As a result,
it is often assumed that some types of investors are informed. For example, Boulatov
et al. (2009) use the institutional order flow as a proxy for informed trading.
    In this paper, we use a novel data set of trades by investors we can identify as having
substantial private information, to study whether proposed liquidity measures reveal the
presence of informed trading. Specifically, we exploit a disclosure requirement to identify
trades that rely on valuable private information. Rule 13d-1(a) of the 1934 Securities
Exchange Act requires investors to file with the SEC within 10 days of acquiring more
than 5% of any class of securities of a publicly traded company if they have an interest
in influencing the management of the company. In particular, Item 5(c) of Schedule 13D
requires the filer to “... describe any transactions in the class of securities reported on
that were effected during the past sixty days or since the most recent filing of Schedule
13D, whichever is less.” Thus, Schedule 13D filings reveal the date and price at which
all trades by the Schedule 13D filer were executed during the 60 days that precede the
filing date.4
    We hand collect a comprehensive sample of trades from the Schedule 13D filings. We
view this sample as an interesting laboratory to study the liquidity and the price impact
of informed trades. First, an average Schedule 13D filing in our sample is characterized
by a positive and significant market reaction upon announcement. For example, the
cumulative return in excess of the market is about 6% in the (t-10,t+1) window around
the filing date and about 3% in the (t-1,t+1) window around the filing date. Second, we
calculate several measures of profits made by Schedule 13D filers and show that these
profits are economically significant. For example, an average Schedule 13D filer gains
$1.13 million on a $30 million stake in a $404 million market cap company. Third, we
document performance of trading strategies that replicate trades of Schedule 13D filers.
The evidence suggests that these strategies exhibit positive and significant alpha when

   4
     As we explain in Section 2, our sample includes original Schedule 13D filings only, i.e., amendments
to previously submitted filings are excluded from the sample.



                                                   3
either one-, three-, or four-factor models are concerned. For example, a trading strategy
that replicates trades by Schedule 13D filers exhibits a 0.09% daily alpha in the four-
factor model. To summarize, the evidence implies that Schedule 13D filers’ information
is valuable. Therefore, we can classify the pre-announcement trades by Schedule 13D
filers as informed trades. It is also important to realize that, by its very nature, the
information held by Schedule 13D filers is likely to qualify as ‘private information.’ In
most cases, these activist share-holders know they can increase the value of the firm
they invest in by their own effort. Their effort level is, of course, conditional on their
achieving a large stake in the firm. It is their very actions and share-holdership that
constitutes the ‘private’ information in many cases.
   Our main empirical result is that standard liquidity measures do not reveal the
presence of informed traders. Instead, we find that standard liquidity measures suggest
that a stock is more liquid when there is significant informed trading in that stock.
Specifically, we find that all high-frequency measures of stock liquidity we consider are
lower on days on which Schedule 13D filers trade. For example, on an average day
when Schedule 13D filers trade, the measured price impact is almost 30% lower relative
to the sample average. Similarly to the high-frequency measures, the low-frequency
measures of stock liquidity suggest that liquidity is higher when Schedule 13D filers
trade. For example, Amihud’s illiquidity measure decreases by more than 45% on days
when Schedule 13D filers trade. Importantly, we show that days when Schedule 13D
filers trade are characterized by positive and significant market-adjusted returns, which
suggests that informed trades do impact prices. Liquidity measures, however, fail to
detect that price impact.
   Importantly, some of the liquidity measures we consider, such as the Kyle (1985)
lambda, the Easley et al. (1996) pin measure, and the Amihud (2002) illiquidity measure,
have been widely used in the literature as proxies for adverse selection. To summarize,
the evidence constitutes a serious challenge to the argument that standard measures
of stock price liquidity, and in particular of the adverse selection component, reveal


                                            4
the presence of informed trading, at least not trading based on the long-lived type
of information that Schedule 13D filers hold. Perhaps these measures are better at
capturing short-lived information, for which selection issues (i.e., the optimal timing
of his trades by the informed agent) are less of an issue. Collin-Dufresne and Fos
(2012) present a theoretical model where, because of time-variation in abnormal volume
unrelated to the information possessed by the insider, in equilibrium, standard price
impact measures may be uninformative about his trading.
   Consistent with this theoretical analysis, we show that Schedule 13D filers trade more
aggressively not only when the stock they are purchasing is more liquid, but also when
market-wide conditions change. For example, high aggregate volume and low market
return positively affect the likelihood of a trade by Schedule 13D filers on a given day.
   This paper is related to several strands of literatures.
   First, this paper contributes to the empirical literature that relies on liquidity
measures as a proxy for information asymmetry (e.g, Barclay and Hendershott, 2004;
Vega, 2006; Duarte et al., 2008; Bharath et al., 2009; Kelly and Ljungqvist, 2011). Our
evidence suggests that empirical measures of information asymmetry might not reveal
the presence of informed traders. Therefore, empirical researchers should be cautious
when relying on a liquidity measure as a proxy for information asymmetry.
   Second, our paper is related to the large literature on the estimation of the
asymmetric information component of transaction costs (e.g., Easley and O’Hara, 1987;
Glosten and Harris, 1988; Stoll, 1989; Hasbrouck, 1991; Lin et al., 1995). In contrast
to this literature, our paper does not rely on time-series properties of stock prices to
identify informed trades, but uses well-identified trades executed by informed traders to
study the impact of asymmetric information on stock price liquidity measures.
   Third, our paper is related to the empirical literature that studies the impact of
informed trading on the stock liquidity. One strand of this literature studies the impact
of share repurchases on stock liquidity and finds mixed results (Barclay and Smith, 1988;
Singh et al., 1994; Franz et al., 1995; Miller and McConnell, 1995; Brockman and Chung,


                                            5
2001; Ginglinger and Hamon, 2007). Another strand of this literature studies the impact
of insider trading on stock liquidity.5 While some studies conclude that insider trading
impairs stock liquidity (Bettis et al., 2000; Cheng et al., 2006), others show that there
is no significant effect of insider trading on stock liquidity (Chung and Charoenwong,
1998; Charoenwong and Chung, 2000; Cao et al., 2004). Our papers differs from this
literature in that it uses trades by investors we can identify as having significant private
information, as traders make substantial profits and their trades constitute a significant
fraction of the stock’s daily volume. Instead, in the extant insider trading literature it
is often not clear that the trades are based on substantial private information. Share
repurchases, for example, can be motivated not only by private information, but also
by liquidity needs (excess cash leads to higher stock repurchases), investment policy
(deterioration in investment opportunities leads to higher payouts), and compensation
policy (repurchasing shares in anticipation of option expirations). In addition, (legal)
insider trading usually constitute only a very small fraction of the daily stock trading
activity.
       One notable exception is the paper by Cornell and Sirri (1992), which our study
is closely related to. Cornell and Sirri (1992) present a clinical study of one case of
illegal insider trading during Anheuser-Busch’s 1982 tender offer for Campbell Taggar,
for which they obtained ex-post court records to identify trades by corporate insiders
and their tippees. They find that surprisingly liquidity increases when there is active
informed trading.      Our findings are consistent with their case study, but uses a
comprehensive data-set of trades by legal ‘insiders.’
       Fourth, in a recent paper, Obizhaeva (2011) provides evidence on selection bias
in liquidity estimates. Obizhaeva shows that liquidity is lower than what is usually

   5
     Whether trades by corporate insiders contain valuable information is an empirical question. For
example, Lakonishok and Lee (2001) show that very little market movement is observed when insiders
trade and when they report their trades to the SEC. Recently, Cohen et al. (2012) decompose insider
trading into routine (i.e., uninformed) and opportunistic (i.e., informed) and show that only the
opportunistic trades yield positive abnormal return. However, even in that case the dollar profits
realized by the insiders are trivial.


                                                 6
measured, especially in high volume markets, because traders employ price-dependent
strategies and often choose not to execute their orders entirely. Related, our results point
to another distinct selection bias in liquidity measures due to the endogenous timing of
the trading strategies of informed investors.
   Finally, the paper contributes to the corporate governance literature by showing how
activist shareholders benefit from liquid stock markets. Kyle and Vila (1991), Bolton and
von Thadden (1998), and Maug (1998) predict that greater liquidity trading facilitates
monitoring and shareholder activism. While recent empirical papers show that stock
liquidity facilitates hedge fund activism and proxy contests (Brav et al., 2008; Klein
and Zur, 2009; Fos, 2012), this paper provides direct evidence on the magnitude of
these profits. Importantly, in this paper we show that trading strategies of activist
shareholders depend on stock liquidity. That is, we provide the micro-level data to
support the conjecture that higher stock liquidity benefits activist shareholders who
actively intervene in corporate governance.
   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 1 provides an overview of the
institutional background. Section 2 describes the data. The magnitude of information
asymmetry is analyzed in Section 3. Section 4 describes liquidity measures used in
the analysis. Section 5 presents the main evidence on the effect of informed trading
on liquidity measures. Section 6 documents the effect of exogenous variation in stock
liquidity on trading strategies of Schedule 13D filers. Finally, Section 7 concludes.


1. Institutional Background

   In this section we summarize the institutional background and describe what
information we exploit in empirical tests. Rule 13d-1(a) of the 1934 Securities Exchange
Act requires investors to file with the SEC within 10 days of acquiring more than 5% of
any class of securities of a publicly traded company if they have an interest in influencing




                                              7
the management of the company.6
       Item 5(c) of Schedule 13D requires the filer to “... describe any transactions in the
class of securities reported on that were effected during the past sixty days or since the
most recent filing of Schedule 13D, whichever is less.” Importantly, we restrict our sample
to original Schedule 13D filings only, i.e., amendments to previously submitted filings
are excluded from the sample (this maximizes the ‘asymmetric information’ content of
the trades by the insider). Thus, our Schedule 13D filings reveal the date and price
for all transactions by the Schedule 13D filer that were executed during sixty days that
precede the filing date. Figure 1 presents a typical time line of a Schedule 13 filing.

                                        [Insert Figure 1 here]

       For each event we extract the following information from the Schedule 13D filings:
CUSIP of the underlying security, date of every transaction, transaction type (purchase
or sell), transaction size, and transaction price. In addition, we extract filing date, event
date (date of crossing the 5% threshold), and the beneficial ownership of the Schedule
13D filer at the filing date. In the vast majority of cases transaction data are reported at
daily frequency. If the transaction data are at higher-than-daily frequency, we aggregate
it to the daily level. Specifically, for every day we calculate the total change in stock
ownership and the average purchase price. The average price is the quantity-weighted
average of transaction prices.

   6
     In general, an investor who has an interest in influencing the management of the company is required
to file Schedule 13D in the following cases: (i) an investor’s position exceeds the legal threshold of 5%,
(ii) a group of investors decides to act as a legal group and the ownership of the group exceeds the
legal threshold of 5%, and (iii) an investor’s previously established position changes by more than 1%
of stocks outstanding, either positive or negative. This study exploits cases (i) and (ii) only, since the
incentive to trade on private information is the strongest when an investor’s position exceeds the legal
threshold of 5%.

2. Sample Description

2.1. The Sample of Schedule 13D Filings with Information on Trades

   The sample is constructed as follows. First, using an automatic search script, we
identify 9,580 Schedule 13D filings during 2001-2010. Next, we check the sample of
9,580 filings manually and identify events with information on trades. Since the trading
characteristics of ordinary equities might differ from those of other assets, we retain
only assets whose CRSP share codes are 10 or 11, i.e., we discard certificates, ADRs,
shares of beneficial interest, units, companies incorporated outside the U.S., Americus
Trust components, closed-end funds, preferred stocks, and REITs. We exclude stocks
whose prices are below $1 and above $1,000. Moreover, we exclude events that involve
derivatives, such as options, warrants, and swaps. Finally, we exclude Schedule 13D/A
filings (i.e., amendments to previously submitted filings) that are mistakenly classified
as original Schedule 13D filings.
   The final sample is the universe of all Schedule 13D filings that satisfy the above
criteria during 2001-2010 and consists of 1,725 events. Figure 2 presents the time
distribution of the Schedule 13D filings with information on trades in common stocks
during 2001-2010. During the sample period, on average 173 events take place each year.

                                    [Insert Figure 2 here]

   Next, we examine the trading strategy of Schedule 13D filers. The trading strategy
is described using the following three measures, which we describe in detail below: (1)
the probability that a Schedule 13D filer trades at least one share on a given day, (2) the
percentage of outstanding shares traded by Schedule 13D filers, and (3) the probability
of trading with a Schedule 13D filer. Each measure of the trading activity is calculated
at daily frequency. Figure 3 presents the cross-event average of each measure for the
sixty days prior to the filing date, plotted as a function of the distance to the filing day.

                                    [Insert Figure 3 here]


                                              9
   For every distance to the filing day, the probability that a Schedule 13D filer trades
at least one share is the number of filings with a non-zero trade by the filer divided
by the total number of Schedule 13D filings in the sample. Figure 3 indicates that
the probability that a Schedule 13D filer trades at least one share on a given day is
approximately 30% and it reaches a 50% level closer to the filing day.
   To further understand the trading strategy of Schedule 13D filers, we calculate the
percentage of outstanding shares traded by Schedule 13D filers. For every distance to
the filing day, the percentage of outstanding shares traded by Schedule 13D filers is the
ratio of the number of shares traded by the Schedule 13D filer to the number of total
shares outstanding. Figure 3 suggests that a Schedule 13D filer gradually increases the
percentage of outstanding shares purchased on every trading day. Closer to the filing
day Schedule 13D filers trade more aggressively. For example, the average percentage of
outstanding shares purchased on every trading day by the Schedule 13D filers increases
from 0.03%-0.07% to 0.2%-0.3% closer to the filing day.
   Finally, we observe that the probability of trading with a Schedule 13D filer co-
moves with the percentage of outstanding shares purchased by Schedule 13D filers. For
every distance to the filing day, the probability of trading with Schedule 13D filer is the
cross-event average of the number of shares traded by the filer divided by the security’s
volume from CRSP. If no trade is reported on a given day by the filer, the percentage
of outstanding shares traded by the filer is set to zero. The probability of facing an
informed trader in a transaction increases dramatically from 5% to 10%-15% level when
approaching the filing day.
   Summary statistics of trading strategies adopted by Schedule 13D filers are reported
in Table 1. Columns (1) and (4) report summary statistics of all reported trades. The
average (median) stock ownership on the filing date is 7.68% (6.20%). The average
(median) filer purchases 3.8% (2.8%) of outstanding shares during sixty-day period prior
to the filing date. It corresponds to an average (median) purchase of 1,304,126 (393,387)
shares at average (median) cost of $25.6 ($3.3) million. On days with non-zero informed


                                            10
volume the filer purchases 0.5% (0.2%) of outstanding shares.

                                   [Insert Table 1 here]

   The summary statistics of trades executed by Schedule 13D filers during the pre-event
days are reported in columns (2) and (4) and the summary statistics of trades during
the post-event days are reported in columns (3) and (6). The event day is the day when
the filer’s ownership exceeds the 5% threshold. The evidence suggests that Schedule
13D filers trade more aggressively in the post-event period. For example, the average
(median) increase in the ownership per trading day with non-zero informed volume is
0.8% (0.3%) during the post-event period compared with 0.3% (0.1%) during the pre-
event period. Similarly, the average (median) percentage of trading days with informed
trades increase from 34.7% (29.4%) during the pre-event period to 57.1% (57.2%) during
the post-event period.
   To summarize, the evidence suggests that (1) Schedule 13D filers do not trade every
day (but rather every two or three days), (2) when they trade, they trade a relatively
large fraction of the daily volume (around one quarter of the daily volume), (3) Schedule
13D filers trade more aggressively closer to the filing date.
   In our sample, 65% of companies are listed on the NASDAQ, 27% are listed on
the NYSE, and the remaining 8% are listed on the AMEX. Garfinkel and Nimalendran
(2003) suggest that there is a difference in the degree of anonymity between NASDAQ
and NYSE market structures. Specifically, they find evidence that is consistent with less
anonymity on the NYSE specialist system compared to the NASDAQ dealer system.
Consistently with Garfinkel and Nimalendran (2003), we find that Schedule 13D filers
trade more aggressively on the NASDAQ. For example, when Schedule 13D filers target
companies listed on the NASDAQ, the average trading strategy is shorter (15 trading
days on the NASDAQ vs. 17 trading days on the NYSE), filers purchase more shares
on every trading date (0.57% of outstanding shares on the NASDAQ vs. 0.30% of
outstanding shares on the NYSE), and end up with a larger block (7.61% on NASDAQ
vs. 7.00% on NYSE).

                                            11
2.2. Case Study: Icahn Capital LP vs. Chesapeake Energy Corporation

       To illustrate the informed trades that are the focus of this paper, we give a detailed
description of one specific case.
       On May 25, 2012, Icahn Capital LP filed a Schedule 13D indicating that it owned
7.56% of Chesapeake Energy Corporation (50,085,202 shares of common stock), which
operates in the Oil & Gas Operations industry. The filer in a letter to the Chesapeake
board included in the Schedule 13D filing, said that Icahn Capital LP planned to force
the break up of Chesapeake’s board and the installation of new directors nominated
by Icahn Capital LP and other leading shareholders. Therefore, the filer explicitly
highlighted the possibility of active engagement in company’s corporate governance.
       Figure 4 presents the percentage of outstanding shares owned by Icahn Capital LP
during the (f day − 36, f day) period, where f day is the filing day.7 The filer’s ownership
prior to the sixty-day disclosure period was 0.11% of Chesapeake Energy (702,367 shares
of common stock). During the sixty-day period before the filing date the filer purchased
7.46% of Chesapeake Energy (49,382,835 shares of common stock). All these shares
where purchased during the (f day − 36, f day − 1) period. The filer’s ownership crossed
the five-percent threshold on May 17, 2012 (the “event day”).

                                      [Insert Figure 4 here]

       The filer disclosed that the 50,085,202 shares of common stock were purchased for
$785,300,000, i.e., $15.68 per share. The filing reveals that the 702,367 shares purchased
prior to the sixty-day period were acquired at an average price of $14.54 per share while
the 49,382,835 shares that were purchased during the sixty-day period were acquired at
an average price of $15.70 per share. The average price of Chesapeake Energy shares
reached $17 per share level in the ten days after the filing and remained at $17.52 per
share during the post-filing month, suggesting that the filer gained $1.82 on average per

   7
    Since during the (t − 60, t − 37) period the filer did not trade stocks of Chesapeake Energy, this
period is not plotted in this figure.


                                                 12
share purchased. This gain aggregates to $91,981,854. In the forty days after the filing
the stock price reached $19.36 per share, raising Icahn Capital LP’s gain to $183,311,839.
       The price of Chesapeake Energy shares increased by 4.95% during the filing day
(May 25, 2012) and the following trading day (May 29, 2012). Therefore, the market’s
perception of the value created by Icahn Capital LP was clearly positive.
       Consistent with the evidence in Table 1, Figure 4 suggests that Icahn Capital LP
did not trade on every trading day during the sixty-day pre-filing period. Specifically,
the filer traded on eighteen trading days during the sixty-day period. Interestingly, the
filer traded when stock liquidity was high. For example, during the sixty-day period,
the average level of the Amihud (2002) illiquidity measure during days with trades by
Icahn Capital LP was 38% lower than during days with no trades by Icahn Capital LP.8


3. Are Schedule 13D filers informed?

       At the core of this study is the following assumption:                  Schedule 13D filers
possess valuable information on the underlying securities when they trade in the pre-
announcement period. We use three approaches to assess the extent of the filer’s private
information. First, we use short-term announcement event-day returns upon Schedule
13D filing. The short-term announcement event-day returns summarize the market’s
perception of the value created by Schedule 13D filers. Second, we use profits made
by Schedule 13D filers on purchasing stocks at the pre-announcement prices. Finally,
we evaluate the performance of trading strategies that replicate trades of Schedule 13D
filers.
       Note that Schedule 13D filers trade on long-lived information that, by its very nature,
is not likely to be available to other market participants. In most cases, it is their own
future actions, such as shareholder activism, that will increase the value of the firm. Of
course, this depends closely on their decision, and ability, to take a sizable stake in the

   8
    Amihud (2002) illiquidity measure is the ratio of absolute value of daily stock return to the dollar
trading volume, multiplied by 1000.


                                                  13
firm. In some sense, it is their very trading that constitutes the private information.
Only when they reach the 5% threshold, does the information, due to the disclosure
requirement, become public. We can measure the extent to which the market believes
their future action have value by looking at announcement returns. This also allows us
to measure the private information content of their trades.

3.1. Announcement Returns

    Figure 5 plots the average buy-and-hold return, in excess of the buy-and-hold return
on the value-weighed NYSE/AMEX/NASDAQ index from CRSP, from sixty days prior
to the filing date to forty days afterward. Panel A includes data from the 2001-2010
sample period. There is a run-up of about 7% between sixty days to one day prior to
the filing day. The two-day jump in excess return observed at the filing date is around
3%. After that the excess return remains positive and so that the post-filing ‘drift’
cumulates to a total of 13%.9 Thus, the short-term announcement event-day returns
suggest that Schedule 13D filers indeed possess valuable private information during the
pre-announcement period.

                                       [Insert Figure 5 here]

    By studying the abnormal returns around the filing day we implicitly assume that
Schedule 13D filings become public when filed with the SEC. While the 3% two-day
jump in excess return observed at the filing date is consistent with this assumption, to
further validate it we checked a representative sample of events ‘by hand’ and found
that most of the Schedule 13D filings become public within one day after filing with the
SEC. There are, however, some exceptions in the early part of the sample when filings

   9
     The evidence is consistent with Brav et al. (2008) and Klein and Zur (2009), who report significant
positive stock reaction to announcement of hedge fund activism, where the announcement is triggered
by Schedule 13D filings. There are two main differences between our samples. First, we consider all
Schedule 13D filings while Brav et al. (2008) and Klein and Zur (2009) consider only filings by hedge
funds. Second, a Schedule 13D filing is required to have information on trades in order to be included in
our sample. That is, we restrict our sample to cases in which the Schedule 13D filer actively accumulate
shares and crosses the 5% threshold.

                                                   14
became public with a short delay. Such delays might explain the post-filing drift in
returns which is evident in Panel A of Figure 5. To further investigate this, we replicate
Panel A while restricting the sample period to 2003-2010. The results are reported in
Panel B of Figure 5. It shows that the post-filing drift in returns does not exist in the
later part of the sample. Specifically, there is no trend in the abnormal return after
the filing date. Therefore, the overall evidence suggests that market participants learn
almost immediately about Schedule 13D filings in recent years, and also incorporate the
resulting information about the stock price fairly efficiently into prices.

3.2. Profits

   We calculate three measures of profits. First, we calculate Schedule 13D filers’ profits
from purchasing shares at the pre-announcement prices:


                             T rading P rof it = q0 (ppost − p),                       (1)


where q is the vector of trades (purchases are positive and sales are negative) during the
sixty-day period, ppost is the post-announcement price, and p is the vector of transaction
prices. The post-announcement price is the average stock price during the week that
follows the Schedule 13D filing.
   If Schedule 13D filers indeed own valuable private information, they would be
expected to purchase shares at a discount relative to the post-announcement price. Of
course, by purchasing securities schedule 13D filers may also push up prices. Thus their
cumulative profits also depend on the price impact of their trades. If price impact is
large, then we expect realized profits of insiders to be lower than if price impact is low.
Thus the trading profits of Schedule 13D filers depend both on the value of their private
information and on the stock price liquidity.
   Second, we calculate the total profit realized by informed investors:


                   T otal P rof it = T rading P rof it + (ppost − p0 )w0 ,             (2)


                                             15
where p0 is the price of the first transaction and w0 is the initial ownership, which is
established before the sixty-day period. This measure assumes that a Schedule 13D filer
purchases the initial stake at the price of the first transaction. As our case study on
“Icahn vs. Cheasapeake” suggests, this assumption is most likely to cause a downward
bias in estimated total profits.
   Finally, we report the total value created for the shareholders of a company that
experience a Schedule 13D filing:


                         V alue Created = (ppost − p0 )SHOU T,                        (3)


where SHOU T is the number of shares outstanding.

                                    [Insert Table 2 here]

   Table 2 presents the distribution of trading profits. We split the sample into five
market cap quantiles and report mean and median profit measures for every quantile.
The evidence suggests that informed traders profit significantly from trading.        For
example, a Schedule 13D filer who acquires a $30 million stake in a $404 million market
cap company (i.e., 7.42% stake, which is an average stake in our sample) expects to
benefit $1.13 million. This can be further broken down into a $0.60 million profit on
trades during the sixty-day period and a $0.53 million profit on the initial ownership,
purchased prior to the sixty-day window.
   The evidence also suggests that the main beneficiaries are shareholders who own
shares on the announcement date. For example, shareholders of companies in the fifth
market cap quantile gain $46.2 million during an average event whereas the Schedule
13D filer gains $3.0 million. Therefore, while Schedule 13D filers benefit from uninformed
traders who sell their shares during the pre-announcement period, they create significant
value for all other shareholders by deciding to file Schedule 13D and to intervene in a
company’s governance.



                                             16
3.3. Trading Strategies

   Next we evaluate the performance of trading strategies that exploit the information
from Schedule 13D filings. Note that some of these strategies are not implementable
based only on public information and without the knowledge of the insider’s information
or trading. The results are nevertheless interesting to measure the quality of (and returns
to) private information. Table 3 reports estimates of one-, three-, and four-factor models,
where the left-hand-side variable is a daily return on the portfolio of Schedule 13D stocks.

                                   [Insert Table 3 here]

   Panel A reports the performance of an equal-weighted portfolio return, constructed
as follows. For every trading day, we calculate the equal-weighted average of returns
on stocks held by Schedule 13D filers. We report results for three investment horizons:
from 90 days before filing to 30 days after filing, from 60 days before filing to 30 days
after filing, and from 30 days before filing to 30 days after filing. The evidence in Panel
A suggests that all portfolios exhibit positive and significant daily alphas, varying from
0.13% to 0.21%.
   Panel B reports the performance of a value-weighted portfolio return, constructed
as follows. For every trading day, we calculate the dollar investment of Schedule 13D
filers in every stock. Then we calculate the average return on these stocks for every
trading date, where the weights are proportional to the dollar investment in each stock.
We assume that Schedule 13D filers do not change their position until 30 days after
the filing date. The evidence suggests that this portfolio exhibits economically and
statistically significant positive alpha. For example, the four-factor model daily alpha is
0.09% with 3.04 t-statistic.
   The evidence suggests that the informational advantage of Schedule 13D filers is
substantial, and that taken together a strategy that could replicate their investments
would be extraordinarily successful at generating ‘alpha,’ i.e., outperforming significantly
the benchmark return predicted by standard linear asset-pricing factor models.


                                            17
4. Liquidity Measures

       We use four measures of stock liquidity that rely on high-frequency data: the Kyle
lambda, the effective spread, the realized spread, and price impact. Kyle’s lambda is a
measure of price impact, which can be interpreted as the cost of demanding a certain
amount of liquidity over some given time period. In constructing this measure, we follow
Hasbrouck (2009) and Goyenko et al. (2009) and calculate the price impact as the slope
coefficient λit in the regression:


                                     retitn = δit + λit Sitn + εitn ,                            (4)


where for the nth five-minute period on date t and stock i, retitn is the stock return and
                                                             P                 p
Sitn is the sum of signed square-root dollar volume, that is, k sign(dvolitnk ) |dvolitnk |.
The trades are signed according to the Lee and Ready (1991) algorithm.
       The effective spread is the difference between the natural logarithm of the actual
transaction price and the natural logarithm of the midpoint prevailing at the time of
the trade:
                                espreaditk = 2|ln(Pitk ) − ln(Mitk )|,                           (5)

where Pitk is the price of the kth trade and Mitk is the midpoint of the consolidated BBO
prevailing at the time of the kth trade (Hasbrouck, 2010).10 Aggregating over day t, a
stock’s effective spread espreadit is the dollar-volume-weighted average of the effective
spread espreaditk computed over all trades on day t. The wider the effective spread, the
less liquid is the stock.
       The realized spread is the temporary component of the effective spread. It measures
the revenue to liquidity providers assuming that the liquidity provider is able to close
her position at the midpoint prevailing five minutes after the trade. For a given stock i

  10
       We exclude NBBO crossed and locked observations from the analysis (Holden and Jacobsen, 2011).




                                                   18
and day t, the realized spread on the kth trade is defined as:


                           rspreaditk = 2qitk (ln(Pitk ) − ln(Mitk+5 )),                         (6)


where Mitk+5 is the midpoint of the consolidated BBO prevailing five-minutes after the
kth trade and qitk is the buy–sell indicator (+1 for buys, –1 for sells). Aggregating over
day t, a stock’s realized spread rspreadit is the dollar-volume-weighted average of the
realized spread rspreaditk computed over all trades on day t.
       The five-minute price impact is the permanent component of the effective spread.
It measures gross losses to liquidity demanders due to adverse selection (Glosten and
Harris, 1988). For a given stock i and day t, the five-minute price impact of the kth
trade is defined as:


                           pimpactitk = 2qitk (ln(Mitk+5 ) − ln(Mitk )),                         (7)


Aggregating over day t, a stock’s price impact pimpactit is the dollar-volume-weighted
average of price impact pimpactitk computed over all trades on day t.
       In addition, we use seven low-frequency measures of stock liquidity: the Amihud
illiquidity, the Amivest liquidity, the daily bid-ask spread, an indicator of a day with
zero return (“zero”), an indicator of a positive-volume day with zero return (“zero2”),
the Pastor and Stambaugh (2003) reversal measure, and the probability of informed
trade (“pin”) introduced by Easley et al. (1996).11
       Amihud’s illiquidity measure illiquidityit is defined as:

                                                          |rit |
                                 illiquidityit = 1000            ,                               (8)
                                                        volumeit

  11
    The indicators are closely related to the proportion of days with zero-returns and the proportion
positive-volume days with zero returns defined in Lesmond et al. (1999). Averaging an indicator over
a period of time (e.g., month) will produce the corresponding proportion of days.




                                                 19
where rit is the stock i return on day t and volumeit is stock i dollar volume on day t.
A smaller value of illiquidity implies a lower price impact, and therefore a higher stock
liquidity.
       The Amivest liquidity measure liquidityit is defined as:

                                                               volumeit
                                       liquidityit = 0.001              .                              (9)
                                                                 |rit |

A larger value of liquidity implies a lower price impact.
       The bid-ask spread basperadit of stock i on day t is defined as:

                                                         askit − bidit
                                     baspreadit =                          ,                          (10)
                                                       0.5(askit + bidit )

where askit and bidit are daily closing ask and bid from CRSP. A smaller value of
baspread implies a higher stock liquidity.
       The Pastor and Stambaugh (2003) reversal measure for stock i in period t (e.g.,
month) is the ordinary least squares estimate of γi,t in the regression

                  e                                         e
                 ri,d+1,t = θi,t + φi,t ri,d,t + γi,t sign(ri,d,t )υi,d,t + i,d,t , d = 1, ..., D,   (11)


where quantities are defined as follows: ri,d,t is the return on stock i on day d in period
    e
t; ri,d,t = ri,d,t − rm,d,t , where rm,d,t is the return on the CRSP value-weighted market
return on day d in period t; υi,d,t is the dollar volume for stock i on day d in period t.12
A negative γ indicates the presence of reversal. A higher absolute value of γ implies
greater expected reversal and therefore lower stock liquidity.
       The Easley et al. (1996) pin measure is:

                                                          αµ
                                               pin =            ,                                     (12)
                                                        αµ + 2ε

  12
       We follow Pastor and Stambaugh (2003) in imposing restrictions on the estimation procedure.




                                                        20
where α is the probability of an information event, µ is the arrival rate of of traders who
know the new information if it exists, and ε is the arrival rate of uninformed traders.
Maximum likelihood estimators of these parameters are described in Easley et al. (1996),
pages 1412-1414. A higher value of pin implies a higher probability of informed trade.
   Table 4 provides summary descriptive statistics of the stock liquidity measures. Panel
A describes high-frequency stock liquidity measures and Panel B describes low-frequency
stock liquidity measures.

5. Results

   The evidence reported in Section 3 suggests that Schedule 13D filers indeed possess
valuable private information and benefit from trading with uniformed traders. Thus, we
can confidently argue that there is a substantial amount of asymmetric information
in Schedule 13D trades. Therefore, it is an ideal environment for testing whether
liquidity measures indicate the increase in the information asymmetry between market
participants. In this section we test whether liquidity measures, described in Section 4,
indicate the presence of informed trading.

5.1. Price Impact of Informed Trades

   We begin the analysis by showing that trades by Schedule 13D filers affect prices.
First, note from figure 5 that stock prices increase closer to the filing date. Moreover,
Figure 3 shows that Schedule 13D filers trade more aggressively closer to the filing date.
This suggests that trades by Schedule 13D filers affect prices and specifically, that when
Schedule 13D filers buy stocks, their prices appreciate and get closer to the post-filing
date level.
   Second, we compare the market-adjusted returns and the daily turnover during the
sixty-day disclosure period and the sixty-day period during previous year. Panel A in
Table 5 suggests that the market-adjusted returns and the daily turnover are higher

                                             21
during the sixty-day disclosure period. The changes are not only statistically but also
economically significant. For example, the market adjusted return increases from 0.02%
to 0.11%.

                                     [Insert Table 5 here]

   Third, Panel B in Table 5 suggests that market-adjusted returns and daily turnover
are higher on days when Schedule 13D filers trade. For example, the average market-
adjusted return is 0.62% on days when Schedule 13D filers trade and -0.04% on days
when Schedule 13-D filer do not trade. Thus, the adverse selection is worse on days
when Schedule 13D filers trade.
   Finally, we adopt the regression methodology and estimate the following regression:


                                  yit = α + γitradeit + it ,                      (13)


where yit is either market-adjusted return or daily turnover for company i on day t and
itradeit is an indicator that is +1 on a day with trades by Schedule 13D filers and zero
else. Table 6 reports the results.

                                     [Insert Table 6 here]

   Similarly to evidence in Table 5, Table 6 suggests that market-adjusted returns and
daily turnover are higher on days when Schedule 13D filers trade. The results are robust
to augmenting the regression with event fixed effects and restricting the sample to the
sixty-day disclosure period only.
   Overall, the evidence indicates that when Schedule 13D filers trade they move prices
up. In addition, days with trades by Schedule 13D filers are characterized by high daily
turnover. Next we study whether liquidity measures reveal the presence of informed
trading.




                                              22
5.2. Do Liquidity Measure Reveal the Presence of Informed Trading?

       We begin the analysis by plotting the two arguably most popular (il)liquidity
measures around the filing date: the Kyle (1985) lambda and the Amihud (2002)
illiquidity measure. Figure 6 shows that both lambda and the Amihud (2002) illiquidity
measure achieve local minima around the filing date. That is, it is exactly when the
informed traders are most active and affect prices, these measures indicate low adverse
selection.

                                       [Insert Figure 6 here]

       Next, we consider the sixty-day disclosure period and test whether liquidity measures
during this period differ from liquidity measures during the same calendar window in
the year prior to that when the Schedule 13D is filed. Table 7 presents the results. The
evidence suggests that none of the liquidity measures indicate the presence of informed
traders during the sixty-day disclosure period. Instead, three high-frequency measures
(λ, espread, and rspread) and five low-frequency measures (illiquidity, liquidity,
baspread, pin, and zero2) indicate higher stock liquidity. For example, pin is more than
10% lower during the sixty-day disclosure period.13 Pastor and Stambaugh (2003) return
reversal measure, psgamma, is the only measure that indicates lower stock liquidity (i.e.,
stronger return reversal), but the difference is not statistically significant.
       Importantly, while some liquidity measure are affected not only by adverse selection
(e.g., baspread may also be a function of inventory costs), λ and pin are usually
associated specifically with the adverse selection component. Therefore, the evidence
presented in Table 7 constitutes a major challenge to the argument that these liquidity
measures detect informed trades.

                                       [Insert Table 7 here]

  13
    Related to our results, evidence in Aktas et al. (2007) suggests that pin is lower before merger and
acquisition announcements.



                                                  23
       The evidence in Section 2 suggests that Schedule 13D filers trade on average only
on 15 days during the sixty-day disclosure period. Motivated by this evidence, we next
test how liquidity measures behave on days when Schedule 13D filers trade compared
to days where they do not trade, during the disclosure period. Table 8 presents the
results.14 The evidence suggests that all liquidity measures except zero (which is not
statistically significantly different on both types of days) indicate higher stock liquidity
on days with trades by Schedule 13D filers. For example, the average λ is 12.35 on days
with informed trades and 16.85 on days with no informed trades. That is, it is almost
30% lower on days with informed trades.15

                                         [Insert Table 8 here]

       Next, we adopt the regression methodology and estimate the following regression:


                                     liqit = α + γitradeit + it ,                                    (14)


where liqit is a measure of liquidity for company i on day t and itradeit is an indicator
that is +1 on a day with trades by Schedule 13D filers and zero else.16
       Panel A in Table 9 reports the results. First note the constant in this specification
has a simple interpretation: it measures the average level of a liquidity measure during
the sample period, which is (f day − 120, f day + 40) around the filing day. For example,
the average effective spread is 112 basis points. The coefficient of itrade indicates how

  14
      This approach does not allow us to study two liquidity measures that have played a significant role
in the literature: the Pastor and Stambaugh (2003) gamma and Easley et al. (1996) pin measure. This
is because the estimation of these two measures requires a time series of a certain length, and cannot
be performed on adjacent days. For example, it is typically suggested to estimate the pin measure over
at least a one month horizon.
   15
      Motivated by the more aggressive trading strategy of Schedule 13D filers in the post-event period, we
test how liquidity measures behave on post-event trading days when Schedule 13D filers trade compared
to days where they do not trade, during the disclosure period. Untabulated evidence is very similar to
evidence from Table 8, suggesting that all liquidity measures except zero and rspread (which are not
statistically significantly different on both types of days) indicate higher stock liquidity on days with
trades by Schedule 13D filers during the post-event period.
   16
      Hendershott et al. (2011) use similar specification to study the effect of algorithmic trading on
liquidity.

                                                    24
different a measure of liquidity is on days with trades by Schedule 13D filers. The
estimates suggest a higher stock liquidity on days with trades by Schedule 13D filers.
All results are highly economically and statistically significant. For example, the price
impact decreases by 12 basis points from 62 to 50 basis points, which is a 19% reduction.
None of the liquidity measures, including those that have often being used to proxy for
adverse selection, indicate the presence of informed trades.

                                           [Insert Table 9 here]

    Next we estimate an augmented version of equation (14), which accommodates event
fixed effects:
                                    liqit = α + γitradeit + ηi + it ,                                     (15)

where ηi are event fixed effects. Panel B reports the results. The evidence suggests that
even after including event fixed effects, the main conclusion does not change: liquidity
measures do no indicate the presence of informed trades. Instead, stocks appear more
liquid when schedule 13D filers trade. For example, the Amihud (2002) illiquidity
measure decreases by more than 25% (from 0.3389 to 0.2442). Since all cross-sectional
variation in liquidity measures is captured by the event fixed effects, we can conclude
that stocks appear more liquid when Schedule 13D filers trade.
    In a robustness check we restricted the sample to the (f day − 60, f day) period. The
idea of this exercise it to verify that results are not driven by changes in liquidity in the
post-filing period. The evidence in Panel C suggests that results are almost unaffected
by changing the sample period.17
    To summarize, the evidence constitutes a major challenge to the idea that empirical
measures of stock price liquidity, and, in particular, of adverse selection, reveal the

   17
      Untabulated robustness check suggests that the coefficient of itrade in equation (15) does not change
significantly when the ten-day period before the filing date is concerned. Specifically, we estimate the
following specification: liqit = α + γ1 itradeit ∗ tendayit + γ2 itradeit + γ3 tendayit + ηi + it , where tenday
indicates the ten-day period before the filing date. The evidence suggests that γ1 is insignificant for all
liquidity measures, except rspread. When rspread is concerned, γ1 is positive and significant at 10%
level while the sum of γ1 and γ2 is negative and statistically insignificant.

                                                       25
presence of informed trading. Instead, we find that measures of stock liquidity appear
better (i.e., measured adverse selection is smaller) when informed investors trade more
aggressively. Importantly, the results are similar when either high- or low-frequency
measures of stock liquidity are considered.


6. Aggregate Return and Liquidity

       To shed more light on the selection mechanism that drives the results, we study
the effect of exogenous variation in stock liquidity on trading strategies of Schedule
13D filers.18 Collin-Dufresne and Fos (2012) present at theoretical model where insiders
trade more aggressively when uninformed order-flow volatility is high. The authors find
that when uninformed order-flow volatility is allowed to vary stochastically over time in
Kyle’s model, then the sign of the correlation between measures of price impact, such
as Kyle’s lambda, and the amount of informed trading is undetermined. In fact, if noise
trader volatility is predictable, then the correlation can become negative, as trading
(i.e., slippage) costs to uninformed investors are lower in high abnormal volume states,
which is precisely when informed investors choose to trade more (and therefore more
private information is incorporated into prices). Consistently with this intuition, Figure
7 suggests that Schedule 13D filers trade more aggressively when uninformed trading
activity is high.19

                                        [Insert Figure 7 here]

       We next show how variation in market-wide conditions, such aggregate volume and
market return, affects the trading strategies of Schedule 13D filers. Specifically, we

  18
      Note that our regression regression results above say nothing about causality. It could be that
insiders select to trade when stocks happen to be more liquid. Or it could be that stocks appear more
liquid because insiders trade more and somehow affect stock liquidity. The latter is, in a way, the
argument put forth by Cornell and Sirri (1992) who argue that there are ‘falsely informed’ noise traders
who are attracted by informed trading and therefore offer better liquidity to the insiders (see page
1054). Below we offer some support that, if at all correct, this is not the whole story, since insiders do
seem to condition on market wide liquidity, which is unlikely to be caused by their own trading.
   19
      We separate to total trading volume for every trading day into two components: informed (initiated
by Schedule 13D filers) and uninformed (not initiated by Schedule 13D filers).

                                                   26
estimate the following regression:


                   itradeit = α + γ1 pdvolt + γ2 mktrft + γ3 liqit + it ,             (16)


where pdvol is the percentage deviation of CRSP volume from its previous year average
and mktrf is the value-weight market return in excess of the risk-free rate. The analysis
is based on daily observations from 60 days before the filing day to the filing day.
   Panel A in Table 10 reports the results. The evidence suggests that Schedule 13D
filers are more likely to trade when aggregate market activity is high (high CRSP
volume), when the market performs poorly (low market return), and when measured
liquidity is high. For robustness, we augment equation (16) with event fixed effects,
which control for any event-specific unobservables.        Panel B reports estimates and
suggests that the results are not driven by unobservable event-specific factors.

                                  [Insert Table 10 here]


7. Conclusion

   In this paper we exploit a hand-collected data set on stock transactions by Schedule
13D filers. We find substantial evidence that trades by Schedule 13D filers contain
valuable information: both announcement returns and profits realized by the filers are
substantial. Moveover, we show that when Schedule 13D filers trade, prices do move
up. We therefore feel warranted classifying pre-filing trades by Schedule 13D filers as
informed trades.
   The data set allows us to test whether stock price liquidity measures, proposed in the
literature, reveal the presence of informed traders. The evidence suggests that neither
high-frequency nor low-frequency measures of stock liquidity indicate the presence of
informed traders. Instead, stocks exhibit higher stock liquidity when informed market
participants trade, and even more so when they trade more aggressively. Importantly,
measures that have been used as direct proxies for adverse selection, suggest that the

                                             27
adverse selection is lower when informed trading takes place. The evidence is consistent
with informed traders being more aggressive in regimes with higher stock ‘liquidity.’
   The main implication of the paper is that we cannot use standard liquidity measures
as proxies for information asymmetry.     The main problem seems to be that these
measures are not robust to the informed trader’s ability to select when and how much
to trade. We show that along with liquidity measures, Schedule 13D filers use market
volume and market return to condition their timing and size of trades.

a Schedule filing. The event day is the day on which Schedule 13D filer’s ownership
crosses the 5% threshold. Within ten days after the event day the filer files with the
SEC and the filing day is determined. The filing includes information on trades during
the sixty-day period that precedes the filing day (“sixty-day disclosure period”).

solid line (right axis) plots the probability that a Schedule 13D filer trades at least one
share on a given day. For every distance to the filing day, t − τ , the probability that
a Schedule 13D filer trades at least one share is the number of filings with a non-zero
trade by the filer divided by the total number of Schedule 13D filings in the sample. We
define the distance to the filing day as the number of days between a trading day, τ , and
the filing day, t. The filing day corresponds to the day of filing with the SEC. The dark
bars (left axis) represent the percentage of outstanding shares traded by Schedule 13D
filers, from 60 days prior to the filing day. For every Schedule 13D filing and distance
to the filing day, t − τ , we calculate the percentage of outstanding shares traded by the
filer as the ratio between the number of shares traded by the filer and the number of
shares outstanding. If no trade is reported on a given day by the filer, the percentage
of outstanding shares traded by the filer is set to zero. Then, for every distance to the
filing day, t − τ , the percentage of outstanding shares traded by Schedule 13D filers is
the average of the percentage of outstanding shares traded among all filings. The dashed
line (right axis) plots the probability of trading with a Schedule 13D filer. For every
distance to the filing day, t − τ , the probability of trading with a Schedule 13D filer is
the average of the number of shares traded by the filer divided by security’s volume from
CRSP.

     threshold. Columns (3) and (6) report descriptive statistics from days with informed trades during the post-event day
     period (‘After’). ‘Informed trade’ is a trade executed by a Schedule 13D filer. Stock ownership on the filing date is the
     total beneficial ownership of the Schedule 13D filer on the filing date. Number of trading days is the number of days
     with informed trades during the corresponding period. % of trading days with informed trades is the ratio of days with
     informed trades to the number of trading days. Informed volume (per trading day) is the total number of shares traded
     by a Schedule 13D filer (per trading day) on days with informed trades. Dollar informed volume (per trading day) is the
     total dollar amount traded by a Schedule 13D filer (per trading day) on days with informed trades. Change in ownership
     (per trading day) is the increase in stock ownership (per trading day), as percentage of number of shares outstanding, on
     days with informed trades. Informed turnover is the percentage of daily turnover that corresponds to the trades executed
     by Schedule 13D filers.

Table 2: Profits from Informed Trades. This table presents summary statistics
of three measures of profits. Trading Profit is defined as q0 (ppost − p), where q is
the vector of trades (purchases are positive and sales are negative), ppost is the post-
announcement price, and p is the vector of transaction prices. The post-announcement
price is the average price during the week that follows the filing date. Total Profit is
defined as T rading P rof it + (ppost − p0 )w0 , where p0 is the price of the first transaction
disclosed in the Schedule 13D filing and w0 is the initial ownership, established prior to
the first transaction disclosed in the Schedule 13D filing. V alue Created is defined as
(ppost − p0 )SHOU T , where SHOU T is the number of shares outstanding. Market CAP
is market capitalization of the targeted company.

Table 3: Performance of Trading Strategies Based on Schedule 13D Filers’
Transactions. This table presents evidence on performance of portfolios that replicate
trades by Schedule 13D filers. Panel A reports performance of an equal-weighted
portfolio return, which is constructed as follows. For every trading day, we calculate
the equal-weighted average of returns on stocks held by Schedule 13D filers. We report
results for three investment horizons: from 90 days before filing to 30 days after filing,
from 60 days before filing to 30 days after filing, and from 30 days before filing to 30
days after filing. Panel B reports the performance of a portfolio-weighted return, which
is constructed as follows. For every trading day, we calculate the dollar investment of
Schedule 13D filers in the underlying security. Then we calculate the average return
on stocks held by Schedule 13D filers for every trading date, where the weights are
proportional to the dollar investment in each security. The trading strategy starts with
the first disclosed transaction. We assume that Schedule 13D filers do not change their
position during 30 days that follow the filing date. Table reports estimates of daily alpha
(α) and the corresponding t-statistics. Standard errors are clustered by calendar date.

     Table 4: Summary Statistics of Liquidity Measures. This table reports the summary statistics of liquidity measures
     on daily data. All liquidity measures are defined in Section 4. The sample covers (f day − 60 − year, f day − 1 − year)
     period, where f day is the Schedule 13D filing day. First, for every Schedule 13D filing we calculate the average level of
     a liquidity measure during the (f day − 60 − year, f day − 1 − year) period. Then, we calculate summary statistic of
     liquidity measure among all events. The data set combines TAQ, CRSP, and the hand-collected sample of Schedule 13D

Table 5: Market-Adjusted Returns and Daily Turnover. This table compares
market-adjusted returns and daily turnover during periods with trades by Schedule 13D
filers. The data set combines TAQ, CRSP, and the hand-collected sample of Schedule
13D filings (see Section 2). Market-adjusted return (eret) is the stock return in excess
of the CRSP value-weighted return. Daily turnover (to) is daily volume divided by
the number of shares outstanding. Panel A compares level of market-adjusted returns
and daily turnover during the sixty-day disclosure period, (f day − 60, f day − 1), and
the corresponding sixty-day period of the year before the Schedule 13D filing, (f day −
420, f day − 361). First, for every Schedule 13D filing we calculate the average level
of market-adjusted returns and daily turnover during the sixty-day disclosure period,
(f day − 60, f day − 1). Then, we calculate the average level of market-adjusted returns
and daily turnover among all events. Column (1) reports the average level of market-
adjusted returns and daily turnover during the sixty-day disclosure period among all
events. Similarly, Column (2) reports the average level of market-adjusted returns and
daily turnover during the corresponding sixty-day period of the year before the Schedule
13D filing, (f day−420, f day−361). Column (3) reports the differences between columns
(1) and (2). Column (4) reports the t-statistic of the difference. Panel B compares level
of market-adjusted returns and daily turnover during on days when Schedule 13D filers
trade and on days when Schedule 13D filers do not trade. The sample covers the sixty-day
disclosure period only. First, for every Schedule 13D filing we calculate the average level
of market-adjusted returns and daily turnover during the sixty-day disclosure period
on days with trades by the Schedule 13D filer. Column (1) reports the average level
of market-adjusted returns and daily turnover on days with trades by Schedule 13D
filers among all events. Column (2) reports the average level of market-adjusted returns
and daily turnover on days with no trades by Schedule 13D filers during the sixty-day
disclosure period. Column (3) reports the differences between columns (1) and (2).
Column (4) reports the t-statistic of the difference. Panel C .. *, **, and *** indicate
statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels.

Table 6: Market-Adjusted Returns and Daily Turnover – Continued. This table
compares market-adjusted returns and daily turnover during periods with trades by
Schedule 13D filers. The data set combines TAQ, CRSP, and the hand-collected sample
of Schedule 13D filings (see Section 2). Market-adjusted return (eret) is the stock return
in excess of the CRSP value-weighted return. Daily turnover (to) is daily volume divided
by the number of shares outstanding. We regress market-adjusted returns (columns
(1)-(3)) and daily turnover (columns (4)-(6)) on indicator of informed trading, using the
following specification: yit = α+γitradeit +it , where yit is either market-adjusted return
or daily turnover for company i on day t, and itrade indicates days on which Schedule
13D filers trade. Columns (1) and (4) reports results based on daily observations from
120 days before the filing day to 40 days after the filing day, where the filing day is the day
on which the Schedule 13D filing is submitted to the SEC. Columns (2) and (5) report
estimates of a specification augmented by event fixed effects: yit = α+γitradeit +ηi +it ,
where ηi are event fixed effects. Columns (3) and (6) report results with events fixed
effects based of daily observations from 60 days before the filing day to the filing day.
In each column, we report estimated coefficients and their t-statistics, calculated using
heteroscedasticity robust standard errors. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance
at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels.

Table 7: Liquidity Measures during the Sixty-Day Disclosure Period. This
table reports the summary statistics of liquidity measures during the sixty-day disclosure
period and the corresponding sixty-day period during the year before the Schedule 13D
filing. The data set combines TAQ, CRSP, and the hand-collected sample of Schedule
13D filings (see Section 2). All liquidity measures are defined in Section 4 and are 99.9%
winsorized. Market-adjusted return (eret) is the stock return in excess of the CRSP
value-weighted return. Daily turnover (to) is daily volume divided by the number of
shares outstanding. For every Schedule 13D filing we calculate the average level of a
liquidity measure during the sixty-day disclosure period, (f day − 60, f day − 1). Column
(1) reports the average level of liquidity measures during the sixty-day disclosure period
among all events. Similarly, Column (2) reports the average level of liquidity measures
during the corresponding sixty-day period of the year before the Schedule 13D filing,
(f day − 420, f day − 361). Column (3) reports the differences between columns (1) and

Table 8: Liquidity Measures on Days when Schedule 13D Filers Trade. This
table reports the summary statistics of liquidity measures on days when Schedule 13D
filers trade. The sample covers the sixty-day disclosure period only. The data set
combines TAQ, CRSP, and the hand-collected sample of Schedule 13D filings (see Section
2). All liquidity measures are defined in Section 4 and are 99.9% winsorized. Market-
adjusted return (eret) is the stock return in excess of the CRSP value-weighted return.
Daily turnover (to) is daily volume divided by the number of shares outstanding. For
every Schedule 13D filing we calculate the average level of a liquidity measure during the
sixty-day disclosure period on days with trades by the Schedule 13D filer. Column (1)
reports the average level of liquidity measures on days with trades by Schedule 13D filers
among all events. Similarly, Column (2) reports the average level of liquidity measures
on days with no trades by Schedule 13D filers during the sixty-day disclosure period.
Column (3) reports the differences between columns (1) and (2). Column (4) reports the
t-statistic of the difference. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%,
5%, and 1% levels.

     Table 9: Informed Trading and Liquidity Measures. This table shows the impact of informed trading on liquidity
     measures. In Panel A we regress each of liquidity measures described in Section 4 on indicator of informed trading,
     using the following specification: liqit = α + γitradeit + it , where liqit is a measure of liquidity for company i on day
     t, and itrade indicates days on which Schedule 13D filers trade. The analysis is based on daily observations from 120
     days before the filing day to 40 days after the filing day, where the filing day is the day on which the Schedule 13D
     filing is submitted to the SEC. In Panel B we estimate the specification from Panel A, while adding event fixed effects:
     liqit = α + γitradeit + ηi + it , where ηi are event fixed effects. In Panel C we estimate the specification from Panel B,
     while restricting the sample to daily observations from 60 days before the filing day to the filing day. In each column,
     we report estimated coefficients and their t-statistics, calculated using heteroscedasticity robust standard errors. *, **,
     and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels.
