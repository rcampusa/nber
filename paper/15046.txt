                                              ABSTRACT

This study examines the relationship between child weight and fast food and fruit and vegetable prices
and the availability of fast food restaurants, full-service restaurants, supermarkets, grocery stores and
convenience stores. We estimate cross-sectional and individual-level fixed effects (FE) models to
account for unobserved individual-level heterogeneity. Data are drawn from the Child Development
Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics combined with external food price and outlet
density data at the zip code level. FE results show that higher fruit and vegetable prices are statistically
significantly related to a higher body mass index (BMI) percentile ranking among children with greater
effects among low-income children: fruit and vegetable price elasticity for BMI is estimated to be
0.25 for the full sample and 0.60 among low-income children. Fast food prices are statistically significantly
related to child weight only in cross-sectional models among low-income children with a price elasticity
of -0.77. Increased supermarket availability and fewer available convenience stores are related with
lower weight outcomes among low-income children. These results provide evidence on the potential
effectiveness of using fiscal pricing interventions such as taxes and subsidies and other interventions
to improve supermarket access as policy instruments to address childhood obesity.

1. Introduction
       The prevalence of obesity among children (age- and gender-specific body mass index

(BMI) ≥ 95th percentile) has increased three-fold over the past few decades and has reached

12.4%, 17.0% and 17.6% among children aged 2-5, 6-11, and 12-19 years, respectively, in 2003-

2006 (Ogden et al. 2008). Obese children are at increased risk of poorer health (Hannon et al.

2005; Freedman et al. 1999) and obesity itself is shown to track from childhood to adulthood

(Whitaker et al. 1997; Freedman et al. 2005). Over the past few years, public health officials and

state legislatures have increasingly introduced a number of bills and enacted laws with the aim of

reducing childhood obesity (Cawley and Liu 2008). Much of this legislation has been in the area

of improving school nutrition standards and increasing physical education requirements. There

are also significant public health concerns related to obesity about the extent of unhealthful food

advertising directed at children (Institute of Medicine 2006). Whereas currently there exists

some limited government sponsored health diet and physical activity health promotion

advertising on television (Emery et al 2007), governments have not yet taken formal steps to

limit industry food advertising; although self-regulation has emerged among a consortium of

companies who have pledged to limit or improve the nutritional standard of food advertising

directed at children (Powell et al. 2007d).

       In addition to these policy areas, given the success in other public health areas such as

tobacco, there has been much discussion on the potential of implementing fiscal pricing policies

(such as soda and “fat” taxes or subsidies to fruits and vegetables) to address the problem of

obesity (Jacobson and Brownell 2000; Marshall 2000; Leicester and Windmeijer 2004; Caraher

and Cowburn 2005; Kim and Kawachi 2006; Powell and Chaloupka 2009). The idea here is to

change the relative costs of consuming of unhealthy energy dense food versus more healthy less

dense foods with the aim of shifting consumption patterns to achieve a healthier weight outcome.



                                                                                                   3
Indeed, the price of a calorie has been shown to be substantially cheaper when obtained from

energy dense versus more healthful less dense foods (Drewnowski and Specter 2004;

Drewnowski and Darmon 2005). It is argued on the basis of both theory and empirical evidence

that technological change has contributed to the U.S. obesity epidemic by altering incentives

such that the relative price of consuming a calorie has fallen over time while production

efficiency has raised the cost of physical activity and work has become more sedentary

(Lakdawalla and Philipson 2002; Philipson and Posner 2003; Cutler, Glaeser and Shapiro 2003;

and Lakdawalla, Philipson and Bhattacharya 2005). Recent evidence suggests that rising obesity

is primarily the result of over-consumption of calories associated both with technological

innovations as well as changes in socio-demographic factors (Bleich et al. 2008).

       A growing body of research has sought to provide evidence on the extent to which

economic factors such as food prices and food-related outlet availability are related to weight

outcomes. Among adults, cross-sectional analyses have found higher fast-food prices and food at

home prices (Chou, Grossman and Saffer 2004) and higher prices of sugar (Miljkovic and

Nganje 2008) to be statistically significantly associated with lower weight outcomes; although

another study did not find evidence of a statistically significant association between fast food

prices and weight for adults and found higher fruit and vegetable prices to be positively

associated with adult BMI (Beydoun, Powell and Wang 2008). A number of recent studies have

examined economic factors and children’s and adolescents’ weight. Higher fast food prices have

been statistically significantly associated with lower BMI and obesity among adolescents using

cross-sectional data (Chou, Rashad, Grossman 2005, 2008; Monheit, Vistness, and Rogowski

2007; Powell et al. 2007a; Auld and Powell 2009) and weakly statistically significantly related to

lower adolescent BMI based on longitudinal random effects models (Powell and Bao 2009). Fast




                                                                                                   4
food prices, however, have not been found to be statistically significantly related to weight

outcomes among younger children (Sturm and Datar 2005, 2008; Powell and Bao 2009). On the

other hand, these same studies on children (Sturm and Datar 2005, 2008; Powell and Bao 2009)

which have used longitudinal data, have found higher fruit and vegetable prices to be statistically

significantly related to higher weight outcomes among children. Further, a recent study also

found adolescents’ weight to be sensitive to the price of fruits and vegetables (Auld and Powell

2009). The magnitude of the price effects where significant have generally been quite small,

although a number of studies have found larger effects for low-SES children (Sturm and Datar

2005; Powell and Bao 2009) and for children and adolescents at risk of overweight (Sturm and

Datar 2005; Auld and Powell 2009). Thus, the existing literature does provide some evidence

that fiscal food pricing interventions may improve weight outcomes among children and

adolescents.

               The relationship between fast food or full-service restaurant availability and child

or adolescent weight outcomes has not been found to be statistically significant (Chou, Rashad,

Grossman 2005, 2008; Sturm and Datar 2005; Monheit, Vistness, and Rogowski 2007; Powell et

al. 2007a; Auld and Powell 2009; Powell and Bao 2009). In addition, the existing evidence on

the effects of supermarket availability is mixed; whereas Sturm and Datar (2005) did not find a

statistically significant relationship between supermarket availability and child weight, a recent

study by Powell and Bao (2009) found that increased supermarket availability was statistically

significantly negatively associated with child BMI when availability was assessed on a per land

area basis rather than on a per capita basis. Among older children, Powell et al. (2007b) and Auld

and Powell (2009) found that greater per capita local area supermarket availability was

statistically significantly associated with lower adolescent BMI.




                                                                                                     5
       The purpose of this study is to provide empirical evidence on the extent to which we can

expect fiscal policy interventions in the area of food pricing or other interventions that reduce the

relative cost of obtaining healthy foods by, for example, increasing access to outlets such as

supermarkets, to improve weight outcomes among US children. Previous studies that have

examined children using longitudinal data have controlled for individual-level random effects.

This study builds on the previous literature by using fixed effects panel data methods to account

for individual-level unobserved heterogeneity. We draw on longitudinal data from the Child

Development Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (CDS-PSID) combined at the

zip code level with food price data from the American Chamber of Commerce Researchers

Association (ACCRA) and food-related outlet density data obtained from Dun & Bradstreet

(D&B). We examine the relationship between child weight and the real price of energy-dense

foods such as fast foods, the real price of healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables, fast food

and full-service restaurant availability, and access to food store outlets such as supermarkets,

grocery stores and convenience stores. We estimate both cross-sectional and individual-level

fixed effects models to account for individual-level unobserved heterogeneity. We also examine

whether the relationships between child weight and food prices and food-related outlet

availability differ by households’ socioeconomic status (SES) by examining differences in

estimates by houshold income.

2. Data

Individual-level data

          The CDS-PSID data were collected by the University of Michigan's Institute for Social

Research (ISR) as a supplement to focus on children of the PSID sample, which is a nationally

representative longitudinal sample of adults and their families collected since 1968. The PSID




                                                                                                     6
provides rich information, especially on various income measures for individuals and families in

which they reside. This study draws on the two waves of the CDS, CDS-I collected in 1997 and

CDS-II collected in 2002/2003. The 1997 CDS gathered data on children aged 0-12 of PSID

parents, providing information on 3,563 children from 2,394 participating families. The 2003

CDS contains follow-up data on 2,908 of the children sampled in the previous wave, now aged

6-19 years old, from 2,017 families. The main interviews were conducted with each child’s

primary caregiver. Information on parents' income, education, and work-related variables was

drawn from the 1997 and 2003 PSID waves and linked to the CDS data by household identifiers.

       Our outcome measure for child weight is based on the gender-age-specific BMI

percentile ranking. BMI is calculated as (weight(lb)/height(in)2) * 703. The child's weight was

measured by the interviewers in both CDS data waves, while the child's height was reported by

the child's primary care giver in the first data wave and measured in an in-person assessment

interview in the second data wave. We used the Centers for Disease Control’s SAS program

based on gender-age specific growth charts to obtain the age-gender specific BMI percentile

rankings (Kuczmarski, Kuczmarski, and Najjar 2001). Table 1 shows that, on average, children

were in the 61st percentile of the BMI distribution. Children’s weight increased over the sample

period moving them, on average, from the 58th percentile in 1997 to the 63rd percentile of the

BMI distribution in 2003 (not shown in tables). Children with a BMI greater than the 85th

percentile are defined to be at risk of overweight and those with a BMI greater than the 95th

percentile are overweight (or, more commonly, referred to as obese).

         A rich set of individual- and household-level demographic variables are used as

controls in the empirical models. The descriptive statistics of these variables are reported in

Table 1 and they include: gender, race/ethnicity (white, African American, Hispanic, other race),




                                                                                                   7
whether the child was breastfed as a baby, child's birthweight (in pounds), child's age, marital

status of the family head (married, never married, divorced/ separated/ widowed), mother's

education (less than high school, completed high school, some college, college graduate or more,

missing), mother's work status (not working, working part-time, working full-time, missing),

family income (indicators for income quintiles) and year of the interview wave (1997, 2003). We

also control for the degree of urbanization of the children’s zip code of residence based on data

from the Census 2000 that measure population size within a zip code inside urbanized areas,

outside urbanized areas (referred to as suburban areas), and in rural areas. We calculate the

percentages of a zip code’s population by degree of urbanization and then define a zip code’s

level of urbanization by the category making up the largest percentage of its population. For

instance, if in a zip code, the largest percentage of its population lives in urbanized areas, we

define the zip code to be urban. Dichotomous indictors based on the Census 2000 are thus

created for residences in urban, suburban or rural areas, which are then merged with the CDS-

PSID by the zip code level geocode identifier. We also draw on Census 2000 data to include a

continuous measure of zip code-level median household income which is also merged to the

CDS-PSID by the zip code level geocode identifier.

       We limit the sample to children who are at least two years of age in the CDS-I in 1997

and at most 18 years of age in CDS-II in 2003. In addition, girls who reported to be pregnant at

the time of the interviews are excluded from the estimation sample. The final estimation sample

based on non-missing data includes a balanced sample of 3,258 observations on 1,629 children.

Food Price Measures

       The ACCRA price data contain quarterly information on prices across more than 300 US

cities. The price data are matched to the CDS-PSID sample based on the closest city match




                                                                                                    8
available in the ACCRA using the zip code-level geocode indicator. The closest city match is

determined by the shortest straight line distance between the centroid point of the child’s zip

code and the centroid point of the ACCRA price city. We created a match quality variable based

on this distance in miles which we control for in all regression analyses. Based on the items

available in the ACCRA data we create two food-related price indices: a fruit and vegetable price

index and a fast food price index. All prices are deflated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)

Consumer Price Index (CPI) (1982-1984=100).

       The fruit and vegetable price index is based on the prices available for the following food

items: bananas, lettuce, potatoes, canned sweet peas, canned tomatoes, canned peaches, and

frozen corn. ACCRA reports weights for each item based on expenditure shares derived from the

BLS Consumer Expenditure Survey. These weights are used to compute a weighted fruit and

vegetable price index based on the per product prices of the seven food items noted above. The

fast food price is based on the following three items included in the ACCRA data: a McDonald’s

Quarter-Pounder with cheese, a thin crust regular cheese pizza at Pizza Hut and/or Pizza Inn, and

fried chicken (thigh and drumstick) at Kentucky Fried Chicken and/or Church’s Fried Chicken.

The fast food index is computed as an average of these three product prices given that they have

equal weights. As shown in Table 1, the average real ($1982-84) price of the fruit and vegetable

index is 73 cents and the average real price of a fast food meal is $2.73.

       The ACCRA price data are not without their limitations: the data are collected only in a

limited number of cities and metropolitan statistical areas and they do not provide price data at

lower geographic units; the data are based on establishment samples that reflect a mid-

management (a higher) standard of living; ACCRA does not always continuously sample the

same cities and hence the data are not fully comparable over time; and, a small number of food




                                                                                                    9
items are surveyed and hence the data are limited in their representativeness across food groups.

Despite these limitations which have been acknowledged elsewhere (Sturm and Datar 2005;

Powell and Bao 2009), given the national coverage of these price data they have been similarly

used in a number of previous studies (Chou et al. 2004; Chou, Rashad and Grossman 2005, 2008;

Lakdawalla, Philipson and Bhattacharya 2005; Sturm and Datar 2005, 2008; Powell et al., 2007a,

2007b; Auld and Powell 2009; Powell and Bao 2009).

Outlet Density Measures

       Data on food store and restaurant outlets were obtained from a business list developed by

Dun and Bradstreet (D&B) available through its MarketPlace software (Dun and Bradstreet

2005). MarketPlace contains information on more than 14 million businesses in the U.S and is

compiled and updated quarterly through directories, government registries, websites, and

interviews; nonetheless these commercial data have limitations as they are subject to count and

or classification error. MarketPlace allows sorting by multiple criteria such as location and

Standard Industry Classification (SIC) codes of business types. Facilities may be listed by both

"primary" and "secondary" SIC codes. We draw on the primary SIC code listing only in creating

the list of outlets used for this analysis. Outlet density data are matched by year at the zip code

level to the CDS-PSID and are computed as the number of available outlets per 10,000 capita per

10 square miles using Census 2000 zip code level population and land area estimates. That is, the

availability of food outlets is defined to take into consideration accessibility both in terms of

congestion (per capita) and distance (per land area).

       Data on restaurant outlets are available from D&B under the 4-digit SIC code of “Eating

Places”. Fast food restaurants were defined by the full set of 8-digit SIC codes (excluding coffee

shops) that fell under the 6-digit SIC code of “Fast food restaurants and stands” plus the two 8-




                                                                                                      10
digit SIC codes for chain and independent pizzerias. Non-fast food restaurants, referred to as

full-service restaurants, were defined as the total number of “Eating Places” minus fast food

restaurants and excluding coffee shops, ice cream, soft drink and soda fountain stands, caterers,

and contract food services.

          Information on the number of food store outlets by type were extracted at the 6-digit SIC

code level to allow us to examine the availability of three types food store outlets: 1)

supermarkets, 2) grocery stores, and 3) convenience stores. Supermarkets are substantially larger

food stores compared to grocery stores and are more likely to have on-site food preparation such

as a butcher, baker, and deli. For example, in the D&B sample of food stores in the year 2000,

supermarkets averaged seven times the number of employees as grocery stores and forty six

times the sales volume of grocery stores. Grocery stores in the D&B sample averaged two times

the number of employees as convenience stores. Table 1 shows that the average number of food-

related outlets per 10,000 capita per 10 squares miles per zip code was 2.09 fast food restaurants,

10.40 full-service restaurants, 0.52 supermarkets, 1.19 convenience stores and 4.53 grocery

stores.

3. Empirical Model

          We empirically examine the importance of economic contextual and individual- and

household-level factors on child weight following an economic framework where weight

outcomes depend on marginal costs and benefits related to behaviors such as food consumption

(Cutler, Glaeser and Shapiro 2003; Chou, Grossman and Safer 2004; Auld and Powell 2009).

Higher costs of healthful foods through direct monetary prices (i.e., fruit and vegetables prices)

and limited access (i.e., lower supermarket availability) are expected to decrease healthful food

consumption and increase weight outcomes. Lower costs of unhealthy energy dense food (i.e.,




                                                                                                 11
fast food prices) and increased access (i.e., greater availability of fast food restaurant or

convenience stores) are expected to increase the consumption of energy dense foods and raise

energy intake and related weight. Thus, our empirical model examines the importance of the

direct monetary prices of foods such as fruits and vegetables and fast food. In addition, we proxy

the opportunity cost of the time spent acquiring the food and the preparation and clean up time

by examining measures of restaurant (including full-service and fast food restaurant) and food

store (including supermarket, grocery stores and convenience stores) availability. We also

control for zip code level neighborhood median household income. Controlling for neighborhood

contextual variables helps to remove zip code level heterogeneity that may be correlated with

general neighborhood socioeconomic patterns and to control for potential unobserved zip code

level time-varying heterogeneity.

       We estimate a reduced form empirical model of children’s BMI percentile of the

following form:


              BMIist = β 0 + β 1PRICEst + β 2OCst + β 3 Xit + β 4 Dt + εist            (1)



where PRICEst is a vector that measures fruit and vegetable and fast food prices faced by

individuals in geographic area s at time t. This vector also includes our price match quality

measure of the distance in miles between the centroid of the zip code and the closest ACCRA city

match. OCst is a vector of other contextual factors including measures of the availability (per

10,000 capita per 10 square miles) of full-service and fast food restaurants and supermarkets,

grocery stores, and convenience stores and neighborhood median income in geographic area s at

time t. Xit is a vector of individual and household characteristics as described earlier and Dit is a

year dummy variable. β are conformable vectors of parameters to be estimated and εist is a



                                                                                                   12
standard residual term. We begin by estimating cross-sectional ordinary least squares (OLS) BMI

percentile models.

       However, cross-sectional estimates based on equation (1) may be biased and standard

errors may be underestimated if there exist unobserved individual-level effects. εist = vi + wist is

rewritten and Equation 1 then can be rewritten as:


        BMIist = δ 0 + δ 1PRICEst + δ 2OCst + δ 3 Xit + δ 4 Dt + vi + wist          (2)

where vi is the constant individual-specific residual and wist is a standard residual. Hence, to

account for unobserved individual-level heterogeneity, an individual-level fixed effects (FE)

model is estimated. The FE panel estimation allows vi to be arbitrarily correlated with the

independent variables and the time-invariant covariates in the vector Xi and the constant

individual-specific residual vi are differenced out and within person equation estimates are

provided (Wooldridge 2002).

       We assess the robustness of the price effects by estimating alternative model

specifications that exclude restaurant outlets, food store outlets, and neighborhood median

household income. We also provide separate estimates for our price and food-related outlet

density contextual factors by SES on the basis of family income.

4. Results

       In Table 2, we present the results from the cross-sectional OLS models (as described in

Equation 1) and the longitudinal individual-level FE model (as described in Equation 2) on the

relationship between children’s BMI percentile ranking and economic contextual factors

controlling for individual- and household-level covariates. Controlling for all other covariates,

the cross-sectional results show that higher prices of fruits and vegetables have a statistically

significant positive effect on children’s BMI percentile: a one-dollar increase in the price of fruit


                                                                                                    13
and vegetables is associated with a 20.28 percentage point increase in the child’s BMI percentile

ranking. In elasticity terms, a 10% increase in the price of fruit and vegetables increases BMI

percentile by 2.4% (see Table 5). The fruit and vegetable price estimate from the FE model is

similar to the OLS estimates but loses some statistical power (p-value=0.052 in the FE model

compared to p-value= 0.012 in the OLS model). The corresponding price elasticity from the FE

model is 0.25. The price of fast food is negatively associated with children’s BMI percentile in

the cross-sectional model but the point estimate does not achieve statistical significance. The fast

food price estimate is positive and insignificant in the FE model. These price results are

consistent with study findings by Sturm and Datar (2005, 2008) and Powell and Bao (2009) who

found statistically significant but inelastic fruit and vegetable price effects on children’s weight

and statistically insignificant fast food price effects.

        The results presented in Table 3 suggest that the price estimates found in both the cross-

sectional OLS and longitudinal FE models are robust to the exclusion of the restaurant outlets,

the food store outlets and neighborhood median household income.

        With regard to our measures of food-related outlet availability, as shown in Table 2, the

results from the OLS model do not reveal any statistically significant associations between these

variables and children’s weight status. Similarly, food-related outlet availability generally is not

found to be related to children’s weight in the FE model with the exception of a statistically

significant negative relationship between full-service restaurant availability and BMI percentile.

        Turning to the results for the individual- and household-level covariates shown in Table

2, the OLS results show that after controlling for the contextual economic factors, African

American children are no longer statistically significantly heavier than their white counterparts

and the magnitude of the difference in the BMI percentile gap falls by 30% (from 4.43 to 3.11).




                                                                                                    14
These results suggest that local area economic contextual factors explain part of the BMI gap

between African American and white children. However, the economic contextual factors do not

appear to explain any of the differences in weight between Hispanic and white children with

Hispanic children being, on average, 7.77 percentiles higher in the BMI distribution even after

controlling for the economic contextual factors and all other individual-level and household level

characteristics. In terms of other time-constant individual-level covariates, higher birth weight is

associated with a significantly higher BMI ranking.

       With regard to parents’ SES and work status, having a mother who has completed college

or more is weakly statistically significantly associated with being approximately 5 percentiles

lower in the BMI distribution compared to children whose mothers do not have a high-school

education. Children living in households with higher levels of income also are found to have a

weakly statistically significantly lower BMI percentile ranking compared to those children living

in lower income households. A number of previous studies have found a significant association

between higher maternal education and a lower prevalence of child obesity but a statistically

insignificant relationship between household income and child obesity (Anderson, Butcher and

Levine 2003; Classen and Hokayem 2005; Liu, Hsiao and Chou 2005; Powell and Bao 2009).

With respect to mothers’ work status, consistent with the previous literature (Anderson, Butcher

and Levine 2003; Classen and Hokayem 2005; Liu, Hsiao and Chou 2005), having a mother who

works full-time is associated with a higher weight outcome. However, none of these parental

characteristics are found to be statistically significantly associated with child weight outcomes in

the FE model.

       Table 4 presents cross-sectional and longitudinal estimates to examine potential

differences in the relationship between the economic contextual factors and children’s BMI




                                                                                                  15
percentile ranking across populations of different SES measured by household income. Table 5

presents the price elasticities for the low-income populations (we do not report price elasticities

for the high-income populations since none of those estimates are statistically significant). The

results reveal that low-income children’s BMI percentile ranking is more sensitive to the price of

fruits and vegetables than their high income counterparts, particularly in the FE model. For low-

income children, the BMI percentile fruit and vegetable price elasticity based on the FE models

is 0.60, more than twice that of the sample as a whole (full sample elasticity of 0.25). Whereas,

the price of fast food is not found to be statistically significantly associated with children’s

weight in the full sample in either the OLS or FE model, fast food prices are found to be

statistically significantly negatively associated with low-income children’s weight in the OLS

model, with a BMI percentile fast food price elasticity of -0.77. However, the negative effect in

the FE model is not statistically significant.

       There also exist some interesting differences in results with respect to availability of food

stores among the low- and high-SES populations. In particular, greater availability of

supermarkets is related to a statistically significant but small reduction in BMI percentile ranking

among low-income children: one additional supermarket (per 10,000 capita per 10 squares miles)

in the zip code is related to roughly a one half percentage point reduction in children’s BMI

percentile ranking. This result is found for both the cross-sectional OLS model and the

longitudinal FE model. Also in the FE model, greater convenience store availability increases

low-income children’s BMI percentile ranking. In the cross-sectional model among high-income

children, greater availability of full-service restaurants and convenience stores is weakly

statistically significantly associated with lower BMI percentile but the effect is not statistically

significant once we control individual-level heterogeneity in the FE model.




                                                                                                       16
5. Discussion and Conclusions

       As policymakers consider the adoption of fiscal pricing interventions such as food taxes

on less healthy foods and subsidies for relatively healthy foods it is important for them to be able

to draw on evidence based on longitudinal models of the relationship between food prices and

weight outcomes. This study builds on the previous literature in this area by providing new

evidence on the relationships between economic contextual factors such as food prices and outlet

availability and child weight using longitudinal fixed effects methods to control for individual-

level heterogeneity. The results from the FE models showed that higher fruit and vegetable

prices were statistically significantly related to a higher BMI percentile ranking among children,

with larger effects for children in low-SES families. The fruit and vegetable price elasticity for

BMI percentile ranking was estimated to be 0.25 for the full sample and 0.60 among low-income

children. These results are consistent with previous study findings based on individual-level

random effects models that found children’s BMI to be sensitive to the price of fruits and

vegetables with greater effects for low-SES children (Sturm and Datar 2005, 2008; Powell and

Bao 2009). This growing body of evidence suggests that subsidies to healthful foods such as

fruits and vegetables, in particular subsidies targeted to low-income families, may help to reduce

children’s weight and reduce the likelihood that they fall into the at risk for overweight or

overweight categories of the BMI distribution.

       Fast food prices were not found to be statistically significantly related to children’s

weight outcomes in either the cross-sectional OLS or longitudinal FE models for the full-sample.

The cross-sectional results suggested that higher fast food prices were associated with lower

BMI among low-income children, but estimates from comparable FE models were not

statistically significant. Powell and Bao (2009) found that fast food prices were statistically




                                                                                                     17
signifincantly associated with lower BMI among low-income children aged 6-17, but not for the

full sample. In addition, a number of cross-sectional studies have found significant relationships

between fast food prices and adolescents’ BMI and overweight prevalence (Chou, Rashad,

Grossman 2005, 2008; Monheit, Vistness, and Rogowski 2007; Powell et al. 2007a; Auld and

Powell 2009) suggesting that fast food taxes may be an effective tool for curbing overweight

among this population. Unfortunately, repeated observations during adolescence are not

available in the CDS-PSID and hence we cannot provide FE estimates separately for teenagers.

       Our study results also suggest that in addition to the potential for effective fiscal pricing

interventions, it is also important, particularly among low-income populations, to help ensure

adequate access to food stores such as supermarkets which are more likely to provide a greater

selection of and lower prices for a range of healthier food options. Greater availability of

supermarkets was shown to have small but statistically significant negative effects on low-SES

children’s weight. A limited number of recent studies similarly have found statistically

significant associations between supermarket availability and BMI among adolescents (Powell et

al. 2007b; Auld and Powell 2009) and children (Powell and Bao 2009). Given that a number of

studies in the public health literature have documented the limited availability of supermarkets in

low-income and minority neighborhoods (Morland et al. 2002; Shaffer 2002; Moore and Diez-

Roux 2006; Powell et al. 2007c), the results in this study suggest that in addition to fiscal food

pricing policies, interventions aimed at improving access through zoning or other incentives such

as tax breaks to encourage the location of supermarkets in areas that are underserved can

contribute to reducing childhood obesity. Also, the study results suggest that policy instruments

that reduce the relative costs of healthy versus unhealthy foods both in terms of monetary costs




                                                                                                     18
and access will help to reduce the BMI-gap between African American and white children and,

in turn, reduce health disparities in the U.S.

       Although food in the U.S. is subsidized for low-income individuals and families through

a number of programs such as Food Stamps, the Women, Infant and Children Nutrition Program,

the Child and Adult Care Food Program, and the National School Lunch and Breakfast

Programs, food subsidies directed at the consumer do not generally exist for specific food items.

However, California has recently passed legislation to conduct a “Healthy Purchase” pilot

program where for each dollar of food stamps spent on fresh produce, participants will be

subsidized a portion of the cost (Guthrie et al. 2007). Similarly, food taxes have not generally

been introduced or increased with the aim of modifying consumption behavior as they have been

used in other public health areas such as tobacco. Food taxes are currently imposed on selected

categories of food such as soft drinks, candy and snacks in grocery stores and vending machines

but at quite low tax rates (Chriqui et al. 2008). Evaluations of pilot projects that subsidize

healthful foods and studies that examine the relationship between food taxes and energy intake

and weight outcomes, in particular using longitudinal data, will further contribute to the evidence

required by policymakers to assess the potential effectiveness using pricing policies to curb the

obesity crisis among children and adolescents in the US.

        Estimates of price elasticities among children and youth are particularly important – if

such elasticities are higher than among the general population then we can expect to see more

beneficial changes in behavior and related weight outcomes among these younger groups. This

evidence is critical given the development of obesity-related health risks among children, the fact

that food consumption patterns become more permanent as we age, and that childhood obesity

has been shown to track into adulthood.
