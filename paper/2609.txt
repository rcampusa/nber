                        METEOR SHOWERS OR HEAT WAVES?
    HETEROSKEDASTIC INTRA-DAILY VOLATILITY IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET

                                         ABSTRACT


     This paper defines and tests        a   form of merket efficiency called narket
dexterity which requires that asset prices adjust instantaneously and completely
in response    to   new   infornation.    Examining   the behavior   of    the yen/dollar

exchange rate while each of the nmjor narkets are open it is possible               to test
for informetional effects from one narket to the next.         Assuming that news has
only country   specific autocorrelation       such as a heat wave,        any   intra—daily
volatility spillovers (meteor showers) become evidence against nnrket dexterity.
ARQi models are employed to model heteroskedasticity across intra—daily narket
segments. Statistical tests lead to the rejection of the heat wave and therefore
the mrket dexterity       hypothesis.  Using   a volatility    type of vector
autoregression we examine the impact of news in one narket on the time path of
volatility in other merkets.

     It    is well Iciown   that exchange    rates approxintely follow         a   martingale

process so that future changes are essentially unpredictable                on the basis of

publicly available informetion.1 This finding is in accord with the efficient
sarket hypothesis as described by Faa(l97O). It has also long been known that

exchange rates exhibit volatility       clustering so that large changes tend to be
followed by large changes of either sign           and periods    of tranquility alternate
with periods of high volatility.2 Recently,         rrmny   investigators have modelled the

dynamic process of the conditional volatility using ARCH and GARCH models.                 For

example. Engle and Bollersiev(1986). Domowitz and Hakkio(1985), Diebold                    and
Nerlove(1988), Hsieh(l985) and McCtirdy and Morgan(1988) have all documented the
forecastability of volatility.         The explanation for such volatIlity          processes
must lie either In the arrival of new inforsatlon or sluggish                      inforsation

processing by the sarket.       If informetion comes         in clusters,   then the sarket

response say      exhibit   ARCH behavior      even      sarket perfectly and
                                                        if     the

instantaneously adjusts to  the news. Alternatively, traders with heterogeneous
prlors and private information, may take some hours of trading, after a shock
to have expectational differences resolved.   In either case, the conditional
market expectation at every time point could be unbiased, so In that sense it
still accords with market effeciency.
     We define and propose testing a form of market efficiency called market
dexterity.    A   market is said to be dextrous If the equilibrium price              responds
instantaneously and completely     to news.     If there is no news, there will be no

price movement in a dextrous market.        In particular, old news cannot predict any
aspect of the distribution of future asset prices, unless it predicts the change
in the arrival process of additional news.         Lack of dexterity does not



1For example,     Meese   and Rogoff    (1983a.b)    tested the      random walk hypothesis

against other forecasting formula and found the random walk hypothesis                to be as

good as others.   Ito and Roley (1987) and Ito (1987) showed how the exchange
rate responded to various news in the different markets around clock.
                                                                                      "
2Faxra's   observation on volatility clustering is sunerized as follows:                  large
daily price changes tend to be followed by large daily changes. The signs of
the successor changes are apparently random, however, which Indicates that the

phenomenon represents a denial of the random walk model but not of the market
efficiency hypothesis.       Nevertheless,    it Is interesting to speculate why            the

phenomenon might arise." (Fasa (1970; p. 396))

necessarily imply profit opportunities in options or futures rrnrkets                     as these
contracts can be priced to reflect the persistence of uncertainty.
     In this paper, careful examination of intra—daily exchange rates provides a
laboratory where  the dexterity hypothesis can be tested.    Using the set—up of
Ito and Roley(1987) and Ito(l987). we decompose the daily change in exchange
rates into the parts occurring while each of the rtnjor nnrkets is open. In this

paper we ask whether news in the New York earket can predict volatility in the
Tokyo market several hours later. This is a settIng where it is unlikely that
the news process         w    U   '-'n   aatocorre ateo a'   ass    markets    so that volatili
spillovers can reasonably he interpreted as evidence against rarket dexterity.
      Using meteorological analogies, we suppose that news follows a process llke
a heat wave so that   a hot day in New York Is likely to be followed by another
hot day in New York but not typically by a hot day in Tokyo.     Under earkar
dexterity, the volatility process should also be a beat wawe, The alternative
analor is a meteor_shower which rains down on the earth as it turns. A meteor
shower in New York will ai,aost surely be followed by one in Tokyo.        To
anticipate our conclusion, vnlatilty appears to be  a meteor shower rather than
a heat wave and therefore we claim evidence against the dexterity of the market,
     The heat wave hypothesis is coasistent with a via tint major sources of
disturbances     are    changes in country—specific fundamentals, and that one large
shock increases        the conditional volatility but only in that country. if the
policy   switch of the Federal Reserve, revealed or suspected toward the end of

day t,   is
          the source of volatility on day t, then a new piece of information,
such as how serious the Fed is about lowering the interest rate, would not be
revealed      until    the New York business         hours    of day       t÷l,    Therefore,     the
conditional volatility of the New York market on day ttl will increase, but not
the conditional volatility of the Tokyo or Europe markets.  For example, Ito

(1987) found that icrediately after the Group of Five agreement of September
1985, most of yen appreciation took place in the New York market due to the

surprise intervention by the New York Fed, while a sharp                      appreciation    in late
October was caused       by a     surprise increase of the interest rate,          revealed   over a
week, by the Bank of Japan and took place in the Tokyo market only.                     These are
clear—cut example of country—specific news on the fundamentals.
      The meteor shower hypothesis can be interpreted as the lack of dexterity in
the market.      For example, when the monetary supply statistics are announced                    n
New York at 4:10pm of Thursday,               there are less than thirty minutes          to trade

actively in New       York.       If all the traders do not        share   the cotron belief about



                                                 —4—
the meaning of the announced money supply, then it takes a few hours of actual

trading to settle the difference In traders' priors.     Ito and Roley (1987)
showed the evidence of the spillovers Into the Pacific merket after weekly money

supply announcements when the Fed targeted the money growth, but they did not
look at volatility spillovers.        Meteor showers could also be consistent with
failures of merket efficiency as well as dexterity.          For example some types of

technical analysis behavior could have this characteristic.         Suppose that there
was a large yen appreciation in the Tokyo merket.     If the shock creates the

expectation of more appreciation, i.e., a bandwagon, then the speculation my
take place in the European earkets of the same day and not wait until the Tokyo
merket   of the next day.        Put differently,   the   conditional volatility   will
increase for all rrnrkets, not just for the    mrket    domestic to the shock.
     Another   interpretation    of   the meteor shower,      however,   is cooperative
monetary policies.   If the policy switch by the Fed increases the uncertainties
of the monetary Stance of the Bank of Japan. or vice versa, then this would show
up as the meteor shower. In this Interpretation, neither merket efficiency nor
dexterity is violated.

Because of the rich dynamics of the volatility process we can trace out the
effects of news from one merket on the volatily in other earkets using a

technique which Is like a vector autoregression for volatility.   Section 3

exchange rate data since the Group of Five meeting of September l985          Section 4

is devoted to test the heat wave vs. meteor shower hypotheses. Our statistical
tests lead to a rejection of the heat waves hypotheses and hence earket
dexterity.     In section   5,        responses of volatility across narket

assumptions are made in this settIng.                                      First, we assume market efficiency which
implies that intra—daily exchange rate changes are distributed with mean zero.
This assumption is tested in section 6. Clearly, the assumption that
                                                                       et and

                                                                     e     =    0    for j=l,..., —1 if the market                        .5    is
closed because of a holiday on date                                    t   or   t—l.   VMs     choice follows from tha view
that the conditional                variance                    tends      to change upon the arrIval                          of   the new
information and that little or no new information is revealed during a holiday.4

3From en econometric viewpoint, innovations should not be serially correlated in
AflUl models, otherwise they can be forecast by using the past inforeation and

then the conditional mean will not be zero. In Section 6. robustness checks are
also implemented to justify this assumption.

4For example, as             suested by French and Roll                                    (1986), the volatility                   of stock

prices can be caused by the arrival of new inforantion or mispricing.                                                                          The
volatility of stock prices is relatively lower in non—trading hours.

       We    will use in this paper      the intra—daily yenldollar            exchange rate from
October 3,                            (see data appendix for more detail). This
                 1985 to September 26. 1986
one year period starts after the CS meeting in New York. In this period. as

analyzed in Ito (1987), the economic and political news play an important role
in the determinants of the exchange rate dynamics.               Ito (1987)         only       identifies

the different waves of exchange          rate   fluctuations by looking            at    the major news
in the respective markets without analyzing the effect of the country—specific
news on the volatility of the intra—daily exchange rate changes. However, we
still have little solid evidence on how the fundamental news induces the

volatility in the respective markets and how well the market adjusts to the new
information. Thus, the disaggregation of the market segments is a primary step
in understanding       the role of news in the determinants of volatility. Here, we
consider four major market segments.   We denote the change between the opening
and closing prices in Tokyo as the "TOKYO" market segment. Since there is a two
and a half hour (or three and a half hour during daylight savings time) interval
from    the New York close         to the Tokyo open, we can safely assume that                         the
Japanese news are the main causes of the TOKYO change. Although there is little
trading between the close in New York and the Tokyo open, we label this as a
separate market segment denoted as "PACIFIC". The "NEW YORK" market segment is
simply the change between the open and            the   close in New York.              Itt   spite of the



                                                -9-
overlap between the afternoon hours of London market and the early morning hours
of New York market, the NEW YORK segment mainly reflects the relevant news
originating in the U.S.   Finally, we define the Europe market, "EUROPE", as the
Interval between the Tokyo close and New York open.6
      Table     1    sunrizes     the relevant statistics describing our data set. We can

compare   these statistics          with    those of Ito and Roley         (1987) for   the period
January 1980 to September 1985.             The absolute     r.eans   are relatively higher in the
later period than in the earlier period. However, the variances (except Pacific

market) are lower in the later period. The per—hour volatility is approximately
0.0860, 0.0647, 0.0663, 0.0766 in the Pacific, Tokyo, Europe, and New York
markets implying that Tokyo and Europe are the least volatile markets per hour.
Next, the kurtosis in four markets are significantly greater than zero,

indicating       a    fat—tailed       distribution.        The akeanesa      statistics   are not
significant from zero except in the Tokyo market, revealing the syimnetric
distributton, Although the raw Box—Pierce statistics are upward biased in the
presence of          ARCH    effects as pointed out         by Diebold (1987), the Box—Pierce
statistics      are generally insignificant and therefore show no evidence of serial
correlation,  Together with insignificant nesns (eacept in the Europa market),
the statistics may suggest a random process with CAROB disturbances in the

foreign exchange markets.

      Most empirical          papers    studying    the effect of news in the        first moment
(conditional memn equation) measure                the change over 24 hours
                                                                (from a closing
rate to a closing rate).  To compare our data with the models in the literature.
we begin by investigating the volattlity of        exchange rate changes in the
New York and Tokyo narkets, because those are the only two markets with
                                                                         opening
and   closing       rates.
                     We denote the daily volatility in the Tokyo and New York
narkets as TK24        and NY24
                         respectively. The estiunted results of GARCII(l,l) are
presented in the first and fourth coluans of Table 2 respectively. Most of the
estinuted coefficients are sigaificant at a SN level and then reflect a strong
CARQ{ effect. The sum of coefficients in the conditioral variance equation is
only slightly less than 1.0 and naybe reveals the integrated CARGI process as
described in Engle and Bollerslev (1986).  The twenty—four hour innovation in

Tokyo earket has the larger impact on the conditional volatility in the future.
They are similar to results in Diebold and Nerlove(l9S6) and McCurdy and
Morgan(l988).        In general, the volatility of the daily change in the yen/dollar
exchange rate is serially correlated and that there is a persistent volatility
conditiome.1 on the current           informetion.
       These results        leave unanswered       the questions    posed   in the introduction.

During the 24 hour period, infornation from all countries is aggregated.   Thus

it is not possible to separate the sources of the inforeation and the causes of
the price and volatility changes.   In particular, yesterday's change has a mejor

impact on  todays volatility, but it  is not clear whether this is due to daily
serial correlation in the country-specific news or volatility spillovers between
different merket within a day.

     In the following subsection, our attention is focused first on the heat
wave model of volatility in New York and Tokyo only. These are the two nrkets
with the well defined opening and closing rates. In this case, the conditional
varIance of the change in one earket depends solely upon the past shocks in this
earket. The results are shown for the Tokyo and New York earkets in the second
and fifth rows of Table 2. The results again suggest a positive and significant
effect of yesterdays change on today's volatility as well as the possibility of
a    unit root in the variance process which says that these shocks last forever.

between       the   opening   and closing quotes is a              reflection   of    the   domestic

volatiltity.  The squared change between the closing rate at the previous period
and opening rate at this period measures the effect of the foreign volatility.
which aggregates the effects from the other earkets. The heat wave hypothesis
is equivalent to       a   zero coefficient on the foreign emrket term.
        The test against the meteor shower hypothesis which aggregates all foreign
news, is conducted by the Lagrangean                 Multiplier    test described     in Section   2.

The results shown in Table 2 indicate that the null hypothesis of heat waves can
be rejected at least at the 5X significance level in both the Tokyo and New York
nrkets.
        Table 2 also       presents estintes of the meteor shower           model aggregating the



                                                  — 11 —
foreign news.  The striking feature of these estimetes is the finding that the
foreign news is more important than yesterday's domestic news.   The result is
much like a Cranger           causality      test    for     variances     where   the   own     lag    is

significant until      the Intervening variables are introduced.                   The constants in
the conditional vmriance become negative which implies that the unconditional or

conditional variances could be negative depending upon the relative magnitude of

foreign news  to the domestic news and constant term In the foreign news
equation.  On the whole, we can conclude that there are volatility spillovers
which nay be interpreted either as a lack of dexterity in the narket, or as
evidence for important, potential international policy coordination that implies
cross country news autocorrelation.

     Although the heat wave hypothesis is soundly rejected, this specification
does not allow us to pinpoint the source of the volatility. In the next section
we decompose the foreign news into its component market segments and therefore
can trace the impoct of a news shock in one market through the system.

statistics are shown in Table 3.   Since we do not report the results for heat
wave models in the Europe and Pacific markets, Wald tests are presented for all
markets.
     These tests check  the adequacy of the null hypothesis of heat waves; the

significant statistics (except in Tokyo market) reported in Table 3 confirm the
previous    findings    that the epillover          effects play an essential            role    in the
determinants of intra—daily volatility in the foreign exchange markets.

     Next, by examining the estimated coefficients in Table 3, we see that the
impacts of news on the volatility of the New York market are —0.00738, 0.07999,
0.14582 and —0.01750 according        to the source markets.               By the absolute value of
those estimated       impacts, the relation exhibits an inverse U curve. The                         sane
ideas can be applied         to the other market segments.                 The Pacific market also
appears an inverse U shape curve whereas the Europe and Tokyo markets exhibit a
two—peak curve.       in these instances, the fact            that the     value and the timing of
information     are    not      negatively     related        may     be    attributable        to     the
characteristics of how fast the news could be digested in the market. We may
infer from the pattern of the inverse U shape curve that the market lacks

5   IXFUL     RES11        IN VOLATILITY
     Although table 3 is suggestive about how a shock in one narket influences
the future volatility in the merkets around the world, the table does not give
us the precise answer. Suppose there is a large shock in New York. Thea, the
impact of the New York dIsturbance will influence the Tokyo volatility through a
direct effect in the Tokyo equation and an indirect effect through the Increased

volatility in the Pacific srket.     In order to calculate the impact of     the

increased volatility         In narket    J    on date t on the rrrket i on date t+k, the
system of four      recursive       equations,    represented in equation (10), has to be
solved.      This process is analogous          to solving the vector autoregressions            (VAR)
model     Into   moving average        representation,      and shows       the    impulse    response
functions (see Sims (1980)).

      Figures 1—4 show such Impulse responses in per—hour volatility.                        Given the

per—hour shock in one particular   nrket, how per—hour volatilities in other
nrkets will be affected Is plotted in each graph. The impact reponses can be
obtained by solving equatIon (10) and multiplying by the realtive business hour
ratio of      the   source    narket     to    the   respondent   merket,         The vertical    axis

represents the deviation        (   volatility       increment) from the benchnrk case, while
the horizontal axis represents the days elapsed from the day of the shock.
      At a first glance, the impulse response curves exhibit a short run                       dynamic
effect,    and then die out approxilTm.tely           after two weeks.      In general, the Tokyo

per hour news       has    the largest        impact on the per hour predicted           conditional
variances In all merkets.             It also responds relatively           little to shocks from
other merkets.      Table 1 reveals that the Tokyo           quietest in terms
                                                              rrarket   is the

of unconditional variance; apparently whenever there is news, it has important
consequences.
      During     the one—year       period after      the Group of Five meeting of September

1985, the coordination          between       the central banks     in the five countries had
undergone    a       From September to December 1985, the central banks of the
                 change.
five countries coordinated the depreciation of the dollar, although the amount
of intervention and the degree of change in the interest rate constantly

surprised the rr2rket.         In 1986. there were growing signs of conflicts between
the   U.S.    and Japan.       The Japanese government was more reluctant to help
depreciation of the dollar.            In fact the Bank of Japan started to intervene in
the narket in support of the dollar in March 1986.              There were uncertainties

about what the Bank of Japan could do to prevent the yen appreciation.                           (See Ito
(1987) for      detail        of such policy        switches.)          Our   results   show    that   the

volatility in the Tokyo market, presumably created by the Bank of Japan policy
revelation, had a great impact on the world volatility.                          It might have been the

case that it took several hours or days to precisely                          interpret the meaning of
policy action in Japan.
        The eigenvalues of this system are 04877, 0.5725, 0.8228, 0.9481, which
are sit indication        of the stationary process.                    It also confirms        that   any
innovation      from    one particular market will not persist in the long run.
However,     this      does not prevent a signIficant Interaction of volatility
splllovmrs in the short run.

     The specification tests in the preceding section support the idea that the

foreign exchange market is not dextrous in that the yolatilities are correlated
across    intra—daily markets.           In this section, additional              robustness    tests of
related hypotheses are performed.
     One of popular hypotheses in the empirical studies is the weak—form market
effeciency, which implies that the foreign and domestic news or announcements
cannot affect the conditional mean of exchange rate aovements  This hypothesis
has been widely examined  in the literature; for example, see Edwards (1982)
(1983), Frenkel (1981), and Ito and Roley (1987). The first set of tests check
whether the previous country—specific innovation                    (    in   level )   has   explanatory
powers on the mean equation of intra—daily exchange rate changes or not. Since
most of those tests reported in the first four rows of Table 4 (except in the
Pacific market)         are    not    significant    at    the 5%       level,    the data reveal       the
robustness of the model specification to this competing hypothesis.
     A substantial body of studies from the forward exchange market as well as
the other  financial markets address the evidence that the time varying risk

premium for risky assests held by risk averse investors is related to the
conditional variance.7               If we take ihis view,       then intra—daily exchange             rate
changes may be caused by the time varying conditional variance. If this is the
case,    then   the coefficient          of   h   will     be significant          in the mean return

equation.  The empirical results reported in Table 4 indicate the absence of the

volatility effect on intra—daily exchange rate changes in the New York. Tokyo
and Pacific merkets. whereas this effect appears in the Europe narket.
     The third group of robustness tests investigate holiday and Monday effects
on   the    conditional     mean as well     as on the conditional       variance   of   the

intra—daily exchange rate movements. On the one band, holiday and Monday effects
reveal no significantly         explanatory powers     in the conditional mean.     This is
contrary to the findings of French (1980) and Gibbon and Hess (1981) that the
Monday effect yields negative returns in the stock narket. On the other hand.
the Tokyo merket shows a significant Monday effect In the conditional variance

equation since it is the first organized earket open in Monday.
     Finally, we check the higher order of the ARC}I term and the holiday effect
on the sensitivity of ARCH(1) to the conditional variance equation. The results
show no evidence of the ARG{(2) effect, i.e. a2. In case of the preceding

holidays, the squared lagged Innovations from the same smrket actually arising
from the previous two or three days my not be worth as much as that of the no
preceeding holiday case. From this viewpoint, the coefficient in the interation
between             and   the holiday dunsny is supposed to be negative. and the data
           etl
show a rejection of the interaction effect on the conditional variance              for the
Tokyo and Europe narkets

     Unlike much work on                  of the efficiency In the foreign
                                   the examination

exchange merket. this paper sheds some light on volatility clustering of the
exchange rate. We propose and test the concept of dexterity.   In particular.
the GARQ{ model is employed          to determine    the sources causing the   intra—daily
volatility in the disaggregated narket segments with the data of the yen/dollar
exchange        from October 3, 1985 to September 26. 1986. Two competing
             rate

hypotheses —  heat waves and meteor showers — are proposed to examine the
dexterity of the yen/dollar exchange rsarket. The empirical results are generally
against the heat waves hypothesis, implying either that the yen/dollar              foreign
exchange merket Is not dextrous and suffers from volatility spillovers or that
volatility clusters because  of stochastic policy coordination.  However, the
role of merket dexterity in Tokyo is not conclusive since it is not robust to
the disaggregation of merket segments. To understand the value of informtion.
we then investigate          the   extent   to which   merket—specific   news affects    the




                                             — 15 —
conditional variances in the subsequent markets.
     The empirical evidences yield conclusions      in the above two principal
issues.     First, the timing and the impact of the arrival of information do not
exhibit   a
          negative correlation. Usually, there exists an inverse U curve or two
peak curve. indicating either a time lag in response to the news or a different
value of the news to the traders.     Second. in the reactions to the various
innovatIons, the Impulse response curves show a cross—market dynamic effect in
the short run and then die out. Judging from eigenvalues with modulus
                                                                       being less
than one, we nay conclude that the volatility process of the
                                                                      intra—daily
exchange rate dynamics is approximately stationary.
     Finally, some robustness tests are provided for supporting the validity of
the model  specifications. Under some circumstances, Information about holiday
and Monday durmies may help explain the heteroskedasticity. In the Tokyo and New
York markets, the exchange rate process cannot be distinguished from a
martingale. According to this finding, the market efficiency in the mean is
supported but not market dexterity.
