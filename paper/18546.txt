                                           ABSTRACT

We propose a dynamic spatial theory to analyze the geographic impact of climate change. Agricultural
and manufacturing firms locate on a hemisphere. Trade across locations is costly, firms innovate, and
technology diffuses over space. Energy used in production leads to emissions that contribute to the
global stock of carbon in the atmosphere, which affects temperature. The rise in temperature differs
across latitudes and sectors. We calibrate the model to analyze how climate change affects the spatial
distribution of economic activity, trade, migration, growth, and welfare. We assess quantitatively the
impact of migration and trade restrictions, energy taxes, and innovation subsidies.

          We propose a dynamic spatial theory to analyze the geographic impact of climate change.
      Agricultural and manufacturing …rms locate on a hemisphere. Trade across locations is costly,
      …rms innovate, and technology di¤uses over space. Energy used in production leads to emissions
      that contribute to the global stock of carbon in the atmosphere, which a¤ects temperature. The
      rise in temperature di¤ers across latitudes and sectors. We calibrate the model to analyze how
      climate change a¤ects the spatial distribution of economic activity, trade, migration, growth,
      and welfare. We assess quantitatively the impact of migration and trade restrictions, energy
      taxes, and innovation subsidies.




                                         1. INTRODUCTION


  The potential negative economic e¤ects of anthropogenic temperature increases are the result
of frictions that prevent the free movement of goods and people in space. The logic and evidence
behind this claim is straightforward. First, temperature varies by parallel from 0 celsius in the
North Pole to 28 celsius in the Equator (during the growing season). This range is much larger
than the estimates of temperature increases in extreme scenarios, that reach at most between 6
and 8 celsius over the next 200 years. Hence, over this time period, the increase in temperature will
induce more moderate temperatures in large parts of the world thereby increasing productivity in
those regions. Of course, under these same scenarios, global warming will also create large deserts
in which no agricultural or manufacturing production will be feasible. Combine these observations

with the fact that most land in the world is essentially economically unused and empty. According
to G-Econ 4.0, in 2005 at market exchange rates 90% of production occupied only 10% of land. The
number is 84% in PPP terms and 72% if we focus on population. The extreme concentration of
production and population implies that making a fraction of land un…t for production cannot lead to
big losses in output, since agents in the world choose not to use most land anyway! This logic implies
that if we expect large economic losses from global warming in the foreseeable future they cannot
come just from the direct e¤ect of temperature increases on the productivity of land. Instead, they
have to come from the frictions involved in moving production and people from their current sites
to the regions that will be suitable for production in the future. Namely, the welfare losses are the
result of the frictions associated with international trade and migration. Understanding how these
frictions a¤ect the impact of global warming is the primary goal of this paper.
  Global warming has had an important e¤ect on the geography of economic activity already in the
past. During the Medieval Warm Period, roughly between the ninth and fourteenth centuries, the
world experienced temperatures rises of up to 2 celsius that, according to Fagan (2008) “...brought
bounty to some areas, but to others, prolonged droughts that shook established societies to their
foundations.”1 Northern Europeans or Inuits bene…tted enormously, while Mongols, native Ameri-
cans, and other Mesoamerican societies su¤ered losses that went from limiting their expansion to
bringing them to the brink of extinction. The world as we know it today was shaped by these
changes, not because warming led to less available land or resources in the world as a whole, but
because of the changes in the location of the suitable areas for production and growth. As we
emphasize here for the case of future anthropogenic global warming, during the Medieval Warm
Period Fagan (2008) concludes that “The only protection against such disasters was movement.”2
Moving goods and people is restricted and costly, and the economic e¤ect of temperature change
will depend crucially on the magnitude of these frictions.
  Understanding the spatial implications of global warming requires a framework with both geog-
raphy as well as dynamics. The economic models that have been proposed to study the economic
implications of temperature change are in general dynamic, but have not incorporated geograph-
ically ordered space. Some frameworks, such as Krusell and Smith (2009) and Nordhaus (2010),
do include many regions, but these regions are not linked to each other through trade costs and
technology di¤usion. Hence, it is impossible to use them to understand changes in geographic
specialization and trade patterns, as well as the geography of innovation and migration.

  Incorporating a rich set of spatially ordered locations in a dynamic model is in general intractable.
In Desmet and Rossi-Hansberg (2011) we develop a framework with both a spatial and a time
dimension that can be solved forward due to local competition for land and technological di¤usion.
With the proposed structure, innovations yield pro…ts for the …rm today, but only increases in
land values, not in pro…ts, in the future. This property of the model implies that a …rm’s dynamic
optimization problem can be solved as a sequence of static problems. Hence, the equilibrium of the
model is just a sequence of static spatial equilibria with state variables that follow laws of motion
determined contemporaneously. This structure of the model makes the framework computable and
suitable for the problem at hand.
  To study the impact of global warming on spatial and aggregate outcomes we model the Northern
Hemisphere. So space is half a sphere with the diameter of the earth. We study symmetric spatial
equilibria where prices and allocations are identical for all locations at a given latitude. This is
natural since we assume that all regions in a given latitude have the exact same temperature.
The model features two industries, agriculture and manufacturing, whose productivity depends
on both temperature and the local technology in the sector. The local technology is the result
of technological innovations in the region as well as technological di¤usion over space. In that
sense, our model is a spatial endogenous growth model. Goods can be traded across locations
subject to iceberg transport costs that depend on distance. Since space is continuous, incomplete
specialization can happen only in a set of measure zero, and so it does not represent a problem to
our focus on symmetric equilibria.
  Agriculture and manufacturing …rms produce using labor, land, and energy as inputs. Energy use
generates a global stock of pollution (or CO2 in the atmosphere), which in turn leads to temperature
change. The increases in temperature that result from a larger stock of CO2 in the atmosphere are
not uniform across locations. As documented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC, 2007), locations in latitudes closer to the North Pole increase their temperature more than
those close to the Equator, although never enough to compensate for the larger temperatures close
to the Equator. Obviously, since emissions are local but lead to a global stock of pollution, which in
turn changes local temperatures, global warming is a¤ected by an externality in energy use. Absent
policy, local producers do not internalize the e¤ect of their emissions on temperature change.
  Temperature change has two main e¤ects on spatial production patterns. First, the gradual
increase in average temperatures makes the ideal location to produce in both industries move to
the north over time. The literature suggests that the impact of temperature on productivity is more


                                                  3
pronounced in agriculture than in manufacturing. Nevertheless, general equilibrium e¤ects imply
that the specialization areas in manufacturing change as well. These changes in specialization
lead to changes in technology innovation in the di¤erent locations, thus amplifying the e¤ects.
The second implication of temperature change is that locations closer to the North Pole experience
larger changes in temperatures, which enhances their comparative advantage in agriculture. Hence,
temperature changes tend to favor specialization of the north in agriculture and the south in
manufacturing. This is balanced by the fact that technologies in manufacturing are initially better
in the northern latitudes, which leads to more innovation in the north. In calibrated examples, we
observe that when the e¤ect of pollution on temperature is small, the south specializes in agriculture
and the north in manufacturing, as is roughly the case in the world today. In contrast, when the
e¤ect of CO2 on temperature is large, the south increasingly specializes in manufacturing and
produces in this sector using backward technologies with low total factor productivity. Eventually,
if the e¤ect is very large or if we study a very long period, the North Pole ends up specializing in
agriculture.
  The e¤ects outlined above lead to large migrations of agents across locations, and so the conse-
quences of global warming are mediated by the ability of agents and goods to move across space.
We analyze two scenarios for labor mobility: one in which labor is freely mobile across locations
and therefore welfare in the world is equalized, and another scenario where labor is freely mobile
within a southern region and within a northern region (modeled as intervals of latitudes) but not
across them. The …rst scenario is useful to understand the direction and the magnitude of migration
patterns across countries. The second scenario is useful to understand the welfare implications of
the spatial inequities created by global warming. Reality surely lies in between these two extremes.
The framework is amenable to studying other less draconian migration regimes, although we leave
that for future work. The quantitative exercises show that migration policy is a crucial comple-
mentary policy when addressing the impact of global warming. Migration restrictions increase the
overall welfare costs of a more pronounced relationship between temperature and CO2 emissions.
Furthermore, they increase the negative e¤ects of global warming in scenarios where the relation-
ship between pollution and temperature is extreme and lead to signi…cant costs in the south and
signi…cant gains in the north. Thus, global warming seems particularly problematic in the presence
of migration restrictions.
  The framework can be used to evaluate a variety of environmental, industrial, regional, and
migration policies. Since we model the local decision to use energy in the production process, we


                                                  4
can introduce either carbon taxes or cap-and-trade type policies. Since regional-sectoral innovation
is endogenous, we can also introduce innovation incentives that reduce the use of energy. In
the main formulation of the model, we use a Cobb-Douglas speci…cation and so we do not allow
for energy-biased technological changes. Nevertheless, technological innovations reduce the use of
energy per unit of output and so, given a positively sloped supply of energy in the world, the
quantity of energy used in equilibrium. Hence, local innovation a¤ects energy use, pollution, and
global warming. In that sense, innovation generates a positive externality. This externality is
valued di¤erently across regions. In the quantitative exercises, we explore the role of trade policy,
energy taxes, and innovation subsidies. We …nd energy taxes to be particularly e¤ective, as they
tend to stimulate innovation by favoring high productivity locations, which tend to innovate more.
The elasticity of welfare with respect to the energy tax is positive but declining in the tax and
eventually turns negative. This pattern justi…es high levels of the tax (on the order of 400% for the
calibrated economy). More generally, we …nd that these policies interact with innovation and the
spatial pattern of economic activity, and so modeling space is essential to evaluate their aggregate
implications.
  In recent years there has been a vast e¤ort to quantitatively model the economic e¤ects of
climate change. One of the main contributors has been Nordhaus (2008, 2010), who, building on
his previous work, has developed a multi-region economic growth model of climate change that
aims to quantitatively assess the impact of di¤erent abatement policies. We draw on his work to
incorporate some of the relevant features of climate change, such as the link between production,
emissions, carbon stock, and temperature. However, we deviate from Nordhaus (2008, 2010) by
considering space to be ordered and by introducing more than one sector. This allows us to analyze
the role of trade, specialization, migration and agglomeration in mediating the impact of climate
change on the spatial distribution of economic activity and on welfare. There are a few papers
that explicitly introduce space into models of climate change. An example is the work by Brock et
al. (2012a,b), which focuses on how space matters to model heat di¤usion across latitudes and the
moving of the ice lines toward the poles.
  There have been some attempts to incorporate trade and specialization into the analysis of
climate change, such as the IMPACT model developed by the International Food Policy Research
Institute (IFPRI), as well as the EPPA model described in Babiker et al. (2008), among others. All
of these attempts to model trade in combination with climate change use Armington assumptions
and therefore are not suitable to analyze the e¤ect of climate change on patterns of specialization


                                                 5
and local innovation over time. As far as we are aware, the only exception is the IMPACT model,
which focuses solely on agriculture (and on the possibility of switching between di¤erent crops or
between crops and livestock) and is therefore partial equilibrium in nature (Nelson et al., 2009).
The calibration part of our model draws on a large literature, such as the studies by the Intergov-
ernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the RICE/DICE models by Nordhaus, and studies
on the impact of temperature on crop yields (Le, 2010; Lobell and Burke, 2010).
  Our paper is part of an incipient literature that quantitatively assesses the economic impact
of climate change in standard dynamic general equilibrium models. Examples include Golosov
et al. (2011) and Hassler and Krusell (2012), who incorporate climate change into an otherwise
standard macroeconomic model and quantitatively analyze the impact of di¤erent tax policies. We
follow in the same tradition but focus on trade and innovation and consider space to be ordered.
Macroeconomists have also become increasingly interested in analyzing how policy can be used to
make growth sustainable. For example, Acemoglu et al. (2012) and Aghion et al. (2011) analyze
which types of policies can direct technological change toward the use of clean energy. In our model,
there is no choice between clean and dirty energy, but policy does a¤ect the intensity of energy use
and thus the amount of pollution.
  The sensitivity analysis we carry out in the paper is motivated by di¤erent concerns raised in
the literature. One issue, highlighted by von Below and Persson (2008) and Weitzman (2009),
is the substantial uncertainty about the relations between economic activity and global warming,
including the possibility of catastrophic climate change. We will compare how the sensitivity in the
relation between pollution and temperature a¤ects outcomes. Another hotly debated question is
which discount factor to use, as welfare e¤ects depend crucially on the value chosen for this para-
meter. The Stern Review (Stern, 2006), for example, came under criticism for using a high discount
factor. In our numerical simulations we will compare outcomes considering di¤erent discount rates.
  The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model and Section 3 discusses
the calibration. Section 4 carries out the benchmark numerical simulation and analyzes the impact
of global warming by comparing economies where pollution has distinct e¤ects on temperature.
Section 5 assesses the impact of migration and trade barriers, and Section 6 studies the e¤ect
of energy taxes and innovation subsidies. Section 7 concludes. An appendix explores alternative
formulations of the link between emissions and temperature.

                                                    2. THE MODEL


  The economy consists of land and agents located in a half sphere that represents the Northern
Hemisphere. Any point in the half sphere can be represented by its latitude (`V 2 0;                     2   ) and
longitude (`H 2 [             ; ]). We will focus on symmetric allocations from the North Pole and so
                                                                                     ~ (`V ) as the
a location’s characteristics will only depend on its latitude. It is useful to de…ne D
circumference of the Earth at latitude `V in kilometers. For simplicity we assume that the Earth is a
                                                                   ~ (`V ) = 2 rE sin( =2 `V ), so
perfect sphere with radius at the Equator of rE = 6; 371 km. Hence D
                             ~ ( =2) = 0 km, and at the Equator (`V = 0), D
at the North Pole (`V = =2), D                                            ~ (0) = 2 rE = 40030

km, namely, the circumference of the Earth.
  The total surface in the Northern Hemisphere is then given by the integral over a density given
by the circumference, namely,

          Z    =2
                                                                             =2        2
                    2 rE sin( =2      `V )rE d`V = 2 rE cos( =2     `V )j0        = 2 rE = 255032236 km2 :
          0


A fraction of 71% of the surface of the Earth is covered with water. The fraction is, of course,
heterogeneous at di¤erent latitudes. We abstract from this heterogeneity and multiply the surface
at all latitudes by 0.29. Hence, when we integrate over space we need to use the density D (`V ) =
       ~ (`V ) = 0:58 r2 sin( =2
0:29rE D                                    `V ):
                       E

  Countries in the Northern Hemisphere, when we use them, will be modeled as intervals of lat-
itudes. So a country is supposed to occupy a whole ring of the earth. Note that all locations
with the same latitude are ex-ante identical. Let there be N countries, where country n = 1 is
the one closest to the Equator and occupies latitudes [0; n1 ], and country n = N is the one clos-
est to the North Pole and occupies latitudes [nN             1 ; nN ].   Throughout we refer to a location as
     `V
`=   `H       2 0;   2    [    ; ]:
  The total number of agents in country n is denoted by Ln ; and each of them is endowed with one
                                     P
unit of time each period. We let L = n Ln denote the world’s population. Agents are in…nitely
lived.


2.1. Preferences


  Agents live where they work and they derive utility from the consumption of two goods: agricul-
ture and manufacturing. Every period labor is freely mobile across locations within a country. In



                                                         7
the benchmark quantitative exercise we allow also for mobility across countries. Independently of
the migration assumption in place, throughout the paper we assume that agents can move freely
across sectors and within countries.
  Agents supply their unit of time inelastically in the labor market. They order consumption
bundles according to an instantaneous utility function U (cA ; cM ) with standard properties, where ci
denotes consumption of good i 2 fA; M g. We assume that the utility function U ( ) is homogeneous
of degree one. In the numerical exercises below we use a CES utility function with an elasticity of
substitution given by 1=(1            ), namely,

                                                               1

                                                                     t

  Agents hold a diversi…ed portfolio of land and …rms in all locations.3 Goods are non-storable,
and there is no other savings technology apart from land and …rm ownership. The problem of an
agent at a particular location ` in country n is given by4

where pi (`; t) denotes the price of good i, w (`; t) denotes the wage at location ` and time t, R (t)
and    (t) denote total land rents and total …rm pro…ts. Total …rm pro…ts,                         (t); include standard
pro…ts (which are zero in equilibrium) and the value of the energy supply given by e(t)E S (e(t))
where e (t) represents the price of energy and E S ( ) its supply. Given that agents hold a diversi…ed
portfolio of land, …rms, and energy in all locations, R(t)=L and                           (t)=L represent the per agent
dividend from land and …rm ownership. The …rst-order conditions of this problem yield


                        Ui (cA (`; t) ; cM (`; t)) =       (`; t) pi (`; t) , for all i 2 fA; M g ;

     Since U ( ) is constant returns to scale, agents are not risk averse. If they were, they would like to hold this
diversi…ed portfolio to insure themselves against idiosyncratic local shocks. Alternatively we could have agents hold
a diversi…ed portfolio of land and assets in the country where they reside.

     Since we assume labor mobility within a country, utility levels within the country will equalize across space each
period and so we can study the optimization problem of an agent as if she were to stay in the same location forever.



                                                                8

Lagrange multiplier. Denote by Un (pA (`; t); pM (`; t); w(`; t) + R(t) +               (t) =L) the indirect utility

  Free labor mobility across locations within countries in each period guarantees that

where un (t) is determined in equilibrium.


2.2. Technology


  Firms specialize in one sector. The inputs of production are land, labor and energy. Production
per unit of land in location ` at time t, if the location specializes in agriculture, is given by


                                                                                                    A
                   YA (LA (`; t) ; EA (`; t)) = ZA (`; t) gA (T (`; t)) LA (`; t)   A   EA (`; t)       ;


and, similarly, if it specializes in manufacturing is


                                                                                                        M

where Li (`; t) is the amount of labor per unit of land; Ei (`; t) is the amount of energy per unit
of land used at location ` and time t in sector i; 1                i     i   > 0 is the share of land in sector
i;5 and Zi (`; t) gi (T (`; t)) is the technology level, composed of two parts: Zi (`; t) is the result
of the investment decisions by …rms and gi (T (`; t)) determines the e¤ect on productivity of the
local temperature, T (`; t). The function gi (T (`; t)) is such that gi (T )               0 and limT !1 gi (T ) =
limT !   1 gi (T )   = 0. Furthermore it is single-peaked and twice di¤erentiable in the interior. Hence,
there exists some …nite ideal temperature T such that gi (T )                   gi (T ) for all T 2 R: We use the
following parametrization in the empirical exercise,


                                     gi (T ) = max gi0 + gi1 T + gi2 T 2 ; 0


where gi0 ? 0, gi1 > 0 and gi2 < 0. So the ideal temperature is given by Ti =                                gi1
                                                                                                            2gi2   and yields
                      2

gi (Ti ) = gi0      4gi2   :

    A share of land smaller than one (1      i    i ) is the main congestion force in our model. It implies that there
are decreasing returns to scale in production in any particular location.

2.3. Di¤usion


  Technology di¤uses between time periods. This di¤usion is assumed to be local and to decline
exponentially with distance. In particular, if Zi (r; t                1) was the technology used in location r in
period t     1, in the next period, t; location ` has access to (but does not necessarily need to use)
technology

                                               e           Zi (r; t      1) ;

where k`     rk denotes the distance between locations ` and r which is given by


                   k`    rk = rE arccos (sin `H sin rH + cos `H cos rH cos (`V                         rV )) :


Hence, before the innovation decision in period t, location ` has access to

                                                                       k` rk
                               Zi (`; t) =         max             e            Zi (r; t        1)                              (3)

which of course includes its own technology in the previous period. This type of di¤usion is the
only exogenous source of agglomeration in the model.


2.4. Innovation


  A …rm can decide to buy an innovation                      1 at cost              i(      ) per unit of land in a particular
industry i (this cost will be paid using local production so the real cost in industry i is given by

 i(   ) =pi (`; t) per unit of land). Hence, a …rm that obtained a productivity Zi (`; t) in the morning
of period t after di¤usion happened, and chooses a level of innovation , will improve its technology
                                                                                                      0             00
to Zi (`; t) : We assume that       i(   ) is twice continuously di¤erentiable,                       i(   ) > 0;   i (   ) > 0 for
                        0
  > 1; and lim   !1     i(   ) = 1 with, potentially,            i (1)   > 0:
  In the calibration below we index the cost by the wage so that it scales with the economy and
use the following speci…cation,

2.5. The Dynamics of Temperature


  We now discuss how emissions from global production a¤ect the carbon stock and how the
carbon stock determines temperature in di¤erent locations. The …rst link, between emissions and
the carbon stock, is known as the carbon cycle. It analyzes how carbon ‡ows between di¤erent
reservoirs (the atmosphere, the upper ocean, and the lower ocean). These ‡ows determine how
anthropogenic carbon emissions a¤ect the total stock of carbon in the atmosphere, and how this
e¤ect decays over time as emitted carbon slowly gets trapped in the lower oceans. The second link,
between the carbon stock and temperature, is the climate sensitivity. As carbon accumulates in
the atmosphere, this generates increased radiative forcing, leading to higher temperatures.
  The literature has used di¤erent ways of modeling these links. On the one hand, Nordhaus
(2010) assumes a carbon cycle in which the e¤ect of emissions on the atmospheric carbon stock
completely dies out over time. Emissions initially add to the carbon stock in the atmosphere, but
this e¤ect slowly decays as the emitted carbon gradually moves to the lower oceans, to then remain
there forever. On the other hand, Allen et al. (2009) and Matthews et al. (2009) show that both
links, the carbon cycle and the climate sensitivity, can be simpli…ed into a direct linear relation
between cumulative emissions and temperature. This amounts to assuming zero decay in the e¤ect
of emissions on temperature. In between those two extremes, Golosov et al. (2011) follow Archer
(2005) and propose a carbon cycle in which about 20% of emissions stay in the atmosphere forever,
whereas the remaining part decays over time.
  We assume a simpli…ed reduced-form carbon cycle in the spirit of Nordhaus (2010), where the
carbon stock slowly decays over time. In other words, the stock of carbon in the atmosphere in a
given period depends on the stock of carbon in the atmosphere in the previous period and on the
emissions created by energy use in manufacturing and agriculture. So let the global stock of carbon
be given by
                            P (t + 1) = "1 P (t) + "2 EA (t) + EM (t) ;                         (4)

where "1      1 determines how the stock of carbon in the atmosphere decays over time, whereas
"2 determines how a unit of energy is converted in a unit of carbon emissions. Note that P (0) is
normalized to 0. If we were to set "1 = 1, then P (t) could be interpreted as cumulative emissions,
rather than as the stock of carbon. This implies that the model of Allen et al. (2009) and Matthews
et al. (2009) is a special case of ours. Although for our baseline analysis we assume "1 < 1, in
Appendix we will redo our numerical analysis using the Allen et al. (2009) assumption of "1 = 1.


                                                11
The aggregate energy consumed in sector i is given by

                                                     Z     =2
                                        Ei (t) =                i (`; t) Ei (`; t) D(`)d`

where     i (`; t)   denotes the fraction of land at location ` that specializes in sector i at time t. We
abstract from household consumption of energy.
  The next step is to determine the temperature T (`; t) as a function of the stock of carbon. In
Nordhaus (2010) and Golosov et al. (2011) temperature is a concave (logarithmic) function of the
stock of atmospheric carbon, whereas in Allen et al. (2009) and Matthews et al. (2009) temperature
is a linear function of cumulative emissions. Consistent with this, we assume temperature to be
weakly concave in P . In addition, the environmental evidence seems to suggest that for a given
increase in the level of aggregate pollution, locations farther to the north will experience a larger
increase in temperatures (IPCC, 2007). Of course, independently of the stock of carbon, T (`; t) is
a decreasing function of `, namely, temperatures at the Equator are always higher. A convenient
way of parameterizing these di¤erent pieces of evidence is


                                                                                  2

In the calibration we choose values of               1;    2;   and       3   to guarantee these properties.6

main way of modulating the importance of global warming. Given                                   2,   3,   and T (`; 0), a high              1

implies, by the derivative in (6), that temperature increases faster with pollution. Since pollution
a¤ects the real economy only through its e¤ect on temperature, this implies that when                                                 1   = 0,
there is no global warming phenomenon, and when                              1   is large, pollution can lead to catastrophic
increases in temperature.
  While in our baseline analysis we will assume emitted carbon decays over time ("1 < 1 in equation
(4)) and temperature is a strictly concave function of the carbon stock (                                  2   < 1 in equation (5)),
we can easily take the Allen et al. (2009) approach and make temperature a linear function of
cumulative emissions by setting "1 = 1 and                        2   = 1. We will explore the robustness of our results to
this alternative model in the Appendix. Recall that in terms of how emissions a¤ect temperature,
our baseline model assumes the whole stock of carbon decays over time, Allen et al. (2009) and
Matthews et al. (2009) assume zero decay, whereas Golosov et al. (2011) take an intermediate
view. Therefore, by comparing our baseline to Allen et al. (2009) and Matthews et al. (2009), we
capture the full range of possibilities.

pro…ts, since there is no storage technology or …nancial assets in our model. In any case, given the
argument below, this choice is irrelevant in our setup.
  Labor is freely mobile within a country and …rms compete for land and labor every period with
potential entrants that, because of di¤usion, have access to the same technology as they do. Hence,
the decision of how many workers to hire, how much energy to use and how much to bid for land
is a static problem. So, consider …rst a …rm’s static problem of choosing labor and energy in sector
  7
    The assumption simpli…es the model considerably. Modeling the location of energy production would be incon-
sequential for our results in the absence of scale economies in the sector.

which guarantees that …rms make zero pro…ts.
  Since pro…ts are zero every period, the decision to innovate by the …rm does not consider any
future periods and is static. This is due to the presence of a competitive market for land and
the fact that any …rm can access the new technologies next period via di¤usion. However, the
innovation decisions are not socially optimal given the externality (see Desmet and Rossi-Hansberg
(2011) for details). Hence, the innovation problem of a …rm, given factor prices and the amount of

2.7. Land, Goods, Energy, and Labor Markets


    Goods are costly to transport. For simplicity we assume iceberg transport costs which are
identical in agriculture and manufacturing. If one unit of any good is transported from ` to r, only
e     k` rk   units of the good arrive in r. Since the technology to transport goods is freely available,
the price of good i produced in location ` and consumed in location r has to satisfy

                                                                 k` rk
                                                 pi (r; t) = e            pi (`; t) :                                             (13)


    Land in a given location is assigned to the …rm in the industry that values it the most. Hence,
land rents are such that
                                        R (`; t) = max fRA (`; t) ; RM (`; t)g :                                                  (14)

If R (`; t) = Ri (`; t) then      i (`; t)   = 1. To break ties, when RA (`; t) = RM (`; t), we let                    A (`; t)   = 1.
    In order to guarantee equilibrium in product markets, we need to take into account that some
of the goods are lost in transportation. Note also that this formulation implies that nothing in the
allocation depends on the longitudinal angle of the location. So there is no trade across longitudes
with the same latitude. Let Hi (`; t) denote the stock of excess supply of product i between latitudes
0 and ` after summing over all longitudes. De…ne Hi (`; t) by Hi (0; t) = 0 and by the di¤erential
equation
                  2                                                                                            3

                                                                                                                                  (15)

                                              Hi ( =2; t) = 0 for all i and t:

  The supply of energy in the world is given exogenously by E S (e(t)) = '1 e(t)'2 for 0 > '2 > 1:
Note that, even though we assume an upward sloping supply, we abstract from any energy extraction
costs, and so all revenue from selling oil is rebated to agents as explained when discussing the
consumer problem in (1). Hence, market clearing in the energy sector implies


                                      EA (t) + EM (t) = E S (e(t)) for all t:                                    (16)

un such that:

      Agents solve the consumption problem in (1).

      Agents locate optimally, so (2) is satis…ed.

      Firms maximize pro…ts by choosing L
      bid rent, Ri , that solves (11).

      Land is assigned to the industry that values it the most, so if max fRA (`; t) ; RM (`; t)g =
      Ri (`; t), then   i (`; t)   = 1:

      Goods markets clear, so Hi is given by (15) and Hi ( =2; t) = 0:

      The worldwide energy market clears, so (16) is satis…ed.

      The labor market in each country clears so (17) is satis…ed.

      Technology Zi satis…es (3) and technology becomes ^ i Zi when a location innovates.

      Temperature T is determined by (5).

                                               3. CALIBRATION


  The calibration strategy assigns parameter values so that the model matches certain key obser-
vations or predictions on climate change. Table 1 lists the parameter values and brie‡y explains
how they were assigned. We now discuss our choices in some more detail.
  The preference parameters that determine the weights of agriculture and manufacturing in the
CES utility function, hA and hM , are set to match an initial employment share in agriculture of
35% (WDI, World Bank). For the elasticity of substitution between agriculture and manufacturing,
we follow Yi and Zhang (2011) and choose a value of 0.5. Having an elasticity of substitution less
than one implies that the sector with higher productivity growth loses employment relative to the
other sector.
  The technology parameters require us to choose the factor shares of labor and energy in agri-
culture and manufacturing. Estimates of labor shares vary between 0.45 and 0.7 (Valentinyi and
Herrendorf, 2008; Herrendorf and Valentinyi, 2012). Gollin et al. (2012) argue that, though some-
what higher in manufacturing, labor shares cannot be too di¤erent in both sectors. If not, this
would lead to large di¤erences in aggregate labor shares across poor and rich countries. Given that
such di¤erences are absent, we choose labor shares to be the same in both sectors and set them
equal to 0.6. Estimates for the factor share of energy in agriculture come from Schnepf (2004),
who estimates a …gure of 0.05 for the United States. In developing countries the share is likely to
be somewhat smaller (FAO, 2011), so we use a value of 0.04. In manufacturing, the International
Energy Agency (2007) gives a …gure of the energy cost as a share of the production cost of between
0.03 and 0.12, depending on the country. Taking an average, we use a value of 0.07.
  The energy supply depends on its price. Using data from 1974 to 2004, Krichene (2005) estimates
a long-run price elasticity of crude oil supply of 0.23 and a similar …gure of 0.21 for natural gas.
Brook et al. (2004) review several studies and …nd numbers ranging from 0.1 to 0.58. Based on
these di¤erent studies, we set the price elasticity of energy supply, J2 , to 0.25.8
  For the transportation cost parameter, we rely on Ramondo and Rodriguez-Clare (2012), who
assume that           `r   > 1 units must be shipped over a distance j`           rj for 1 unit to arrive, where
       = 1+       +                                              j` rj
 `r           0        dist j`   rj=1000: Since in our model e           must be shipped for 1 unit to arrive, we
   8
     The energy supply function, J1 eJ2 , also includes a parameter J1 . In the calibration we set J1 to 10,000,000 but
its value does not qualitatively a¤ect any of the results.

policy exercises we will analyze the e¤ect of other trade costs paid only at borders, such as tari¤s,
that would bring average trade costs closer to their estimates.
  For technology di¤usion, Comin, Dmitriev and Rossi-Hansberg (2012) analyze the adoption of
20 major technologies in 161 countries over the last 140 years. The median of their distance decay
parameter gives a value of 1.5.9 Given that their estimates are based on distances of 1000 kilometers,
this corresponds to a value of 0.0015 in our context, and so we set our                             parameter equal to this
value.10
  For the link between temperature and productivity, our model assumes a quadratic relationship.
Agronomists have estimated such quadratic relations between temperature and crop yields. Le
(2010) gives estimates for corn, cotton, soybean and sorghum for the U.S., whereas Lobell and Burke
(2010) analyze maize in sub-Saharan Africa. Of these di¤erent estimates, we take the average of the
minimum and maximum optimal temperatures (21.1 centigrade) and the minimum and maximum
temperatures at which implied yields become zero (9.4 centigrade and 32.9 centigrade). Using these
three restrictions, and assuming a quadratic function between temperature and productivity, we
solve out for the constant gA0 , the linear coe¢ cient gA1 and the quadratic coe¢ cient gA2 .
  No similar studies exist for the relation between temperature and the level of output in manu-
facturing.11 In the absence of such a relation, the model would predict too many people living in
arctic latitudes, specializing in manufacturing. However, in reality this is not the case. To see this,
we use detailed geographic data on population for 2000 from the LandScan database (Oak Ridge
National Laboratory, 2001) and split up the world by latitude into 1000 bands of 9.6 kilometers
   9
     We exclude Rail-line Kms from the calculation of the median since the model in Comin, Dimitriev and Rossi-
Hansberg (2012) …ts that technology badly. Including it would yield a median of 1.3.
  10
     Technology di¤usion is modeled in a slightly di¤erent way in Comin et al. (2012), so their parameter estimates are
not strictly comparable to ours. In their setup, adoption of a new technology depends on the probability of someone
in location r meeting someone in location ` who has already adopted, where the probability of meeting declines with
distance. Taking a more literal interpretation and transforming their estimates into what they imply for our estimates
would give values for between 0.0012 and 0.0024, similar to the 0.0015 value used in our benchmark exercise.
  11
     Dell, Jones and Olken (2012) provide estimates of the impact of temperature change on sectoral growth, but not
of the relation between temperature and sectoral output.

each (corresponding to 0.087 arc-degrees).12 For each band we then calculate the population as
a share of the world’s population. Finally, since our model focuses on one hemisphere, we sum
up southern and northern latitudes. Figure 1 shows the results by depicting population share by
latitude, smoothed using an Epanechnikov kernel and including the 95% con…dence intervals. As
can be seen, the share of the world’s population living above the 66th parallel (corresponding to the
Arctic Circle in the Northern Hemisphere) is close to zero. We therefore set the relation between
temperature and manufacturing output to match this lower share of population living in arctic
latitudes. The calibrated coe¢ cients gM 0 , gM 1 and gM 2 imply an optimal temperature for manu-
facturing production of 17.3 centigrade (compared to 21.1 in agriculture). In addition, the relation
between temperature and productivity is also much ‡atter than in agriculture: positive productiv-
ity occurs over a range spanning -3 to 38 degrees centigrade (compared to a range spanning 9.4 to
32.9 degrees in agriculture).

  In reality the share of oceans changes with latitude, whereas in the model it does not. As a
result, one reason why the share of population in Figure 1 varies with latitude may be the varying
share of oceans. To make sure this is not driving the results, we compute the population density
by latitude by taking the total population within a latitudinal band and dividing it by total land
area of that latitudinal band. As can be seen in Figure 2, the overall picture is very similar, so this
  12
     The 1000 bands of 0.087 arc-degrees do not add up to 90 degrees, because the most northern and southern
latitudes are dropped, as no one lives there.

  The lower optimal temperature and the smaller sensitivity of productivity to temperature in
manufacturing imply that lower latitudes will mainly specialize in agriculture, and higher latitudes
will mostly produce manufactured goods. The data counterpart requires us to look at trade patterns
by latitude. To do so, we use sectoral trade data for 2000 from the NBER-United Nations Trade
Data (Feenstra et al., 2005) and compute net agricultural trade by country.13 We take a fairly
restrictive de…nition of agriculture, focusing mainly on crops, since they are the ones to which
our temperature - yield relation applies.14 We then split up the world into 100 latitudinal bands
and assign each country’s net agricultural trade to the di¤erent latitudinal bands proportional to
the country’s population share living within the di¤erent latitudinal bands. Figure 3 depicts net
agricultural exports at di¤erent latitudes.
  As can be seen, the area located between the 30th and the 50th parallel specializes in agricul-
ture. This corresponds, roughly speaking, to the regions from northern Mexico to southern Canada,
North Africa to Central Europe, northern India to Kazakhstan, and southern Brazil to southern Ar-
  13
     Because not all countries have balanced trade, net agricultural exports are de…ned as (exports of agricultural -
imports of agricultural goods) - (exports of non-agricultural goods - imports of non-agricultural goods).
  14
     In particular, we de…ne agriculture as SITC2 codes 04 (cereals and cereal preparations), 05 (vegetables and
fruit), 06 (sugars, sugar preparations and honey), 07 (co¤ee, tea, cocoa, spices and manufactures thereof), 08 (feeding
stu¤ for animals ), 09 (miscellaneous edible products and preparations), 11 (beverages), 12 (tobacco and tobacco
manufactures). Using a broader de…nition that includes animals and animal products does not qualitatively change
the picture.

gentina. Further away from the 50th parallel toward the polar regions, countries specialize mainly
in manufacturing. In two areas net agricultural trade is close to zero. In the region going from
the Equator to the 30th parallel, the main reason is the absence of a pronounced pattern of spe-
cialization, though there is a slight bias toward manufacturing. The other region with agricultural
trade close to zero goes from the Arctic Circle (66th parallel) to the pole: in that region special-
ization continues to be in non-agricultural activities, but because of very low population density,
the volume of trade is close to zero. To see this, we compute net agricultural exports as a share of
GDP by latitude by dividing total net agricultural exports within a latitudinal band by total GDP
within that same latitudinal band.15 Figure 4 clearly shows an area of agriculture at intermediate
latitudes, an area of manufacturing at higher latitudes, and a less pronounced area of specialization
at equatorial latitudes.
  In our benchmark calibration the initial distribution of agricultural and manufacturing TFP
as a function of latitude, ZM (`; 0) and ZA (`; 0), will match the two main areas of specialization,
an agricultural area at lower latitudes and a manufacturing area at higher latitudes. As for the
equatorial region, which in the data shows a weak tendency toward manufacturing specialization,
it will arise as a third area in our numerical experiments as the world’s temperature increases and
agricultural productivity declines at the Equator.
  15
     We calculate GDP by latitude in an analogous way as trade by latitude by assigning a country’s GDP to the
di¤erent latitudinal bands proportional to the country’s population share living within the di¤erent latitudinal bands.
Data on GDP are for 2000 and come from the World Bank WDI.

  Innovation costs are set to match output growth in agriculture and manufacturing. Given that in
our model population is constant, our focus is on output per capita. Using real GDP and population
data from the Penn World Tables (PWT 7.0, 2011), we compute annual growth in real GDP per
capita in the world economy from 1950 and 2000 and …nd a …gure of 2%. Of course, the growth
rate may be di¤erent across agriculture and manufacturing. However, this does not seem to be the
case. Using data from Duarte and Restuccia (2010), we compare growth in value added per worker
in both sectors in a sample of 30 countries. For the period 1950-2000 we …nd very similar growth
rates in both sectors.16 We therefore assume the same annual output growth rate of 2% in both
sectors when matching the innovation costs.
  The evolution of the total stock of pollutants depends on the stock of pollutants in the previous
period and on the emissions of the previous period, P (t + 1) = "1 P (t) + "2 EA (t) + EM (t) .
Because of the carbon cycle, some of the carbon concentration in the atmosphere moves to the
upper ocean, and some of the carbon concentration in the upper ocean moves to the atmosphere.
In the absence of new emissions, the estimates of the carbon cycle in the RICE model of Nordhaus
(2010) imply a net reduction of carbon in the atmosphere by 0.25% every year. This corresponds
  16
    In particular, we …nd a growth rate of 4% in agricultural productivity and of 4.2% in manufacturing. These
numbers are substantially higher than the 2% growth in real output per capita in the world economy. The di¤erence
may be partly due to the much smaller sample in Duarte and Restuccia (2010), who do not have data on, for example,
any African country. From Duarte and Restuccia (2010) we therefore simply conclude that productivity growth rates
are similar in both sectors.




                                                                                        23
to a value for "1 equal to 0.9975. As for the emissions intensity parameter, "2 , it is set to match
the predicted increase in carbon in the atmosphere by 800 gigatons of carbon (GTC) by 2100
(Nordhaus, 2010). This yields a value of "2 = 0:00000137.17
  The Earth’s temperature obviously declines from the Equator to the poles, but the di¤erence
is expected to become smaller as a result of global warming. The parameters in the temperature
                                                 2
function, T (`; t) = T (`; 0) +       1P   (t)       (1   3T   (`; 0)), are calibrated to match the di¤erence in
temperatures between the Equator and the North Pole as a function of di¤erent levels of pollution.
In particular, for P = 0 we set the temperature at the Equator to 28 degrees, corresponding to
the average temperature in Singapore during the growing season (May-September), and in the
North Pole at 0 degrees, corresponding to the average temperature in Dikson (Russia) during the
growing season (May-September). Note that we focus on the growing seasons, since they are the
relevant ones for the agricultural production function.18 Predictions are that by 2100 the stock of
carbon will increase by 800 GTC and that the temperature at the Equator will increase by around
2 degrees and at the North Pole by around 6 degrees (IPCC, 2007).19 We use these predictions, in
addition to the current temperatures by latitude, to calibrate our temperature function. Obviously,
many di¤erent scenarios exist about the future warming of the planet. The numerical exercises will
explore some of these di¤erent scenarios.20
  In the model we keep the world population constant at 7 billion. Clearly, climate change will
depend on the evolution of the world population. However, given that there may be important feed-
back mechanisms between climate change and population growth, we abstract from these changes
and leave this issue for future research.


       4. BENCHMARK SCENARIOS AND THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE


  The numerical examples we present compute an equilibrium for 200 years. In this section we
focus on explaining the basic forces at work in the model. We will consider di¤erent scenarios
  17
     Note that a gigaton of carbon is equivalent to 3.667 gigatons of CO2 .
  18
     Clearly, when considering the e¤ect of temperature on manufacturing productivity, there is no reason to focus on
the growing season. However, since the temperature-productivity relationship in manufacturing has been calibrated
to match the lower share of population living at arctic latitudes, assuming di¤erent initial temperatures would simply
lead to a di¤erent calibration of that relationship, without a¤ecting the results.
  19
     Note that the IPCC predicts a much lower increase at the South Pole than at the North Pole, of 2.75 degrees,
rather than of 6 degrees. However, since only 13% of the world’s population lives in the Southern Hemisphere, our
baseline calibration will focus on the temperature changes in the Northern Hemisphere.
  20
     Throughout we report and discuss values of 1 that have been divided by 1000=( =2) since in all numerical
simulations we divide space in 1000 intervals of latitudes between 0 and =2: This yields 1 = 0:0003394 which we
round to 1 = 0:0003.




                                                           24
of temperature increases and will therefore do a number of counterfactual exercises modifying
the value of   1,   the parameter in equation (5) that determines the relation between the stock
of pollutants and temperature. Our benchmark exercise assumes          1   = 0:0003, which implies an
increase in temperature after 100 years of about 2 degrees at the Equator and 6 degrees at the
poles. Throughout this section we assume free mobility of people across locations.
  We choose initial productivity functions ZM (`; t) = 0:8 + 0:4`=90 and ZA (`; t) = 1:2     0:4`=90,
so that locations close to the Equator have a comparative advantage in agriculture and locations
close to the North Pole have a comparative advantage in manufacturing. These initial productivity
functions, together with the relation between temperature and productivity, gA ( ) and gM ( ),
determine the specialization pattern across the globe, as illustrated in the top-right panel of Figure
5. The horizontal axis represents time (200 years, going from 2000 to 2200), and the vertical axis
represents latitudes in degrees (going from the Equator, at 0 degrees, to the pole, at 90 degrees).
The red areas specialize in agriculture and the blue ones in manufacturing.
  Over time, as the stock of pollution grows and temperature in the world increases, northern lati-
tudes gain in terms of agricultural productivity, relative to equatorial latitudes, making the region
that specializes in agriculture gradually expand northward. As shown by the green curve in Figure
6, initially this leads to a higher manufacturing price, which is eventually counterbalanced by in-
creasing relative productivity growth in manufacturing. The increase in pollution and temperature
is shown in Figures 7 and 8. Once again, the benchmark case is represented by the green curves.
As can be seen, the stock of pollution increases by 800 GTC in the …rst 100 years and reaches more
than 2000 GTC after 200 years. The increase in temperature by the year 2200 is about 4 degrees
at the Equator and more than 8 degrees at the pole.
  These changes are accompanied by an important redistribution of people across latitudes. The
black-dotted and green lines in Figure 9 present the distribution of population (or employment)
by latitudes in the initial year, as well as 100 and 200 years later, respectively. The initial hump
shape matches the observed distribution in Figure 1. Over time there is a tremendous increase
in population concentration. The world forms two clusters, one in the south, around the 30th
parallel, specialized in agriculture, and one in the north, around the 50th parallel, specialized in
manufacturing. The Equator and the North Pole are essentially empty, as they are either too warm
or too cold to produce e¢ ciently. The concentration of population is the result of free mobility
and scale e¤ects in technological innovation. The location of the clusters at intermediate latitudes
has to do with their higher productivity because of mild temperatures. Over time, these di¤erent

forces interact, creating large clusters of population.
           The role of innovation in the emergence of clusters of specialization requires some further dis-
cussion. In our model geographical concentration of population enhances productivity because the
incentives for local innovation are greater when it bene…ts more people. The higher productivity in
turn attracts more people, implying a circular causality that leads to the concentration of economic
activity. This process is weakened by congestion coming from the decreasing returns in output per
unit of land (1               i       i   > 0 all i). Still, in spite of the relatively large share of land, around one
third in both sectors, the decreasing returns are not strong enough to stem the emergence of dense
areas of specialization. These clusters are highly innovative, sustaining the rate of output growth of
2% to which we calibrate. The evolution of TFP in both sectors is represented by the green curves

e¤ect of temperature. Productivity in both sectors grows almost at exactly the same rate. As a
result, the employment share in agriculture stays essentially constant over time, as does its area of
specialization. We present the agricultural employment share in Figure 11.

     The resulting equilibrium increases current utility throughout the 200 years under study, as
illustrated by the green curve in Figure 12. Remember that all agents obtain identical utility
given free mobility and uniform ownership of land. Hence, in our calibrated exercise, the e¤ect of
innovation dominates the e¤ect of temperature: A direct implication of our choice to calibrate the
innovation parameters to obtain a per capita income growth of 2% per year. Still, if we were to
abstract from the e¤ect of temperature on productivity (                                                                                                                  1   = 0) to do the calibration, the e¤ect
would be very similar, since for levels of                                                       1   between 0 and the calibrated value of 0.0003, the e¤ect
of    1   on output per capita growth is minimal. Global warming has important implications for
the spatial pattern of specialization but a relatively small e¤ect on utility unless we go to extreme
scenarios, as discussed below. The economy adjusts in an e¢ cient way to accommodate global

warming. Of course, in this paper we exclusively focus on the e¤ect of temperature on productivity
and leave aside other reasons why temperature could lead to lower levels of well-being.
  The benchmark equilibrium described above considers a moderate scenario for the e¤ect of pol-
lution on temperature. This e¤ect is governed by our choice of 0.0003 for the parameter                                                          1   in
equation (5). Figures 5 to 12 present equilibria using alternative values of                                                  1,   ranging from 0 (no
e¤ect of temperature on productivity) to 0.0012 (extreme e¤ect of pollution on temperature). As
mentioned before, the calibrated value of                                       1   = 0:0003 corresponds to estimates of what the increase
in temperature will be by 2100. The e¤ect of this parameter can be most easily appreciated in
Figure 8. The benchmark value of                                      1   = 0:0003 implies that temperature increases at the North Pole
by 8 degrees over a period of 200 years, whereas the extreme scenario of                                                  1   = 0:012 would imply a
corresponding increase of 30 degrees. While unlikely to occur, these extreme counterfactuals help
to illustrate the e¤ect temperature has in our model.
  As already mentioned, when comparing the benchmark case (                                                   1   = 0:0003) to the case in which
we ignore the e¤ect of temperature on productivity (                                            1   = 0), global warming seems to have a
limited e¤ect. The most relevant di¤erence relates to where the two clusters of specialization

emerge. As can be seen from comparing the green curves to the blue curves in Figure 9, the two
clusters of specialization emerge about 10 degrees more north when taking into account the e¤ect
of temperature (                         1   = 0:0003) compared to when temperature has no e¤ect (                    1   = 0). Further
increasing                1   to 0.0006 enhances the e¤ect of pollution on temperature, pushing both clusters even
further north. Similarly, Figure 5 shows that the greater                                  1,   the more agriculture moves to northern
latitudes. As the e¤ect of temperature on productivity increases and the ideal location to produce
agriculture shifts north, the comparative advantage of the south changes. The equatorial regions
become too warm for agriculture and start specializing in manufacturing. But this does not give
rise to the emergence of a new high-density manufacturing cluster, as few people end up living
in these equatorial latitudes. As can be seen from Figure 9, the spatial distribution continues
to be characterized by two clusters, one in agriculture and another in manufacturing. Higher
values of           1     increase the size of the agricultural cluster and decrease the size of the manufacturing
cluster. This happens because higher values of                                     1   imply a bigger rise in temperature and thus
a greater dampening of productivity growth in agriculture (Figure 10). Given an elasticity of
substitution between agriculture and manufacturing of less than one, this leads to a larger increase



                                                                              31
in the agricultural employment share (Figure 11) and a drop in the relative price of manufacturing
(Figure 6).
  Except for the extreme temperature scenario (             1   = 0:0012), the e¤ect of global warming on
utility is limited (Figure 12). Furthermore, the e¤ect need not be monotone: starting o¤ with no
change in temperature (    1    = 0), increasing global warming initially raises utility (   1   = 0:0003) but
then lowers it (for values of    1   greater than 0.0006). This illustrates that, depending on a location’s
initial temperature, global warming may increase or decrease its productivity. For moderate levels
of global warming, the higher productivity in northern regions more than compensates the lower
productivity in equatorial regions, and welfare improves. For higher temperature increases, the
losses in equatorial latitudes start to dominate, and welfare decreases.
  Figures 5 and 9 help us better understand why the e¤ect of global warming on productivity and
utility is generally limited. The increase in temperature relocates economic activity and people
across latitudes. Essentially, the level of temperatures determines whether the manufacturing
cluster will be at the 40th parallel, the 50th parallel, or the 60th parallel. Within the range of
expected temperature increases over the next two centuries, the world has enough ‡exibility to
limit the overall e¤ect of climate change by relocating production and people. This …nding is
subject to a number of important caveats. First, in our model the world population does not
increase. If the overall world population were to grow, then the possibility of …tting a greater share
of the world population in the most desirable latitudes would be more limited. Second, we are
ignoring any costs related to the relocation of people and activities. In the next section we will
analyze the impact of mobility restrictions. Third, while in the next 200 years the e¤ect of global
warming may be limited, in the very long run it will lead to disaster. As the world continues to
warm, agricultural production will be shifting further north, eventually reaching the North Pole.
At that point it can no longer adjust by relocating. Further temperature increases will then lead
to agricultural productivity going to zero, implying the end of human life on earth. Although our
analysis has focused on only 200 years, we get a ‡avor of this disastrous outcome when setting                1

to the extremely high value of 0.0012. In that case agricultural productivity would start declining,
as innovation no longer compensates the negative impact of temperature increase (Figure 11).
Likewise, utility would stop increasing and start going down (Figure 12).
  To summarize the e¤ect of global warming on the equilibrium of our model, we present in
Figure 13 a comparison between the case of no e¤ect of pollution on temperature (                  1   = 0) and
the case of extreme e¤ects of pollution on temperature (            1   = 0:0012). The …gure shows contour

  Focus …rst on the e¤ect of temperature increases on the location of the world’s employment
clusters (…rst row). When pollution has no e¤ect on temperature, two clusters emerge, one spe-
cializing in agriculture around the 20th parallel and a second specializing in manufacturing around
the 45th parallel. In contrast, when   1   = 0:0012, the formation of the employment clusters changes
dramatically. Now the largest cluster is in agriculture, and it progressively moves north as tem-
perature continues to rise. The manufacturing cluster still forms, but it is also pushed northward,
and becomes less dense. This happens partly because the equatorial regions start producing more
manufactured goods (Figure 5) and partly because the drop in agricultural productivity implies
that a larger share of the population is employed in agriculture (Figure 11).
  The e¤ect of global warming on productivity di¤ers dramatically across sectors (Figure 13, second
and third row). In manufacturing, higher temperatures do not seem to have a negative impact on
manufacturing productivity growth; it simply moves innovation further north. In equatorial regions,
in spite of switching to manufacturing, there is no productivity increase. Rising temperatures and
a lack of innovation keep the south’s manufacturing technology backward. In agriculture, rising
temperatures have a more dramatic e¤ect. They initially lead to an increase in productivity, but
eventually the negative impact of global warming dominates the investments in innovation, and
overall productivity declines. As a result, the employment share in agriculture shoots up to more
than 80% by the end of the 200-year period.
  The comparisons in Figure 13 show the delicate balance between migration, technological inno-
vation, and the e¤ect of temperature. They illustrate an extreme comparison. While the actual
calibrated e¤ect of global warming is much smaller, the direction of the change is similar. The
agricultural cluster shifts north, without the manufacturing cluster moving south because of the
north’s accumulated technological advantage in that sector. At the same time, productivity growth
in agriculture becomes relatively harder, as it su¤ers more from temperature increases than man-
ufacturing.
  As we argued above, a key reason why the economy responds well to global warming in the
calibrated version of the model has to do with the free mobility of people and goods. If these ‡ows
of people and goods were not possible or were restricted, the e¤ects of global warming are likely to
change. In the next section we explore the impact of such restrictions.

                        5. MIGRATION AND TRADE RESTRICTIONS


  To analyze how migration restrictions a¤ect the economic impact of global warming, we set a
border between the north and the south at the 45th parallel. In 2000 around 90% of the world pop-
ulation lived between the Equator and the 45th parallel (adding both hemispheres). We therefore
split the world population of 7 billion and allocate 6 billion to the south (the region between the
Equator and the 45th parallel) and 1 billion to the north (the region between the 45th parallel and
the pole). We allow people to move freely within each region but not across regions. This implies
that all agents in the south have the same utility, as do all agents in the north, but southern and
northern agents will have di¤erent utility levels.21

  In Table 2 we present the value of consumer welfare (the maximum value of the objective in
(1)) for a discount factor of        = 0:95.22 The top panel reports welfare in the case of free mobility
  21
     In order not to a¤ect credit markets as well, we maintain the assumption that all agents in the world hold a
diversi…ed portfolio of the same size of all land in the world. Of course, in the presence of migration restrictions if
we were to allow agents to choose their portfolio optimally, they might decide to trade some of it.
  22
     Note that the value of did not play a role before, since all decisions of …rms and agents end up being static.
However, the value of is essential in determining the value of consumer welfare. Many of the studies on climate
change choose somewhat higher discount factors. Nordhaus (2010) and Golosov et al. (2011), for example, use a
discount factor of 0.985, whereas Stern (2006) uses an even higher 0.999. We assess below the sensitivity of our results


                                                          35
for di¤erent values of               1.    This corresponds to the exercise in the previous section. The middle
panel reports welfare when we impose migration restrictions. It distinguishes between welfare in
the north, welfare in the south, average welfare, and relative welfare. It also computes percentage
changes and di¤erences, relative to the case where pollution has no e¤ect on temperature (                1   = 0).
The bottom panel reports the same information but adds a 20% trade barrier between north and
south.
  Migration restrictions bene…t the north, and more so when the e¤ect of pollution on temperature
is large. The reason is straightforward. As temperature rises, the north becomes a relatively better
place to produce. When there is free mobility, this attracts southern migrants, and wages drop.
Now no migrants from the south can enter, and so agents in the north maintain their higher wages.
In contrast, agents in the south lose from global warming. The loss is minimal when                  1   is small,
but the e¤ect grows as                 1   increases. There are two countervailing e¤ects. On the one hand, by
not allowing migration, the concentration of people in the south is larger, making them innovate
more. This leads to faster growth and higher welfare for southern agents. On the other hand,
agents cannot move out of the south, resulting in welfare losses.23 When pollution has no e¤ect on
temperature (         1   = 0), both e¤ects balance out, making the migration restrictions almost welfare
neutral (a 0:24% decline in welfare or in aggregate consumption given that utility is linear). The
total e¤ect could very well have been positive. Because di¤usion is an externality, the equilibrium in
this economy is not Pareto optimal, and so migration restrictions could potentially enhance welfare.
When we increase               1   and the e¤ect of pollution on temperature becomes larger, the negative e¤ects
of global warming in the south start dominating the positive agglomeration e¤ects. For example, in
the case of   1   = 0:0009, southern agents obtain 5% lower welfare than if pollution and temperature
were unrelated, and 5.2% less welfare than in the case of free mobility.
  The implication of Table 2 is that global warming ampli…es inequality between northern and
southern agents when there are migration restrictions. Relative welfare goes from 90% when                    1   =0
to 79% when       1   = 0:0009. Migration restrictions also amplify the overall e¤ect of global warming on
welfare by hindering the natural adjustment of specialization and migration patterns. For example,
when increasing            1   from 0.0006 to 0.0009, average welfare decreases by around 3% when there
are mobility restrictions, whereas it remains essentially unchanged when there is free mobility.
This implies that in the benchmark case of the previous section, it was mobility that prevented
global warming from having important welfare e¤ects. In this sense global warming and mobility
to higher discount factors.
  23
     The border introduces an initial welfare di¤erence in period 1 of 20% in favor of the north.

restrictions complement each other, leading to larger negative e¤ects from pollution.
  To see how migration restrictions change the clustering of people, compare Figure 14, which
shows employment shares at each of the 1000 locations in our grid, and Figure 9, which shows the
same information for the case of free mobility. Recall that the migration restriction is imposed
at the 45th parallel, which is marked with a vertical line in the graph. The black dotted line
indicates employment shares in period 1, common to all values of                      1.   The …gure also reports
employment shares for         1   = 0 and    1   = 0:0006, 100 and 200 years later. Over time employment
concentrates in two clusters. In the absence of any e¤ect of pollution on temperature (                    1   = 0), the
clusters locate around the 20th parallel and the 45th parallel, similar to the case of free mobility in
Figure 9. When       1   increases to 0.0006, the higher temperature in the south pushes the agricultural
cluster to the 35th parallel, but the manufacturing cluster remains stuck at the border. This
stands in sharp contrast to the case of free mobility in Figure 9, where for the same value of                         1

manufacturing had moved much further north, close to the 60th parallel. In other words, because
of the mobility restrictions, the manufacturing cluster remains stuck at the border, and global
warming has no impact on the cluster’s location. This is especially striking in the north, where
there is no perceptible di¤erence in the distribution of population after 100 years and after 200
years. Although technology continues to change (as do prices, etc.), for all practical purposes
people in the north stop moving. The north gains from global warming because its trade partners
move closer (the two clusters move closer together) and because technology to produce in the north
is now better due to the increase in temperature. The south also gains from the trade e¤ect but
loses due to the negative e¤ect of global warming on its productivity.
  The apparent importance of these trade e¤ects suggests that trade frictions at the border might
also interact in relevant ways with the e¤ect of pollution. The bottom panel in Table 2 presents
another exercise where, on top of migration restrictions, we impose a trade barrier of 20% at the
border. This barrier leads to a discontinuous increase in the price of the good that is crossing the
border.24 Furthermore, it is of the iceberg type and involves a real cost in terms of resources. Not
surprisingly, the trade barrier reduces welfare both in the north and in the south for all values of

 1.   However, since the e¤ects of global warming on northern welfare rely heavily on the fact that
the southern clusters move closer to the northern border and the resulting increase in trade, the
north su¤ers more from the new trade friction. The relative well-being in the south still deteriorates
   24
      Note the di¤erence between the transport costs governed by and this barrier. One applies continuously in space
since it is costly to transport goods across any two locations. The other applies only at the border and so it is a cost
of exporting goods. In setups without space these two costs are indistinguishable.

with global warming but less than before. That is, the south loses more than before from global
warming, but it is less worse o¤ relative to the north.
  The exercise with migration restrictions as well as trade frictions at the border illustrates how
trade policy can ameliorate some of the redistributive e¤ects of global warming across the north
and south but only at the cost of making everyone worse o¤. This e¤ect would be mitigated if
the trade barrier did not involve an actual loss in resources. In that case the tari¤ would make
southerners better o¤ for low values of                               1,    even though the loss of northern welfare would still
imply a loss in average welfare.
  We have set the border arbitrarily at the 45th parallel. The importance of migration and trade
frictions depends on the location of this border and, in particular, on the location of this border
relative to the two large population clusters. To check the robustness of our results to the location
of the border we calculate the same exercises with the border at the 40th and 60th parallels (we
attribute population proportionally across countries in the segment that is added to the north or
south respectively). The results are qualitatively the same. In particular, global warming has
larger welfare costs in the presence of migration restrictions and the larger the e¤ect of carbon



                                                                                  38
on temperature, the larger the impact of migration restrictions.25 These additional results also
uncover a new pattern. Namely, the more to the north the border, the smaller the overall costs of
global warming. For example, with           1   = 0:0006, the average welfare gain/loss relative to the case
with   1   = 0:0003 is 0.3% with the border at 60 , -0.6% with the border at 45 and -1.1% with the
border at 40 . Of course, if we go to           1   = 0:0009 even with the border at 60 latitude we get a
welfare loss of -1.1%. A border further north bene…ts a few northerners, but also allows southern
agents to cluster in parallels with cooler temperatures in higher latitudes (and so southern utility
relative to northern utility grows).
  In the welfare comparison in Table 2 we use a value of               equal to 0.95. Given that this economy
exhibits growth over time and many of the e¤ects we have discussed are dynamic, the magnitude
of the temporal discount is important. For example, the positive growth e¤ect generated by the
concentration of people in the south that we highlighted above plays a larger role in welfare when
the discount factor is closer to one and so agents discount the future less. To show this, in Table
3 we redo the welfare calculations using a value of            of 0.98. The positive agglomeration e¤ect of
the migration restriction now dominates the negative e¤ect of global warming on the south and
so both the northern and southern agents gain from the migration restrictions. In other words,
even though southern agents would have a static incentive to move to the north, it would be better
for them to stay put. All other relative comparisons between north and south remain unchanged
though. The south still loses from global warming relative to the north, and the e¤ect is weaker
in the presence of trade barriers. As we discussed in the previous section, global warming can be
welfare increasing for low values of       1.   This is the case for values of   1   = 0:0003 in Table 2 and for
values of    1   up to 0:0006 in Table 3. However, once          1   is high enough so that global warming is
welfare decreasing, the presence of migration frictions again ampli…es the e¤ect of global warming.
For example, if      1   = 0:0009 rather than 0:0006, welfare with labor mobility declines by 7.0% but
it declines by 9.3% with migration restrictions.
  To further illustrate how mobility frictions amplify the impact of global warming, we now compare
the two extreme cases of free migration across all locations and no migration across any location.
While assuming that people cannot move at all, not even locally, over a period of two centuries
is admittedly unrealistic, it serves the purpose of highlighting that the economic cost of climate
change is mainly due to mobility frictions. To make the comparison between both extremes as sharp
as possible, we exclusively focus on migration frictions, and therefore set transportation costs to
  25
    In fact, average welfare seems to peak with a border close to intermediate latitudes, with average welfare going
from 0.731 to 0.732 and then to 0.727 as we change the border from latitude 40 to 45 and to 60 , respectively.

zero. In the no migration case we start the economy with the distribution of people across locations
from the …rst period of the equilibrium with free migration, and do not let anyone move over the
200 years of the analysis.26 This will obviously lead to utility di¤erences across locations. To make
welfare comparisons with the perfect mobility case, we take the utilitarian view, and compute the
population-weighted average utility across all locations.
  Figure 15 shows the discounted sum of utility across di¤erent latitudes, comparing the no migra-
tion case with the free migration case under two scenarios: no change in temperature (              1   = 0) and
extreme change in temperature (        1   = 0:0009). When there is free mobility, the di¤erence between
the two solid lines indicates that climate change lowers welfare (or consumption) by 0.38%. The
same comparison when there is no mobility, given by the di¤erence between the two dashed lines,
reveals a welfare cost of 5.38%, more than an order of magnitude larger than in the free mobility
case. Hence, in the absence of migration restrictions global warming essentially has no impact, but
when people are unable to move the e¤ect is substantial.
  So far we have assessed the welfare cost of no migration focusing on population-weighted averages.
  26
    We smooth out the distribution using a Hodrick-Prescott …lter with parameter 1000000 to avoid kinks (we use a
grid of 1000 points), facilitate computations, and bring the distribution closer to the empirical distribution.

The impact of the lack of mobility is even more dramatic when we look at welfare di¤erences across
latitudes. This is represented by the two thick solid curves in Figure 15. In the absence of climate
change, intermediate latitudes, between the 30th and 60th parallels, gain relative to the case with
mobility, whereas equatorial and polar latitudes lose. The welfare di¤erence between winners and
losers is around 20%. In the presence of climate change, these di¤erences are hugely ampli…ed, with
welfare in the polar regions being more than twice that of equatorial regions.27 In most latitudes
the impact of global warming depends crucially on whether people can move or not. However, this
is not the case for intermediate latitudes: locations around the 45th parallel are hardly a¤ected
by global warming, independently of whether we allow for migration or not. The 45th parallel
passes through the Northern United States, Southern France, Northern Italy, Northern China and
Northern Japan. The model suggests that those regions of the world should be largely indi¤erent
to the e¤ects of climate change. This also implies that global warming will lead to increased
migratory pressure from the regions below the 45th parallel north to those above the 45th parallel
north. This explains our choice of setting the border at that particular latitude in our initial exercise
  27
    In Figure 15, the kinks in the curves representing welfare for the no mobility case are associated with changes in
specialization that are ampli…ed by di¤erent innovation rates across industries.

                    6. ENERGY TAXES AND INNOVATION SUBSIDIES


     In this section we explore the impact of energy taxes and innovation subsidies and how the
e¤ect of these taxes interacts with global warming. The competitive equilibrium of our economy
is not Pareto e¢ cient due to two distinct externalities. First, technology di¤uses across locations,
and second, economic activity at one location a¤ects the global stock of pollution and therefore the
temperature and the productivity at all locations. So the pollution generated in one location a¤ects
the productivity in all other locations. These two externalities imply that a variety of frictions and
policies can be welfare improving. This is the case for the two policies we analyze in this section.28
     Energy taxes reduce the use of energy and so reduce pollution and global warming. This mech-
anism is well known and operative in our framework. Table 4 presents welfare and the stocks of
carbon (expressed in GTC) after 200 years for di¤erent levels of ad-valorem taxes on energy used by
…rms. The percentage changes presented in the table are all relative to the same economy without
the tax. We rebate the tax to all agents equally so the tax has no wealth e¤ects but it generates
distortions in input use.
     In our model energy use is directly related to pollution and temperature increases. In this
sense, what we call energy is best interpreted as carbon-generated energy. Hence an energy tax in
our context is equivalent to a tax on carbon emissions and should be interpreted as such. Note
that because we are not modeling di¤erent forms of energy generation, energy taxes will not lead to
substitution between energy sources, nor will they lead to energy-saving technological change. Still,
they will lead to Hicks-neutral innovations that will tend to save on all factors, including energy.
     As Table 4 indicates, energy taxes are, in general, welfare improving. This is the case even when

 1   = 0. The reason is that an energy tax makes high-productivity regions relatively better, leading
to more clustering and innovation. This happens because high-productivity locations rely more on
technology and less on inputs, so that the impact of an energy tax is relatively smaller. A 100% tax
increases welfare by 1.2% when          1   = 0, while a 400% tax increases it by 2.9%. Once             1   becomes
positive and pollution increases temperatures, the e¤ect of the tax is larger, the larger is                 1.   With

      Note that the structure of our model allows us to compute a competitive equilibrium but not the planner’s
problem. In the latter case the planner needs to form expectations about the path of the distribution of economic
activity across space. This problem is, as far as we know, intractable and makes solving for the optimal policy in our
framework infeasible.

      While our results suggest that an energy tax could yield welfare gains of between 3% and 5%, Nordhaus (2010)

higher      1,   the greater the e¤ect of pollution on temperature, and so the reduction in energy use
leads to larger welfare gains.30 The amount of energy used decreases with the tax, although the
drop is not always increasing in           1.

     Larger taxes on carbon have marginally smaller e¤ects on welfare. The elasticity of welfare with
respect to the energy tax is positive but declining in the tax and eventually turns negative. For low
values of        1   it turns negative for lower taxes than for large values of      1.   So larger e¤ects of carbon
stocks on temperature justify larger energy taxes. For                  1   = 0:0012 even a tax of 800% results
in a positive elasticity of welfare with respect to the tax. So carbon taxes are clearly bene…cial
in our setup. They promote growth by reducing carbon emissions. It is important not to overdo
them when the e¤ect of pollution on temperature is small. However, even in our benchmark case
of    1   = 0:0003, a 400% tax is justi…ed, although an 800% tax is not.31
…nds a much lower 0.35%. One reason for the larger e¤ect in our model is the presence of externalities, which imply
that energy taxes improve welfare even in the absence of a relation between emissions and temperature.
  30
     Note that even in the absence of taxes, a higher e¤ect of pollution on temperature leads to a reduction in emissions
and so the stock of carbon declines with 1 . This e¤ect is mostly the result of the slowdown in economic activity
associated with temperature increases.
  31
     For comparison purposes, Golosov et al. (2011) …nd an optimal tax of around 50$ per ton of coal using a
discount rate of 0.985. Given the current coal price, this amounts to a tax of around 100%. Nordhaus and Boyer
(2000) compute an optimal tax rate starting around 30% at the beginning of the 21st century, and rising to 180% by
the end of the century.

  Figure 16 focuses on the extreme temperature scenario (          1   = 0:0012) and presents contour plots
of employment shares and agricultural productivity for the case of no tax (top panel), a 200%
tax (middle panel), and an 800% tax (bottom panel). Recall that when discussing Figure 13 we
argued that for the case of     1   = 0:0012 global warming eliminates productivity growth in the
agricultural sector. As can be seen in the top panel, in the absence of a carbon tax, technology
in agriculture regresses. All clusters move far north, and the agricultural cluster becomes much
more important than the manufacturing one in terms of population, as the employment share in
agriculture skyrockets. Once we introduce energy taxes, these phenomena weaken or are delayed
in time. The higher the tax, the less the clusters move north, the larger the manufacturing cluster
remains relative to the agricultural one, and the smaller the technological regress in the agricultural
sector. In fact, for the 200-year period we examine, the technological regress in agriculture turns
to progress when the tax is raised to 800%, an optimal tax in this extreme scenario according to
our calculations.

  We now turn to studying innovation subsidies and how their e¤ect interacts with global warming.
As we discussed above, because technology di¤uses across locations, investments in innovation are
not optimal and so innovation subsidies may raise welfare. Throughout we analyze innovation
subsidies that reduce proportionally the innovation cost of …rms. The subsidies are paid for using
lump-sum taxes charged to all residents so, as with energy taxes, they do not introduce wealth
e¤ects. Of course, innovation subsidies distort innovation decisions and encourage …rms to innovate
more. Table 5 presents computations where we introduce innovation subsidies in both industries.
  Table 5 shows that for subsidies of 20% and 40%, welfare increases for all the alternative values of

                                                     45
 1.   That is, subsidizing innovation is always better than not subsidizing it. Furthermore, the larger
the value of    1,   and so the larger the e¤ect of pollution on temperature, the lower the e¤ect of the
subsidy on welfare when we subsidize both industries. So in contrast with the energy tax analyzed
above, the increase in welfare associated with the policy is smaller, the larger the impact of pollution
on temperature. The contrast is interesting since it underscores the importance of introducing space
in the analysis of the economic e¤ect of temperature increases. Innovation subsidies make …rms
innovate more, which leads to welfare gains, since in equilibrium they do not innovate enough due
to the externality. However, they innovate more in regions that will become too hot in the future
to be e¢ cient for production. That is, as production shifts north, past innovation in the south is
rendered useless. This e¤ect reduces the impact of innovation subsidies and is larger the greater is

 1.

  The economic phenomenon described above is evident when we look at aggregate growth in
each sector. First, it is stronger in agriculture than in manufacturing, since global warming a¤ects
the agricultural sector more. The innovation subsidy always increases aggregate output growth in
both sectors but does so less the higher the impact of carbon on temperature. For                 1   = 0:0012;
the subsidy has no e¤ect on average output growth in agriculture. In this case global warming
completely eliminates 200 years of output growth in agriculture with or without the subsidy.
  To explore this further, Figure 17 presents the time paths of aggregate productivity for the
di¤erent sizes of the subsidies and       1   = 0 and     1   = 0:0012: For   1   = 0 we see that the larger
the subsidy, the larger the growth rate of productivity. In contrast, when               1   = 0:0012, this is
only the case in manufacturing but not in agriculture. In agriculture productivity …rst increases
and then decreases due to global warming: the regress in productivity that we highlighted above.
The innovation subsidy increases the rate of growth in agriculture initially, but this ampli…es the
impact of global warming, leading to productivity that ends up at the same level after 200 years,
independently of the innovation subsidy. In this sense, innovation subsidies do not help ameliorate
the catastrophic e¤ects of global warming. Energy taxes are much more e¤ective for this purpose.


                                              7. CONCLUSION


  This paper provides a framework to analyze the spatial impact of global warming in a dynamic
context. We model a hemisphere of the Earth and calibrate the model using current data and a
variety of projections on temperature and economic growth. Our model is one in which changes
in specialization –induced, for example, by global warming–have long-lasting e¤ects through their

impact on innovation and the resulting local technological improvements. Even though global
warming interacts with specialization patterns and innovation in complex ways, one of its main
e¤ects is to shift production and population to the north as it makes some of these regions warmer.
Since technology is better in the north, in the absence of migration restrictions, temperature change
can lead to small positive welfare e¤ects. So if the impact of pollution on temperature is small, an
economy can gain from temperature change. If, on the other hand, the e¤ect of carbon emissions
on temperature is very large, the welfare cost can be substantial. We …nd that these conclusions are
a¤ected in a signi…cant way by the presence of migration restrictions and other frictions. Hence,
our analysis suggests that part of the policy debate on global warming should focus on addressing
some of these complementary frictions.
  Our model features two externalities. The …rst one is related to technology di¤usion and the
second to energy use and carbon emissions. Due to these two externalities policy can be welfare
enhancing (as can other frictions). We …nd that energy taxes are particularly useful to stop some
of the consequences of global warming. Due to their interaction with specialization patterns and


                                                                                      47
   the corresponding innovation choices, such taxes can lead to positive (though small) growth e¤ects
   and overall welfare gains. Energy taxes also result in large reductions in the stock of carbon,
   which could generate other health and consumption-based bene…ts that are not accounted for in
   our setup. In contrast, innovation subsidies also lead to welfare gains, but they have a more limited
   role in preventing some of the catastrophic e¤ects of global warming in extreme scenarios. This is
   partly because we do not allow for energy-saving technological change or elasticities of substitution
   between inputs in production di¤erent than one. Extending the framework to add any of these two
   policies is a natural next step.
     In presenting our quantitative results, we had to make many choices about the particular exercises
   to present and policies to evaluate. Much more can be done on this front. For example, one could
   introduce location-speci…c policies, where countries at di¤erent latitudes impose di¤erent taxes or
   subsidies. Given the substantial spatial interactions between specialization, innovation, and global
   warming that we uncover, we hope others will help us take on this task in the future.

  APPENDIX: AN ALTERNATIVE CALIBRATION OF THE LINK BETWEEN
                                    EMISSIONS AND TEMPERATURE


  Allen et al. (2009) and Matthews et al. (2009) have shown that the relation between temperature
and cumulative emissions is essentially linear. That is, we can summarize all carbon cycle feedbacks
and climate feedbacks with a simple linear relationship. This is not exactly consistent with the
calibration we use in the main text since we choose                           2   = 0:5 and "1 = 0:9975: A value of "1 6=
1 implies that temperature is a function of the carbon stock and not of cumulative emissions.
Furthermore, it implies that the stock of carbon is computed as the sum of emissions minus the
fraction that is eliminated over time. This is a simpli…cation of the much more complex carbon cycle,
and it takes the simple view that the carbon stock follows an AR(1) process. If we make "1 = 1;
then the function P ( ) just captures cumulative emissions which in turn determines temperatures.
Given the de…nition of P ( ) ; implied by our choice of "1 , a value of                        2   < 1 implies that temperature
in period t is a concave function of P (t). The model we have put forward includes the relationship
advocated by Allen et al. (2009) and Matthews et al. (2009) as a special case when                                   2    = "1 = 1.
  In this appendix, we set           2   = "1 = 1 and recalibrate "2 ;              1    and   3   so that cumulative emissions
are equal to 1600 GTC in 2100, as implied by the IPCC Special Report Emissions Scenarios (2000),
and we obtain a 2 increase in temperature in the Equator and a 6 increase in the North Pole in
2100 in the baseline case (same as in the main text and consistent with IPCC, 2007). The result
is "2 = 0:000002475,         1   = 0:000003 and          3   = 1=42 (as before). One caveat with this calibration is
that cumulative emissions vary little with                        32
                                                             1.        The value we select yields cumulative emissions of
1603 GTC in 2100 while a value of               1   = 0:000006 yields cumulative emissions equal to 1599 GTC
by 2100. We selected the former as a baseline case since it yields temperature increases after 200
years more in line with the ones in the literature and with the model in the main text, although we
present results below for several values of                  1.   Note also that the values of          1   in this calibration are
two orders of magnitude smaller. The reason is that the stock of carbon is smaller than cumulative
emissions and       2   = 1. These values yield identical temperature targets in year 2100 as those in the
main text.
  Table 6 presents the results of the Allen et al. (2009) and Matthews et al. (2009) (                                        2   = 1
and "1 = 1) calibration, as well as the results for the calibration in the main text (                                2   = 0:5 and
"1 = 0:9975) for comparison purposes. The results are very similar. Welfare peaks at the baseline
case when         = 0:98; but it peaks at double the value of                        1   when        = 0:95. Furthermore, the
 32
      As in the main text we report values of       1   after dividing by 1000=( =2):


                                                                       52
increases in temperature after 200 years when we multiply the baseline value of          1   by two, three or
four, are also very similar.
  One noticeable di¤erence is that welfare is lower with the new calibration. The reason is simple:
global warming is now a phenomenon that advances unabated. Humanity will eventually burn since
temperature will grow unboundedly as long as the economy keeps using energy to produce. Given
that we do not give producers any alternative, the faster increase of cumulative emissions than the
stock of carbon yields smaller welfare. We view these two cases as extremes. The calibration in the
text perhaps discounts the stock of carbon too much, while Allen et al. (2009) and Matthews et al.
(2009) assumes a linear relationship between cumulative emissions and temperature independently
of the levels of both of these measures. Other, more involved, representations of the carbon cycle,
such as Golosov et al. (2011), will yield outcomes in between. However, given the small di¤erences
we compute between both of these formulations, the variation relative to the cases we present here
will be small and is unlikely to change any of our conclusions.
