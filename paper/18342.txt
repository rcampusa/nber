The Distributional Effects of the Social Security Windfall Elimination Provision
Jeffrey R. Brown and Scott Weisbenner
NBER Working Paper No. 18342
August 2012
JEL No. H55

                                                ABSTRACT

Millions of federal, state and local government employees have lifetime earnings that are divided between
employment that is covered by the Social Security system and employment that is not covered. Because
Social Security benefits are a non-linear function of covered lifetime earnings, the simple application
of the standard benefit formula to covered earnings only would provide a higher replacement rate on
those earnings than is appropriate given the individuals’ total (covered plus uncovered) lifetime earnings.
The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP), established in 1983, is intended to correct this situation
by applying a modified benefit formula to earnings of individuals with non-covered employment. This
paper analyzes the distributional implications of the WEP, and finds that it reduces benefits disproportionately
for households with lower lifetime covered earnings. It discusses an alternative method of calculating
the WEP that preserves the intended redistribution of the system. In recognition of the data limitations
that prevent this alternative method from being used by SSA for at least another decade, the paper
also analyzes two alternative ways of calculating the WEP that use the same information that SSA
currently uses, are budget neutral, and come closer to maintaining the cross-sectional progressivity
of Social Security than does the existing WEP formula.

1. Introduction
       Approximately one fourth of all public employees in the U.S. do not pay Social Security
taxes on the earnings from their government job (U.S. GAO, 2007). This includes approximately
5.25 million state and local workers, as well as approximately 1 million federal employees hired
before 1984 (U.S. GAO, 2003). Many of these public employees still qualify for Social Security
benefits, either as a result of switching between covered and uncovered employment at some
point in their career or because they simultaneously work two or more jobs that span both
covered and uncovered employment. For example, a teacher in the State of Illinois (one of the
states whose public workers are not covered under Social Security) may spend his summers
working in covered employment. Alternatively, a professor may spend part of her career
working at a private university covered by Social Security, and part of her career working for a
state university that is not covered.
       If Social Security benefits were calculated as a simple linear function of lifetime
earnings, it would be possible to calculate the retirement benefit for a worker with partial
coverage by simply applying the standard benefit formula only to those earnings covered by
Social Security. However, Social Security’s benefit formula was explicitly designed to be non-
linear in order to offer a higher replacement rate (e.g., a higher ratio of Social Security benefits to
average indexed monthly earnings over one’s lifetime) for individuals with lower earnings. For
workers employed by certain federal, state, or local governments who have earnings that are not
covered by the Social Security system, using only covered earnings in the standard benefit
formula would result in a higher “replacement rate” on these covered earnings than they would
receive if all of their earnings were covered.
       In order to adjust for this, the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) was enacted as part
of the 1983 Social Security Amendments. This provision is meant to downward-adjust the
Social Security benefits of affected workers in order to eliminate the “windfall” that arises when,
for example, an individual with high lifetime earnings (based on both covered and uncovered
earnings) would appear as if he or she were a low earner when evaluated solely based on covered
earnings.




                                                                                                     1
        The WEP is extremely controversial to those affected by it. Indeed, bills to eliminate or
alter the WEP are regularly proposed in Congress.1 There are numerous potential reasons for the
intense opposition to the WEP by those affected, including that: (a) the underlying rationale for
the WEP does not appear to be well-understood by many of those affected by it, (b) the official
SSA publications quite clearly frame the WEP as a benefit cut, and (c) the WEP is perceived as
being particularly unfair to lower income individuals. This paper discusses all three of these
concerns, although the primary contribution is to investigate the third claim by analyzing the
distributional implications of the WEP in comparison to several alternative methods of
calculating this adjustment.
        We find that the WEP does indeed reduce benefits disproportionately for lower earning
households than for higher earning households. Because the WEP changes the marginal Social
Security benefit only on the first $711 (in 2008) of average indexed monthly earnings, the WEP
reduces benefits by a larger percentage for households with lower covered earnings. Because the
WEP provision is phased out for individuals with 20 to 30 years of sufficient covered earnings
(to be explained in more detail below), the WEP provision can also, in some cases, lead to large
changes in Social Security replacement rates based on small changes in covered earnings. This
potentially has both distributional and labor supply incentive effects.
        This paper begins in section 2 by describing in more detail why an adjustment for
uncovered earnings is appropriate. In section 3, we discuss the details of the WEP calculation as
it is currently applied. In section 4, we discuss the distributional implications of the WEP as
currently applied. In section 5 we present two alternative methods for calculating the WEP that
are administratively feasible and that may do a better job of preserving the income progressivity
that is inherent in the broader Social Security system. Section 6 provides a very brief overview
of a distinct but related provision – the Government Pension Offset. Section 7 draws conclusions
and provides further commentary on the WEP, including a brief discussion of how the framing of
the existing WEP adjustment likely exacerbates the political unpopularity of this provision.

  In the 110th Congress, such bills include the “Public Servant Retirement Protection Act of 2007” (H.R. 2772 and
S. 1647). These bills often garner a large number of co-sponsors, especially from states whose state employees are
affected by these provisions.

2. Why is a Benefit Adjustment Necessary for Government Employees?
         A brief review of how Social Security benefits are calculated provides a useful
background for understanding the need for a benefit adjustment for workers with both covered
and uncovered earnings. Let’s begin with an individual born in 1946, who will turn age 62 in the
year 2008, and whose earnings are 100 percent covered. This individual’s earnings in each year
are first indexed to the average wage index to bring nominal earnings up to near-current wage
levels.2 Social Security then averages the highest 35 years of indexed earnings and divides by 12
to compute the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME). The next step is to compute the
Primary Insurance Amount (PIA), which is the basis for all benefit calculations. For the 1946
birth cohort, the PIA is calculated as a function of the AIME as follows:
         PIANo WEP = 0.9 ⋅ min ( AIME,711) + 0.32 ⋅ max(0, min( AIME, 4288) − 711)
                                                                                                         (1)
                               + 0.15 ⋅ max(0, AIME − 4288)
         The benefit formula in equation 1 is most easily scene graphically:

  The indexing factor for a prior year is the result of dividing the average wage index (AWI) for the year in which
the person attains age 60 by the average wage index for year Y. A factor will always equal one for the year in which
the person attains age 60 and all later years. http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/ProgData/retirebenefit1.html



                                                                                                                   3
         If an individual retires at his or her normal retirement age (NRA), which is age 66 for the
1946 birth cohort, the individual’s monthly benefit would be equal to the PIA as calculated
above. For individuals retiring earlier (or later than this age), the benefit is decreased (or
increased) by an actuarial adjustment that is meant to be roughly actuarially fair for the
population as a whole.3 This non-linear benefit formula is meant to be redistributive, in that the
PIA/AIME ratio is flat or falling as AIME rises.4 In other words, individuals with lower average
lifetime earnings tend to get a higher fraction of their average earnings replaced by Social
Security each month than do individuals with higher average lifetime earnings.
         Now, consider an individual who has high lifetime earnings, but for whom most of those
earnings were from a state or local employer that is not covered by Social Security. This means
that when one looks only at the earnings of the individual that are covered by Social Security, the
individual appears as if they are a low-earner when in fact they are a high-earner. Applying the
benefit formula in equation 1 only to covered earnings would place this person on the high
replacement rate portion of the benefit formula, in essence giving this individual too large of a
benefit relative to their total (covered plus uncovered) lifetime earnings.
         It is easiest to see the problem that would be created if there were no WEP provision in
place through an example. Consider the three individuals shown in Table 1. Person A is a very
low income worker who works her entire life under Social Security, with an AIME of only $500
per month. Using the 2008 PIA formula (applicable to the 1946 birth cohort, as it appears in
equation 1 above), person A would have a PIA of $450, or a replacement rate of 90%. Person B
is a higher income worker with all of her earnings covered under Social Security, thus having an
AIME of $5,000. Applying equation 1 indicates that Person B would have a PIA of $1891.34, or
a replacement rate at the NRA of nearly 38%. Thus far, this example simply illustrates the non-
linearity of the benefit formula, as person A receives a higher replacement rate than does person
B, owing to the fact that person A has lower lifetime earnings.

  More details on these adjustments, as well as for other complexities relating to family benefits, spousal benefits,
special minimum benefits, etc., are available on the Social Security website, www.ssa.gov.

  Whether Social Security is redistributive from a lifetime and/or household perspective is a more complex question
that takes into account, among other items, differential mortality rates, spousal benefit rules, etc. A number of
studies have examined this issue, including Coronado, Fullerton and Glass (2000), Gustman and Steinmeier (2001),
and Liebman (2002), among others.


                                                                                                                    4

       Now consider person C, a public employee. Person C’s total lifetime earnings (which on
an indexed average monthly basis were $5,000) are identical to B’s. Had all of person C’s
earnings been covered by Social Security, person C would have the same 38% replacement rate
as B. However, only 1/10th of person C’s earnings were in employment covered by Social
Security; the rest were in non-covered public employment. If Social Security applied the
standard benefit formula to person C’s covered earnings without any WEP adjustment, person C
would receive a monthly benefit of $450, equivalent to person A. This provides person C with a
ratio of PIA to (covered) AIME of 90%, which is substantially more generous than the 38% ratio
provided to person B, even though B and C have identical lifetime earnings. To use the language
of the provision designed to address this issue, person C would receive a “windfall.”


3. How Does the WEP Work?
       In 1983, Congress acted to correct this potential “windfall” to public employees. A
natural approach to adjusting for public employment, which we will call the “proportional WEP”
to distinguish it from the actual WEP, would entail calculating a participant’s “total PIA” based
on total (covered and non-covered earnings) – $1891.34 in the case of person C – and then
multiplying by the ratio of covered-to-total earnings – 0.1 for person C. This would result in a
“covered PIA” of $189.13. Note that the resulting replacement rate of covered earnings under
the “proportional WEP” is, by construction, 38%, identical to the replacement rate provided to an
individual with identical total lifetime earnings. In addition to preserving the distributional




                                                                                                    5
aspect of the benefit formula, this approach would also be relatively simple to explain to affected
participants in a manner that would likely be viewed as “fair.”5
        Implementation of a proportional WEP, however, would require that SSA keep track of
total earnings, including non-covered earnings. Unfortunately, this could not be operationalized
by the Social Security Administration in 1983 due to the fact that the SSA had not historically
collected information on non-covered earnings. Specifically, according to recent Congressional
testimony by an SSA official, “SSA only has records of non-covered earnings beginning in 1978,
when it began receiving Form W-2 information from employers, and some of these records are
incomplete – particularly for the years soon after SSA began collecting this earnings
information” (Social Security Administration, 2005). Even if one assumes that the SSA records
became more complete by the time of the 1983 amendments that introduced the WEP provision,
it will be another decade before SSA has at least 35 years of both covered and uncovered
earnings for new retirees. It will be several years beyond that before SSA can produce
proportional WEP computations based on a complete earnings history. Diamond and Orszag
(2003) have suggested that this approach could be implemented now by requiring that this
alternative calculation “be available only to workers who provide the Social Security
Administration with a complete history of earnings in non-covered work.” Such an approach
would increase benefit expenditures, however, as only those workers who would see their benefit
rise as a result of the alternative calculation would have the incentive to provide such records.
        In recognition of these operational constraints, Congress created a modified benefit
formula that is based only on covered earnings. The key difference between the ordinary benefit
formula and the one used for individuals subject to the WEP is that under the WEP, the covered
earnings up to the first PIA bend point (e.g., the first $711 of AIME in the year 2008) are
converted to PIA at a rate of 0.4 rather than 0.9. Note that the WEP adjustment is applied to the
PIA before benefits are adjusted for early claiming, delayed claiming, or cost of living
adjustments. Because this applies only on the first $711 of AIME, the maximum benefit
reduction under the WEP is $355.50 per month, or $4,266 per year, in 2008.
        This formula is then further altered for individuals who have more than 20 years of
“years of coverage” (YOC), defined as any year in which an individual has covered earnings that

5
 For example, SSA could simply state that “over your lifetime, 10% of your earnings were subject to the Social
Security payroll tax. Thus, you will receive 10% of the benefit that you would have received had you paid taxes on
all of your earnings.”


                                                                                                                 6
meet a minimum amount. For 2008, a YOC is defined as earnings in excess of $18,975.6 For
individuals with 20 or fewer YOCs, earnings to the first PIA formula bend point are credited at
0.4. For each year over 20, the first PIA factor is increased by 0.05. For individuals with 30 or
more years of YOCs, the benefit formula is identical to the standard, non-WEP benefit formula.
Formally, the benefit formula for individuals affected by the WEP can be represented as:
                        PIAWEP = (0.4 + 0.05 ⋅ min (10, max(0, YOC − 20 ))) ⋅ min ( AIME ,711)
                                                                                                                 (2)
                                + 0.32 ⋅ max(0, min ( AIME , 4288) − 711) + 0.15 ⋅ max(0, AIME − 4288)
                 Thus, for person C in the example above who had a covered AIME of $500, the PIA after
the WEP adjustment (assuming fewer than 20 YOCs) would be $200, for a PIA/AIME
“replacement rate” on covered earnings of 40%. The fact that the benefit calculated under the
actual WEP formula differs from the proportional WEP described above is typically the rule
rather than the exception. These adjustments can be seen in Figure 2, which shows the benefit
formula for an individual with 30+ YOCs (or, identically, someone not subject to the WEP), an
individual with 25 YOCs, and an individual with 20 or fewer YOCs.

 “For 1951-78, the amount of Social Security covered earnings needed for a year of coverage is 25 percent of the
contribution and benefit base. For years after 1978, the amounts are 25 percent of what the contribution and benefit
based would have been if the 1977 Social Security Amendments had not been enacted.”

4. Distributional Implications of the WEP
                        There are two aspects of the WEP adjustment that cause it to potentially affect low
earners proportionately more than higher earners. First, the maximum WEP adjustment is
reached at a low level of earnings: specifically, the WEP reduction applies only to covered
earnings up to the first PIA bend-point ($711 in 2008). For all individuals with covered AIME
above this, the maximum reduction of $355.50 represents a smaller fraction of earnings as
earnings rise. This simple point is illustrated in Figure 3, which charts the replacement rate (the
ratio of PIA at the NRA relative to covered AIME) for different income levels for individuals
with no WEP (or individuals with 30+ YOCs) and for individuals with 20 or fewer YOCs who
are subject to the WEP.

                        The difference between the two lines is the result of the WEP, and not surprisingly, this
adjustment is larger (relative to covered AIME) for those with a lower AIME. Thus, holding
constant the fraction of total earnings that are covered, the WEP hits lower earners proportionally
harder.


                                                                                                                    8
         A second way in which the WEP can have a distributional impact can be seen when one
holds constant the fraction of earnings covered, and instead varies total (covered plus uncovered)
earnings. Recall that a YOC is granted for a given year on an all-or-nothing basis, depending on
whether one’s covered earnings exceed the threshold. Thus, if we hold constant the fraction of
total income that is covered versus uncovered, a higher income individual is more likely to cross
the YOC threshold. For example, if two individuals each have 50 percent of their earnings
covered, the person who earns $40,000 per year has covered earnings ($20,000) that exceed the
YOC threshold in 2008, while an individual earning $35,000 per year has covered earnings
($17,500) that are below the threshold.
         For individuals close to the YOC in a given year who expect to have between 20 and 30
YOCs in their lifetime, crossing the YOC threshold can boost lifetime benefits substantially. For
example, an individual claiming in 2008 with an AIME exceeding $711 (so that the full WEP
offset applies), increasing one’s YOCs by one year (between 20 and 30) would boost initial
individual benefits at the NRA by $35.55 per month. Given that these benefits are inflation
indexed and last for life, the increment to the expected present value of lifetime benefits
(calculated as of the NRA) is over $5,000 for each additional YOC between 20 and 30.7 Indeed,
the increment to lifetime income would be even higher for those receiving spousal, survivor, and
other family benefits that are calculated based on this PIA.
         Another way to view the magnitude of this change is as follows. For someone whose
AIME is between the two bend points (i.e., between $711 and $4288), raising one’s PIA by
$35.50 per month would normally require raising one’s lifetime earnings (on a wage indexed
basis) by $46,593.75.8 For an individual with an AIME beyond the 2nd bend point, the increment
to lifetime earnings required to boost monthly income by $35.50 is $99,400. Yet for those in the
affected range of the WEP, this incremental benefit can be earned by having only $18,975 in
covered earnings during the year. Thus, in addition to distributional effects being explored here,
these provisions could have large effects on labor supply incentives for individuals in the
affected range.

  The present value calculation assumes a unisex mortality table and a real interest rate of 3%.

  $46,593.75 = (35.50 / 0.32) * 12 * 35. In words, the extra $35.50 in monthly benefits for an individual on the
middle bend point factor requires an additional $110.94 per month of AIME. This is $1,332.25 annually. Because
the benefit formula is based on the 35 highest years, this requires a boost in lifetime indexed earnings of $46,593.75.


                                                                                                                     9
                                                The full WEP formula, including the YOC adjustment, can lead to some highly non-
linear movements in the benefit-to-AIME ratio as the fraction of covered earnings rises. For
example, in Figure 4, we use an individual classified by the SSA actuaries as a “maximum
earner,” i.e., an individual whose earnings in every year were precisely equal to the maximum
earnings that were subject to the payroll tax in that year. We assume this individual enters the
workforce at age 21 in 1967, and retires and claims on his 62nd birthday (assumed to be 1/1/08).
Because the individual is claiming before his normal retirement age, the benefit that he receives
by claiming on 1/1/08 is approximately 75% of his PIA.9

                                                In the figure, we vary the fraction of total earnings that are covered by Social Security
from 0% to 100%, in each case assuming that this percentage applies to earnings in every
individual year. There are three lines presented in Figure 4. For comparison, the horizontal line
at just under 24% is the replacement rate that a max earner would receive at ate 62 under the
“proportional WEP” baseline. Recall that this proportional WEP is a useful baseline because it


9
 With a January 1 birthday, the SSA treats the individual as if they were born the prior month. Thus, beginning
entitlement in January 2008 causes this individual to be treated as if they claimed at age 62 and one month.
Therefore, the precise actuarial adjustment for this individual results in an initial benefit that is 75.42% of his PIA.


                                                                                                                                                              10
replicates the replacement rate that the person would receive if 100% of their earnings were fully
covered by Social Security.
       The second line, which begins at just under 68% (which corresponds to the 90% PIA
factor, adjusted by the age 62 actuarial reduction) and then gradually declines to the 24% rate
when all earnings are covered, is the replacement rate that the max earner would receive if there
were no WEP adjustment. The difference between these first two lines is a measure of the
“windfall” that the WEP was meant to address. The third line shows the replacement rate
provided under the actual WEP formula.
       There are three noteworthy points about the actual WEP benefit pattern relative to the
“No WEP” and “WEP” benefits. The first and most obvious point, which is true based on how
the WEP is calculated, is that all the replacement rates with the WEP are lower than or equal to
those resulting from the application of the standard PIA formula to covered earnings without
regard for the windfall. A second point to note is that, for this maximum earner, the replacement
rates are all higher than the 24% that the individual would have received under a proportional
WEP. In other words, maximum earners are getting a better return on their Social Security
dollars – even with the WEP adjustment – than they would receive had their earnings been fully
covered by Social Security. Thus, it is somewhat ironic that these individuals would find the
WEP so objectionable, given that the current design of the WEP still provides them with a higher
replacement rate on their covered earnings than otherwise similar lifetime earners are receiving.
       A third point to note about this line is that the pattern of replacement rates is highly non-
monotonic. It begins at approximately 30% (which corresponds to the 40% PIA factor under the
WEP, adjusted by the age 62 actuarial reduction)) when 10% or less of earnings each year are in
covered employment, and then gradually drops to 27.4% before jumping up to over 40%, and
then declining gradually. The discrete jumps occur at places where a small change in the
fraction of covered earnings each year causes the individual’s covered earnings in some years to
qualify as YOCs. For example, the move from 19 to 20% of earnings causes a jump from 2 to 27
in the number of years of this particular earnings profile where the YOC threshold is met, thus
increasing the first PIA factor from 0.4 to 0.75 (such a disproportionate jump is admittedly an
artifact of how these particular earnings profiles are constructed, but it illustrates the important
role that the YOC thresholds play). Subsequent small increases in the proportion of earnings
covered by Social Security further increase the number of YOCs to 29 at 22% of earnings, where



                                                                                                       11
the number of YOCs stays until 27% of earnings are covered, at which time there is a jump to 41
YOCs, reverting the individual back to the ordinary benefit formula applied only to covered
earnings. Recall that once the individual reaches 30 or more YOCs (which occurs for the
maximum earner once 27% of earnings are covered), the WEP formula reverts to the non-WEP
formula.
                        The finding that a “max earner” individuals receive a higher replacement rate – even with
the WEP in place – than other individuals whose identical level of income is fully covered by
Social Security is not a finding that holds true for lower income workers. As seen in figure 5, an
individual with a “scaled low earner” profile (defined by SSA as an individual with earnings
equal to 45% of average wages) would have a replacement rate of 46.5% under the proportional
WEP (which is also the replacement rate if all earnings were covered by Social Security).
Regardless of the fraction of earnings covered by Social Security, these low earners receive a
replacement rate of less than or equal to 30.2%, more than 1/3 reduction. Notably, even when
100% of the low earner’s earnings are covered by Social Security, this individual has fewer than
20 years that classify as a YOC, and therefore the individual never experiences the benefit of a
YOC adjustment to the benefit.

                                                                                                                                                                                12
        We have constructed similar graphs for medium and high earners, but omit them for the
sake of space. Qualitatively, however, the benefits under the WEP are lower than the benefits
under the proportional WEP for “medium earners” who have less than 45% of their earnings
covered each year by Social Security.10 As the fraction of annual earnings covered by Social
Security rises from 45 to 50%, medium earners see a large step-up due to the rise in the number
of YOCs, so that above 50% of earnings covered, the individual receives a higher benefit under
the WEP than they would receive under a proportional WEP. For “high earners,” the WEP
formula lies above the fully covered replacement rate in most ranges (the exception being from
approximately 18-28% of earnings covered, in which case the benefit ratio is slightly lower than
that received under the proportional WEP).
        Naturally, the use of these stylized workers exaggerates the concentration of the YOCs by
percent of earnings covered, due to the fact that the definition of low, medium, high, and max
earner are tied to the average wage index, as is the YOC itself. Further, it is unlikely that any
given individual would split their earnings over their entire career by a fixed percentage of
covered and uncovered employment, although having many years of mixed employment is not
uncommon (e.g., public school teachers who work in private sector jobs during the summer).
Individuals may also spend some of their years in fully covered employment, and others outside.
The fully covered years would likely qualify for YOCs, while the non-covered years would not.
        Nonetheless, these graphs, and others like them, illustrate two key patterns. First, they
illustrate the regressive nature of the WEP by showing that low earning individuals are more
likely to receive a lower benefit under the WEP than individuals with otherwise similar lifetime
earnings, while high earners are likely to receive a higher benefit-to-AIME ratio than fully
covered high earners. Second, these graphs illustrate that the WEP formula generates non-
monotonic patterns of benefit-AIME ratios, a fact that creates issues of “fairness” when
evaluated on a distributional basis.


5. Alternative Approaches to Computing the WEP
        As noted earlier, the SSA is not currently able to use uncovered earnings to calculate the
“proportional WEP” due to the lack of comprehensive administrative records on non-covered


10
  “Medium earners” are those with earnings about equal to average wages, while high earners are those at
approximately 160% of average wages (source: www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/NOTES/ran5/an2005-5.html).


                                                                                                           13
earnings. Nonetheless, the fact that the existing WEP reduces benefits by a larger fraction for
lower earning individuals may be viewed by some as an undesirable feature of the existing
policy. In this section, we consider two alternative approaches to calculating the WEP that meet
three constraints: (1) the adjustment is approximately cost-neutral to the OASDI trust funds, (2)
the adjustment does not rely on SSA having information on uncovered earnings, and (3) the
adjustment does not rely on changes in the underlying PIA formula and would therefore not
change benefits for individuals not currently affected by the WEP. Loosening any one of these
constraints opens up a wide range of alternative approaches, including ones that simultaneously
handle other populations with only limited covered labor force participation, such as immigrants
or even populations that voluntarily spend time out of the labor force.
        In order to approximate the first constraint, the SSA Office of the Actuary graciously
provided us with a cross-tabulation of covered AIME and YOCs from the 2007 Master
Beneficiary Survey. This cross-tab was for the 1937 birth cohort, and includes all primary
beneficiaries in current pay status to whom the WEP applies.11 In total, this includes 66,352
individuals. Using this information, we calculate that the total value of the benefit adjustment
applied to the PIA for this cohort, using the PIA factors in place in 1999, the year in which this
cohort turned 62. We estimate that the WEP adjustment reduced aggregate PIA For this group
by $13.7 million dollars, relative to a pre-WEP aggregate PIA of $38.3 million.
        As a first alternative WEP, we simply take the ratio of post-WEP PIA ($24.6 million) to
pre-WEP PIA ($38.3 million), and apply this adjustment to the full non-WEP PIA for
individuals. Under this approach, the formula adjustment for a YOC would be eliminated. The
PIA formula for individuals affected by the WEP would simply be:
                                      Alternative1
                                   PIAWEP          = 0.642 ⋅ PIANoWEP                               (3)

        Under this alternative policy, individuals who have both covered and uncovered earnings
under Social Security would simply receive a benefit that is 64.2% of the benefit that results
from the application of the standard formula to covered earnings. This is mathematically
equivalent to reducing the PIA factors from (90, 32, 15) to (57.8, 20.5, 9.6).
        If policymakers wished to maintain the YOC concept, this approach could be adapted to
gradually revert to the non-WEP formula based on YOCs. Of course, allowing the YOC credits

11
  The sample includes a very small number of individuals who were bumped to a special minimum PIA because of
the WEP, a detail which we ignore when calculating our alternative WEP adjustment.


                                                                                                          14
to reduce the WEP adjustment for individuals with more YOCs requires a larger adjustment to
the base formula in order to keep it cost neutral. By using the AIME x YOC tabs provided by
SSA, we approximate that the modified formula would reduce the multiplication factor to 0.58,
and then increase the benefits by 0.042 for each YOC between 20 and 30, such that:
                                                          Alternative 2
                                                       PIAWEP           = (0.58 + 0.042 ⋅ min (10, max(0, YOC − 20 ))) ⋅ PIANoWEP                                                    (4)

       Because we have constrained the WEP adjustments to be (to a close approximation) cost
neutral, there will of course be both winners and losers from any such reform relative to the
status quo. The adjusted WEP approaches increase benefits for individuals with lower covered
AIMEs and reduce them for individuals with higher covered AIMEs. Of course, the “winners”
include both genuine low earners, and high earners with a small fraction of earnings covered by
Social Security. Without access to uncovered earnings data, it is difficult to avoid this outcome.
Importantly, these “winners” may still end up with a lower ratio of benefits to covered AIME
than fully covered individuals with the same lifetime earnings level. For example, the “low
earner” receives a benefit under either adjusted WEP formula that is higher than the existing
benefit, but still lower than the 46% rate that they would have received were all earnings covered
(i.e., under the proportional WEP). This can be seen in figure 6 below:

                                               The “losers” relative to the status quo are high earners who have substantial covered
earnings. Whether or not these “losers” end up with a higher or lower replacement rate than they
would under the proportional WEP depends in part on whether the YOC adjustment is used or
not. As indicated in Figure 7, the alternative WEP that ignores the YOC adjustment provides a
lower benefit than the proportional WEP baseline for maximum earners with more than 35% of
earnings covered. If the alternative WEP with a YOC adjustment is used, this alternative
remains everywhere higher than the proportional WEP baseline. Stated differently, with the
alternative WEP that includes the YOC adjustment, even the “losers” still receive a windfall,
albeit a smaller one than under the status quo.

6. A Related Provision: The GPO
                                               While not the primary focus of this paper, there is a second provision that adjusts the
benefits of public sector workers who have non-covered earnings. Whereas the WEP was
designed to address the non-linearity of the benefit formula, the Government Pension Offset
(GPO) is designed to address the role of spousal benefits.




                                                                                                                                                           16
       Under Social Security, an individual is entitled to receive benefits based on the earnings
record of his or her spouse if that spousal benefit is greater than what the individual would
receive based on his or her own work record. While the spousal benefits are gender neutral, for
sake of exposition let us assume that the husband (H) has had higher earnings over his career
than has the wife (W). Assuming W is at least 62 years of age (or having a qualifying child in
her care), W is eligible for a spousal benefit that can be as much as 50% of H’s PIA (depending
on the age at retirement.) If W has benefits based on her own work record, then she receives the
higher of her own benefit (based on her own work record) or the spousal benefit (based on H’s
work record.)
       For example, suppose that H has a PIA of $2,000. W would be entitled to a spousal
benefit of $1,000 at her NRA even if she had no earnings during her lifetime. If W did work,
and based on her work record was entitled to a worker benefit based on a PIA of less than
$1,000, then she would still receive the benefit based on the $1,000 PIA. In this sense, the taxes
paid on those earnings result in no marginal increase in her benefit (until she has earnings that
would result in a PIA in excess of $1,000). Put differently, with the spousal benefit in place, W’s
own worker benefit is reduced dollar-for-dollar until she reaches $1,000.
       Now suppose that W is a state employee whose earnings are not covered by Social
Security. For simplicity, let’s assume that the pension she receives from the state is identical to
what Social Security would have paid her, and further suppose that this amounts to $800 per
month. If Social Security ignored the fact that she had uncovered employment, she would
receive her state pension benefit ($800) plus the full $1,000 spousal benefit from Social Security,
for a total benefit of $1,800. In comparison, had this same individual worked in covered
employment, she would not have received the $800, and would have received only the $1,000
spousal benefit.
       In short, the design of the spousal benefit rules means that working spouses who are
covered by a government pension and not covered by Social Security would receive a total
benefit that is too generous relative to that received by an otherwise identical couple in which
both spouses are covered by Social Security. The GPO is intended to correct this problem.
Originally established in 1977, the GPO reduced spousal benefits dollar-for-dollar, as does the
spousal benefit for covered working spouses. However, presumably due to the recognition that
many government pensions for non-covered workers are meant to replace both Social Security



                                                                                                    17
and a private sector pension, the GPO calculation was altered in 1983. Specifically, the new
legislation replaced the one-for-one offset with a two-for-three offset, thus reducing the Social
Security spousal benefit by 2/3 of the amount of the government pension.
       Like the WEP, the GPO is viewed as unfair by those affected by it. And like the WEP,
the offset could be calculated more accurately if SSA had access to complete earnings records
that included both covered and uncovered earnings.


7. Discussion and Conclusions
       The Social Security benefit formula was designed to be non-linear in an attempt to
redistribute benefits from higher earning workers to lower earning workers. It was not designed
this way in order to transfer resources from workers who are full participants in the system to
workers who are only partially covered. Yet the simple application of the standard benefit
formula to partially uncovered workers would have exactly this effect. As such, some form of
benefit adjustment for workers with uncovered earnings can be justified as being consistent with
the goals of the benefit formula.
       Nonetheless, the WEP has proved quite controversial. While many of the objections to
the WEP appear to be ill-informed about the need for a benefit adjustment in the presence of a
non-linear benefit formula, one objection that has support in the data is that the WEP hits lower
earners disproportionately hard. Our research suggests that, among individuals subject to the
WEP, those individuals with low lifetime earnings receive a lower ratio of benefits to covered
earnings – and thus receive a lower “return” on their OASDI contributions – than do individuals
with higher lifetime earnings.
       If SSA had access to a complete set of uncovered earnings records, the conceptually
simple way to make such an adjustment would be to calculate an individual’s benefit using total
(covered plus uncovered) earnings, and then multiply this by the ratio of covered-to-total lifetime
earnings. The SSA, however, does not have access to reliable earnings histories prior to the
early 1980s. In the absence of these data, it is quite difficult to construct an alternative WEP that
maintains the intended degree of redistribution in Social Security.
       Nonetheless, it is possible to construct alternative approaches to the WEP that come
closer to preserving the degree of progressivity in the benefit formula, rely only on covered
earnings data, are budget neutral, and leave benefits unaffected for those non subject to the WEP.



                                                                                                    18
       Short of changing the benefit formula, we speculate that SSA may be able to reduce some
of the public anger towards the existing WEP if its rationale were presented more clearly, and if
it were framed differently. For example, the second sentence in the online retirement planner on
the SSA website (http://www.ssa.gov/retire2/wep-chart.htm) reads “the following chart shows
the maximum monthly amount your benefit can be reduced because of WEP if you have fewer
than 30 years of substantial earnings.” This page provides links to other pages, such as the
“Electronic Fact Sheet: Windfall Elimination Provision” (http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10045.html),
which is the electronic version of the print publication on the WEP. The first heading is “Your
Social Security retirement or disability benefits may be reduced.” In essence, all the material
provided by SSA frames the WEP as a “benefit reduction.” The same is true with the GPO. The
bold face headings in the official SSA publication that explain the GPO include “how much will
my Social Security benefits be reduced?”
       While we are aware of no direct research on this question, this framing would appear to
increase the probability that affected participants view this provision as a “loss.” Alternative
framing of the same information might be able to mitigate some of the anger that the WEP
generates. For instance, the information could discuss “Getting your benefit right” instead of
“your benefit may be reduced.” Changes in how information is framed have been shown in a
variety of contexts to influence both attitudes and behaviors.
       The non-monotonic pattern of benefits that are introduced by the YOC adjustment to the
WEP provide interesting labor supply incentives to those who expect to find themselves in the 20
– 30 YOC range near retirement. Because these marginal incentives are quite large, future
research may be able to use them as a source of variation for studying how labor supply is
affected by Social Security accruals, holding constant total lifetime earnings.
