                                              ABSTRACT

We present a tractable model for the analysis of the relationship between economic growth and the
intensive and extensive margins of technology adoption. At the aggregate level, our model is isomorphic
to a neoclassical growth model. The microeconomic underpinnings of growth come from technology
adoption of firms, both at the extensive and the intensive margin. We use a data set of 15 technologies
and 166 countries to estimate the intensive and extensive margin of adoption using the structural equations
derived from our model. We find that the variability across countries in the intensive margin is higher
than in the extensive margin. The cross country variation in intensive margin of adoption accounts
for around 40% of the variation in income per capita.

        Either as a fundamental or as a channel that amplifies other fundamentals (e.g., in-
stitutions), technology is surely important to understanding why there are rich and poor
countries. However, several factors have limited economists’ ability to assess its importance
quantitatively. Broadly speaking, the goal of this paper is to overcome some of these diffi-
culties.
        One significant limitation in efforts to assess the role of technology has been the lack
of direct measures of technology. Traditionally, technology diffusion has been measured as
the share of producers who adopt a given technology (Griliches, 1957, Mansfield, 1961 and
Gort and Klepper, 1982). Computing this measure requires firm-level data which are hard
to collect for a large number of years, countries, and technologies. Consequently, economists
have been unable to measure technology diffusion comprehensively.
        Comin and Hobijn (2004) and Comin, Hobijn and Rovito (2006) present a new approach
to measuring technology. They measure either the number of units of capital in a country
that embody the new technology (e.g., the number of telephones) or the amount of output
produced with the new technology (e.g., the tons of steel produced in blast oxygen furnaces).
These measures have two advantages over traditional measures of technology diffusion. First,
they just require data at the country level. Thus, it is easier to collect them for a large
number of countries, technologies and years.1 Second, they capture the number of units of
the technology adopted by each adopter.2
        As with any new data set, these new technology measures introduce the challenge of
finding ways to extract information relevant to modeling the technology diffusion process.
That is, they present the challenge of mapping the data into dimensions that we can interpret
through the lens of our models.
        Consider Figure 1 for an example of one technology in Comin, Hobijn and Rovito (2006).
Figure 1 reports the number of land line phone calls normalized by total output for the
United States, Australia, Japan, Malawi, Pakistan and Burkina Faso. These curves roughly
appear to be the graphic result of plotting a single curve and then shifting it both horizontally

    1
      The CHAT data set described in Comin and Hobijn (2009) contains information about the diffusion of
104 technologies in 166 countries over the last 200 years.
    2
      As shown by Comin, Hobijn and Rovito (2008), technology measures that include this dimension do not
diffuse following a logistic curve which is characteristic of traditional measures (Griliches, 1957).

and vertically. The hypothesis that this apparent graphic result reflects the actual process
of technology adoption across countries was broadly confirmed in formal tests conducted in
Comin and Hobijn (2010). Assuming this characterization of technology adoption, we can
fully describe cross-country differences in technology dynamics if we know what drives the
horizontal and vertical shifts in the diffusion curves. Section 1 develops a model based on
Comin and Hobijn (2010) that provides a micro-foundation for these shifts.
   A technology, in our model, is a group of production methods used to make an interme-
diate good or provide a service. We consider two aspects of technology adoption, which we
call the “extensive” and “intensive” margins. The extensive margin of technology adoption
gauges how long it takes a country to adopt a technology. Adopting a production method
requires incurring in a fixed investment. The timing of this investment determines the lag
with which production methods arrive in a country. In section 2, we show that the horizon-
tal shifts seen in Figure 1 measure adoption lags. We call this lag the extensive margin of
adoption.
   Once a technology has been introduced, the intensive margin of adoption captures how
many units of the good embodying it are demanded relative to aggregate demand. The
intensive margin is determined by the productivity and price of goods that embody the
technology and the cost that individual producers face in learning how to use it. Other
things equal, these variables produce vertical shifts in the evolution of observable measures
of technology adoption such as displayed in Figure 1. We call the vertical shift the intensive
margin.
   In this paper we pay particular attention to the intensive margin. To be clear, our
goal is not to assess how important a particular factor may be in affecting the intensive
margin of technology adoption. Instead, we just intend to understand how important cross-
country differences in this margin are in explaining cross-country differences in productivity.
Answering this question does not require taking a strong stand on the nature of the drivers
of technology adoption.
   Little has been known about how significant a role the intensive margin of technology
adoption plays in determining overall productivity performance. Clark’ s (1988) classic
study on spinning-machine spindles documents large cross-country differences in the number
4                                           COMIN AND MESTIERI



of spindles that each worker operated circa 1900 and argues that this factor was a major
contributor to differences in productivity. However, observing more units of a new technology
in rich countries is not sufficient to establish the importance of the intensive margin for
aggregate productivity, since it could just reflect reverse causation. In other words, higher
aggregate demand could lead to the adoption of more units of technology per worker.
        Filtering out the effect of aggregate demand on observable measures of technology is a
key challenge that any attempt to assess the importance of the intensive margin needs to
confront. We follow two different approaches to deal with this issue. First, we use our model
predictions to pin down the income elasticity of our technology measures. On a balanced
growth path, the income elasticity of demand for the goods embodying technology must equal
one. Using this restriction we can filter out the effect of aggregate demand on technology
adoption and then use the model to formalize the intuitions described above and identify
the intensive and extensive margins of adoption.
        Our second approach relaxes the restrictions of a balanced growth path (despite its
appeal over long periods we study) to check the robustness of our findings. Here we use
the time series dimension of our panel to estimate the income elasticity of demand for goods
embodying a technology. Because of the need for long time series to carry out this exercise
and because we want to reduce possible biases in the estimates of the intensive margin,3 we
proceed in two steps. First, we estimate the income elasticity of demand for goods embodying
a technology using only U.S. data, and then we impose this estimate on the other countries
to estimate the intensive adoption margin and the adoption lags for each technology-country
pair.
        We use data for 15 technologies and 166 countries, as in Comin, Hobijn, and Rovito
(2006). Our data cover major technologies related to transportation, telecommunication,
information technology, health care, steel production, and electricity. We obtain precise and
plausible estimates of the adoption lags for two thirds of the 1294 technology-country pairs
for which we have sufficient data.
        Our exploration of the intensive margin of adoption, complementing Comin and Hobijn’s
(2010) analysis of the extensive margin, delivers four main findings. First, the magnitude

                   THE INTENSIVE MARGIN OF TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION                                5


of cross-country differences in the intensive margin of adoption and adoption lags are large.
On average, they are 20% larger than the cross-country dispersion in per capita income.
Second, there are significant differences across technologies in the cross-country dispersion in
the intensive margin. For example, the dispersion in electricity and passenger rail represents
40% of the dispersion in per capita income, while in blast oxygen steel represents 170% of the
dispersion in income. Third, a variance decomposition reveals that 33% of the variation in
the intensive margin can be attributed to cross-technology variation, 43% can be attributed
to cross-country variation, and the remaining 23% is not explained by these two factors.
Fourth, the cross-country dispersion in adoption lags has declined monotonically over time.
Specifically, for every decade later that a technology has been invented, the dispersion has
been two years smaller. In contrast, we do not observe any cross country convergence in the
intensive margin of adoption.
   Our model is similar at the aggregate level to the neoclassical growth model, except that
in our model the level of total factor productivity (TFP) is endogenous. In particular, TFP
depends on both the intensive and extensive margins of technology adoption. We use this
result to assess the magnitude of the cross-country differences in labor productivity that
our estimated differences in the intensive margin generate. We find that differences in the
intensive margin of adoption account for 44% of cross-country differences in income per
capita. As our model makes clear, these effects could be fundamentally driven by differences
in the costs individual producers face in adopting the new technologies or by differences in
the overall efficiency of the economy that affect the intensity of adoption.
   Finally, we show that the empirical results obtained in the baseline model hold when we
allow for non-homothetic production functions that do not pin down the income elasticity
of demand for goods embodying a new technology. For instance, the intensive margin still
accounts for 52% of the cross-country variation in income per capita.
   This paper is related to three strands of the literature. First, macroeconomic models of
technology adoption (e.g., Parente and Prescott, 1994, and Basu and Weil, 1998) have tried
to understand the role of technology in determining TFP. However, these studies have used
an abstract concept of technology that is hard to match with data. Second, the applied mi-
croeconomic technology diffusion literature (Griliches, 1957, Mansfield, 1961, and Gort and
6                                   COMIN AND MESTIERI



Klepper, 1982, among others) has focused on estimating diffusion curves for technologies in
different countries. However, these studies have only been able to investigate a relatively
small number of technologies and countries. Moreover, the diffusion curves are purely sta-
tistical descriptions, not embedded in an aggregate model. Hence, it is difficult to use them
to explore the aggregate implications of the findings.
    Finally, the closest reference to this paper is Comin and Hobijn (2010). This paper differs
from it in at least three important ways. First, our model provides a micro-foundation for
the intensive margin of adoption as well as for the extensive margin. Second, in our empirical
analysis we estimate and analyze the intensive margin of adoption. Third, we explore the
robustness of our findings about the two margins of adoption by relaxing the balanced
growth restriction and allowing the income elasticity of the demand for the technology to be
endogenous.
    The paper is divided into four sections. Section 1 sets out a one-sector neoclassical
growth model featuring intensive and extensive margins of adoption. Section 2 describes
the diffusion patterns of technology under the balanced growth path assumption, derives
structural equations that can be estimated from the data, and explains how the margins
of adoption are identified. Section 3 presents the results of the estimation, and Section 4
concludes.




1     A one-sector growth model with extensive and
      intensive technology adoption

We next present a one-sector growth model with endogenous technology adoption at the
extensive and intensive margins. The model maps the adoption margins into the time-path
of observable measures of technology diffusion and illustrates how each adoption margin
affects endogenous TFP differentials. In what follows, we omit the time subscript, t, where
obvious.

1.1        Preferences

A measure one of households populates the economy. They inelastically supply one unit
of labor every instant, at the real wage rate W , and derive the following utility from their
consumption flow                               Z   ∞
                                          U=           e−ρt ln(Ct )dt.                        (1)
                                               0

Here Ct denotes per capita consumption and ρ is the discount rate. We further assume that
capital markets are perfectly competitive and that consumers can borrow and lend at the
real rate re.



1.2        Production

Technology:
Each instant, a new production method appears exogenously. We call these production
methods, technology vintages or simply vintages. Production methods are capital embodied.
The set of vintages available at time t is given by V = (−∞, t]. The productivity embodied
in new vintages grows at a rate γ across vintages, such that


                                               Zv = Z0 eγv .                                  (2)


Note that Zv is constant over time. This characterizes the evolution of the world tech-
nology frontier. We shall choose the normalization parameter Z0 such that vintage v has
productivity Zv .4
       A country does not necessarily use all the capital vintages that are available in the world
because, as we discuss below, making them available for production is costly. The set of
vintages actually used is given by V = (−∞, t − D]. Here D ≥ 0 denotes the adoption lag.
That is, the amount of time between when the best technology in use in the country became
available and when it was introduced in the country.
       In order to map the model into the data, we introduce the concept of technology. A
technology is a set of production methods used to produce closely related intermediates. To
   4
       This implies that Z0 = Zv e−γv .
8                                        COMIN AND MESTIERI



simplify the exposition, we consider only two technologies: an old one, denoted by o, and a
new one, denoted by n. The old technology consists of the production methods introduced
up till a fixed time v, such that the set of vintages associated with the old technology is
Vo = (−∞, v]. The new technology consists of the newest production methods, invented
after v, such that it covers Vn = (v, t − D].
Output:
The output associated to a technology τ , Yτ , is given by:
                                              µ
                                       Z  1
                                 Yτ =  Yvµ dv  ,                     τ ∈ {o, n},                      (3)
                                          Vτ


where Yv denotes the intermediate output produced using technology vintage v. Final output
Y, is produced competitively with the following production function:
                                                                                     µ
                                    Z   t−D       1
                                                         µ            X          1
                                                   µ                              µ
                              Y =              Yv dv          =                 Yτ  .
                                       −∞                             τ ∈{o,n}


    Once a technology vintage v is brought to the country, producers can find distinct ways
to use it. Because each application developed solves a new problem, the larger the number of
applications developed, Nv , the more efficient the production of intermediate service v is. In
other words, there are efficiency gains from developing more applications.Each application
yields a differentiated output, Yvi . Differentiated outputs are produced monopolistically. A
competitive producer then aggregates these outputs in the form of intermediate v, Yv , as
follows:5                                                        µ
                                            Z     Nv     1
                                       0
                         Yv =   Nv−(µ−µ )                 µ
                                                        Yvi di        , with µ > µ0 > 1.                (4)
                                               0

Output Yvi is produced by combining labor and capital, Kvi , that embodies production
method, v, as follows:
                                                      1−α α
                                            Yvi = Zv Lvi Kvi ,                                          (5)

Capital goods production and taxes:
   5
     This specification is similar to Benassy (1996). The assumption that µ > µ0 ensures that the profits of
a individual producer decline with Nv .

Capital goods are produced by monopolistic competitors. Each of them holds the patent of
the capital good used for a particular production method v. It takes one unit of final output
to produce one unit of capital of any vintage. This production process is assumed to be fully
reversible. For simplicity, we assume that there is no physical depreciation of capital. The
capital goods suppliers rent out their capital goods at the rental rate φR Rv . Rv is the price
received by the capital goods producer, while the wedge φR captures a tax on the price of
capital that the government rebates back to the consumers with a lump sum transfer. φR is
constant across vintages and over time. Below we show that φR can capture a wide range of
institutional distortions that affect the efficiency of the economy.
Technology adoption costs:
There are two types of adoption costs. The cost of bringing to the country the production
method associated with a capital vintage, Γevt , and the cost incurred by each individual
producer to find a distinct application of a production method that is already available, Γivt .
We define the former as the extensive and the latter as the intensive adoption costs. Both
of these are sunk costs. The extensive cost of adopting vintage v at time t is given by (6)
while the intensive cost of adoption is given by (7).

GDP ratio and is included for normalization purposes. The term (Zv /Zt ) captures the idea
that it is more costly to adopt technologies the higher is their productivity relative to the
productivity of the frontier technology. The last two terms capture that the cost of adoption
is increasing in the market size. We choose these formulations because, just like the adoption

     Note that all producers of differentiated outputs associated to a given vintage face the
same demand and have access to the same technology. As a result, they will charge the same
price which is given by a constant markup, µ, times the marginal cost of production:

where Rv is the rental price of a unit of capital that embodies vintage v, φR is a tax on
capital, and W is the wage rate. From (9), this implies that

     It could of course be the case that the linearity in the adoption cost function is violated for some
particular technology for some particular country, without necessarily violating balanced growth, but to the
extent that we are documenting adoption lags across many technologies this is perhaps not so critical.

   The supplier of each capital good takes as given the number of differentiated output
producers but recognizes that the rental price he charges for the capital good, Rv , affects
the price of the output associated with the capital good and, therefore, its demand, Yv . The
price elasticity of demand she faces, , is constant. As a result, the profit maximizing rental
price equals a constant markup times the marginal production cost of a unit of capital, which
we assume is equal to a unit of final output.
   Because of the durability of capital and the reversibility of its production process, the
per-period marginal production cost of capital is the user-cost of capital. Thus, the rental
price that maximizes the profits accrued by the capital good producer is

Optimal adoption implies that, every instant, all the vintages for which the value of the firm
that produces the capital good is at least as large as the adoption cost will be adopted. That

is, for all vintages, v, that are adopted at time t

This holds with equality for the best vintage adopted if there is a positive adoption lag.
       The adoption lag that results from this condition equals

and is constant across vintages, v.7 The lag with which new vintages are adopted is increasing
in the adoption costs, be , and the tax wedge, φR , is decreasing in Nv and in the deviation of
the stock market to output ratio from its steady state level. As shown in equation (16), the
number of producers that develop distinct uses for technology vintage v, Nv , declines with
the intensive cost of adoption, bi , and increases with the deviation of the stock market to
output ratio from the balance growth level.8
       Conversely, there are several significant factors that do not influence the adoption decisions.
First, given the specifications of the production function and the costs of adoption, the mar-
ket size symmetrically affect the benefits and costs of adoption at both the intensive and
extensive margins. Hence, variation in market size does not affect the timing of adoption, D,
and the number of producers that use a new vintage, Nv . By the same token, the adoption
margins are not affected by the productivity of technology at time zero, Z0 . Second, since on
the balanced growth path Ψ = Ψ, the steady-state adoption lags and number of producers
do not depend on the stock market to output ratio.
       These observations together with equation (12) help us understand what drives aggregate
TFP in this model. Three factors can drive cross-country differences in TFP: The adoption
lag, the number of producers that adopt each technology vintage, and the normalized pro-

   7
    In what follows we focus on the interior case where Γtτ ≤ Mtτ .
   8
    Note that φR does not affect the intensity of adoption as measured by the number of producers that adopt
a new vintage. That is the case because, from the perspective of the potential producers of differentiated
outputs, φR only affects aggregate demand. Aggregate demand, in turn, has a symmetric effect on the costs
and benefits of adopting the vintage for the differentiated output producers. Instead, corporate income taxes
(or expropriation risk) also affect the profit margin net of taxes. This asymmetric effect would affect the
number of producers that adopt the new vintage.

ductivity level of the initial vintage. Note that, Z0 affects directly aggregate TFP but, as
mentioned above, has no effect through D or Nv . The costs of adopting new technologies
affect TFP because they influence the range of technologies available for production and
how many different applications are developed. Finally, the tax wedge (and other related
frictions) only affect aggregate TFP through their effect on the adoption decisions.



2      Diffusion of the new technology
We define the equilibrium of this economy in Appendix B. In what follows, we focus on the
balanced growth path of the economy.9 Along the balanced growth path, adoption lags,
D, are constant, the number of adopters that adopt each vintage once it is available in the
country is constant and equal to N, and the economy grows at a constant rate equal to
γ/ (1 − α).10
     So far, we have derived expressions for output and capital at the vintage level. However,
because of the nature of available data, we are interested in the total demand for capital goods
and the output produced with the production methods that make up the new technology
τ = n. We can express output produced with technology τ in the following Cobb-Douglas
form

      The path of the new technology TFP is driven by the adoption margins. First, there are
efficiency gains from the number of producers that adopt a given vintage. This affects the
level of technology through the ‘intensity of adoption’ term in (23). The trend in TFP is
driven by the economy-wide adoption of new, more productive, vintages. The adoption lag
determines the best vintage adopted and affects the level of TFP through the ‘embodiment
effect’ term in (23). Finally, adoption lags also drive the curvature of An at a given moment in
time. The marginal productivity gain from adopting new vintages decreases as more vintages
are adopted. Because the adoption lag determines how far in the adoption process a country
is at time t, they affect the evolution of the slope through the ‘variety effect’. Graphically,
this effect is captured by horizontal shifts in the path of An as adoption lags vary. We shall
use this result to identify the adoption lags in the data.
      These properties of the path for the level of TFP for technology τ affects the output and
capital associated with the technology through its effect on the marginal cost of production
of the technology-specific output measured by the price Pτ .

2.1       Empirical application

Our goal is to estimate the intensity of adoption and adoption lags for the different technology-
country pairs in our data set. We extend the results above by allowing multiple sectors, each
                                                                                                              θ

                                                                                                                   reflects

within sector elasticity of demand. We allow θ−1 to vary across                            sectors. Further, we allow
the growth rate of embodied technological change, γ τ , and the invention date, v τ , to vary

      Comin and Hobijn (2008) derive the multi-sector version of a similar model in detail.

across technologies. We denote the technology measures for which we derive reduced form
equations by mτ ∈ {yτ , kτ }. Small letters denote logarithms.
     These modifications yield the following demand for technology τ output

                                                        θ
                                           yτ = y −        pτ .                                         (25)
                                                       θ−1

Combining that with the intermediate goods price (24)


                        pτ = −α ln α − aτ + (1 − α) (y − l) + αr + α ln φR ,                            (26)


we obtain the reduced form equation (27) for yτ .

                               θ
                   yτ = y +       [aτ − (1 − α) (y − l) − αr + α ln α − α ln φR ]                       (27)
                              θ−1

     Similarly, we obtain the reduced form equation for kτ by combining the log-linear capital
demand equationwith (25) and (26),

                  1
      kτ = y +       [aτ − (1 − α) (y − l) − αr + α ln α − α ln φR ] + ln α − r − ln φR .               (28)
                 θ−1

These expressions depend on the intensive margin and adoption lag Dτ through their ef-
fect on the productivity term, aτ . Comin and Hobijn (2010) show that, to a first order
approximation,

                                                                          γτ
                    aτ ≈ (µ0 − 1)nτ + zvτ + (µ − 1) ln (t − Tτ ) +           (t − Tτ ) ,                (29)
                                                                          2

where Tτ = v τ + Dτ is the time when the technology is adopted. In this approximation,
the growth rate of embodied technological change, γ τ , only affects the linear trend in aτ .12




   12
      Intuitively, when there are very few vintages in Vτ the growth rate of the number of vintages, i.e. the
growth rate of t − Tτ , is very large and it is this growth rate that drives growth in aτ through the variety
effect. Only in the long-run, when the growth rate of the number of varieties tapers off, the growth rate of
embodied productivity, γ τ , becomes the predominant driving force over the variety effect.

Substituting this into (25) and (28) yields the following reduced form equation


                mτ = β 1 + y + β 2 t + β 3 ((µ − 1) ln (t − Tτ ) − (1 − α) (y − l)) + ετ ,                  (30)


where ετ is the error term. The reduced form parameters are given by the β’s. Note that,
the homothetic nature of the production function implies that the coefficient of aggregate
demand, y, is equal to one.
    According to our theoretical model, the intercept β 1 is given by the following expression
which depends on both the intensive and extensive margins of adoption,

                   θ h 0                              γ                          i

                  θ−1                                 2

    We define the intensive margin of adoption of technology τ in country j as


                           Mjτ = ((µ0 − 1)nτ + zvτ ) − α(r + ln φR − ln (α)).                               (33)

    Three different factors affect the intensive margin of adoption: the number of adopters
of the technology, nτ , the normalized productivity level of the technology, zvτ , and the
distortions in the price of capital, r + ln φR .


2.2     Identification and estimation procedure
We use the reduced form equation in (30) to identify the adoption lags and the intensity of
adoption. To this end, we assume that preference parameters (ρ) and technology parame-
ters other than adoption costs (i.e., θ, µ, µ0 , γ α, and zvτ ) are the same across countries.
This implies that the equilibrium interest rate (r) is also the same across countries.13 The
distortions that affect the efficiency of the economy (φR ) and the adoption cost parameters
(be and bi ) can vary across countries. As a result, the adoption lags (Dτ ) and the number of
producers that adopt a technology (n) can also differ across countries.
  13
     Our identification strategy is unaffected if interest rates, r, and the normalized productivity level for the
new technologies,zvτ , varied across countries.
18                                      COMIN AND MESTIERI



       These assumptions impose some cross-country parameter restrictions. Since the intercept
term, β 1 , depends on n, Dτ and φR , it can vary across countries. The trend-parameter, β 2 ,
just depends on α and γ τ , so it is assumed to be constant across countries.14 β 3 only depends
on the technology parameter, θ, and is therefore assumed to be constant across countries.
We do not estimate µ and α. Instead, we calibrate µ = 1.3, based on the estimates of the
markup in manufacturing from Basu and Fernald (1997), and α = 0.3 consistent with the
post-war U.S. labor share.15
       The parameter β 1 is a technology-country specific constant. Therefore, it can be identified
by a technology-country fixed effect. Once we have an estimate of β 1 , we still need an
estimate of the adoption lags to obtain an estimate of the intensive margin of adoption. We
follow Comin and Hobijn (2010) and identify the adoption lags through the non-linear trend
component in equation (30), which reflects the variety effect. Intuitively, after controlling
for the observables such as GDP or labor productivity, only the adoption lag affects the
curvature of mτ . That implies that, ceteris paribus, if we see two countries one with a
steeper diffusion curve than the other at a given point in time, this means that the former
started adopting the technology later.
       For each technology, we report the intensive margin measures relative to the U.S. Note
that our estimates of β 1 in (31) and (32) are not directly comparable for technologies mea-
sured with capital and output variables. To construct comparable measures of intensive
margin of adoption, we need to eliminate the differential effect of φR that appears on the
technologies measured using capital. To this end, we regress, for each country, the intercepts
in (31) and (32) on a dummy variable that takes value of 1 if the technology is measured in
capital units. The coefficient on the dummy captures the differential effect of φR . We then
subtract the dummy coefficient from β k1 , and correct for the factors θ/(θ − 1) and 1/(θ − 1)
to obtain the measure of the intensive margin in (33).16,17

  14
     The output elasticity of capital is one minus the labor share in our model. Gollin (2002) provides
evidence that the labor share is approximately constant across countries.
  15
     As argued by Comin and Hobijn (2008), the estimates of the adoption parameters are very robust to
alternative calibrations of these parameters.
  16
     The parameter θ is computed as the average (across technologies) implied estimate from the estimates
of β 3 and it is equal to 1.31 for the homothetic case and 1.14 for the non-homothetic case.
  17
     An alternative approach could be to take advantage of the fact that we have two measures of railways
that are measured as output (passengers and freight) and one that is measured as capital (rail lines). Under

    This identification strategy assumes that the underlying curvature of the diffusion curves
is the same across countries. This assumption would be violated, for example, if the efficiency
of an economy increased over time non-linearly inducing a similar pattern in the technology
measure. Of course, a priori, there is no reason why the distortions in the economy evolve
to induce such a specific pattern of adoption rather than affecting the trend or adding noise
to the evolution of technology. Nevertheless, Comin and Hobijn (2010) take seriously this
hypothesis and test formally the identification assumption by allowing β 3 to vary across
countries. Then, they see how often they can reject the null that the unrestricted and the
                                               u
restricted estimates are the same (i.e. β̂ 3 = β̂ 3 ). They find that they cannot reject the null
in two thirds of the technology-country pairs considered. Further, the estimated adoption
lags in the restricted and unrestricted specifications are very highly correlated suggesting
that, effectively, the deviations from a constant curvature pattern are not quantitatively
important.
    Because the adoption lag is a parameter that enters non-linearly in (30) for each coun-
try, estimating the system of equations for all countries together is practically not feasible.
Instead, we take a two-step approach. We first estimate equation (30) using only data for
the U.S. This provides us with estimates of the values of β 1 and Dτ for the U.S. as well as
estimates of β 2 and β 3 that should hold for all countries. In the second step, we separately
estimate β 1 and Dτ , using (30) conditional on the estimates of β 2 and β 3 based on the U.S.
data, for all the countries in the sample besides the U.S.
    Besides practicalities, this two-step estimation method is preferable to a system estima-
tion method for two other reasons. First, in a system estimation method, data problems for
one country affect the estimates for all countries. Since we judge the U.S. data to be most
reliable, we use them for the inference on the parameters that are constant across countries.
Second, our model is based on a set of stark neoclassical assumptions. These assumptions
are more applicable to the low frictional U.S. economic environment than to that of countries
in which capital and product markets are substantially distorted. Thus, if we think that our

the plausible assumption that the average intercept of the output measures (passenger and freight measures)
corresponds to the rail line measure used in the country, we can back out the additional effect of φR on the
capital measures of technology. Then, we can subtract this additional effect from the other capital measures
and can construct comparable measures of the intensive margin. The results we obtain using this procedure
are similar to the ones reported in the main text.

reduced form equation is more likely to be mis-specified for some countries other than the
U.S., including them in the estimation of the joint parameters would affect the results for
all countries.
     We estimate all the equations using non-linear least squares. Since we estimate β 3 for
the U.S., this means that the identifying assumption that we make is that the logarithm of
per capita GDP in the U.S. is uncorrelated with the technology-specific error, ετ . However,
because of the cross-country restrictions we impose on β 3 , the risk of simultaneity bias is
not a concern for all the other countries in our sample.



2.3     Non-homotheticities

One general concern in structural estimation exercises is model mis-specification. In the
context of our model, the place where this concern probably is more relevant is in the
elasticity of technology with respect to income. For our model to have a balanced growth
path, the production functions need to be homothetic. This implies that the income elasticity
of technology measures is equal to one. In this subsection, we explore the implications for
the estimated equations (30) if we replace the original production function (3) for a more
general specification that allows for non-homotheticities.
     Consider the following non-homothetic version of (3)

                                                                    !θ̄
                                          1     X               1
                                                               θτ
                                      Y =             θ τ Yτ              ,
                                          θ̄      τ


where θ̄ is the long-run average of θτ over τ so that constant returns to scale are guaranteed
(in the long-run),
                                                (θ̄−1)θ τ       −θ τ
                                       Yτ = Y   θ̄(θ τ −1)   Pτθτ −1 .

This yields the following reduced form equation


            mτ = β 1 + β y y + β 2 t + β 3 ((µ − 1) ln (t − Tτ ) − (1 − α) (y − l)) + ετ ,   (34)


which differs from (30) in that β y is not restricted to be equal to 1. It will be greater than
                      THE INTENSIVE MARGIN OF TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION                                         21


one if θ̄ > θτ and smaller otherwise.
       As in the homothetic reduced form equation (30), we estimate the coefficients in (34)
that depend on technological parameters (β 2 , β 3 and β y ) for the U.S. and then impose these
estimates in the other countries. The only difference is that now we estimate an additional
parameter, β y .
       Using the U.S. estimate of β y has several advantages. First, reliable data on U.S. real
GDP is available since 1820. This long time-span facilitates the identification. It also
ensures that the estimate is based on the various stages of development that the U.S. has
gone through over the last two centuries. As a result, it should capture reasonably well
the effect of aggregate demand on technology diffusion for countries at different stages of
development. Most importantly, since for each technology-country pair, the intensive margin
in our model is constant, by exploiting the time series dimension to identify β y we avoid the
bias due to the potential cross-country correlation between the intensive margin of adoption
and income.
       Identifying β y using only the time series dimension is not trivial for two reasons. First,
since γ τ may differ across technologies, when estimating β 2 we must include a time trend for
each technology. Since in the long run log GDP is approximately linear, GDP and time are
co-linear over very low frequencies. Second, most technologies in our sample are embodied in
capital goods. The high cyclicality and volatility of investment shall induce a high estimate
of β y . This estimate however, would capture the cyclical properties of capital rather than
the effect of aggregate demand on our technology measures at lower frequencies.
       To overcome these two difficulties, we use a Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter to decompose
log of real GDP into a high frequency component and a ‘trend’. As is well known,18 trends
that result from HP filters have significant fluctuations at medium term frequencies.19 By
exploiting this variation, we could in principle identify β y . Thus, we introduce separately the
high frequency component and the ‘trend’ in log real GDP and estimate a different elasticity
for each.20,21 To identify β y in our data, we estimate simultaneously the system of equations
  18
     E.g. Comin and Gertler (2006).
  19
     In the context of this exercise, medium term frequencies means cycles with periods between 8 years and
infinity.
  20
     We have obtained very similar results when including only the ‘trend’ component of GDP.
  21
     As conjectured, the short-run elasticity is significantly higher, capturing adjustment over the business
22                                     COMIN AND MESTIERI



(34) for all the U.S. technologies.
     Though in our model the parameters that determine the intensive margin are fixed, it is
instructive to consider how will our estimate of β y be affected if they vary in the data. The
first thing to realize is that institutions, human capital and other factors that may affect the
costs of adoption at the intensive margin in the U.S. have changed very slowly. As a result,
this may have effects on our technology measures and on GDP only at very low frequencies.22
These frequencies are so low that most of these effects will be captured by the time trends
and will have little effect on the estimate of β y .
     Note further that, since naturally changes in institutions or variables that affect adoption
costs would induce a positive co-movement between GDP and technology, the small bias
induced on β y would be upwards. As a result, when identifying the intensive margin we
would filter too much aggregate demand inducing a lower cross-country dispersion in the
intensive margin. That is, the bias in β y would bias downwards the importance of the
intensive margin for development.



3      Results
We consider data for 166 countries and 15 major technologies, that span the period from
1820 through 2003. The technologies can be classified into 6 categories; (i) transporta-
tion technologies, consisting of steam and motor-ships, passenger and freight railways, cars,
trucks, and passenger and freight aircraft; (ii ) telecommunication, consisting of telegraphs,
telephones, and cellphones; (iii ) information technology, consisting of PCs and Internet
users; (iv ) medical technology, namely MRI scanners; (v ) steel produced using blast oxygen
furnaces; (vi ) electricity.
     The technology measures are taken from the CHAT data set.23 Real GDP and popu-
lation data are from Maddison (2007). Appendix A contains a brief description of each of
the 15 technology variables used. For our estimation, we only consider country-technology
combinations for which we have more than 10 annual observations. There are 1298 such
cycle.
  22
     One example would be expansion of high school enrollment in the U.S. between 1910 and 1940.

pairs in our data. The third column of Table 1 lists, for each technology, the number of
countries for which we have enough data.
       We follow Comin and Hobijn (2010) and analyze only the technology-country pairs for
which we have plausible and precise estimates of the adoption lags. These are estimates with
an adoption date later than the invention year plus 10, and with small standard errors.24
We have plausible and precise estimates for 837 technology-country pairs, which represent
approximately two thirds of the total.


3.1       Estimated Intensive Margin
Dispersion

Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of our estimates of the intensive margin of adoption
relative to the United States. The fifth column reports the cross-country average. This
statistic is negative for all the technologies but ships and freight railways. This means that
for all the technologies but these two, the U.S. intensive margin is higher than the average
in our sample.
       Column 6 reports the cross-country standard deviation of the intensive margin of adoption
by technology while column 10 reports the inter-quartile range.25 The conclusions are robust
to using any of these two measures of dispersion so, for brevity, we base our discussion on
the cross-country standard deviation. The dispersion in the intensive adoption margin varies
significantly by technology ranging from 0.33 (rail passenger) to 0.89 (blast oxygen steel).
To have a benchmark, we report, in column 12, (1 − α) times the cross-country standard
deviation in log per capita income in 2000 for the same sample of countries for which we have
plausible and precise estimates of the adoption margins for each technology.26 The ratio of
the standard deviation in the intensive margin to the standard deviation of per capita income
  24
      Comin and Hobjin (2010) discuss several reasons for obtaining implausible estimates. The 10 year cut
off point for plausible estimates is to allow√ for inference error. The cutoff we use in the standard error of
the estimate of Tτ for it to be precise is 2003 − v τ . This allows for longer confidence intervals for older
technologies with potentially more imprecise data. Including imprecise estimates in our analysis does not
affect the conclusions.
   25
      The inter-quartile range is defined as the difference between the adoption intensities in countries in the
75 and 25 percentiles.
   26
      We scale down log income by the factor (1 − α) because, in addition to the effect through TFP, the
extensive margin also induces a higher capital-labor ratio which also affects the level of per capita output.

is on average 1.2, but it ranges significantly across technologies: from 0.4 (for railways and
electricity)27 to 1.72 for (blast oxygen steel). This suggests that technology-specific factors
are important drivers of the cross-country variation in the intensive margin.


Evolution

The evolution of the intensive margin may be help us understand the dynamics of growth
over the last two centuries. At first sight, the cross-country dispersion of the intensive margin
seems to be uncorrelated with the invention date. We test this observation in the first column
of Table 2, which reports the estimates from a regression of the average intensive margin,
the cross-country dispersion and inter-quartile range on the year of invention. The regres-
sions confirm an insignificant relationship between the dispersion of the intensive margin of
adoption and the invention date of the technology.
      One possible reason for the stationary nature of the dispersion of the intensive margin
could be that our estimates of this dispersion for early adopters of early technologies are
smaller than they should be because of the effect of the replacement of dominated technolo-
gies. The argument would be as follows. Some of the early technologies were dominated by
superior technologies a long time ago. For early adopters such as the United States, the level
of our measures for their intensive margin has been declining. As a result, the estimated
intercept is lower than in late adopters, where these technologies have been dominated more
recently. Under this hypothesis, cross-country dispersion in the intensive margin with which
early technologies were adopted might have been larger than it now appears in the statistics.
The alternative, of course, is that the stationarity of the cross-country dispersion in the
intensive margin of adoption correctly represents the empirical facts.
      To disentangle these two hypothesis, we re-estimate our baseline regression for the old
technologies using only data up to 1939, when presumably none of the early technologies
was yet obsolete. Table 3 compares the estimates of the average, standard deviation and
inter-quartile range of the intensive margin of adoption for the countries for which we can
precisely estimate the diffusion equation using data up to 1939.28 The results vary a little by

 27
      In particular, the ratio is 0.4 for passenger-Km moved by railways.
 28
      For obvious reasons, we only report the estimates for technologies invented before 1900.
                   THE INTENSIVE MARGIN OF TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION                                25


technology but, overall, there are no significant increases in the dispersion of the intensive
margin of adoption when we restrict the sample to the pre-1939 period. This implies that
the dispersion in the intensive margin of adoption for early technologies is not driven by
the fact that early technologies have been dominated sooner in countries that adopted them
first.
    The lack of convergence in the intensive margin contrasts with the evolution of the disper-
sion in adoption lags. Column 11 of Table 1 reports the cross-country standard deviation of
the adoption lags for each technology. It is evident at first sight that dispersion in adoption
lags has decreased monotonically over the last two centuries. That is, the difference in adop-
tion lags across countries has been much smaller for technologies invented in the recent past
than for those invented in the more distant past. Column 3 in Table 2 test this observation
formally. The negative relationship between cross-country dispersion in adoption lags and
invention date is statistically significant. In particular, technologies invented ten years later
have a dispersion that is two years smaller.



Variance decomposition

Understanding the sources of variation in the intensive margin of adoption is beyond the
scope of this paper. However, we can explore whether this variation is mostly driven by
country effects or by technology effects. Specifically, let ∆jτ measure the intensive margin
of country j in technology τ . We can decompose ∆jτ as follows


                                     ∆jτ = ∆j + ∆τ + uiτ ,                                  (35)


where ∆j is a country fixed effect, ∆τ is a technology fixed effect and uiτ is an error term.
The first line of Table 4 examines the contribution of the country fixed effects alone. That is,
the R2 when estimating (35) with only country fixed effects. Country-specific factors explain
approximately 44% of the variation in the intensive margin of adoption. In the second row,
we calculate the contribution of technology-specific fixed effects in an analogous manner and
find that they explain 34% of the variation. The last row of Table 4 shows that country
and technology specific factors jointly account for approximately 77% of the variation in the
26                                   COMIN AND MESTIERI



intensive margin. Of this total variation, 43% can be directly attributed to country effects,
33% can be directly attributed to technology effects, and the remaining 1% is due to the
covariance between these effects which differs from zero because our panel is unbalanced.
     The drivers of the variance in the intensive margin differ quite a bit from the drivers of
the variance for the extensive. As shown in Comin and Hobijn (2010), the technology fixed
effects account for 65% of the variance in the adoption lags. In contrast, country fixed effects
are the main factor when accounting for the variance of the intensive margin of adoption.


Non-homotheticities

As discussed in the identification section, we want to explore an alternative approach to
dealing with the endogeneity of income in estimating the intensive margin. So far we have
used restrictions imposed by the assumption of balanced growth on the elasticity of our
technology measures with respect to GDP (equation 30). We would like to explore how
robust the estimates of the intensive margin are to using other identification schemes. In
particular, the alternative scheme consists in identifying the effect of aggregate demand on
technology by using the time series variation in GDP in the United States and then imposing
the estimate of the U.S. income elasticity when estimating the reduced form equation (34)
for the other countries.
     As discussed above, when estimating the income elasticity for the United States, we
want to distinguish between the short and long run income elasticities, since the former is
likely to capture cyclical variation in the demand for investment goods. This presumption
is confirmed by our estimates. We find that the long-run income elasticity is 2.2, while the
short-run is 6.6. Both estimates are very precise.
     The additional flexibility allowed in the model comes at the cost of a lower precision in the
estimates of the adoption lag for two U.S. technologies: ships and electricity. This creates the
minor problem of having a less precise estimate for the United States in the intensive margin.
Since we do not want to have as baseline intensity for the technology an imprecise estimate,
for these two technologies, we take France as a reference rather than the United States.
Which country is taken as baseline is irrelevant for computing the cross-country dispersion
measures. However, the mean intensive margin of adoption may be affected; therefore, the
                  THE INTENSIVE MARGIN OF TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION                               27


average intensive margin is not directly comparable with the homothetic case.
   We obtain plausible and precise estimates for 738 country-technology pairs. This repre-
sents 57% of our sample. The statistics for the estimated adoption lags and the intensive
margin are reported in Table 5. On average, adoption lags are slightly smaller (35 years
versus 45 years) when we allow for non-homotheticities. The cross-country dispersion in
adoption lags is also slightly smaller (33 years versus 39 years) under non-homotheticities.
However, the estimates of the adoption lags under both identification strategies are very
highly correlated (see column 3 in Table 6). The average correlation across technologies is
0.91, and ranges from 0.79 for electricity to 0.98 for cellphones, MRIs and the Internet.
   The cross-country dispersion in both measures of the intensive margin quite similar (0.72
versus 0.68). Column 4 in Table 6 shows the correlation between the estimates of the
intensive margin of adoption in the homothetic and non-homothetic cases. On average the
correlations are high, approximately 0.87. By technology, they range from 0.6 for freight
railways to 0.97 for passenger aviation and cellphones.


Correlation with per capita income

Before using our model to conduct a development accounting exercise, it is revealing to
explore the correlation between per capita income and the intensive margin of adoption for
each technology. Table 7 reports these statistics for both the homothetic and non-homothetic
estimates. The correlations are sizable. In the homothetic case the average correlation
across technologies is 67% and in the non-homothetic case it is 64%. We find some variation
across technologies. The correlation of the intensive margin with per capita income seems
to be lower for the earlier technologies, especially for ships and railways. Contrary to the
perception that information technologies may be closing the technological divide between
rich and poor countries, we find that the intensive margin of these technologies (i.e. PCs,
cellphones, Internet) present quite high correlations with per capita income.
   Table 7 also reports the correlation between the adoption lags and per capita income.
As shown by Comin and Hobijn (2010) for the homothetic case, the correlation is also fairly
high, approximately -46%. In the last column, we show that the there is also a significant
correlation between the adoption lags in the non-homothetic case and per capita income
28                                             COMIN AND MESTIERI



though slightly lower than in the homothetic case (-30%).




3.2     Development accounting

Next, we investigate how the estimated differences in the intensive margin of adoption trans-
late into cross-country differences in per capita income. To answer this question, we have
to (i) aggregate the technology-level estimates of the intensive margin to an economy-wide
measure of the intensive margin, and (ii) compute the effect of the aggregate intensive mar-
gin on per capita income. Both of these computations require the use of a model that maps
individual technologies into aggregate productivity. We naturally draw from the equilibrium
relationships of the model presented above.
     Aggregate production, Y , can be expressed as
                                                                   Z   t                     Z   t

                                                                   −∞                         −∞


Aggregate TFP, A, is given by

                           τ ∈{o,n}


     Aggregate TFP depends on the adoption lag, D, the number of producers that adopter
each technology vintage, N, and the normalized level of productivity, Zv . The adoption lag
affects aggregate TFP because a higher D reduces the productivity embodied in the best
technology vintage available for production. The number of adopters per vintage, N , affects
TFP because their outputs are imperfect substitutes and there are efficiency gains from a
greater variety of outputs.

       Taking logs, we obtain:

                                                                1       γ ∗ (DU S − Dj )

where var[X] denotes the variance of X, and cov[X, Y ] denotes the covariance between X and
Y. The first term is the share of the cross-country variance in per-capita income accounted
for the intensive margin, while the second term is the share of income differences accounted
for the extensive margin.30 Under our model, together these two terms should account for
100% of the cross-country differences in productivity.
       To implement the decomposition, we need to compute the aggregate intensive margin,
∆j . To this end, we assume that the intensive margins we have estimated using our sample
of technologies are representative of the average intensive margin of adoption across all the
technologies used in production. Under this assumption, the aggregate intensive margin in
country j is equal to the average intensive margin in the country across the technologies in

    Formally, (y\
                j − lj ) ≡ (yj − lj ) − (yU S − lU S ) and D̂j ≡ (Dj − DU S ).
  30
    This variance decomposition follows the decomposition in Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare (1997) and splits
the co-variance between the intensive and extensive margins evenly between the two terms.

our sample.31
       Figure 2 plots the first term in equation (39) against log per capita income in 2000 from
the Penn World Tables 6.2.32 The thicker dashed line corresponds to the regression line,
while the light grey line is the 45◦ -line. The slope of the regression line is equal to the
contribution of the intensive margin in (40). We find that the slope of the regression line is
0.44.33 This implies that the intensive margin of technology adoption accounts for 44% of
the log per capita GDP differentials observed in the data.
       Note that there is an heteroskedastic pattern, as poor countries have more variance in
the measure of the intensive margin. This may be explained by the fact that we have fewer
observations for poor countries than rich countries, and as a result, our measure of the
average intensive margin is more noisy in poor countries.
       Finally, we perform a development accounting exercise analogous to the one discussed
above for the estimates obtained using a non-homothetic production function. The presence
of non-homotheticities prevents the existence of a simple aggregate production function such
as we have in our baseline model. To conduct this exercise, we assume, as a first pass, that the
aggregate production function does not differ much from the one obtained in the homothetic
case. Since our goal is to evaluate the robustness of our findings to alternative identification
schemes in the estimation of the intensive margin of technology, it is desirable to use the same
production function to draw the aggregate implications of the technology-specific estimates.
It turns out that the development accounting exercise for the non-homothetic estimates of
the intensive margin yields very similar results to the baseline exercise, as it can be seen in
Figure 3 The correlation between the intensive margin and income per capita is 0.67, and
the coefficient on the regression is 0.52.
       To sum up, this section suggests that differences in the intensive margin of adoption
account for over 40% of cross-country per capita income differences. The observation that a

substantial share of income differences are either caused or amplified by the intensive margin
of adoption is robust to the two identification strategies we have followed to deal with the
endogeneity of aggregate demand to technology.




4     Conclusion
In this paper we have built and estimated a model of technology diffusion and growth. Our
model predicts that the diffusion path of individual technologies is determined by the lag
with which their different vintages are introduced in the country, the level of aggregate
demand and the intensive margin of adoption. Using these predictions and exploiting the
panel structure of our data set, we have identified the intensive and extensive margins of
adoption for over 800 technology-country pairs that correspond to the diffusion of up to 15
major technologies in 166 countries. The estimates are robust to different strategies used to
estimate the elasticity of technology with respect to aggregate demand.
    An analysis of the estimates yields significant findings. There is a large cross-country
dispersion in the intensive margin, though the dispersion varies significantly across technolo-
gies. The cross-country dispersion in adoption lags has declined very significantly over the
last two centuries, while we find no such convergence pattern in the intensive margin.
    In addition to describing accurately the diffusion patterns of individual technologies, our
model yields a representation of aggregate productivity that allows us to relate income levels
to the intensive and extensive margins of technology adoption. We find that approximately
45% of the cross-country variation in per capita income can be attributed to differences in
the intensive margin. Comin and Hobijn (2010) reported that differences in the extensive
margin account for at least 25% percent of the cross country variation in productivity. Taken
together, these results imply that the role of technology is crucial to understanding per capita
income differences. In particular, the empirical estimates suggest that 70% of the differences
in cross-country income per capita can be explained by differences in technology adoption.
    We anticipate that the findings of this paper will stimulate three lines of research. First,
we would like to understand better the relative importance of the different drivers of the
intensive margin. In particular, we would like to assess what is the role played by adoption

costs, institutional constraints that affect the overall efficiency of the economy and distor-
tions that affect the price of capital. Second, we plan to study the underpinnings of the
variation in adoption costs which this paper abstracts from. Specifically, our findings beg
the question of why adoption costs at both the extensive and intensive margin are so large
in developing countries. Finally, the differences we have observed in both the intensive and
extensive margins across technologies suggest that maybe the dynamics of technology adop-
tion are important not only to understanding cross-country differences in productivity but
to explaining the dynamics of growth over the last two centuries. In particular, we intend
to explore whether the dynamics of adoption uncovered in this paper can explain the Great
Divergence and the lack of absolute convergence over the post-war period.

 Note: Plausible and Precise estimates are defined as having
                                                          p an adoption year greater than 10 years before our invention date (this allows for some inference error)
and a standard error for the adoption year smaller than 2003 − v τ . Sd stands for Standard Deviation, pX denotes the percentile X (e.g., p50 is the median), IQR
is defined as the difference between 75th percentile and 25th percentile and sd ỹ is (1 − α) times the standard deviation of log of income per capita in 2000. The last
line (Total) reports the sum of observations for columns 3 and 4 and the unweighted mean for the technology measures with columns 5 to 13.
