FDI and Inequality in Vietnam: An Approach with Census Data

                                         ABSTRACT

We investigate the effects of inward FDI on income distribution and absolute living standards in
Vietnam using census data from 1989-2009. We compute the number of employees of foreign
establishments in each of Vietnam's provinces for each year, and use that as a measure of local
FDI. We estimate the effects of FDI on local households' living standards as reported in the data,
broken down by educational background to allow us to analyze effects on inequality. Estimates
based on the repeated cross section indicate that rising FDI in a province is associated with a
slight decline in living standards for households there if they do not have a member employed by
the foreign enterprises, with only modest gains for households who do have a member employed
by the foreign enterprises. These estimates may reflect composition effects, however, since we
find large movements of people toward the provinces receiving the FDI. The findings show that
measuring the effect of FDI on household welfare is more difficult than measuring the effect of
trade policy, and may pose a difficulty for the view of FDI as a general anti-poverty strategy.

1      Introduction
OECD countries, and not least both the US and Japan, have embraced FDI as a primary

tool of economic development in low-wage economies, and even perhaps as a more important

tool than Official Development Aid. However, there has been much debate over the effects

of FDI on the host economies, and particularly its effects on income inequality. Perhaps

the most important channel by which FDI can affect income inequality is by shifting the

demand for labor. In principle, FDI could either raise or lower income inequality in this

way.

    This paper attempts to measure this effect in the case of Vietnam. Vietnam is an

extremely interesting one for measuring the effects of trade and foreign investment because

of its rapid transition from a relatively closed centrally-planned economy to a very open

market-based economy. McCaig and Pavcnik (2013) document the dramatic restructuring

of the economy from the late 1980’s to 2008 following the Doi Moi market reforms of 1986,

with a large drop in the share of agriculture in employment and GDP and increases in

the share of manufacturing and especially services. The share of State-Owned Enterprises

(SOE’s) has fallen as SOE’s have lost subsidies and failing SOE’s have been allowed to

exit, and the role of foreign enterprises has increased rapidly as restrictions on foreign

ownership have been relaxed. At the same time, increases in labor productivity in each

sector combined with movements away from the lowest-productivity sector (agriculture)

have resulted in a doubling of income per capita. The Vietnamese economy has been

the recipient of a large volume of Japanese FDI, with smaller flows from the US to date,

but that is likely to change given the close trade ties between the US and Vietnam, and

particularly if the Trans-Pacific Partnership is ratified, which would provide for free trade

between Vietnam and several other top trade partners including the United States.



                                             3
   To address the effect of FDI on income inequality in Vietnam, we use data from the 1989

to 2009 Population and Housing Census (hereafter, the ‘Census’), each of which records

the industry and province of employment for each worker, as well as an unusual piece of

information that is crucial for the question at hand: whether the worker is employed in a

private entity, state enterprise, or foreign-owned enterprise. The amount of FDI into each

industry and province can be computed by adding up the number of workers in foreign-

owned entities. This is available for 1999 and 2009, so our regressions focus on those years

(using some information from 1989 for initial conditions).

   If the Census also provided wage data, a Mincer wage regression could then be used

to establish whether or not the skilled wage premium has moved systematically together

with FDI inflows either by industry or by province, and in what direction. Specifically,

controlling for all available personal characteristics, a measure of the worker’s skill level

could be interacted with the number of foreign-owned enterprise jobs in the province.

This would allow us to test for the possibility that a hiring surge by multinationals in a

particular location has an effect on skill premia, and we could estimate it both for those

actually employed in the foreign sector and for those outside of it.

   Unfortunately, wage data were not collected by the Census, so indirect methods are

required. The Census does ask a wide variety of questions that can be used to gauge a

household’s standard of living. Does the household have access to piped water? Is it piped

into the household’s dwelling? Does the household have access to electricity? Does it own

a radio? A television? What is the rate of child mortality? These can be observed over

time to see if people living in a province that saw a greater FDI inflow also were more

likely to see a measurable improvement in living standards as measured in these basic

amenities. In addition, we can look for a differential effect by education: Were households

with more high-school-educated adults, for example, more likely to see an improvement in


                                             4
their living conditions, in provinces with a large FDI inflow, compared to those with less

education? Is there any educational class that saw a worsening in living conditions, or a

slower improvement relative to other groups, when more FDI is present?

   This allows us to measure the pure general-equilibrium effect of FDI on local income

inequality operating through its effect on labor demand. This approach can also be used

to examine the effect of FDI on the absolute level of local real income, assuming that all

of the amenities in question are normal goods.

   Before turning to our approach in detail, we will review some of the main theoretical

ideas and existing literature.



1.1    Theoretical ideas

There are many reasons inward FDI could increase income inequality and many reasons it

could have the opposite effect. Here we mention three different mechanisms as examples.

   (i) Inward FDI could compete with domestic capital for domestic workers, pushing down

the income of domestic capitalists and raising the incomes of domestic workers. This is the

idea behind the political argument of Pandya (2014) that the median voter should typically

be in favor of policies to welcome FDI. One simple model in which this outcome emerges is

as follows. Home is a small open economy with multiple industries, each producing some

tradable output by combining labor and capital with constant returns to scale. The capital

for each industry is sector-specific, meaning that it can be used only for that industry, and

it is available in a fixed amount. There is an exogenous supply of homogeneous workers,

who can switch from one industry to another costlessly. Each citizen has one unit of labor,

but some in addition own some capital, creating income inequality. An increase in inward

FDI to any of the industries raises the marginal product of labor in that industry, raising



                                             5
aggregate labor demand and the equilibrium wage. This decreases income per unit of

capital in each industry (since output prices are determined on world markets and remain

unchanged). As a result, incomes of low-income citizens (who have only labor income)

rise proportionally more than the incomes of higher-income citizens (who receive income

gains on their labor but income reductions on their capital). In this model, inward FDI

unambiguously reduces income inequality.

   (ii) Inward FDI could shift the mix of tasks performed in the economy in the direction

of increased skill intensity. This mechanism is developed in detail in Feenstra and Hanson

(1996) (a similar story with a slightly different mechanism emerges in Zhu and Trefler

(2005); and Raveh and Reshef (2014)). In that model, there is one manufactured good

that requires a continuum of inputs to produce. Each input requires high-skilled labor,

low-skilled labor and capital to produce, and can be produced either in North or in South.

Each country has an exogenous endowment of all three factors, and the ratio of high-skilled

to low-skilled labor is higher in North. The inputs differ in the ratio of high-skilled and

low-skilled labor required to produce them.

   In equilibrium, the ratio of high-skilled to low-skilled wages is higher in South, so it

is more expensive to produce very skilled-labor intensive inputs in the South than in the

North, and vice versa for very low-skilled-labor intensive inputs. Therefore, there is a cutoff

input such that inputs that are more skilled-labor-intensive than the cutoff are produced in

North and less skilled-labor-intensive inputs are produced in South. Now, if FDI transfers

some capital from North to South, the cutoff input changes: The increased productivity

of Southern labor expands the range of inputs produced in the South, so that the new

cutoff is more skill-labor intensive than the old one. Consequently, the least skilled-labor

intensive inputs that had previously been produced in North are now produced in South,

where they become the most skilled-labor intensive inputs produced in South. As a result,


                                              6
       the relative demand for skilled labor goes up in both countries, increasing wage inequality.

          The result is that in this model, inward FDI reduces the income of South’s capitalists,

       which in and of itself lowers inequality; but it increases wage inequality, which pushes in

       the other direction.

          (iii) Inward FDI could be more or less skill intensive than domestic businesses in its

       own demand for labor. Consider the following illustrative model. Home is a small open

       economy, with a range of industries, each producing a traded good combining skilled and

       unskilled labor with constant returns to scale. To keep the argument as simple as possible,

       suppose that all of these industries have the same production function.1 In addition, there

       is a sector that requires foreign capital to produce, in combination with both kinds of

       labor. Think, for example, of an oil field that requires foreign technology to exploit, or an

       assembly operation that will use foreign machines plus local labor to produce products for

       export. For simplicity, suppose that the foreign-capital-using sector uses skilled workers in

       a fixed ratio, S F , to unskilled, and that all capital is foreign-owned.

          Suppose that initially there is no foreign capital at all, and the economy’s exogenous

       ratio of skilled to unskilled labor is S̄. Now, allow a small amount of inward FDI, so

       that the foreign-capital-using sector begins hiring local workers, S F skilled workers for

       each unskilled worker. If S F > S̄, the labor left over for the domestic industries has a

       lower ratio of skilled to unskilled workers than S̄, and so the skilled-to-unskilled wage ratio

       must rise to induce domestic employers to substitute toward unskilled workers and restore

       labor-market clearing. The result is a rise in wage inequality (which in this illustrative

       model is also a rise in overall inequality). In this case, FDI reduces the absolute wages of
   1
     This is not essential to make the point. If different industries differ in their skilled-labor intensities, then
analyzing labor demand is complicated by the fact that the mix of products produced will be endogenous,
as varying the skilled-wage-to-unskilled-wage ratio will move the economy from one cone of specialization to
another. But this is only a complication and does not affect the main point under discussion.



                                                         7
the unskilled workers as well, since in each domestic firm the ratio of skilled to unskilled

workers, and hence the marginal product of unskilled labor, will fall. If S F < S̄, inequality

is reduced, and real incomes of unskilled workers are increased, due to FDI, following the

same logic.

   The former case could be quite plausible in the case of extractive industries; perhaps a

new oil well will require 1 engineer, 1 supervisor, and 20 manual workers; but if the typical

domestic employer has 1 supervisor for 100 manual workers, the oil well removes from the

domestic economy skilled workers who would normally employ 200 manual workers, while

providing new jobs in the foreign-capital-using sector for only 20 of them. The resulting net

decrease in unskilled labor demand requires a drop in unskilled wages to restore equilibrium.

The opposite outcome is more likely for an assembly operation, where the skilled-unskilled

ratio might be comparable to or even below the domestic-sector average.

   These three examples are by no means exhaustive. Indeed, there is now a rich the-

oretical literature on the relationship between trade and inequality (Harrison, McLaren

and McMillan, 2011), and any one of those models would have its own implications for

the effect of FDI on inequality. These examples merely illustrate the point that there can

be no theoretical presumption regarding whether inward FDI will raise or lower income

inequality, whether it will raise or lower the real incomes of low-skilled workers, or whether

it will raise or lower poverty rates. Only empirical enquiry can answer these questions.



1.2    Literature review

A broad literature investigates the relationship between FDI and income inequality. Macro

approaches are exemplified by Jaumotte et al (2008), who use panel data for 51 countries

over 1981-2003 and find a positive effect of FDI on income inequality but a negative effect



                                              8
of trade. Im and McLaren (2015) suggest that such findings may be due to the endogeneity

of FDI, and find a negative effect on inequality, once FDI inflows are instrumented by a

range of variables. Raveh and Reshef (2014) examine the effects of capital imports on the

skill premium in wage data for a wide panel of countries, using changes in unit prices of

different types of capital as instruments. They find that the composition of capital imports

is more important than the quantity of capital imports, with more R&D intensive capital

imports promoting increased skilled-wage premia.

   Micro studies tend to examine the effect of FDI on wages in the host country. Lipsey

(2004) surveys a wide range of studies, finding robust evidence that multinationals raise

incomes for the workers whom they hire, but little evidence either way on the effects of

multinationals on the income of other workers in the same labor market. We provide some

evidence on that question.

   A small number of studies based on micro data investigate the effects of FDI on outcomes

of living standards in a manner somewhat analogous to what we are attempting here. Atkin

(2009) uses the height of a worker’s children as a measure of economic outcomes in response

to local hiring by multinationals in Mexico. Apart from FDI, Young (2012) uses a range

of tangible variables quite similar to what we use here (ownership of a television, access to

electricity, various health measures) from the Demographic and Health Surveys of USAID

to assess economic growth trends in Africa.

   This study is also related to the literature that assesses the effects of globalization by

exploiting intra-national geographic variation in its effects. Edmonds and Pavcnik (2005)

studied the effect of the mid-1990’s liberalization of rice exports in Vietnam on child labor,

by using variation in the effect on rice prices across different locations within the country.

Topalova (2007) studied the poverty effects of the Indian trade liberalization of the early

1990’s by using differences in the intensity of the shock across districts. Many studies have


                                              9
followed in this vein. Particularly relevant for our present purposes is Hanson (2007), who

used geographic variation in FDI in Mexico to investigate the effect on income inequality

there, finding modest evidence in Census data that FDI (and trade) raise inequality.

    The rapid changes in Vietnam have provided the setting for a number of studies focussed

on income effects of globalization in that country in particular. Aside from Edmonds and

Pavcnik (2005) mentioned above, McCaig (2011) finds that the reduction of US tariffs

on Vietnamese goods following the 2000 bilateral agreement significantly reduced poverty,

with the most-affected provinces showing the largest reductions in poverty. McCaig and

Pavcnik (2014) show that the same tariff reductions led to a large reallocation within

affected industries from informal production to the formal enterprise sector. Brambilla et

all (2012) show that US protectionist actions limiting exports of Vietnamese catfish lowered

incomes of affected households. Although in this study we use variation in international

shocks at the level of the province analogously to McCaig (2011), this appears to be the

first study to look at the effects of FDI on welfare of Vietnamese households in a similar

way.



2          Empirical Approach
Our outcome variables are observed at the household level, so all of our individual-level

data needs to be aggregated to the household level. Given a household h living in province

i in year t, consider an outcome variable yh . This could be a dummy variable for the

presence of a television in the household, for example. Once we condition on h, we do not

need to condition on i or t, because each household in the sample is observed in only one

year of the data, and of course lives in only one province. It will be useful to write i(h)

and t(h) for the location and year of observation, respectively, of household h.


                                            10
          Given that we have no income variables, the simplest way to measure the effect of FDI

       in the local labor market would be through a regression of the following sort:




                                                                                    i(h)      t(h)
                                          β2j njh + β3 nFh OR + β4 F ORi(h),t(h) + β5
                                      X
               yh = β 0 + β 1 n h +                                                        + β6      + h .   (1)
                                      j



       Here, nh is the number of members in the household; njh is the number of adult members

       of educational class j, where j takes one of four values, indicating that the highest level

       of education achieved is either ‘less than primary,’ ‘primary,’ ‘secondary,’ or ‘university;’

       nFh OR is the number of adult household members employed by a foreign employer; F ORi,t

       is the number of workers employed by foreign employers in province i in year t, normalized

       by the initial population of province i;2 and β5i and β6t are province and year fixed effects

       respectively. The njh are controls for the human capital endowment of the household. This

       last variable, F ORi,t , is the main variable of interest. If its coefficient β4 is positive, then

       that implies that households living in provinces with a greater increase in FDI during

       the period under study saw a greater increase in the probability of owning a television,

       or whatever the particular outcome variable is. Note that we are controlling for whether

       or not the household has members who are themselves employed by foreign enterprises

       through nFh OR , so this would demonstrate that even those who are not themselves hired by

       foreign firms nonetheless benefit from the increased local demand for labor that the foreign

       firms create.

          A comment on how to interpret the demographic coefficients may be in order. Increasing

       njh , holding nh constant, implies exchanging one working-age adult with education j for
   2
    More precisely, this is the number of foreign-employed workers in province i at date t, divided by the
population of province i in 1989, unless that population figure is not available, in which case we use the population
in 1999.


                                                          11
one child or senior citizen. Therefore, each of the β2j coefficients measures the effect of

a reduction in the household’s dependency ratio, with higher values of j implying higher

levels of education for the working-age member in question. On the other hand, an increase

in nh , holding the njh variables constant, implies addition of one non-working-age dependent

to the household, whose effect is measured by β1 .

   Now, equation (1) is framed as if an increase in FDI will have the same effect for all

households in the same province, but of course that may not be the case, and indeed the

discussion above indicates that there are many reasons FDI might affect the real incomes of

households with different human capital to different degrees, or even in different directions.

We can investigate such differences with the modified equation as follows:


                                                                                  i(h)      t(h)
                            β2j njh + β3 nFh OR +        β4j njh F ORi(h),t(h) + β5
                       X                            X
   yh = β0 + β1 nh +                                                                     + β6      + h .   (2)
                        j                           j


The difference from (1) is in the fourth term, which interacts the household human-capital

variables with the provincial foreign-hiring variable. If β4j > 0 for all j, then a rise in local

foreign hiring improves living conditions for households of all human capital levels. However

if, for example, β41 < 0 while β44 > 0, then local foreign investment improves living standards

for highly-educated households, while worsening things for lower-education households.

   An obvious problem with this approach is the possible endogeneity of foreign hiring.

This could arise for many reasons. For example, if a province receives a new highway or an

improved electrical grid, that could increase incomes and living standards throughout the

province, and at the same time make the province more attractive for foreign investment.

If there are enough shocks of that sort, a spurious positive correlation between foreign

hiring and living standards will be induced, and regressions of the sort we are using will

overstate any benefit from the foreign hiring. On the other hand, during this period the


                                                    12
      State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) sector contracted very rapidly as market reforms proceeded

      (McCaig and Pavcnik (2013, pp. 13-14)). In a province with a heavy concentration of

      SOE’s, the reduction in labor demand from that sector could in and of itself reduce wages

      and living standards, but that same reduction in wages would also make the province more

      attractive to foreign enterprises. If there are enough shocks of that sort, a spurious negative

      correlation between foreign hiring and living standards will be induced, and regressions of

      the sort we are using will understate any benefit from the foreign hiring. Many such possible

      correlations between foreign hiring and omitted variables can be contemplated.

          To deal with this issue, we have explore two different instrumental variable strategies

      as follows.

          (i) A shift-share approach. We can construct a simple instrumental variable as follows.

      For each industry k, we construct from the Census data the share θik of that industry’s

      total jobs nationwide that are located in province i as of 1989.3 Then, for year t =

      {1999, 2009}, we sum up the total foreign employment nationwide in industry k for year
                                                                 SS ≡
      t, f oreign_empltk . Our instrument for F ORi,t is then IVi,t                   k              k
                                                                                 P
                                                                                   k θi f oreign_emplt .

      This is analogous to a standard instrument, variously called a ‘shift-share’ or ‘supply-push’

      instrument, used in the immigration literature to deal with the endogeneity of immigrant

      inflows as popularized by Card (2001). It should be uncorrelated with local productivity

      and labor-demand shocks subsequent to 1989, but correlated with local foreign hiring to

      the extent that a multinational enterprise will prefer to hire, other things equal, in locations

      where that firm’s industry has already established itself.

          (ii) An approach based on foreign supply of FDI. An alternative approach is based on

      data from foreign FDI outflows. For countries that are major suppliers of FDI, we can

       analogous to the instrument used by Hummels et al (2014) for offshoring by Danish firms.

          A difficulty that has plagued both approaches is that for most specifications the IV’s

       produced tend to be weak, with first-stage F-statistics well below 10. Trial and error has

       led us to use the ‘foreign-supply’ specification constructed from outward FDI from Japan,

       lagged 2 years. It is not surprising that this is the strongest instrument, since Japan has

       been by far the largest source of FDI to Vietnam (although Vietnam makes up a small

       share of Japan’s FDI). Our only criterion has been to find the IV method that produces

       the strongest first stage, as measured by the first-stage F-statistic. As reported at the

       bottom of our results tables, the F-statistic tends to range from just over 3 to 7 with this

       approach.



       2.1     Data

       We use the 1989, 1999 and 2009 Vietnam Population and Housing Census, from which we

       have an anonymized 5%, 3% and 15% sample respectively, taken from the Integrated Public

       Use Micro Samples system (IPUMS) (Ruggles et al (2010)).4 As Table 1 presents, we have

       19,172,742 individuals in our sample, divided into 4,226,009 households, with an average of

       3.914 members per household. The data are divided into 43 provinces.5 A fraction 60.19%

       of the individuals are adults, defined as the ages between 18 to 65. On average, there

       are 0.038 adult workers per household who are employed by the foreign firms – about one

       foreign-employed worker for every 26 households. The average household has 0.703 adults

    The data are available through IPUMS - International: https://international.ipums.org/international/

    In the Census raw data, there were originally 79 distinctive provinces in terms of their names. Brain McCaig
pointed out that there was a provincial boundary reform between 1989 and 1999. We are very grateful that
Brain McCaig shared his code for constructing time-consistent provinces for our sample periods from 1989 to
2009.



                                                       14
      with less than primary education and 1.19 adults with only primary education completed.

      About one in three households has a high-school graduate, and about one in eight a college

      graduate. The number of Adult FDI workers in each province in each year is scaled by

      the person weights so that we have correct representation from each sample.6 On average,

      there are 3,088 adult workers employed in the foreign sector in a given province in year

      1999 and 38,433 workers in year 2009, which, as shown in Table 1, amounts to about half

      a percent and 4.8% of the initial provincial population respectively.

         The census records the ‘foreign enterprise’ indicator, which is our means of keeping track

      of trends in FDI employment, for all three years. However, in 1989, no worker is recorded

      as employed by a foreign entity (to be precise, not a single worker in the entire economy).

      This is clearly an error. For example, the Foreign Investment Law of 1987 opened up

      almost the entire economy to foreign firms, allowing for 100% foreign ownership in most

      cases, and provided generous tax incentives. In 1990, FDI was 2.8% of GDP (McCaig and

      Pavcnik, 2013, pp. 12-13). Consequently, we take the zeros for 1989 as a coding error, and

      use only the foreign-employment data from 1999 and 2009.

         Our data include a wide range of standard-of-living variables at the household level,

      which we will use as the outcome variables in question. The summary statistics are provided

      in Table 2. Most of these are dummy variables, i.e., whether the household has an access

      to electricity, etc. However, ‘Living area in square meters’ and ‘Child deaths’ are integers.

      We define these briefly: (i) Electricity. Indicates whether or not the household has access

      to electricity. (ii) Water supply. Indicates whether or not the household has access to

      piped water. (iii) Private water supply. Indicates whether or not the household has access

      to water that is piped right into the household’s dwelling. (iv) Television set. Indicates

   This is a correction required when working with IPUMS samples, as the samples intentionally oversample
some demographic groups.



                                                   15
ownership of at least one television, either color or black and white. (v) Radio in household.

Indicates ownership of a radio. (vi) Toilet. Indicates that the household has a toilet of

any kind, including flush toilets and latrine-type toilets. (vii) Flush toilet. Indicates the

flushable subset of the previous indicator. (viii) Living area in square meters. Indicates

total area of the household’s dwelling. (ix) Child deaths. Indicates the number of children

ever born alive to a woman in the household who are no longer living (including from

fathers not in the household but excluding still births).

    We have had to omit data on a number of other interesting living-standard variables

because they are not available for both 1999 and 2009. These include: access to a sewage

system or septic tank; presence of a telephone within the dwelling; air conditioning; per-

sonal computer; clothes-washing machine; refrigerator; number of rooms; and number of

bedrooms.

    These amenities vary widely in the breadth of their availability. For example, in our

data, 94% of households have access to electricity, while 23.6% have a radio. Only 21%

have access to piped water, but 81.6% have a television. The average dwelling is 67 square

meters (about 710 square feet) in size.



3     Results
The results from equation (1) estimated with OLS are shown in Table 3. Each column

presents results from a regression with a different dependent variable. Each row lists

estimated coefficients from a different regressor, which are in order: Foreign-employed in

province, the number of adults employed by foreign enterprises in the province and year

in which the household is located (FOR_i(h),t(h) above); Size of household, the number

of people of any age in the household (nh above); Adults without primary education, the

of adults with university education (nU
                                      h
                                        niv above); Foreign-employed in household, the


number of adults in the household employed by a foreign enterprise (nFh OR above); and

U rban, a dummy variable indicating that the household lives in an urban location. Each

regression has year and province fixed effects, and all standard errors are clustered at the

province level.

   Note that in controlling for the regressors in rows 3 through 6, we are controlling for

the number of working-age adults in the household, so the second row shows the effect of

an increase in the number of non-working age household members, holding the number

of working-age adults constant. Looking at the results in the second row, we see that an

increase in the size of the household is associated with a small increase in living area (about

three square meters, perhaps the size of a closet), but otherwise is associated with reduced

living standards suggesting that the household budget needs to be stretched further to

accommodate the additional dependent. For example, one more non-working-age member

is associated with a one-percentage-point reduction in the probability of a toilet in the

house. The one exception to this pattern is a small increase in the probability that the

household has a radio or TV.

   Turning to the human-capital variables, note that the coefficient on njh implies the effect

of one more working-age adult of education class j, holding household-size fixed. This effect

is in most cases positive for all four educational classes except for the first one, indicating

that, holding household size constant, one more working-age adult tends to improve living

standards, unless that adult has less than primary education. The coefficients mostly

increase as one moves down the column, indicating that having more education has a


                                              17
bigger impact on the living standard. One more uneducated adult is associated with a

1.7 percentage point reduction in the probability that the household has electricity, and

a 5 percentage-point reduction in the probability of having a flush toilet. On the other

hand, one more university-educated adult is associated with an increased living space of 16

square meters, enough for an extra bedroom, and is associated with a 14.5 percentage-point

increase in the probability that the household has a flush toilet. Importantly, adding high-

school or college-educated adults to the household reduces child mortality, by approximately

1 percentage point (in other words, one less child death with a probability of 1%).

   The U rban variable is correlated with improvements in living standards along all fronts.

Controlling for all other factors, an urban household is 6.6 percentage points more likely

to have electricity, 40 percentage points more likely to have private, piped water, 6.8

percentage points more likely to have a toilet and 33 percentage points more likely to have

a flush toilet, and has 9 square meters of additional living space. This last point is strking in

light of the likelihood that space is more expensive in urban areas. Finally, child mortality

is 2.2 percentage points lower for urban households.

   The overall pattern of the control variables is consistent with a story in which one

more dependent causes the household to spend a bit more on housing but to sacrifice living

standards along other dimensions, while one more working-age adult tends to be associated

with improvements along all dimensions as long as the adult has some education, and

dramatically so if he or she has university education, as does urban status.

   We turn now to the main variable of interest, the foreign employment in the house-

hold’s province, which recall is normalized by the province’s 1989 population. There is

a great deal of variance in the number of people employed by foreign enterprises, both

across provinces and across time. For our purposes, the time-series variation is the most

important, which we can measure as the standard deviation across provinces of the first


                                               18
difference in the foreign employment in a given province. This standard deviation is 0.14.

We will interpret regression results in terms of this standard deviation. For example, in the

first regression, with ownership of a television as the dependent variable, the coefficient on

the normalized number of foreign-employed workers in the province is −0.102. Multiplying

this by the standard deviation of the right-hand side variable gives −0.102×0.14 = −0.014.

This implies that a one-standard deviation increase in foreign employment on average is

associated with a 1.4-percentage-point reduction in the fraction of local households who

own a television, holding all controls constant.

   Going through the regressions, there are five statistically significant coefficients. A one-

standard-deviation increase in local hiring by multinationals lowers the probability of TV

and radio ownership by 1.1 and 1.4 percentage points respectively (that is, −0.102 × 0.14

and −0.0773 × 0.14), and reduces living space by 1.5 square meters. On the other hand,

the same change raises the probability of a flush toilet by 5.2 percentage points and lowers

expected child mortality by a third of a percentage point. We see a mix of good and bad

news, in other words. The picture is similarly mixed for a household that actually has an

employee at one of the foreign enterprises, as the seventh row of the table shows.

   We do not wish to pin too much on the OLS regressions because of the endogeneity

problem. Table 4 reports the results for the IV version of the regression. Clearly, the

negative findings for the number of foreign jobs in the province are greatly strengthened.

Three variables are now statistically significant, two of which indicate a worsening of living

standards when foreign hiring increases. The exception is living space, which increases

by 8.4 square meters when foreign hiring goes up by one standard deviation – perhaps

enough space for one small room. Access to electricity and a TV fall by about 23 and 12

percentage points respectively with a one-standard-deviation increase in foreign hiring. For

households who have a member who gets one of the foreign-enterprise jobs, there are two


                                             19
bright spots – an increased probability of a flush toilet and a drop in child mortality – but

the magnitudes are negligible, and there is no increase in living space. (It is possible that

this is due to people moving into a dormitory to take a foreign-sector job. The results are

essentially unchanged when households with a foreign-sector employee are removed from

the sample). Note that the worsening of the estimates of the effect of foreign hiring on

household welfare suggests that the first endogeneity story discussed in Section 2 fits better

– omitted variables that improve living standards also attract FDI.

    To sum up, a rise in local hiring by multinationals is associated with slightly reduced

living standards, even if the household itself has a member who takes one of the foreign

jobs.

    We turn now to the results from estimation of equation (2), to see if we can infer

anything about inequality. These results are reported for OLS in Table 5 and for the IV

regression in Table 6, which are set up exactly as Tables 3 and 4, but the rows 8 through 11

are the interaction terms between the human capital measures and the province’s foreign

employment (Foreign employed in province × adults w/o primary is the interaction with

the number of adults with less than primary education, and so forth). Once again, all

regressions have province and year fixed effects and standard errors clustered at the province

level.

    The control variables have coefficients similar to their counterparts in equation (1).

More non-working-age members cause the household to allocate resources toward living

area and away from other uses. More education and living in the city both improve living

standards including reducing child mortality. The effect of having a household member

employed by a foreign employer has mixed effects on living standards, and is correlated

with reduced living area.

    In this case, it is more difficult to find any appreciable effect on living standards due to


                                              20
foreign hiring. In the OLS results, there is a small negative effect on access to electricity,

significant only for workers with a primary education, and very small in magnitude (a one-

standard-deviation increase in foreign hiring is associated with about a third of a percentage

point decrease). For toilets, there is a minuscule increase in access for uneducated workers,

and a similarly-sized drop for educated workers. There is a significant rise in probability of

a flush toilet (0.431×0.14 = 0.09,) of 9 percentage points per standard-deviation increase in

foreign hiring, which disappears in households who have one university graduate – perhaps

because those households already have a flush toilet regardless of foreign hiring. There are

very small reductions in child mortality. However, most of these effects become insignificant

in the IV regressions.

    The effect of having a household member employed by a foreign enterprise, recorded in

row 7, is very similar to what it was for equation (1); very small, and a mixed bag. Foreign

employment improves access to a flush toilet by about half a percentage point.

    To sum up, a rise in local hiring by multinationals is associated with slightly reduced

living standards, slightly less so for a household with very low education, and with small

improvements if the household itself has a member who takes one of the foreign jobs.



4     Allowing for heterogeneous effects
The effects of foreign hiring estimated above were almost uniformly quite small. Note that

this cannot be because the data are simply noisy and uninformative, since a number of

strong effects came through for other variables, such as household size, education, and

urban location. Here we look more closely at some forms of heterogeneity that may have

been obscuring the effects.

    (i) Gender. We have not to this point paid any attention to gender. However, it is


                                             21
quite conceivable that male-led households and female-led households respond differently

to the presence of foreign hiring. We do not have any meaningful indicator of household

leader in our Census data, but we do have both the gender and the education level of each

household member. In Table 7, we extend equation (2) to allow for a count of both male

and female family members at each education level. The second row shows the effect of the

number of male household members, and the third row the number of female household

members. Similarly, each subsequent row corresponds to a row from Tables 5 and 6, but

with the count of male members first and the corresponding count of female members next.

As before, the table is estimated by IV, with province and year fixed effects and clustering

at the provincial level.

   Two striking points emerge. First, the variables for the two genders appear to have

very similar effects. Almost throughout, the sign of the variables for men and women is

the same and the magnitudes are similar. For example, one more boy in the household

increases child mortality by 0.3 percentage points, and one more girl by 0.5 percentage

points. One more man with a university degree reduces child mortality by 0.7 percentage

points, and one more woman with the degree reduces it by 0.9 percentage points. Second,

the effects of foreign hiring in the province are once again very weak. The only significant

effects are very small increases in the probability of having a television, and reductions in

living area. These do not differ by gender in any interesting way.

   (ii) The average effect. In our main regressions, we controlled for the number of workers

each household had who were employed by foreign employers, in order to isolate the direct

effect of foreign employment from its indirect effect on the local labor market. However, if

we wish to identify the average effect, it is desirable to do the estimation without controlling

for the household’s own foreign employment. It is also possible that trying to estimate the

direct and indirect effect at the same time diluted the identification, resulting in only very


                                              22
small effects being observed. To address these issues, we also have performed the estimation

without controlling for the household’s own foreign-employed members. The results, for

equation (1) with the IV and clustering as before, are reported in the first panel of Table

8, with only the right-hand-side variables of interest included.

   The results show much the same story as before: Modest effects, indicating a slight

drop in living standards. We find a 22 percentage-point reduction in access to electricity

for the average household, and a small increase in living space of about 8 square meters,

associated with a one-standard-deviation increase in foreign hiring. There is also a small

drop in television ownership.

   (iii) The urban-rural divide. Throughout, we have controlled for urban residence, but

we have not allowed for the possibility that the response of an urban household to foreign

hiring may be different from the response of a rural one. This could be crucial: Given that

foreign hiring is concentrated in the urban areas, it may well be that all of the response

in concentrated in the urban areas, and by pooling all households we have obscured the

effect. The two remaining panels of Table 8 show, respectively, the estimation results for the

sample of rural households only, and urban households only. Once again, this is equation

(1), with IV and clustering as before, and the other regressors suppressed to save space.

   The urban results are indeed stronger than the rural ones, but, perhaps surprisingly,

they are stronger in a negative direction. Most strikingly, the probability of having a flush

toilet rises by 41 percentage points for a rural household with a one-standard-deviation

increase in the province’s foreign hiring, while for an urban household the same probabil-

ity falls by 28 percentage points. For an urban household, the probability of connection

to electricity falls by 6 percentage points, while the effect for a rural household is very

imprecisely estimated.

   The results are surprising and somewhat enigmatic, but they certainly show that the


                                             23
       failure to find beneficial effects of foreign hiring is not due to pooling of rural and urban

       households.



       5     Migration
       As a final exercise, we look at the effect of FDI on the movement of people. If FDI raises

       living standards in a province, and mobility is not prohibitively costly, it is likely that the

       population of the province will respond as a result, as people move to that province to take

       advantage of the new opportunities. This can be an alternative test for living standards

       effects; if people vote with their feet, they may reveal living-standards effects indirectly

       that are difficult to measure directly.

           Table 9 shows the results of regressing the change in province i’s population between

       1999 and 2009 on the increase in foreign employment in province i between the same two

       years. The first two columns show the results from OLS, while the remaining two show IV

       regressions. In each case, we control for the first differences of provincial characteristics.

       which are merely the province-wide means of the variables in equations (1) and (2): aver-

       age household size; average number of members of each educational group per household;

       average number of foreign-employed members per household; and (for columns 2 and 4)

       the interactions between the educational means and the aggregate foreign employment. In

       this case, the first-stage F-statistic is well above 10. In all four regressions, the coefficient

       on aggregate foreign hiring is strongly significant, ranging from about 5 to about 8. The

       implication is that each 1,000 people hired by foreign firms in province i results in at least

       5, 000 people moving to province i from other locations.7
   7
    For some perspective on these magnitudes, it may be useful to note that Moretti (2010) estimated that each
local tradable-sector job in the US leads to an increase of 1.5 local non-tradable-sector jobs.



                                                      24
          This can be taken as indirect evidence of strong beneficial effects on local welfare from

       the foreign hiring, in contrast to the micro evidence we have seen to this point. An al-

       ternative interpretation is that this finding is a possible explanation for the absence of

       beneficial effects in the main regressions: If people are sufficiently mobile across provinces,

       any difference in real incomes across locations can be arbitraged away by mobility.

          To see how in principle the positive migration findings could be consistent with the

       negative living-standards findings of the preceding sections, consider the following simple

       model. Suppose that there are two industries, X and Y , located in two different provinces.

       There are a continuum of workers, with a total mass of 2, indexed by z ∈ [0, 2]. Each worker

       z can supply az,i units of effective labor in industry i. Production in each industry requires

       labor and industry-specific capital; labor is endogenously allocated across industries, but

       capital is in fixed and exogenous supply in each industry. Output of industry i is given by

       F i (Li , K i ), where Li is total effective labor allocated to industry i, or the integral of the

       az,i terms of all workers employed there; K i is the industry’s capital; and F i is a concave

       constant-returns-to-scale production function. The price pi of industry i output is fixed on

       world markets and can be taken as given. With competitive markets, the price of effective

       labor in each industry is the marginal value product of effective labor, ri ≡ pi F1i (Li , K i ),

       where a subscript denotes partial differentiation, and so the wage of a worker in i is equal

       to wz,i = az,i ri = az,i pi F1i (Li , K i ). Each worker chooses the industry i that pays that

       worker the highest wage wz,i , and all of these individual decisions together determine Li

       and ri for i = X, Y . Equilibrium is an (rX , rY ) pair that generates in this way values of

       LX and LY that are consistent with that (rX , rY ) pair, clearing the labor market.8

          Suppose now that FDI exogenously increases the stock of capital in industry X. It is
   8
    This formulation is an example of what are sometimes called ‘assignment models,’ which are becoming
broadly used in international trade to analyze the income-distribution effects of trade policy (Costinot and Vogel
(2015)).


                                                       25
                                                               rX
       easy to verify that this will increase rX , rY , and    rY
                                                                  ,   as well as causing some workers who

       otherwise would have chosen sector Y to switch to X, raising LX and lowering LY .9 One

       consequence is a reduction in the average productivity of workers in the X industry, in

       the sense of az,X , as workers with a weaker comparative advantage in that industry choose

       employment in it.10 The rise in rX tends to pull wages in X up, but the fall in average

       az,X works in the opposite direction.

          It is easy to construct examples in which average wages in X fall in equilibrium as a

       result of the FDI, because the selection effect of lower average az,X values overwhelms the

       labor-demand effect of the rise in rX . For example, consider the case in which industry Y

       does not use capital and the production functions are F X (LX , K K ) = 2(LX K X )1/2 and

       F Y (LY ) = LY . Let K X = 10, and suppose that there are two types of worker. ‘Ordinary’

       workers have az,X = az,Y = 1, while ‘talented’ workers have az,X = 10 and az,Y = 1. The

       prices are pX = pY = 1. Each type of worker makes up half of the population. In the initial

       equilibrium, rX = rY = 1, and labor is evenly divided between the industries. ‘Ordinary’

       workers all are employed in Y (so LY = 1), while ‘talented’ workers are all employed in X

       (so LX = 10). Now, if the FDI raises K X to 11, the equilibrium will have all workers in X.

       The effective units of labor in X will be 10 units due to the ‘talented’ workers plus 1 unit
                                          z,Y     X
   9
      A worker z will choose sector X if aaz,X < rrY and Y otherwise. Consequently the whole allocation of labor
                                  X                                                            X
is determined by the value of rrY . We can show by contradiction that the FDI increases rrY . First, if this ratio
is unchanged after the FDI, the labor allocation will be unchanged, but this is a contradiction since in that case
rX = pX F1X (LX , K X ) will have increased due to the rise in K X while rY = pY F1Y (LY , K Y ) will be unchanged.
     X
If rrY falls, labor will move from X to Y , but that will imply, due to the effect on the marginal products of labor,
                                                                                        X
that rX rises and rY falls, providing a contradiction. The only possibility is that rrY rises and labor flows from
                                                                                                                   X
Y to X. The reduction in LY that this implies must cause a rise in F1Y (LY , K Y ) and hence rY ; but since rrY
                                X
rises, that implies a rise in r as well.
   10
      Note that conditional on any value of az,Y , the worker who is indifferent between the two industries is the
worker whose value of az,X is the greatest lower bound to the set of az,X values for workers who choose X.
                         X
Consequently, when rrY rises, the workers who switch from Y to X are the lowest-az,X workers for each value of
az,Y . They thus bring down the average value of az,X conditional on az,Y for each value of az,Y . Therefore, the
unconditional average value of az,X for workers employed in X also falls.


                                                         26
due to the ‘ordinary’ workers for a total of LX = 11. The marginal product of labor will

be unchanged in both industries, but the average value of az,X in the X industry will have

fallen from 10 to 5.5, and so the average real wage in X will have fallen sharply. (Before

and after the FDI, ‘ordinary’ workers are indifferent between the two industries.)

   Now, consider a slightly larger infusion of FDI, which leaves K X at a value slightly

above 11. Now, all workers strictly prefer industry X. It is still the case that average

wages in X have fallen due to the FDI, due to the massive influx of untalented workers to

that industry. However, note that in this case, as in all cases with this sort of model, the

FDI raises the real wage for every worker.

   This sort of equilibrium story could rationalize the finding from Sections 3 and 4 that

average living conditions in a province fall slightly when more FDI flows in, with the

finding from this section that FDI in a province induces a very rapid inflow of workers to

that province. It would also allow for a very optimistic interpretation of the effect of FDI

on welfare in Vietnam. However, this interpretation is not terribly plausible; it would fly

in the face of large differences in real income effects across provinces due to trade shocks

as measured by McCaig (2011), for example. If the reallocation of people in response

to FDI in a province is really strong enough to overwhelm the effect of FDI on average

living standards in that province, it seems that there should be a similar movement of

people into a province whose industries get a boost from reduced barriers to export to

the US, overwhelming the effect of the trade shock on average living standards in the

province. However, McCaig (2011) shows large improvements in living standards (measured

by poverty rates) on provinces that receive this beneficial trade shock (as do other studies

of similar changes for other countries – for example, see Kovak (2013) for a similar case in

Brazil). For now, we are left with a paradox.




                                             27
6     Concluding Remarks
We have investigated the effect of FDI, measured by hiring by foreign enterprises, on

standards of living and inequality in Vietnam. Our sample is a random draw from the

Vietnamese decennial census, which gives us a series of cross sections of the population.

Using the full, repeated cross-section sample, after correcting for the endogeneity of FDI,

we find consistently that increased foreign hiring in a province is associated with small

reductions in living standards for households whose members are not employees of the

foreign firms. In particular, once endogeneity of FDI is controlled for, access to electricity

falls by more than 20 percentage points when local foreign hiring rises by one standard

deviation. Whether this reflects extra strain on the local power grid due to extra demand

for power by multinationals, or some other mechanism, is a question beyond our ability to

answer within this study. Workers hired by the foreign firms see very minor increases in

living standards. The results are changed in details but not in their broad contours when

we allow for heterogeneous response by education level, gender, or rural/urban status.

    However, the failure to find benefits for the local population from FDI could stem

from a number of sources. In our main regressions, our instrumental variables are on the

weak side at best. We are limited in our geographic detail to the province only; it would be

desirable to have metropolitan areas or commuting zones, but these are not available in the

Vietnamese Census. This may mask crucial geographic variation and stymie identification.

(However, McCaig (2011) found large effects of trade shocks at the provincial level). In

addition, we find large changes in provincial population associated with increases in foreign

hiring, which suggest that there may be welfare benefits that we are failing to measure.

    A number of studies of the effects of globalization on Vietnamese workers and families

have found great benefits. Edmonds and Pavcnik (2005), McCaig (2011), Brambilla et al



                                             28
(2012) all show tangible benefits to Vietnamese households from increased export oppor-

tunities. This paper is an attempt to see if similar benefits extend to inward FDI. One

lesson from the exercise is that effects of FDI are harder to measure than the effects of

those trade policies, because of the endogeneity of FDI flows and the difficulty of finding

effective instruments. Another is that the welfare benefits of trade openness found in those

studies may well not be replicated by an infusion of FDI. This could be offered as a word

of caution to policy makers who would hope that opening the door to increased FDI would

in and of itself be a powerful anti-poverty program in Vietnam.
