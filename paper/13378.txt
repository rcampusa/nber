                                             ABSTRACT

We study the agenda-setting political behavior of a large sample of U.S. newspapers during the last
decade, and the behavior of smaller samples for longer time periods. Our purpose is to examine the
intensity of coverage of economic issues as a function of the underlying economic conditions and the
political affiliation of the incumbent president, focusing on unemployment, inflation, the federal budget
and the trade deficit. We investigate whether there is any significant correlation between the endorsement
policy of newspapers, and the differential coverage of bad/good economic news as a function of the
president's political affiliation. We find evidence that newspapers with pro-Democratic endorsement
pattern systematically give more coverage to high unemployment when the incumbent president is
a Republican than when the president is Democratic, compared to newspapers with pro-Republican
endorsement pattern. This result is not driven by the partisanship of readers. There is on the contrary
no evidence of a partisan bias -- or at least of a bias that is correlated with the endorsement policy
-- for stories on inflation, budget deficit or trade deficit.

1    Introduction

News provided by the mass media are the most important source of information on public a¤airs in

modern democratic societies. Hence, media outlets play a fundamental role in keeping the public

informed on the decisions of their political representatives as well as on issues and events that are

relevant to public decision-making. Time and space available being limited, journalists exercise

a considerable degree of discretion on the topics covered and the tone of the reports. It would

therefore not be surprising if the political views of individual journalists were re‡ected in news

reported in the mass media.

    One of the most important claims about news in the mass media is the agenda-setting hypoth-

esis. The idea is that editors and journalists have a large degree of freedom in deciding what is

newsworthy and what is not, and these choices in‡uence the perception of citizens about which

issues are relevant and to what extent. Cohen [1963] stated it eloquently: the press “may not be

successful much of the time in telling people what to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling

its readers what to think about.”The exploitation of agenda-setting power is potentially one of the

most harmful behaviors by news media, especially if they use this power to suppress information.

The reason is that it is di¢ cult for consumers to distinguish the scenario “I did not see any news

about X today because nothing important happened regarding X” from the scenario “I did not

see any news about X today because, although something important happened, the media decided

not to publish it”. Theoretical models by Anderson and McLaren [2005], Bernhardt, Krasa and

Polborn [2006], Besley and Prat [2006] and Puglisi [2004] incorporate precisely this source of media

bias, and show how this can a¤ect public decisions and possibly lead to suboptimal ones.

    In this paper we try to gauge the extent of agenda bias on economic issues for a large number

of U.S. newspapers over the period 1996-2005. For newspapers belonging to chains or with large

circulation we go back to 1988. Exploiting the NewsLibrary electronic archive, we collected monthly

and quarterly data on the number of articles that each newspaper reported on some relevant

economic issues. These data can be matched with the actual economic …gures to try to assess

whether outlets systematically over-report or under-report on given issues as a function of those

…gures and of the party a¢ liation of the incumbent president. For example, an outlet with a pro-

Democratic bias might devote more (less) space to news on unemployment when the president is


                                                  1
Republican (Democrat) and unemployment is high or rising. We focus on the political a¢ liation of

the incumbent president, because - as consistently shown by a large literature (see e.g. Fair [1978],

Tufte [1978], Hibbs [1987], Erikson [1989]) - the performance of the economy under his mandate is

a strong determinant of his (or his party’s) vote during the next presidential elections.1

    Di¤erently from other studies on this topic, we do not make any claims about the absolute po-

litical bias of U.S. newspapers. Instead, we are interested in the political position of the newspapers

relative to each other. In particular, our strategy consists in detecting agenda-setting behavior by

exploiting prior knowledge on the political leaning of the newspapers. We investigate whether there

is any cross-sectional correlation between the di¤erential coverage of economic issues – as a func-

tion of the political a¢ liation of the incumbent president –and more explicit measures of political

orientation, in particular the endorsements of political candidates. In other terms, we want to see

if the political orientation of newspapers “spills over”from the editorial page, where endorsements

are explictly made, to the news section, where di¤erential coverage of the same economic …gures

can then be interpreted as agenda setting.

    We focus on four key economic variables: the unemployment rate, the in‡ation rate, the federal

de…cit, and the trade de…cit. These all represent “bads”.·The incumbent president might be blamed

by the public for high values, or rewarded for low values. Hence, we check whether newspapers that

have a higher propensity to endorse Democratic candidates give less coverage to a given economic

issue when the incumbent president is a Democrat and the corresponding economic indicator is

high and/or rising, compared to the coverage of newspapers that have a propensity to endorse

Republicans. Formally, this amounts to using a regression speci…cation containing a three-way

interaction term. Moreover, since we do not know whether levels or changes in the economic …gures

are more newsworthy, we consider both speci…cations that focus on levels and speci…cations that

consider changes.

    We …nd fairly robust evidence of political partisanship in the coverage of the unemployment

rate. We …nd that newspapers with a pro-Democratic endorsement pattern systematically publish

fewer pieces about unemployment when the national unemployment rate is high and the president is
   1
     On this account, MacKuen, Erikson and Stimson [1992] posit an indirect mechanism of in‡uence, whereas the
state of the economy (in particular the unemployment rate and GDP growth) a¤ects the perceptions voters have
about it, which in turn a¤ects the approval rate of the incumbent president and his vote percentage during the next
elections. On the contrary, as discussed by Erikson [1990], there is no robust evidence suggesting that the economy
has any signi…cant e¤ects on congressional elections.


                                                        2
Democratic than when the national unemployment is equally high and the president is a Republican.

The size of the estimated e¤ects is not negligible. When the unemployment rate was one percentage

point above the average, newspapers with a strong propensity to endorse Republican candidates

reacted with 15% per month more articles under Clinton than under Bush. For the same one

percent increase, newspapers with a strong pro-Democratic endorsement policy have 9% less news

on unemployment under Clinton than under Bush. We …nd instead no evidence of partisan bias in

the coverage on any of the other economic variables we consider.

   Following a recent paper by Gentzkow and Shapiro [2007] on the determinants of the ideological

slant of the language used by U.S. newspapers, we also check whether the agenda bias found for

unemployment coverage depends on demand, i.e. the partisanship of readers.

   While newspapers more heavily sold in Democratic areas indeed tend to give more coverage to

high unemployment under Bush than under Clinton as compared to those sold in Republican areas,

this correlation is no longer signi…cant when controlling for the ideological leaning of endorsements,

properly interacted. On the other hand endorsement partisanship still matters, i.e. Democratic

endorsing newspapers ceteris paribus give systematically more coverage to high unemployment

under Bush than under Clinton as compared to Republican endorsing ones. On this account,

agenda bias in economic news seems more connected with the partisan position of editors, i.e. a

supply factor, rather than with the ideological tastes of readers.

   A salient feature of our approach is that we code newspaper articles through an automatic

keyword search, instead of a human-based content analysis. One advantage of this procedure is

that, by de…nition, it is not intensive in the usage of human capital. Its low cost means that it can

be used to gather data on a large number of news outlets for a long time span, restricted only by

availabilities in digital archives. More importantly, an automatic search is easily replicated, as it is

based on known set of words and/or sentences that are used as classi…ers. Perhaps a limitation of

this approach is that we only classify articles according to the topic covered, without attempting

to code whether their tone is positive or negative. Our focus is therefore exclusively on the agenda-

setting behavior of newspapers, not on the framing of issues through an intentional or unintentional

choice of words. Coding for tone is di¢ cult, especially when dealing with such a nuanced object as

a newspaper article, even using human-based content analysis. Unless the analyst provides detailed

instructions, inter-coder reliability typically falls far short of acceptable standards. And when the

                                                   3
analyst’s instructions are very detailed, then results are likely to be driven by these instructions.

This suggests that coding for the tone using an automated procedure is also likely to be quite

di¢ cult. We view it as an important challenge for future research, however, since the replicability

of machine-based content analysis constitutes an extremely valuable feature for the scienti…c study

of mass media.



2        Related Literature

The theory of agenda setting is built around the idea that mass media can in‡uence the importance

attached to di¤erent issues by readers and viewers.2 As Lippmann [1922] notes, news provided by

the mass media are a primary source of information about public a¤airs, and sometimes the only

one. Beginning with the seminal contribution by McCombs and Shaw [1972] on Chapel Hill voters,

a host of empirical studies have searched for the presence of agenda-setting e¤ects, i.e. of a causal

relationship that goes from the coverage of issues on the mass media to the priorities of the public.

Experimental evidence, such as that provided by Iyengar, Kinder and Peters [1982], lends the

strongest support to this hypothesis. Importantly, the choice of the topics covered by the media

need not be politically neutral. There are several ways that media sources can try to use their

agenda-setting power to favor one political party or the other.

        One way is to exploit the fact that citizens often think that given problems are better handled

by one of the parties. This is the notion of "issue ownership", as introduced by Petrocik [1996],

who found that on some issues a majority of citizens consistently perceives one party to be more

competent than the other. These are the so called “owned issues”. For example, U.S. citizens on

average believe that the Democratic Party is more competent at managing problems related to

welfare and civil rights, while the Republicans are perceived as more competent on defense.3

        In some cases citizens lack consistent opinions about which party is better at handling a given

problem, but they can update their beliefs on the basis of the past and current performance of

the incumbent government with respect to that problem. The economy is a primary example of a

“performance issue”. News about the economy are good news for the incumbent government if the

[1980], Iyengar, Kinder and Peters [1982], Iyengar and Simon [2000] and McCombs [2002].

     On the basis of Gallup Polls and NES data, Puglisi [2006] provides some additional evidence on issue ownership
perceptions in the U.S. from 1948 to 1996.

economy is going well, and bad news if the economy is going badly.

   If mass media outlets have political preferences and can in‡uence the agenda, then there should

be a consistent relationship between the preferences of the outlets and the way economic issues

are covered, as a function of the true economic datum and the “match” between these preferences

and the political a¢ liation of the incumbent administration. From this perspective, our empirical

exercise provides a test of whether newspapers cover economic news in a manner consistent with

the agenda setting hypothesis and with the existence of di¤erences in their political orientation.

   Our paper is also related to the growing empirical literature analyzing the political biases of

the mass media in the United States.

   Ansolabehere, Lessem and Snyder [2006] use panel data to study the political orientation of

endorsements of U.S. newspapers. They …nd that, while in the 40s and in the 50s Republican can-

didates received more endorsements, this advantage has constantly declined in subsequent decades:

in the 90s the authors …nd a slight Democrats’lead (10%) in the average endorsement choice. They

also …nd an upward trend in the average propensity to provide endorsement for candidates already

in o¢ ce. In the 1940s incumbent candidates received 60% of the total endorsements, but this …gure

has increased to about 90% today. Fridkin Kahn and Kenney [2002] analyze how large newspapers

covered 67 Senatorial campaigns across three election years, as a function of their explicit endorse-

ment choices. Through human-based content analysis they code the tone of the articles and …nd

that newspapers systematically gave a more favorable coverage to endorsed incumbents.

   Lott and Hassett [2004] …nd an overall liberal bias in the U.S. press. They study a panel of

389 U.S. newspapers from 1991 to 2004 (and a sub-sample of them from 1985 to 2004), focusing

on economic news, i.e. looking at how newspapers cover the release of o¢ cial data on a set of

economic indicators. Their identi…cation strategy is based on the fact that newspapers can provide

a more positive or negative account of the same statistical …gure, depending on the party a¢ liation

of the incumbent president. Lott and Hassett …nd that there are, on average, between 9.6 and 14.7

percent fewer positive stories when the incumbent president is a Republican, controlling for the

economic data being released. Di¤erently from our paper, the main focus of Lott and Hassett is on

the tone of coverage and the absolute average political position of U.S. newspapers. They do not

estimate di¤erent positions for di¤erent newspapers.

   Groseclose and Milyo [2005] also …nd a liberal bias in the U.S. press. They trace out which

                                                 5
think tanks are quoted by each media outlet considered in their sample. The political leaning

of each think tank is recovered by looking at the political position (ADA score) of members of

the U.S. Congress who quote the same think-tank in a non-negative way. The political leaning

of each outlet can then be calculated by looking at the frequency with which the various think

thanks are quoted. Groseclose and Milyo …nd that all the outlets in their sample – except Fox

News’Special Report and the Washington Times –are located to the left of the average Congress

member. At the same time, all outlets but one are located between the average Democrat and the

average Republican Congressmen, hence displaying a high degree of centrism. In a similar fashion,

Gentzkow and Shapiro [2007] provide another measure of media bias based on similarities between

the language used by media outlets and congressmen. Exploiting the Congressional Record, they

identify “partisan” words and phrases – i.e., those expressions that show the largest di¤erence in

the frequency of use between Democratic and Republican representatives. They then measure how

frequently these expressions appear in di¤erent newspapers. They conclude that the partisan bias

of newspapers depends mainly on consumers’ ideological leaning and far less on the identity of

owners.

   An account of the agenda setting behavior of the New York Times in the period 1946-1997

is provided by Puglisi [2006], who …nds that the Times displays Democratic partisanship, with

some watchdog aspects. Puglisi …nds that, during presidential campaigns, the New York Times

systematically gives more coverage to Democratic topics (civil rights, health care, labor and social

welfare ) when the incumbent president is a Republican. The New York Times displays a more

symmetric type of watchdog behavior after 1960: in the last four decades, during presidential

campaigns the Times also gives more coverage to the typically Republican issue of Defense when

the incumbent president is a Democrat, and less so when the incumbent is a Republican.

   Finally, a di¤erent and less studied type of bias consists in the overprovision of news that are

of interest to a worthy audience, i.e. an audience which is more valuable to advertisers. A formal

model that illustrates this mechanism is provided by Stromberg [2004], while evidence on the UK

is given in Larcinese [2007].

   Recent advances have also been made regarding the e¤ects of mass media on political decisions

and attitudes. Gerber, Karlan and Bergan [2006] conduct a randomized control trial just prior to

the November 2005 gubernatorial election in Virginia and randomly assign individuals in Northern

                                                 6
Virginia to (a) a treatment group that receives a free subscription to the Washington Post, (b)

a treatment group that receives a free subscription to the Washington Times, or (c) a control

group. They …nd that individuals who were assigned to the Washington Post treatment group

were eight percentage points more likely to vote for the Democrat in the 2005 election, while those

who were assigned the Washington Times were only four percentage points more likely to vote for

the Democrat.4 DellaVigna and Kaplan [2007] use a quasi-experimental approach, and exploit the

gradual introduction of Fox News in cable markets in order to estimate its impact on the vote share

in presidential elections, between 1996 and 2000. They …nd that Republicans gained 0.4 to 0.7

percentage points in the towns which started to broadcast Fox News before 2000.

        To sum up, our paper shares with Groseclose and Milyo [2005] and Gentzkow and Shapiro [2007]

the focus on relative rather than absolute political positions of U.S. media outlets and with Lott

and Hassett [2004] the focus on economic news. However, it is the only paper that analyzes the

agenda setting behavior of media outlets.5 On a methodological ground, ours is the …rst paper

that combines machine-based replicable data on news with information on explicit endorsement

patterns.



3        Data and empirical strategy

We collected data from the NewsLibrary electronic archive, recording the monthly number of hits on

unemployment and in‡ation, and the quarterly number of hits on the federal budget de…cit and the

trade de…cit.6 First, through a number of preliminary searches we de…ned the exact wording of the

search strings in order to reduce the number of false positive and false negative hits. Once identi…ed

the appropriate keywords (reported in Table 1), we run an automated search, then retrieving the

number of hits on each topic by time unit. Overall, we collected data on 140 U.S. newspapers for

which electronic archives dating back to 1996 are available to be searched through NewsLibrary.

        In this section we will …rst illustrate the procedure used to recover the endorsement propensity of

the various newspapers. We will then present the economic news data and a two-stage preliminary

investigation of the data. This illustrates our empirical strategy, although in a less rigorous fashion.

We will then be ready to present our panel speci…cation.


3.1      The endorsement data

We were able to gather endorsement data for 102 newspapers. Table A1 lists the newspapers with

endorsement data, together with the chain to which they belong, if any.

       We obtained the endorsement data for 85 newspapers from Ansolabehere, Lessem and Snyder

[2006], and supplemented this with data on 17 additional newspapers searched via the NewsLibrary

archive. For the remaining 38 newspapers, in some cases the newspaper has an explicit policy not to

endorse candidates for political o¢ ces (e.g. the Deseret News in Salt Lake City, the Orange County

Register, and the Colorado Springs Gazette). In addition, many smaller ones do not bother to

make endorsements, even though they may not take an explicit editorial stance on the subject.

       Following Ansolabehere, Lessem and Snyder [2006] we can calculate the propensity of each

newspaper to endorse one of the parties during electoral campaigns. We used a linear regression

model to estimate the “partisan bias” in endorsement behavior. Let i index o¢ ces, let j index

newspapers and let t index years. Let

The newspaper-speci…c …xed e¤ects, N Ej , capture newspapers’ partisanship.10 Figure 1 reports

the histogram of the resulting estimated variable. In the graphic, 0 is the neutral point, positive

values indicate a propensity to endorse Democratic candidates and negative values a propensity

to endorse Republican candidates. The endorsement variable, which is only based on editorials,

indicates a slight prevalence, on average, of pro-Democratic endorsements. On the other hand,

it also shows a wider dispersion on the Republican side: in other words there is a prevalence of

pro-Democratic endorsers but Republican endorsers tend to be more systematic. Overall, however,

most newspapers appear to be centrist, in the sense that they are placed in the range [ 0:5; 0:5] in

the endorsement scale (i.e. within the vertical lines). Figure 2 features a scatter plot in which the

Democratic endorsement score for each newspaper is represented on the horizontal axis, while the

vertical axis displays the average circulation in 1996. Newspapers selling more than 400,000 copies

are represented by their name, and smaller papers are represented with dots. Interestingly, the

larger newspapers tend to be relatively centrist in their endorsement behavior, as they are typically

placed in the range [ 0:5; 0:5] on the endorsement scale. The more partisan newspapers, outside

this range, tend to have more modest circulation.

    The question we address is now whether partisanship is only limited to endorsements or rather,

in a less transparent way, it is re‡ected in the coverage of economic news in an agenda-setting

     The panel is unbalanced, since we do not have endorsement data on some newspapers in the earlier years.

fashion. To do this we need to compare newspapers’ coverage of given issues with the actual

statistical …gures on in‡ation, unemployment, budget de…cit and trade de…cit.


3.2      The economic news data: a preliminary investigation

The key variables in our analysis are the values of the four underlying economic indicators, and the

amount of newspaper coverage devoted to the four economic issues. Since newspapers vary greatly

in size cross-sectionally (total number of pages, stories, and words), and can also vary in size over

time, we focus on the relative frequency of stories in each newspaper. Table 1 reports the keywords

that we use11 .

       Let EVti be the value of the economic …gure regarding issue i at time t, where i 2 fU; I; B; T g

and U stands for "unemployment", I for "in‡ation", B for budget de…cit, and T for trade de…cit.

Let nijt be the relative frequency of pieces published by newspaper j during time t about issue i.12

       In order to take into account the di¤erences in the average amount of coverage devoted to eco-

nomic news by the various newspapers, we normalize the relative frequency of stories in newspaper

j on issue i at time t by subtracting the average relative frequency of stories in that newspaper,

i.e. we consider
                                                     i
                                                    yjt = nijt          nij

For each newspaper j and each economic issue i 2 fU; I; B; T g, we then run a separate OLS

regression:
                     i      i       i    i       i            i     i               i        i              i
                    yjt =   j   +   j EVt    +   j DPt   +    j (EVt      DPt ) +   jt   +   j   ln sjt +   jt   (2)

where DPt is a dummy variable indicating that the incumbent president is a Democrat. In addition,

we control for a linear time trend and for the logarithm of the total number of articles in each
                                                         i
newspaper at time t, sjt . The coe¢ cient                j   represents the di¤erence in how newspaper j reacts

to bad economic news when the president is Democratic compared to when the president is a

Republican. Positive values indicate that the newspaper is more reactive to bad economic news
  11
     A potential concern is that all the variation in the coverage of economic news might be driven by editorials
themselves. Hence, we have re-run the searches excluding the words “editorial”or “editor”. We explore the robustness
of our results to this narrower de…nition of coverage in section 5.3. We proxy the total number of stories in each
newspaper in each period by running a search on the word “and”.
  12
     Table 2 displays summary statistics of the relative frequency of stories and the economic …gures of interest for
the 1996-2005 period.



                                                               10
when the incumbent president is a Democrat13

       Next, we exploit the information we have about the explicit political position of each newspaper,

as proxied by its endorsement pattern. In Figures 3-6 we analyze the relationship between the

estimated interaction terms from equation (2) and the estimated propensity to endorse Democratic

candidates obtained from equation (1). Again, we explicitly report the names of newspapers with
                                                             d
circulation above 400,000 copies. The two vertical lines –at N Ej =                           d
                                                                                      0:5 and N E j = 0:5 –divide

the sample of newspapers, crudely, into those with pro-Republican endorsement pattern, those with

a relative neutral patterns, and those with a pro-Democratic pattern. Each graph also displays a
                                                                     i
bivariate regression line, i.e. the …tted values of a regression of bj over N
                                                                            d E j and a constant.

       In the case of unemployment news (Figure 3), the relationship between the endorsement variable

and the estimated interaction term is negative and statistically signi…cant at the 95% con…dence

level, using heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. This indicates that newspapers with a pro-

Democratic editorial partisanship tended to give less coverage to unemployment during periods of

high unemployment under Clinton than under George W. Bush, as compared to newspapers with

a pro-Republican endorsement partisanship. The opposite is true during periods of low unemploy-

ment.

       Figure 4 displays results regarding the coverage of in‡ation. The …tted values show a mild

and positive relationship between the endorsement variable and the estimated interaction terms.

However, this relationship is statistically insigni…cant (t-value = 0.49). Figure 5 represents the same

relationship for the coverage of the budget de…cit. In this case the estimated slope is negative and

statistically insigni…cant (t-value = 1.24). Finally Figure 6 shows the results for the trade de…cit,

and shows a mildly negative but statistically insigni…cant relationship (t-value = 0.32) between the

estimated interaction terms and the endorsement variable.


3.3      Panel speci…cation

This simple two-stage graphical analysis gives a mixed picture of the link between endorsement

policy and coverage of economic news. On one hand we …nd some evidence of a partisan bias in the
  13
    If we had data for a period long enough to cover numerous presidents, it would be possible to treat this interaction
term as a measure of the absolute pro-Republican bias of a newspaper. However, given the short time span available,
the time series variation by itself could easily be misleading. In particular, other newsworthy events and issues could
be crowding out economic news more in some years than others.



                                                          11
amount of coverage devoted to unemployment. On the other hand, we …nd small and statistically

insigni…cant relationships for in‡ation, the budget and the trade de…cit.

         Here, we perform a more structured test. Rather than analyzing newspapers one at a time,

we exploit fully the panel nature of our data. We will therefore estimate three-way speci…cations

containing an interaction term between the economic variable EV i , an indicator for Democratic
                                                               d
president DPt and the newspaper-speci…c endorsement propensity N E j 14 . A basic three-way spec-

i…cation is the following (we omit the indicator i of the economic issue):15


                 njt =     j   +   1 EVt   +   2
                                                                                  d
                                                    EVt + DPt + (EVt DPt ) + (DPt N Ej ) +

                                d
                         +#(EVt N                  d
                                  E j ) + (EVt DPt N Ej ) +                     jt   + ln sjt +   jt   (Speci…cation A)


where we include newspaper …xed e¤ects                  j,   newspaper-speci…c trends       j   and sensitivity to news-

paper size (in logarithm) . We also control for the change                      EVt in the economic variable. Our

coe¢ cient of interest is . A negative value of                     implies that newspapers which tend to endorse

Democratic candidates have a relatively pro-Democratic agenda-setting bias (on economic item i),

compared to newspapers that tend to endorse Republican candidates. In this speci…cation we can-

not include time speci…c dummies since we have other variables that, in each given period, do not

vary across newspapers. However, time dummies can be quite important in order to capture the

in‡uence that contemporaneous events can have on the space devoted to economic news. Hence, in

a second speci…cation we include time-dummies                   t   but exclude other variables that, in each period,

do not vary across newspapers:




                 njt =     j   +   t
                                              d
                                       + (DPt N               d
                                                E j ) + #(EVt N                  d
                                                                E j ) + (EVt DPt N Ej ) +

                         + j t + ln sjt +          jt                                                  (Speci…cation B)


                                                                      d
         Finally, in our most demanding speci…cation, we replace (DPt N                 d
                                                                        E j ) and #(EVt N E j ) with,
   14
      From now on, since all speci…cations include newspaper-speci…c …xed e¤ects, the dependent variable is simply
nijt . Also, to take into account the fact that the …xed e¤ects may not absorb the entire within-newspaper correlation
in the error term, we run all regressions clustering the standard errors by newspaper.
   15
      In the baseline speci…cation we control for the contemporaneous value of the relevant economic …gure (xt ), by
itself and properly interacted. For reasons that will be discussed in Section 5.1, we will also re-run all regressions by
using lagged values of the economic variables.


                                                               12
respectively, newspaper-speci…c Democratic president e¤ects and newspaper-speci…c issue-variable

e¤ects:


     njt =   j   +   t   +   j xt   +   j DPt
                                                           d
                                                + (EVt DPt N Ej ) +   jt   + ln sjt +   jt   (Speci…cation C)


This speci…cation is the most general since we allow newspapers to react di¤erently to changes in

the president and in the unemployment rate not just in function of their endorsement partisanship

but also of any other unobserved newspaper characteristics.

    Since it is a priori unclear which aspect of an economic …gure is deemed as more newsworthy by

editors and journalists (whether it is the level thereof, or the change, or both), we also re-consider

the same three speci…cations by using the change in the relevant economic …gure rather than the

levels in the interaction terms. In this case we keep the level of the economic variable as a control.

We …nd, however, no signi…cant results when we focus on changes. The tables are therefore not

reported but are available from the authors upon request.



4    Results

Table 3 displays the results about unemployment, in‡ation, budget de…cit and trade de…cit respec-

tively. We report t-statistics in brackets below each coe¢ cient.

    The results in Table 3 con…rm that newspapers with a pro-Democratic-endorsement pattern,

compared to pro-Republican newspapers, give less coverage to unemployment in times of high

unemployment under Clinton than under George W. Bush. The three-way interaction between the

level of the unemployment rate, the Democratic President dummy and the Democratic endorsement

variable always comes with the expected negative sign and is signi…cant at the 5% level in all three

speci…cations. The magnitude of the coe¢ cient is also very stable across speci…cations. We …nd,

however, no comparable e¤ect for any of the other economic variables we consider. For in‡ation,

budget de…cit and trade de…cit the three-way interaction is always very far from any acceptable

signi…cance level and therefore statistically indistinguishable from zero.

    To calculate the magnitude of the e¤ect for unemployment news we group the newspapers

into quantiles on the basis of their endorsement patterns. Then, for each group, we compute the



                                                          13
di¤erence between the average predicted change in the number of unemployment stories under

Clinton and under George W. Bush, if the unemployment rate is one percentage point higher than

the average. The magnitudes refer to newspapers belonging to the …rst, third and …fth quintile in

the endorsement distribution, i.e. newspapers that we de…ne as, respectively, strongly Republican,

“neutral,” and strongly Democratic. The estimated e¤ects are not trivial. Newspapers will react

to a 1% increase in the unemployment rate di¤erently depending on whether the president is

Democratric or Republican: under a Democratic president a strongly Republican newspaper will

provide 15% more news on unemployment than if the same 1% increase in the unemployment rate

happens under a Republican president. On the other side, considering again a 1% increase in the

unemployment rate, a strongly Democratic newspaper will provide 9% less news on unemployment

under a Democratic president than under a Republican president. The di¤erential treatment of the

same change under the two presidents is instead limited to 1% for a "neutral" newspaper.

       Some data analysts might be tempted to treat the average di¤erence in slopes across Democratic

and Republican presidents (the s) as a measure of the average absolute level of bias across the

newspapers in our sample. We are not. The reason is that the time sample is too short, so

we are only comparing two presidents; the underlying economic conditions were di¤erent under

the two presidents, so functional form is a major concern; and many other newsworthy events

(terrorist attacks, war in Iraq, Monica Lewinsky scandal, O.J. Simpson trial) might have crowded

out economic news di¤erentially under the two presidents. Compared to recent literature on media

bias (see Lott and Hassett, 2004), we would place little emphasis on such coe¢ cients.16 Finally,

it is interesting to note that the coe¢ cients on the interaction between the unemployment rate

and the endorsement variable (the #s) are positive and statistically signi…cant. In other terms,

coverage by Democratic-endorsing newspapers is more reactive to high unemployment than by

Republican-leaning ones, even when controlling with the triple interaction for the partisan e¤ect.
  16
     If one did use the coe¢ cients in this way, the picture would be mixed. The estimated di¤erence in slopes is
negative and signi…cantly di¤erent from zero in the case of unemployment, in‡ation and trade de…cit, suggesting
a pro-Democratic bias. That is, newspapers on average devoted more attention to unemployment (in‡ation, trade
de…cit) during periods of high unemployment under George W. Bush than under Clinton, and vice versa for periods
of low unemployment. On the other hand, for the budget de…cit the estimate suggests a Pro-Republican bias. At the
same time, budget de…cit and unemployment were generally decreasing under Clinton and were increasing during the
George W. Bush years. Hence, it is hard to determine whether the coe¢ cients re‡ect a partisan bias in coverage or
simply a judgement about the importance of the direction of a change (i.e. increases vs. decreases) for a particular
economic variable.

5     Robustness checks

In this section we check the robustness of our results. We implemented a number of checks for all

the economic variables considered and we noticed no change in our conclusion regarding in‡ation,

budget de…cit and trade de…cit: there is no noticeable statistically signi…cant bias in the covering

of these issues. In this section, therefore, we only report results that concern unemployment, the

only economic variable on which we found agenda setting behavior by part of the newspapers.


5.1   Lagged values of the economic …gures

It is a priori unclear whether newsworthy economic events are more correlated with contemporane-

ous values of the relevant economic …gures, or lagged values. The Bureau of Economic Analysis and

the Bureau of Labor Statistics (or any statistical agency assigned to similar tasks) can only publish

lagged values of macroeconomic variables. However, newspapers do not only report on the release of

o¢ cial data (which are related to what happened in the past) but also on contemporaneous events

which may be correlated with the current value of the relevant macroeconomic …gure. For example,

with respect to unemployment, there might be news stories on large layo¤s in a given sector or

by a particular large …rm, or reports of large current spikes in applications at local unemployment

agencies. It might be useful, therefore, to check if our results are sensitive or not to the presence

of lags in the economic variables.

    The …rst three columns of Tab. 4 parallel the …rst three columns of Table 3 but use lagged

instead of contemporary unemployment. The results previously obtained are all con…rmed and the

magnitudes are also very similar (slightly larger under speci…cations A and B, slightly smaller using

speci…cation C). The R-squared also show that the overall …t is comparable in the two cases.


5.2   Controlling for state-level unemployment

Newspapers typically have a locally concentrated readership that cares about local events, and

local aspects of common phenomena. Since there is noticeable variation in unemployment across

regions and states, the local unemployment rate in an area or state may represent a newsworthy

issue. This can potentially introduce an omitted variables bias. The concern is that, in Democratic-

voting areas, the local unemployment rate could be systematically lower than its average when the


                                                 15
incumbent president is a Democrat, because of public job-creating projects being targeted to the

area. If the political partisanship of potential readers in the area where a newspaper sells is posi-

tively correlated with its endorsement policy, then the less intense coverage of high unemployment

by Democratic-leaning newspapers under a Democratic president could be driven by the fact that

the local unemployment rate is lower in those areas where the newspapers are sold. This would not

indicate a partisan bias trickling down from the editorial page to the economic news section, but

simple reporting on local economic conditions.

       To address this issue, we re-ran our regressions controlling for both the level and change of

the unemployment rate in the state where each newspaper is based17 . The results are reported in

columns 4-6 of Table 4. Again we …nd a systematic correlation between the endorsement policy

and the di¤erential coverage of unemployment. The size and signi…cance of the coe¢ cients of the

three-way interaction terms are very similar to those reported in Table 3. The coe¢ cients of the

level of the unemployment rate in the state is positive and signi…cant at standard con…dence levels.

Similarly, the coverage of unemployment is positively and signi…cantly correlated with the change in

the state unemployment rate. Consequently, we will keep state unemployment levels and variations

as control variables in the next checks.


5.3      Excluding editorials

The results found so far could be driven by what is featured on editorial pages themselves. Therefore

we repeat our regressions by excluding editorials from our dependent variable.18 The results are

presented in columns 7-9 of Table 4, again using the same A-B-C speci…cations and including

levels and changes in state unemployment rates. The results are very reassuring: the coe¢ cient of

the three-way interaction is again negative and signi…cant, the magnitude is only slightly inferior

to what we found in the previous cases. To sum up, a large part of the di¤erential coverage of

unemployment takes place on the news pages, not merely on the editorial ones, suggesting that

agenda-setting indeed spills over into the economic news section.
  17
     Because of multicollinearity problems, while the slope of unemployment news with respect to the national unem-
ployment rate is allowed to be newspaper-speci…c, the slopes with respect to state level unemployment rate and its
change are common across newspapers.
  18
     We consider news on unemployment excluding the words “editorial” or “editor”. To pin down the size of the
news section of each newspaper during each month, we have run a search on the word “and”, excluding again the
words “editorial” or “editor”.

5.4      Chain-based and large newspapers

Given that we rely on electronic archives, there is a trade o¤ between the length of the time span

we can study and the number of newspapers for which data are available. For the period 1996-2005

we can rely on 102 newspapers but this number shrinks rapidly as we extend backward the period

we consider. Using di¤erent time windows, our results turn out not to be always robust:19 however,

we cannot say whether this is due to the usage of a di¤erent sample of newspapers or rather to

features speci…c to the period considered. Hence, to mantain some consistency across periods, we

explore the robustness of our results for the subsample of large-scale newspapers, i.e. those that

sell a large number of copies (above 200,000 copies per day on average in 1996) and/or belong to

large chains.20 It could be the case that managing editors and journalists of large-scale newspapers

are more conscious of the political facets of their agenda setting behavior, and act accordingly. In

other terms, the relationship between the endorsement policy and the coverage of economic news

might be less noisy (and hence less susceptible to sample size) when restricting our attention to

this subset of newspapers.

       There are 72 large-scale newspapers if one considers the 1996-2005 time-window. The amount

shrinks to 59 in the period 1992-2005 and to 32 for 1988-2005. Table 5 reports our results for the

three periods respectively. Once again, the three-way interaction comes with the expected negative

sign and acceptable signi…cance levels. For the period 1988-2005 we notice a reduction of about 1/3

in the size of the coe¢ cient compared with the results of Table 3. This reduction is even stronger

for the period 1992-2005. On the contrary, when we consider the 1996-2005 period, the coe¢ cient

turns out to be substantially larger for chain-based and large newspapers (columns 7-9 in Table

5) than for the whole sample (columns 1-3 in Table 3). In brief, although the magnitudes of the

relevant coe¢ cient may vary by a relevant amount, Table 5 substantially con…rms all the results

we found in the previous regressions.
  19
     The statistical signi…cance of the three-way interaction coe¢ cient disappears if we consider the period 1992-
2005 but reappears at the 5% level for the period 1988-2005. Moreover, regarding the 1992-2005 period, if one
excludes the Washington Times and/or the Manchester Union-Leader from the sample, the triple interaction comes
out strongly signi…cant again. One should notice here that in our sample the Washington Times is the most extreme
newspaper endorsement-wise. Moreover, the Union-Leader, a decidedly Republican paper, is the only one based in
New Hampshire, which in 1992 was hit by the worst depression of the last forty years.

Gentzkow and Shapiro’s [2007] thorough analysis of language similarity between congressmen and

U.S. newspapers suggests that the ideological position of the latter is strongly correlated with the

political leaning of their readers. On the other hand, once geographical factors are taken into

account, the owner’s identity has very little or no explanatory power on the political leaning of a

given newspaper.

       In the previous sections we have investigated whether the explicit political position of a news-

paper, as proxied by its endorsement choices, trickles down from the editorial to the news section,

in‡uencing the coverage of economic news. One might be concerned that editors tune their en-

dorsement choices to the ideological leaning of readers, so that our endorsement variable is merely

proxying for a demand factor which also determines economic coverage. According to this view,

both endorsement choices and the partisan coverage of economic news are determined by what

customers would like to read, with no independent role for the newspaper’s editorial position, i.e.

a supply factor.

       In order to address this concern we proceed as follows. First, as a proxy for the average political

position of readers of a given newspaper j, we weight the average Democratic vote in presidential,

senatorial and gubernatorial elections in each county during the time period by the relative sales

of that newspaper in that county. Let this variable be N Rj . We then replicate our three baseline
                                                    d
speci…cations by replacing the endorsement variable N E j with the readership variable N Rj . For
                                                                                  d
all three speci…cations, we also consider an extended model where we include both N E j and N Rj ,

properly interacted with the Democratic President dummy DPt and the level EVt of the economic

variable.

       Table displays results for the contemporaneous unemployment rate.21 When not controlling

for the endorsement behaviour, the coe¢ cient on the triple interaction between the unemployment

rate, the Democratic President dummy and the voter partisanship variable is negative and statis-

tically signi…cant. However, this triple interaction is no longer signi…cant when introducing back

the endorsement controls. On the other hand, the coe¢ cient on the triple interaction with the

endorsement score is negative and mildly statistically signi…cant even after controlling for readers’
  21
    We obtain very similar results (available upon request) when controlling for the lagged level of the unemployment
rate.

partisanship. A relevant concern here is the correlation between reader and endorsement parti-

sanship, which might create problems of approximate multicollinearity when these variables are

twice interacted with the same controls (the Democratic president dummy and the level of the

unemployment rate).22

    However, the raw correlation between the partisanship of endorsements and that of voters is

just 0.21, i.e. quite low. While positive, and statistically signi…cant (p-value = .031), it is hardly

overwhelming.23 Evidently there is a lot of “slack” between voters and editors.

    Since it remains di¢ cult to disentangle the direction of causality with data whose relevant

variation is ultimately cross-sectional, a possible empirical strategy consists in using time series

data and exploit some (possibly) exogenous shock in the partisanship of readers across regions, or

in the editorial position of newspapers, as triggered by a change in ownership or management. An

interesting case in hand is represented by the succession of Otis Chandler in 1960 as publisher of

the Los Angeles Times, the newspaper his family owned since 1884. The LA Times used to have a

clear conservative slant, which was overturned by Chandler, who aimed at making it a credible rival

of the New York Times. Figure 7 shows the time series variation in the propensity of the LA Times

to endorse Democratic candidates, together with the average yearly share of the Democratic vote

in presidential, senatorial and gubernatorial elections in California. In the 60s, after Otis Chandler

took o¢ ce, there was a steep increase in the propensity to endorse Democratic candidates, which

was not matched at all by a comparatively rapid surge in the Democratic vote.

    The top two scatter plots in Figure 8 show the relationship between the actual unemployment

rate and the relative frequency of unemployment stories on the LA Times, before and after 1965.

In each graph, coverage-unemployment combinations under a Democratic (Republican) President

are indexed by a one (zero). The bottom two graphs parallel the top ones, showing the same

relationship for the in‡ation rate. Regression lines between the economic variable and its coverage,

as a function of the political a¢ liation of the incumbent President, are reported. The two scatter
  22
     Indeed, if we introduce newspaper-speci…c controls for newspaper size instead of a common one, under speci…cation
A and B the three way e¤ect with voter partisanship is mildly signi…cant even when controlling for endorsement
partisanship. The triple interaction with the endorsement score stays signi…cant under all three speci…cations. These
results are available upon request.
  23
     One relevant concern here is that this low correlation might be driven by the presence in the sample of newspapers
that are based in large cities with a politically segmented media market, like Chicago, New York and Los Angeles.
However, if we exclude those newspapers (in our case the Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles
Times and the New York Times), the resulting correlation slightly drops to 0.2 (p-value = .045).

plots on the left show that before 1965 the LA Times systematically gave more coverage to high

unemployment and in‡ation under a Democratic President than a Republican one24 . On the other

hand, according to the two graphs on the right, in the post-1965 period there is no systematic

di¤erence in the slopes under presidents of di¤erent political a¢ liation.

         Ideally, this anedoctal evidence should be backed up by the analysis of a large sample of news-

papers, with enough time series variation in their ownership and management. However, coupled

with our previous analysis of endorsement patterns, it is indicative of the fact that supply side

factors might play a non-negligible role in determining the political position of mass media outlets,

in this case a¤ecting the partisan coverage of economic news.



6         Discussion and conclusions

In this paper we have analyzed the relationship between the endorsement policy of U.S. news-

papers and the coverage of economic issues, as a function of the true economic datum and the

political a¢ liation of the incumbent president. Considering the last decade, there is strong evi-

dence that newspapers endorsing Democratic candidates give less coverage to high unemployment

(and more coverage to low unemployment) under Clinton than under George W. Bush, as com-

pared to Republican-leaning newspapers. This relationship is very robust to a number of alternative

speci…cations and robustness checks. On the other hand, there is no evidence of a systematic cor-

relation between the endorsement policy and the coverage of in‡ation, the budget de…cit and the

trade de…cit.

         These …ndings deserve further explorations. On one side, …nding evidence of agenda setting

behavior only on one economic issue out of four could induce us to reject the idea that there is

any relevant ideologically slanted agenda setting in economic news on the U.S. press. On the other

side, unemployment is, of the four considered, the most salient issue. Moreover, as discussed in the

introduction, there is a large body of evidence according to which citizens assess the incumbent

president’s performance on the basis of how strong the economy is, and vote accordingly in the next

presidential elections. Citizens are also better able to grasp the signi…cance of a high unemployment

rate, because of the dire consequences this might have on their personal lives.
    24
         This is formally con…rmed by proper di¤erence-in-di¤erences regressions, available upon request from the authors.



                                                              20
    This latter statement likely applies to the in‡ation rate as well, but the independence of the

Federal Reserve makes harder for the public to establish links between presidential policies and its

variation. Also, even if citizens are largely unaware of the institutional independence of the FED,

in the time period under consideration in‡ation was very low25 , so that it was not perceived as a

serious problem policy makers had to tackle. It is also interesting to note that - in the long run

analysis of the LA Times presented in section 5.5 - the succession of Otis Chandler as publisher

seemed to matter not only with regards to the partisan coverage of unemployment, but for in‡ation

as well. It is indeed the case that, during the longer time period we considered there, the in‡ation

rate was often higher than in the more recent period, sometimes much higher, like in the late 40s,

the 70s and the early 80s. At those times the rise in the cost of living was widely perceived as a

very serious issue.

    Finally, the budget de…cit and the trade de…cit are more arcane variables, whose in‡uence

on presidential approval is far from clear and whose signi…cance citizens understand much less,

perhaps because of the lack of direct e¤ects on their personal lives, perhaps because the e¤ects are

not immediate and can therefore be heavily discounted. In the American National Election Studies

1992-2004, unemployment came in second as the “most important problem facing the nation”

(crime being …rst). Nearly 10% of respondents mentioned it. By comparison, less than 0.5% of

respondents mentioned in‡ation, and even counting generously, only about 1.5% of respondents

mentioned trade issues (only 0.33% of respondents mentioned the trade de…cit speci…cally, and

more respondents mentioned “international competitiveness” or “outsourcing”, which might be

treated more appropriately as employment issues).26

    As mentioned in the introduction, we only study agenda-setting and do not attempt to estimate

any framing of economic events done through tone. Another limitation of our approach is that we

simply count the number of articles featuring the chosen keywords.27

    Still, our approach to the study of mass media is very ‡exible and easily replicable. This
  25
     During the 1996-2005 period, the highest in‡ation rate was about 4.7% (September 2005). In the 1988-2005
period, the peak of around 6.3% was reached in October 1990.
  26
     Unfortunately, we cannot separate the government de…cit from other mentions about government spending being
too high.
  27
     One could for example re…ne the search algorithm to code the page number and newspaper section on which
each piece appears. In particular, one could give a higher weight to front page stories, or separately consider them in
the analysis. A further improvement (which is more di¢ cult to implement within an automated search) would be to
weight articles by their length.

allows to readily extend the dataset and type of analysis in several directions. First, it would be

worthwhile to try and gather data on additional newspapers for the early 90s and late 80s, in order

to shed some further light on the robustness of our results with respect to the time-window being

considered. Moreover, historical electronic archives like ProQuest can be used to construct long

time series on the coverage of economic issues by a handful of newspapers. Secondly, any debate

on the extent of “mass media bias” in the U.S. should be put into a comparative perspective.28

Given that the economy represents a salient issue in almost all countries, one could use the same

keywords-based search procedure on the electronic archives of newspapers and media outlets in

other countries, and construct similar datasets to the one analyzed here. The purpose of such an

exercise would be to compare –on a cross-country basis –the amount of within-country variation

in the di¤erential coverage of relevant economic …gures, as a function of the political a¢ liation of

the incumbent government and the level itself of the economic …gure.
