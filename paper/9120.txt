                                                ABSTRACT

        Understanding the nature and magnitude of resource reallocation, particularly as it relates to
productivity growth, is important both because it affects how we model and interpret aggregate
productivity dynamics, and also because market structure and institutions may affect the reallocation’s
magnitude and efficiency. Most evidence to date on the connection between reallocation and productivity
dynamics for the U.S. and other countries comes from a single industry: manufacturing. Building upon
a unique establishment-level data set of U.S. retail trade businesses, we provide some of the first evidence
on the connection between reallocation and productivity dynamics in a non-manufacturing sector. Retail
trade is a particularly appropriate subject for such a study since this large industry lies at the heart of many
recent technological advances, such as E-commerce and advanced inventory controls. Our results show
that virtually all of the productivity growth in the U.S. retail trade sector over the 1990s is accounted for
by more productive entering establishments displacing much less productive exiting establishments.
Interestingly, much of the between-establishment reallocation is a within, rather than between-firm
phenomenon.

1.      Introduction

        What is the connection between productivity growth and the ongoing reallocation of outputs and

inputs in a market economy? There are many different dimensions to the answer to this question.

Aggregate productivity growth might, as in the simple neoclassical growth model, be driven by common

technology shocks and the ongoing high pace of reallocation observed in market economies might

primarily reflect idiosyncratic shocks that largely cancel out in the aggregate. Under this view, the

dynamics of technological change and productivity growth can be modeled and studied by examining the

changes that occur at the average (or representative) establishment. Alternatively, the reallocation

process may be intertwined with the dynamics of technological change. It may be the case that adopting

new production processes and introducing new products is a noisy and complex process involving trial

and error, uncertainty, and irreversibilities at particular establishments. Under this view, the dynamics

of technological changes and productivity growth will be closely connected to the reallocation of

production inputs and output across establishments rather than via changes within establishments.

Moreover, the reallocation may occur at the margins of establishment entry and exit. If technological

change does occur predominantly through the reallocation process then the costs of technological change

must be modeled in terms of these reallocation dynamics. Under this latter case, distortions in market

structure, institutions, and government policies that impact the reallocation process in turn impact the

level and growth in productivity. Thus it may be that understanding differences in the level and growth

in productivity across countries, regions, sectors and time requires understanding the differences in the

reallocation dynamics induced by these factors.

        A growing empirical literature exploiting longitudinal business-level data to explore the

connection between reallocation and productivity dynamics has emerged in the last decade.1 This body


        1
          Papers that have focused on the connection between micro and aggregate productivity growth
include: (a) for the United States: Baily, Hulten and Campbell (1992), Baily, Bartelsman and

                                                     1
of work has shown that a substantial fraction of aggregate productivity growth is associated with the

reallocation of outputs and inputs from less productive to more productive individual microeconomic

units. Moreover, entry and exit of establishments play an important role in this reallocation. In the U.S.,

roughly thirty percent of productivity growth (measured as either multifactor or labor productivity) over a

ten-year horizon is accounted for by more productive entering plants displacing less productive exiting

plants.2 While we have learned much from this work for both the U.S. and other countries, much of the

analysis has focused on one sector: manufacturing. In this paper, we explore the connection between

reallocation and productivity dynamics using newly constructed longitudinal establishment data for the

retail trade sector in the United States.

        An investigation of the retail trade sector in this context is interesting in its own right and poses a

host of new measurement and conceptual questions. According to official Bureau of Labor Statistics

(BLS) productivity statistics, retail trade as a whole experienced moderate overall labor productivity

growth during the last decade. The BLS labor productivity statistics for retail trade are based upon a

measure of gross output (essentially real gross sales) per hour. While some questions can be raised about

this as a measure of productivity (which we discuss below), we also adopt this measure. Changes in this

measure at the industry or retail establishment level potentially reflect changes in technology, industry

structure, and consumer demand preferences. In retail trade, an obviously important factor in

determining the relative success of an establishment is the location of the establishment. The Census


Haltiwanger (1996, 1997), Bartelsman and Dhrymes (1998), Dwyer (1998, 1997), Foster, Haltiwanger
and Krizan (2001), and Olley and Pakes (1996); (b) for other countries: Aw, Chen and Roberts (2001),
Disney, Haskel, and Heden (2000), Liu and Tybout (1996), Griliches and Regev (1995), Roberts and
Tybout (1996), and Tybout (1996). Bartelsman and Doms (2000) provide an excellent review of the
literature.
        2
          Foster, Haltiwanger, Krizan (2001) looked at automobile repair shops in addition to the
manufacturing sector. They found that reallocation effects via net entry account for virtually all of the
(labor) productivity gains in one industry in the service sector. This finding raises questions about the
nature of the reallocation dynamics and their connection to productivity for sectors outside of
manufacturing.

data on U.S. retail trade businesses reflects individual physical locations and thus we are able to track the

activity and performance at each and every retail location in the country. Accordingly, our measures of

reallocation and the contribution of this reallocation to productivity growth provide a measure of how the

shifting of activity across locations is related to productivity growth in the U.S. retail trade industry.

        The structure of the retail trade industry has changed substantially in the last decade and the

information technology revolution has played an important role in this change. Adoption of systems

which electronically link cash registers to scanners and credit card processing machines have allowed

establishments to increase services and sales without increasing personnel (Sieling (2001)). Widespread

adoption of electronic scanners has meant that managers are able to change prices relatively costlessly

(“high-low” pricing where a price alternates between its regular level and its sale level) and to track more

easily the success of their pricing strategies for individual items (Nakumura (1998)). Further, these

scanners allow for improved inventory and sales tracking. Computerization has allowed large retailers to

adopt “lean retailing” practices of closely tracking of inventory levels which allows these stores to keep

low levels of inventories (Levinsohn and Petropolous (2001)). The McKinsey Global Institute (2001)

attributes much of the drive to adopt new technologies and organization practices in retail trade to the

influence of one company, Wal-Mart. McKinsey finds that the competitive pressure of Wal-Mart

encouraged other retailers to adopt its technological and organizational best practices. This influence was

felt throughout the retail trade sector because Wal-Mart competes with retailers across many categories

including general merchandise stores, drug stores, apparel stores, and grocery stores (Basker (2001)).

The retail trade sector has also become more concentrated over time, with the four-firm concentration

ratio increasing from 5.2 percent in 1987 to 6.8 percent in 1992 and increasing further in 1997. Finally,

Sieling et al (2001) note that consumer spending patterns shifted towards mass merchandising stores in

some industries while favoring speciality shops in other industries.




                                                       3
         In our analysis, we track the entry and exit of establishments in the retail trade sector over the

 course of the 1990s. We investigate the contribution to industry-level productivity growth of continuing

 establishments versus the entry and exit of establishments. We are able to link establishments to their

 parent firms and thus are able to examine the contribution of entering establishments of existing firms

 and of new firms as well as the related contribution of exits of establishments from continuing firms and

 from exiting firms. As part of this analysis of entry and exit, we attempt to disentangle the influences of

 selection and learning-by-doing effects on net entry.

        Underlying the overall productivity growth in retail trade are very different experiences in

individual retail trade industries. We examine three industries in detail in order to highlight the different

industry stories that are otherwise hidden by our focus on the average industry in the sector. The

industries are Department Stores, Miscellaneous General Merchandise Stores, and Catalog and Mail-

Order Houses. These three industries all experienced robust productivity growth in the 1990s but this

growth was the result of very different underlying processes. While there is much anecdotal evidence that

these industries have undergone substantial restructuring, the official BLS statistics can only provide the

aggregate picture. Quantifying and understanding the nature of and the contribution of this restructuring

and reallocation to productivity growth requires consistent measurement of the establishment data

underlying the industry statistics. This is the type of data that we exploit in this paper and, accordingly,

we can directly address these issues.

        The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the conceptual underpinnings that

motivate our empirical analysis and the decomposition methodology we use to relate reallocation and

productivity growth. The data used for our empirical analysis are described in Section 3. In Section 4 we

examine some basic features of the productivity distribution of establishments (such as heterogeneity and

persistence). Our empirical decomposition of industry level productivity growth into within establishment

and reallocation effects is shown in Section 5. The results of this decomposition lead us to focus, in


                                                       4
Section 6, on the role of selection and learning effects on the observed micro dynamics of productivity. In

Section 7 we focus on a few selected industries in order to give a further sense of the underlying

heterogeneity of experiences in retail trade. We provide concluding remarks in Section 8.




2. Conceptual Underpinnings

        2.1      Related Literature

        A pervasive empirical finding in the recent literature is that within-sector differences dwarf

between-sector differences in behavior across businesses on a variety of dimensions. For example,

Haltiwanger (1997) shows that four-digit industry effects account for less than 10 percent of the cross-

sectional heterogeneity in output, employment, capital equipment, capital structures, and productivity

growth rates across establishments in U.S. manufacturing. The magnitude of within-sector heterogeneity

implies that idiosyncratic factors dominate the determination of which establishments create and destroy

jobs and which establishments achieve rapid productivity growth or suffer productivity declines. An

examination of the theoretical literature suggests that many factors may account for such establishment-

level heterogeneity including: uncertainty; establishment-level differences in managerial/entrepreneurial

ability, capital vintage, location and disturbances; learning about all of these factors; and diffusion of

knowledge. Bartelsman and Doms (2000) and Foster, Haltiwanger and Krizan (2001) provide surveys of

the literature concerning these factors.

        For our purposes, we are interested in the connection between micro and macro (in this case

industry-level) productivity dynamics. Even though there is enormous micro-level heterogeneity and

associated reallocation, it is possible that the reallocation is not very important for industry-level

productivity dynamics. One reason is that there is undoubtedly substantial canceling out of the

idiosyncratic shocks in the aggregation from micro-level to industry-level changes. Put differently,

industry-level productivity dynamics may be primarily driven by industry-level productivity shocks that

                                                       5
are common to all businesses in the industry.

        Alternatively, there are classes of models where the process of reallocation plays a vital role in

productivity growth. In the creative destruction models of Aghion and Howitt (1994) and Caballero and

Hammour (1994), new technology can be adopted only by new establishments. Faster technological

growth increases the pace of creative destruction in this class of models and is associated with an

increased gap between the productivity levels of entering and exiting plants. Such models can be

enhanced with uncertainty, learning, and diffusion effects as in Jovanovic (1982), Jovanovic and

MacDonald (1994), and Ericson and Pakes (1995). Uncertainty about initial type for entrants as well

uncertainty about new innovations at existing businesses can generate increased churning that is closely

connected to the process of productivity growth. Such uncertainty is motivated by the inevitable trial and

error process of implementing new ways of doing business at a particular location and or for new products

and processes. The trial and error process suggests that both selection and learning effects are potentially

important for aggregate (industry-level) productivity dynamics. Our primary objective is to quantify the

extent of the entry and exit dynamics within industries in the retail trade sector and in turn to quantify the

contribution of associated selection and learning effects associated with this reallocation process.

         While the working hypothesis is that the reallocation should be productivity enhancing, both the

magnitude and the sign of this relationship should be viewed as open empirical questions. It may be that

the magnitude of the effect is small if technological change primarily involves within-plant upgrading of

technologies. It may also be the case that the reallocation reflects inefficiencies and as such is not

productivity enhancing. Market imperfections in product, capital, or labor markets can distort the

reallocation process so that the timing, magnitude, and or nature of reallocation is not productivity

enhancing (see, e.g., Caballero and Hammour (2000)). While there is a presumption that the U.S. has

generally well-functioning markets (at least relative to the rest of the world), it is not difficult to imagine

that there are sectors or times in the U.S. during which a variety of market distortions play an important


                                                       6
role. One possibility is that capital markets are especially imperfect for small and young businesses.

Following this line of argument, the churning among small and young businesses may reflect such capital

market imperfections. To the extent that this is the case, this will affect the link between reallocation and

productivity growth. Since we focus on the retail trade sector, which is dominated by small businesses

(and evidently young businesses, as we find enormous rates of entry and exit), these issues may be of

particular relevance.

        2.2      The Accounting Relationship Between Aggregate Productivity Growth and

                 Reallocation

        Much of the recent literature begins with basic accounting decompositions of aggregate

productivity growth into within-establishment and reallocation effects. Virtually all of the studies in the

literature consider some form of decomposition of an index of industry-level productivity:




                                                                                                               (1)



where LPit is the index of industry productivity, set is the share of plant e in industry i (e.g., output or

input share), and LPet is an index of plant-level productivity. The decomposition considers the roles of

changing shares versus changing productivity at the micro level in a manner that permits an integrated

treatment of the contribution of entering and exiting establishments.

        An examination of the literature reveals that there are alternate decompositions in use and that the

choice of the decomposition can impact the results significantly.3 We believe that our version has the

most direct economic interpretation of the terms in the decomposition. Our decomposition is:



         3
         See Foster, Haltiwanger, and Krizan (2001) for a discussion of the alternate decomposition
 methodologies.

                                                        7
                                                                                                          (2)




where C denotes continuing plants, N denotes entering plants, and X denotes exiting plants. The first term

in this decomposition represents a within-plant component based on plant-level changes, weighted by

initial shares in the industry. The second term represents a between-plant component that reflects

changing shares, weighted by the deviation of initial plant productivity from the initial industry index.

The third term represents a cross term (i.e., covariance-type) that tells us whether businesses with large

positive productivity changes are more likely to have decreased employment and vice-versa. The last two

terms represent the contribution of entering and exiting plants, respectively.

        In this decomposition, the between-plant, entry and exit terms involve deviations of plant-level

productivity from the initial industry index. For a continuing plant, this implies that an increase in its

share contributes positively to the between-plant component only if the plant has higher productivity than

average initial productivity for the industry. Similarly, an exiting plant contributes positively only if the

plant exhibits productivity lower than the initial average, and an entering plant contributes positively only

if the plant has higher productivity than the initial average.4

        Relating this decomposition to the discussion in Section 2.1, if industry-level productivity growth



         4
            Our decomposition is a modified version of that used by Baily, Hulten, and Campbell (1992).
 The first term in our decomposition (the “within component”) is identical to that in Baily, Hulten and
 Campbell (1992). They essentially combined the second two terms by calculating a term based upon the
 sum of changes in shares of activity weighted by ending period productivity. In addition, they did not
 deviate the terms in the between and net entry terms from initial levels. As Haltiwanger (1997) points
 out, this implies that even if all plants have the same productivity in both beginning and end periods, the
 between component and the net entry component in the Baily, Hulten and Campbell decomposition will,
 in general, be nonzero.

                                                       8
is primarily driven by common shocks (or analogously common adoption of some new technology) then

the within effect should dominate. Alternatively, if implementing new technology can only be

accomplished via entry then the net entry terms should dominate. Reallocation among continuing plants

may contribute positively to industry growth to the extent that the implementation of new technology at

continuing plants involves experimentation and associated reallocation. Note as well that idiosyncratic

shocks will tend to generate offsetting between and cross terms for continuing plants.

        The decomposition of aggregate productivity growth into these components is interesting but only

the first step. As will become clear below, we pursue a number of exercises to explore the factors

underlying the respective contributions of continuing versus entering and exiting establishments to

aggregate (industry level) productivity growth.

        2.3      The Interaction Between Conceptual and Measurement Issues

        The measure of labor productivity that is commonly used for retail trade is real sales per worker

or real sales per hour. Before proceeding with the details of the measurement and subsequent analysis of

this measure, it is useful to consider the potential sources of variation between and within establishments

in this measure. For this purpose, we sketch a simple descriptive model that focuses on the measurement

issues and then relate it to the above discussion of the literature.

        Suppose establishment e in period t has output given by:


                                                                                                                  (3)


where Qet is output, Aet reflects a variety of factors (discussed below) that impact labor productivity, Let is

the labor input, fe is overhead labor, and 2 is a positive parameter (2<1).5 We want to think of Aet broadly


         5
           This simple production function should be interpreted as having maximized out the other
 variable factors (e.g., intermediate inputs, which in the case of retail include the goods sold) and treating
 the fixed and quasi-fixed factors (e.g., location, capital) as contributing to the shift factor A. That is,
 suppose the primitive production function specifies output as a function of capital, materials (in this case
 including the goods sold), and labor. Suppose we treat capital as fixed and thus just include the

                                                        9
as incorporating many potential factors including the level of productivity associated with the installed

technology , technology shocks, and fixed and quasi-fixed factors like location and capital (both tangible

and intangible). Location is obviously important in retail trade and so it is useful to think about Aet as

reflecting the myriad factors which impact the efficiency of a particular location as a place in which to

operate a retail establishment. The presence of such fixed and quasi-fixed factors justifies the assumption

that 2<1.

        One of the key assumptions made here is the presence of overhead labor. This assumption is not

novel, the specification of the production function here is identical to that of Aghion and Howitt (1994),

but we believe it is especially applicable in the current context. For retail trade establishments in

particular, some workers must be present even if no transactions are actually occurring. Put simply, some

workers must be present to open up the doors in the morning and to be available during business hours to

conduct transactions regardless of whether any transactions are occurring. Moreover, since the typical

retail establishment is quite small (more on this below), the role of overhead labor is arguably especially

important in retail trade.

        Labor productivity is thus given by:




                                                  Aet ( Let − f e )θ
                                         LPet =                                                              (4)
                                                         Let




 contribution of capital as a shift factor absorbed in A. Moreover, treating materials as a variable factor of
 production and using the first order condition for materials we can substitute out for materials. All shift
 variables that impact materials (e.g., the cost of materials) are also absorbed in A. Note that A is a
 combination of technology, cost, and fixed factors. Note also that 2 will reflect the underlying labor
 share and other terms after substituting out for optimal materials.

                                                      10
        Suppose at least initially we assume that all establishments in the same industry are price takers.6

If establishments can adjust labor costlessly and continuously, establishment specific differences in Aet

will be reflected in both differences in size and in labor productivity (given the presence of overhead

labor). That is, optimal frictionless employment is given by:

                                                       pt Aetθ 1−1θ
                                         Let = f e + (        )                                             (5)
                                                         wt



where pt is the price of the output and wt is the wage (both presumed to be the same for businesses in the

same industry for now). Within the same industry, establishments with larger values of Aet will have

larger employment. Labor productivity with optimal frictionless employment will be given by:




                                                                                                            (6)




        The presence of overhead labor implies that establishments with higher Aet will have higher

productivity (that is differences in Aet will not simply be reflected in differences in size even with

employment at its frictionless level).

        There may be a variety of frictions that prevent businesses from being at the optimal frictionless

employment such as adjustment costs. Thus, at any given point in time, we are likely to see greater

dispersion in productivity than suggested by equation (4). In turn, some adjustments will be induced by

the departure from optimal frictionless employment. As such, even from this simple descriptive model,


         6
           The implications of product price differences across establishments in the same industry are
 discussed in Section 2.4. As we note, many of the implications we emphasize carry over to this case.

                                                      11
some predictions emerge linking reallocation to productivity differences for continuing businesses.

Businesses with high productivity will increase employment and businesses with low productivity will

decrease employment. In addition, for such continuing businesses, there will be a negative covariance

between changes in employment and changes in labor productivity given the decreasing returns (2<1).

        The connection between reallocation and aggregate productivity growth is likely to be closely

connected to entry and exit dynamics in this environment. To consider entry and exit dynamics, we need

to think about the incentives on both margins and their respective interaction. Businesses will exit when

the value of continuing operations at the existing location is negative. On the flip side, businesses will

enter until the expected discounted value of profits equals the cost of entry (assumed positive). The

presence of the fixed costs of production (as captured here via overhead labor) implies that low

productivity plants will exit. New businesses will have incentives to enter to replace the exiting

businesses. The precise incentives for entry depend upon assumptions about the nature of shocks,

uncertainty, and the growth and adoption of new technologies. One obvious way to obtain a clear

prediction regarding the contribution of entry and exit to aggregate growth is to assume that only entering

businesses have access to the latest technology as in Aghion and Howitt (1994) and Caballero and

Hammour (1994).7

        As noted in the discussion in earlier sections, this type of vintage model could be enhanced by

assuming uncertainty about type/ability at entry so that even though new businesses are the only ones who

have access to the latest technology, some businesses may be more capable of implementing the new

technology than others. In addition, there may be learning-by-doing associated with the new technology.



         7
            In an Aghion and Howitt (1994) or Caballero and Hammour (1994) environment, the growth in
 the productivity of the leading edge technology implies that the production real wage (wages divided by
 the industry output price) will be growing over time. New businesses will enter to take advantage of the
 new more productive technology. Existing businesses will contract and eventually exit (e.g., when they
 hit zero value) as they age since they face ever increasing real wages over time but no access to the
 leading technology.

                                                     12
Uncertainty about types and learning can imply that, even though new businesses have access to the latest

technology, entering businesses do not have higher average productivity than incumbents. Some of the

new businesses will not be very good at implementing the new technology and fail. Even successful new

businesses may take time to learn how to implement the new technology. Such selection and learning

effects for any wave of entrants can enhance the connection between reallocation and productivity growth.

        A modification of the view that new technology can only be implemented by new businesses is

the view that new technology is embodied in capital that is quasi-fixed (which in principle could be either

tangible physical capital or intangible organizational capital). This closely related view implies that

reallocation across existing businesses may be closely linked to aggregate industry growth. Consider a

new technology that will lead ultimately to industry-level productivity growth. Analogous to the impact

of uncertainty on new businesses, if there is uncertainty about type/ability regarding the adoption of new

technology by existing businesses then only some businesses may be successful in implementing the new

technology. As such, resources will be reallocated to those who successfully implement and away from

those who implement poorly. Thus, it may be that each new wave of innovations and implementation

unleashes reallocation dynamics among existing businesses that are productivity enhancing.

        In short, this simple description of plant-level labor productivity helps illustrate the potential

connections between industry-level productivity growth and reallocation. As should be clear, industry-

level productivity growth could reflect common technology shocks (or analogously common adoption of

new technologies) that are shared by all businesses in the sector so that reallocation dynamics are not

particularly important. Alternatively, reallocation dynamics may be vital for productivity growth if, for

example, new technologies can only be implemented by new businesses and or implementation of new

technologies is inherently a noisy one with much trial and error (and associated success and failure). In

the empirical analysis that follows, we will quantify the extent of and contribution of such reallocation

dynamics to industry-level productivity growth.


                                                      13
        2.4     An Interesting Complicating Factor: Idiosyncratic Prices

        An interesting and related complicating factor in theory and practice in measuring establishment-

level productivity is that establishments may have different output prices. Such price differences may

reflect differences in product quality which we want to include in our measured differences in

productivity across businesses. However, product price differences may also reflect some degree of

market power and, if so, idiosyncratic demand and technology shocks will be associated with variation in

prices. This may be especially appropriate in retail as one might think of the location of the product

yielding a differentiated product market structure. To consider this idea in this context, suppose that the

establishment-specific demand is given as follows:




                                                                                                              (7)


where pet is the price of output, *et is a demand shock, and 0 is a positive parameter (where 0<1 will be

assumed consistent with the related product differentiation models such as that of Melitz (2000)). Such

establishment-specific demand factors complicate not only matters conceptually but also practically since

establishment-level prices are not readily available. Measured labor productivity for an establishment in

an industry is typically establishment-level revenue deflated with an industry-level deflator divided by

labor input. Under this specification, measured labor productivity (at frictionless employment) is given

by:




                                                     14
                                                                                                          (8)




        Actual labor productivity is given by:




                                                                                                             (9)




where "=2(1-0).

        Comparing and contrasting equations (8) and (9) (and equation (6) in the prior section) is useful.

Both actual and measured labor productivity will reflect differences in efficiencies and demand shocks

(even with fully flexible labor). As in the prior section, the primary reason that there are persistent

differences in measured and actual productivity across plants is the presence of overhead labor.

Businesses with higher efficiencies and greater demand will be larger which (over some range) raises

productivity in the presence of overhead labor.8

        It is apparent from equations (8) and (9) that actual and measured productivity are closely related.


         8
           Interestingly, in the absence of overhead labor, idiosyncratic differences in demand and
 technology will yield differences in actual productivity but not measured productivity. This is because
 the establishment is not setting the value of marginal product of labor equal to the wage but rather the
 marginal revenue product equal to the wage. As such, demand and technology changes induce changes
 in labor demand that in turn generate fluctuations in output per unit of labor even without overhead labor.
 However, since firms set the marginal revenue product of labor equal to the wage, in the absence of
 overhead labor there will be no differences (in the long run) in measured productivity across firms.

                                                      15
In order to gauge the precise relationship between actual and measured productivity we did a simple

calibration exercise. We attempted to choose parameters that seem reasonable and match some of the

characteristics of the data for this purpose. The parameters we had to choose include 2, 0, fe, w, and the

mean and variances of the demand and technology shocks (we assumed the two types of idiosyncratic

shocks are uncorrelated). We let 0=0.2 implying an elasticity of -5 and a markup of 25 percent and

2=0.67 where both are within ranges of parameter estimates in the literature (see, e.g., Betancourt and

Gautschi (1993) and Betancourt and Mlanoski (1999)). Recall that 2 is the parameter that emerges after

optimizing out the other variable factors of production. If we assume that the labor share of gross output

is 0.4 and the intermediate input share is 0.5 then with an 0 of 0.2 we obtain 2=0.67. We selected the

remaining parameters to match two of the features of the data (for details about the data see the

subsequent sections): the average size of a retail establishment is 13.8 employees and the interquartile

range of log measured productivity is 0.57. To accomplish this, we set fe = 5 and the standard deviations

of the (log of) demand and technology shocks equal to each other at 0.2. For this exercise, we used three

states for both of the shocks with a simple uniform distribution. The resulting series for the nine possible

outcomes (three demand x three technology states) are plotted in Figure 1. In a crude fashion, one can

think of each of the points representing a different establishment outcome depending upon the state of

demand and state of technology at the establishment. The correlation between the actual and measured

productivity is quite high at 0.80 (the correlation is between log actual and log measured to stay consistent

with our analysis). A couple of features of the two series are interesting to note. First, measured

productivity is more highly correlated with demand shocks than actual productivity (0.80 versus 0.15) and

measured productivity is less highly correlated with technology shocks than actual productivity (0.61

versus 0.97). Second, the standard deviations of the two series are virtually identical (0.44 for log




                                                     16
measured or actual productivity).9

         The first conclusion of this section, therefore, is that the presence of overhead labor yields a close

connection between measured and actual labor productivity even in the presence of idiosyncratic prices.

For our purposes, it is also important to emphasize that the distribution of measured labor productivity is

likely to exhibit similar dynamics to those described in Section 2.2. That is, frictions in the adjustment of

employment will imply differences in measured labor productivity that in turn yield incentives for

adjusting employment. Businesses with high measured productivity will expand and businesses with low

measured productivity will contract. In addition, businesses with low measured productivity will be more

likely to exit as they will be unable to cover their fixed costs. The connection between micro and industry

level productivity dynamics is likely to be similar in this context as well. For example, if new technology

can be implemented only by new businesses, then measured industry productivity growth will be

associated with entering businesses displacing lower measured productivity exiting businesses. Thus,

many of the inferences to be drawn from our analysis based upon the homogenous price case still apply in

this more complicated environment.

        To conclude this section, it is worth emphasizing a point made by Melitz (2000). If BLS does

have the appropriate market-share weights across firms, then its price index at the industry level is correct


         9
           These patterns are mildly sensitive to parameter variation. For example, the correlation
 between measured and actual productivity (D) takes on the following values for different parameter
 choices: when 2=0.5 then D= 0.78, when 0=0.1 (thereby increasing the elasticity) then D=0.62, when fe
 =3 then D=0.69, when the variance of demand shocks=0 then D=0.999, and when the variance of
 technology shocks=0 then D=0.94. In short, for the case we examine and these reasonably large
 departures from the base case, actual and measured productivity are highly correlated. While these are
 relatively crude calibrations, these findings provide some degree of confidence that our measured
 productivity is providing information about the true variation in productivity. In this environment, the
 measurement error is not random and measured productivity is likely to be a better predictor of entry and
 exit than actual productivity because it is more closely related to profits (in this example, measured
 productivity has a correlation of 0.9 with profits and actual productivity has a correlation of 0.7). It is
 worth emphasizing that these conclusions depend critically on the presence of at least some overhead
 labor. As is clear from equation (7), in the absence of overhead labor there would be no differences
 across businesses in measured productivity (with frictionless labor).

                                                      17
and the official BLS productivity measure would be correct even if there are differences in prices across

firms.10 In what follows, we show that our industry-level measures correspond closely to those of BLS.

This implies that components of our decomposition (2) aggregate to the correct measure of industry level

productivity growth even in the presence of idiosyncratic prices.

        Putting the pieces together provides a reasonable degree of confidence about the measurement and

methodology used here. With homogenous prices within narrowly defined sectors as in Section 2.3, the

measures at the micro and industry level are correct. With heterogenous prices within narrowly defined

sectors, if these differences reflect differences in quality across producers then our measurement is

correct. Regardless, our industry level measure of productivity growth is still correct and therefore the

components of our decompositions still aggregate to the correct measure. Moreover, even with

heterogeneous prices, we have shown that the connection between measured and actual productivity at the

micro level is still likely to be strong. Perhaps even more importantly, the observed dynamics of measured

productivity at the micro level should exhibit the same types of patterns (e.g., reflecting adjustment

dynamics, learning and selection effects) that we hypothesized in Section 2.3 .



3.      Data Issues

        The empirical analysis in this paper uses data from the Census of Retail Trade (CRT). Every five

years (those ending in ‘2' and ‘7’), the Census conducts a survey of retail trade establishments. The survey




         10
             It is worth noting that official BLS productivity statistics at the industry-level also suffer from
 some aspects of these biases induced by within-industry product differentiation to the extent that the
 product differentiation occurs within the most disaggregated product classes underlying BLS gross
 output series. We note in this regard that BLS has used data at the merchandise line level to construct
 their gross output indices and thus may be less subject to these biases at the industry level. Since our
 industry-level productivity measures that use only 4-digit industry deflators (rather than merchandise line
 deflators) align closely with BLS series, this suggests that either these biases are small and or they occur
 mostly within merchandise lines.

                                                      18
questionnaire is mailed out to all large and medium-sized firms and generally all firms that operate

multiple establishments; most very small firms are excused from answering the questionnaire. The data for

these very small firms come from two sources: a Census sample of these very small firms and

administrative records from other federal agencies. We use both reported data and administrative data in

our empirical exercises because there is no reason to suppose that the administrative records data are

inferior to the reported data for the variables being used in this study.11

        The CRT contains data on establishments concerning the kind of business, physical location, sales

in dollars, annual and first quarter payroll, and employment for the pay period including March 12th. In

addition, the mail segment of the CRT includes some industry-specific data and sometimes other special

interest data. For our purposes, the relevant point is that while it is possible to construct measures of labor

productivity, it is not possible to measure multifactor productivity. The index of establishment-level labor

productivity used here is similar to that used in the literature and is given by:


                                                                                                                  (10)


where Qet is real gross output and Let is labor input ( total hours) for establishment e at time t. We are

constrained by the data to use sales as our measure of nominal output. A preferable measure of output for

the retail trade sector might be gross margins (total sales less the cost of goods sold). However, it is worth

noting that this is the same measure of output used by the BLS in their measures of productivity for the

retail trade sector.12 We deflate sales using BLS’ four-digit industry deflators (see the Data Appendix for


         11
            These administrative records cases accounted for about 10 percent of total sales in 1987, 1992,
 and 1997. See the Data Appendix for the precise categories of administrative records cases by year. The
 percent of administrative cases for 1997 is based on the North American Industrial Classification System
 (NAICS) version of the retail trade sector.
         12
            The output statistics that the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) produces (as opposed to
 BLS) use a gross margins adjustment. However, as noted by Triplett and Bosworth (2001) the BLS sales
 based and BEA gross margin based measures are very similar. The reason is that the gross margin
 adjustment that is applied does not vary much over time and is at a high level of aggregation. Part of the

                                                       19
more details about data from BLS). In measuring the labor input, we again face data constraints because

the CRT does not collect hours information. Instead, we construct manhours at the establishment level by

multiplying establishment employment by the industry average of hours as measured by BLS.13

        Our empirical exercises use data from 1987, 1992, and 1997 since these are the years for which

we are able to link establishments over time (see the Data Appendix for discussions regarding the creation

of the longitudinal links). There are approximately 1.5 million establishments in the retail trade sector

employing close to 20 million workers and generating close to $2 trillion in sales on average for these

three census years.14 We focus on productivity dynamics for 1987-97 period and for the two five-year

subperiods (1987-92 and 1992-97). Using the two five-year periods allows us to study the dynamics of an

entering cohort. In particular, we are able to track the behavior of establishments that enter between 1987

and 1992 by examining their behavior in both 1992 and 1997 (including the possibility that the

establishment does not survive until 1997).

         Since the CRT data have not been extensively used and our methodology is based on aggregating

micro data, it is helpful to compare the productivity measures based on the Census data to those officially

published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Data Appendix describes this comparison detail. In

short, we find that our overall average productivity growth rates are quite similar and that the correlation

between the BLS and Census industry-level productivity growth rates is quite high (0.80).

        Before proceeding it is important to emphasize that the unit of observation in the analysis is

primarily the establishment. An establishment is defined as a physical location at which economic activity


 reason for this is that detailed data on gross margins (e.g., at a merchandise line level) are not collected.
          13
             The adjustment for hours is obviously crude at best. This adjustment should be interpreted as
 a means of controlling for detailed industry and time variation in hours per worker. We have conducted
 all our analyses without this adjustment (so our measure of labor productivity is output per worker) and
 we obtain very similar results. We find that we match the BLS levels and trends by industry somewhat
 better by incorporating the hours adjustment.
          14
             All of the empirical work in this paper is based on the retail trade sector as defined by
 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system.

                                                      20
is occurring. We can also link the establishments in our data to their parent firms. In the analysis that

follows, we find it helpful at times to distinguish between entering establishments of new firms (typically

single-unit entrants) and entering establishments of continuing firms. In a like manner, we distinguish

between exiting establishments of exiting firms (again, typically single-units) and exiting establishments

that belong to continuing firms.



4.      Characteristics of the Productivity Distribution

        In this section, we present basic facts about the shape and evolution of the distribution of

productivity across businesses. We begin by simply characterizing the differences in labor productivity

across businesses in the same narrowly defined industry. For this purpose, we examine the percentiles of

the labor productivity distribution across businesses after removing four-digit industry fixed effects. The

measure we use for this purpose is the log of output per hour at the businesses and we consider the hours-

weighted distribution of this measure.15 By construction (since the four-digit effects have been removed),

the distribution has a zero mean. The standard deviation and the interquartile range of this distribution are

very large and stable: the standard deviation is about 0.54 and the interquartile range is about 0.57 for all

three years. It is striking that within the same industry some businesses are so much more productive than

others and that this dispersion is quite stable over this time period. The latter of course does not mean that

individual businesses are stable within this distribution. Indeed, much of our analysis is devoted towards

examining the churning of businesses within this distribution including the role of entry and exit.

        We begin our analysis of the dynamics of establishment-level productivity by examining the

transition of individual businesses in the overall distribution of productivity over the 1987-97 period. In

each of the years under consideration, we classify establishments into quintiles of the hours-weighted



         15
              We have also examined this distribution for output per worker and find very similar results.
                                                      21
labor productivity distribution. We can thus look forwards or backwards in terms of where the

establishments in 1987 end up or where the establishments in 1997 came from. Since we have removed

four-digit industry effects from each year, the quintiles should be interpreted as capturing relative

productivity within the four-digit industry.

        The transition matrix is shown in Table 1. The most striking feature of Table 1 is the large role of

births and deaths. For any quintile in 1987, the most likely outcome (row percentage) is death. For any

quintile in 1997, the most likely origin (column percentage) is birth. Interestingly, births arrive uniformly

throughout the productivity distribution. In contrast, deaths are concentrated in the businesses with low

productivity in 1987. For example, 70.3 percent of businesses in the lowest quintile in 1987 did not

survive until 1997, while in contrast, only 39.2 percent of businesses in the highest quintile in 1987 did

not survive until 1997. While the latter probability of death is large in absolute terms it is much smaller

than the probability of death for the least productive businesses.

        Conditional on survival, substantial persistence is exhibited by individual businesses in terms of

the relative productivity rankings. Businesses in the top quintile in 1987 had a 26.5 percent chance of

staying in the top quintile in 1997 but only a 4.9 percent chance of moving to the bottom quintile.

Likewise businesses in the lowest quintile in 1987 had a 12.8 percent chance of staying in the lowest

quintile in 1997 but only a 2.8 percent chance of moving to the highest quintile.

        Comparing these results with analogous results for U.S. manufacturing establishments reported in

Baily, Hulten and Campbell (1992), reveals a number of similarities but also a number of differences.

Baily, Hulten and Campbell (1992) find a higher degree of persistence (see their Table 3) but part of this

reflects much lower turnover of businesses in manufacturing as opposed to retail trade. That is,

conditional on survival, the persistence rates are not so different between manufacturing and retail trade.

The large difference, however, is that survival is much less likely in retail trade and it is closely linked to

productivity.

                                                       22
        It is evident from Table 1 that there is considerable turnover of businesses and associated

reallocation of jobs. To examine these issues more directly, Table 2 presents estimates of the gross

expansion and contraction rates of employment over the 1987-97 period (and the subperiods 1987-92 and

1992-97).16 The rates of input expansion (contraction) are measured as the weighted average of the

growth rates of expanding (contracting) plants including the contribution of entering (exiting) plants using

the methodology of Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1996).17 The pace of gross input expansion and

contraction is extremely large over the ten-year horizon. Expanding plants yielded a gross rate of

expansion of 69.2 percent of inputs and contracting plants yielded a gross rate of contraction of 54.6

percent of inputs over 1987-97. The importance of entry and exit are evident in the lower panel of the

table, where one sees that 84 percent of the input gross creation from expanding plants came from entry

of establishments and 82 percent of the input gross destruction came from exit of establishments over the

ten-year period.

        Table 2 also includes the fraction of excess reallocation within four-digit industries in each of

these industries. Excess reallocation is the sum of gross expansion and contraction rates less the absolute

value of net change for the sector. Thus, excess reallocation reflects the gross reallocation (expansion

plus contraction) that is in excess of that required to accommodate the net expansion of the sector.

Following Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1996)18 excess reallocation rates for the entire retail trade

sector can be decomposed into within and between sector effects. The far right column of the upper panel



         16
             We have also looked at the gross reallocation rates for real output. The reallocation patterns
 for real output are qualitatively similar to the patterns that we report here concerning employment. The
 net growth rate of output is higher than that of inputs (especially employment) reflecting the productivity
 growth over this period.
          17
             This methodology entails defining plant-level growth rates as the change divided by the
 average of the base and end year variable. The advantage of this growth rate measure is that it is
 symmetric for positive and negative changes and allows for an integrated treatment of entering and
 exiting plants.
         18
              See pages 52 and 53 for a description of the methodology.
                                                     23
of Table 2 indicates that most of the excess reallocation at the retail trade level reflects excess reallocation

within four-digit industries. Thus, the implied large shifts in the allocation of employment are primarily

among producers in the same four-digit industry. This finding is especially noteworthy since there are

large differences in the net growth rates across four-digit industries – however, apparently, these are

dwarfed by the pace of reallocation within the four-digit industries.

        Given the very large rates of establishment entry and exit, it is of interest to know how much of

the entry and exit of establishments reflects entry and exit of firms as opposed to entry and exit of

establishments for continuing firms.19 The lower panel of Table 2 shows the share of total creation from

new establishments due to new firms and the share of total destruction from exiting establishments due to

exiting firms. The share of job creation due to establishment entry from new firms is greater than half,

but establishment entry from continuing firms is clearly an important contributing factor. On the exit side,

exiting firms account for three-quarters of the job destruction from exiting establishments, but again

exiting establishments of continuing firms play a non-trivial role. We can quantify the overall

contribution of reallocation across establishments within firms by decomposing excess reallocation into

within-firm and between-firm components. For this purpose, we consider not only the reallocation due to

entry and exit but also reallocation among continuing establishments. The last column of the lower panel

of Table 2 shows that roughly 20 percent of excess reallocation is due to the reallocation of employment

across establishments within firms.20


         19
             Jarmin, Klimek, and Miranda (2001) focus on firm entry and exit in retail trade and find that
 the entry and exit rates of firms are substantially larger in retail trade than in manufacturing. However,
 they include firm diversification in their definition of entry and so their results are not directly
 comparable to ours.
          20
             We use the same form of the decomposition used to decompose excess into within- and
 between-industry components. That is, we measure within-firm excess reallocation for each firm as the
 sum of within-firm creation and destruction less the absolute value of the net growth rate of the firm.
 We aggregate this across firms with appropriate employment or output weights. We measure the
 between-firm component as the sum of the deviations of each firm’s absolute net growth rate and the
 overall absolute net growth rate. See Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1996) for further details of this

                                                      24
        Table 2 also shows the analogous results for the subperiods 1987-92 and 1992-97. The rates of

expansion exceed 40 percent for inputs and the rates of contraction exceed 35 percent in both subperiods.

The implied cumulative change from the two five-year horizons is larger than the actual ten-year change

reflecting the fact that some of the five-year changes reflect transitory movements. The shares of

expansion accounted for by births and the shares of destruction accounted for by deaths are extremely

high (accounting for around three-quarters for both for each subperiod).

        We have also calculated the gross contraction and expansion rates by establishment size class

(defined as the average of beginning and ending year employment). The pace of reallocation and excess

reallocation fall systematically with the size of the business in all years. For example, the excess

reallocation rate for 1987-97 is roughly 170 percent for the smallest size class (1-4 employees) but is only

roughly 60 percent for the largest size class (over 50 employees). Part of this difference is driven by the

extremely large entry and exit rates for small businesses – we observe a very high fraction of creation

accounted for by entrants (about 96 percent) and an analogously high fraction of destruction accounted for

by exits (roughly 96 percent) for the smallest establishments for 1987-97. As with reallocation rates,

these fractions fall for the largest size classes. For the largest size class of establishments, births account

for only about 73 percent of the jobs created and deaths account for only about 55 percent of jobs

destroyed. The two subperiods show similar patterns. Interestingly, net growth rates are actually

increasing functions of the size of the establishment. For each of the three time periods, the smallest

establishment class has negative net growth, while the largest establishment class has positive net job

growth rate and the highest net growth of all the size groups. Since the majority of workers in retail trade

work for employers with fewer than 50 employees, these patterns help account for the rapid pace of output


 methodology. Doms, Jarmin, and Klimek (2001) decompose employment changes into those accounted
 for by continuing firms and by net entry of firms. Since they decompose net employment and use a
 different definition of firm, their results are not directly comparable to ours. In their paper they explore
 the role of information technology investment on the growth and productivity dynamics of firms.

                                                      25
and employment reallocation and the dominant role of entrants and exits seen in earlier results. Many

studies (see the survey in Davis and Haltiwanger (1999)) have shown that the pace of reallocation as well

as entry and exit rates are sharply decreasing functions of employer size.

        Finally, we also measured the gross contraction and expansion rates by two-digit industry. The

pace of reallocation also varies substantially across the two-digit industries. Apparel and furniture stores,

for example, have especially high paces of job reallocation with gross creation and destruction rates

roughly between 50-80 percent and excess reallocation about 100 percent. Industries with relatively low

rates of job reallocation include general merchandise stores and food stores. General merchandise has

particularly low creation and destruction rates (roughly 30-50 percent) and excess reallocation rates (about

50-80 percent).21 In all industries, entry and exit play a very large role with about three quarters of creation

(destruction) accounted for by entry (exit) over a ten-year horizon.

        Overall, retail trade is a sector that has exhibited tremendous turbulence. There are substantial

differences in the net growth rates across two-digit industries but these are dwarfed by the gross rates of

reallocation. The large differences between net and gross rates helps account for the finding in Table 2

that much of the reallocation is within as opposed to between industries. Comparing the results here with

those reported in Foster, Haltiwanger and Krizan (2001) reveals that retail trade gross flows are about 50

percent larger than those in manufacturing with a higher share of the flows accounted for by entry and

exit. A key factor here is that retail trade is a sector dominated by small businesses both in terms of

number of establishments and numbers of workers at those establishments. Moreover, we find that the

smallest establishments within retail trade exhibit disproportionately large reallocation and associated

entry and exit rates. We also find that much of the establishment entry and exit is associated with firm



         21
             We look at some of the four-digit industries within this major industry group in Section 7. We
 find that the creation and destruction rates look very different for two of the major industries in this
 group, Miscellaneous General Merchandise Stores and Department Stores.

                                                      26
entry and exit but a non-trivial fraction is accounted for by entry and exit of establishments among

continuing firms. Finally, and quite importantly, we find that virtually all of the reallocation is a within-

industry phenomenon. As such, the standard approach of measuring change and growth at the four-digit

level will miss much of the action and it is impossible with such data to capture the contribution of

reallocation to productivity growth.



5.       Productivity Decompositions

        The large differences in productivity across businesses in the same sector and the large within-

sector reallocation rates motivate our analysis of productivity decompositions at the four-digit level. We

apply the decomposition in equation (2) at the four-digit level. For this purpose, we use the labor input

(total hours) share weights. For labor productivity, the seemingly appropriate weight is employment (or

hours) since this will yield a tight measurement link between most measures of labor productivity using

industry-level data and industry-based measures built up from plant-level data. Both the Griliches and

Regev (1995) and Baily, Bartelsman, and Haltiwanger (1996) papers use employment weights in this

context. In most of our results, we report the results for the average industry. Following Baily, Hulten,

and Campbell (1992), the weights used to average across industries are nominal gross output by industry

averaged over the beginning and ending years of the period for which the change is measured. The same

industry weights are used to aggregate the industry results across all of the decompositions because the

focus is on within-industry decompositions. By using the same weights, the results do not reflect changing

industry composition.

        The decompositions of labor productivity are reported in the upper panel of Table 3.22 For all


         22
            We have conducted all of the analysis in the paper on productivity decompositions and
 associated regressions using output per worker as an alternative measure. In general, the results are very
 similar between these two alternatives. In addition, due to concerns about the data, we also performed

                                                      27
time periods, we find that reallocation effects account for the majority of changes in labor productivity.

That is, the within-establishment contribution is substantially less than half for each of the five-year

changes and less than 20 percent for the ten-year change. In considering the role of reallocation effects,

the contribution of net entry is enormous accounting for virtually all of the overall change in all three time

periods. Moreover, the between-establishment contribution is positive and significant as well. The within,

between, and net entry effects add up to more than the total because the cross term among continuing

establishments reduces labor productivity over these periods. The sign of the cross term reflects a

negative covariance between labor productivity and employment changes. The offsetting nature of the

between and cross terms is consistent with the view that idiosyncratic productivity shocks induce changes

in size and that such changes in size in turn induce productivity changes given within-establishment

decreasing returns. The negative cross term is also consistent with the view that downsizing has been

productivity enhancing over this period for continuing establishments. Putting all of this together suggests

that the average establishment exhibited modest productivity growth over the period, reallocation played a

dominant role primarily due to net entry but also because output and employment were reallocated

towards establishments who had higher than average productivity at the beginning of the period, and

establishments that downsized tended to exhibit increases in productivity (the negative cross term).

        To shed further light on these results, the lower panel of Table 3 presents components of the net

entry term. As can be seen, the large positive contribution of the net entry term is primarily due to a very

large contribution from exit although there is a relatively modest positive contribution from entry.

Interestingly, the positive contribution of entry is mostly coming from entering establishments of existing

firms -- the contribution of entering establishments from new firms is positive over the 10-year horizon

but negative for the five-year horizons. In contrast, the large contribution of exit is mostly coming from


 these decompositions excluding establishments in the computer store industry. The results of the
 decompositions are qualitatively similar to those using establishments in all industries.

                                                      28
exiting establishments of exiting firms. Note that the contribution of net entry to productivity is

disproportionate to net entry’s size in terms of employment (not shown in the table).

         This disproportionate contribution of net entry can be understood by examining the relative

productivities of entering versus exiting establishments. To shed further light on the role of net entry, we

ranked groups of establishments in terms of their productivity relative to continuing establishments in

1987. We find the following rank ordering of productivity (the numbers in parentheses show the

productivity of the group as a percent of that for the baseline group): continuing establishments in 1997

(101%), continuing establishments in 1987 (100%), entering establishments (95%), and exiting

establishments (78%). Focusing on the net entry groups, we further find the following ranking (again

relative to 1987 continuers): new establishments of existing firms (111%), new establishments of new

firms (93%), exiting establishments of continuing firms (89%), and exiting establishments of exiting firms

(75%).

         Before proceeding to the next section, it is worthwhile to compare the findings presented here for

retail trade with the prior literature that focuses on manufacturing. The primary difference is that in

manufacturing net entry was part of the story while in retail trade it appears to be almost the entire story.

The retail trade industry would have exhibited no (or even negative) productivity growth without the

contribution of net entry.



6.       Learning and Selection Effects

         The results reported in Section 5 make clear that entry and exit dynamics dominate the

productivity growth for the retail trade sector. By exploring the differences in productivity dynamics

between incumbents, entrants and exiting establishments in more detail, we can provide a richer picture of

the role of learning (by doing) and selection effects that underlie these dynamics. We use the term



                                                      29
“learning” effects broadly in this context to include any “learning” about how best to run the business at

the specific location. An example might be learning how to more efficiently serve customers at the

specific location of the retail establishment. As such, we are using learning as a short-hand for learning-

by-doing. The selection effects we identify also inherently involve a form of learning as well. That is, as

discussed in Section 2 businesses may be uncertain about their efficiency, learn about their relative

efficiencies over time, and those that learn they are poor performers exit.

        We begin by considering a simple regression of (the log of) productivity on a set of dummies

indicating whether the establishment exited in 1987 (YRDEA87), entered in 1997 (YRBIR97), a year

effect to control for average differences in productivity across the two years (YR97), and four-digit

industry dummies (not reported) using the pooled data .23 The omitted group is continuing establishments

in 1987 so the coefficients can be interpreted accordingly.24 The specification is given by:



                                                                                                        (11)



        The results of this regression, shown in the upper panel of Table 4, confirm earlier results and

help quantify statistical significance: exiting establishments have significantly lower productivity than

continuing establishments, establishments in 1997 have significantly higher productivity than

establishments in 1987, and entering establishments in 1997 have lower labor productivity than continuing


         23
            By pooling the data across industries, we are pursuing a slightly different approach than in
 prior decomposition exercises where we calculated the decomposition for each industry and then took the
 weighted average of the four-digit results. However, by controlling for four-digit effects and using
 analogous weights to those used in the decomposition exercises, these results are close to being the
 regression analogues of earlier tables.
         24
            Care must be taken when interpreting the coefficient on the entry dummy (*). This coefficient
 shows how entering establishments compare to incumbents abstracting from the overall growth. In order
 to compare births in 1997 to the incumbents in 1987, one must also consider the year effects (i.e., look at
 *+<). Thus entering establishments in 1997 are more productive than incumbents in 1987 (*+<>0), but
 less productive than incumbents in 1997 (*<0).

                                                     30
establishments in 1997. Also reported in the upper panel is the F-test on the difference between entering

and exiting establishments which is highly significant, even after controlling for year effects. We also

examine the significance of net entry for the five-year changes using analogous regression specifications.

Interestingly, the patterns for the five-year changes regarding the differences between entering and exiting

establishments are similar to those for the ten-year period. In particular, we observe that entering

establishments have higher productivity than exiting establishments even while controlling for year effects

(*>$). There are differences across the periods as the average continuing establishment exhibited

productivity declines in 1987-92 (<<0) but modest productivity gains in 1992-97 (<>0). We know from

Table 3 that both periods exhibited overall productivity gains. As is clear from Table 4, this comes

overwhelmingly from the contribution of net entry and in particular from the exit of the least productive

establishments.

        The lower panel of Table 4 shows results where the impact of entry and exit is decomposed

between continuing and entering and exiting firms. The rank ordering described in Section 5 emerges

clearly. The least productive are the exiting establishments from exiting firms while the most productive

(even after controlling for year effects) are entering establishments of continuing firms. It is also clear

there are large differences in productivity between establishment entrants that are new firms versus those

that are continuing firms and between establishment exits that are exiting firms and establishment exits

that are part of continuing firms.25 An interesting implication is that continuing firms have a higher

productivity threshold for exit for an individual establishment than do non-continuing firms. 26



         25
             It may at first appear that there is a productivity premium to an establishment for being
 associated with a continuing firm. However, in unreported results we have found that for continuing
 establishments those that have switched their firm affiliation are on average substantially more
 productive. The causality for this latter finding may run in both directions.
          26
              Since the non-continuing firms are dominated by single unit establishments, this finding may
 be related to the finding in Holmes and Schmitz (1992) that owner-managed businesses are less likely to
 exit than other businesses.

                                                      31
        We next examine the dynamics of entering cohorts. We use essentially the same specification as

above except now we classify entering establishments based on whether they entered between 1987-92

(YRBOLD97) or 1992-97 (YRBYNG97):


                                                                                                              (12)




        The results shown in the upper panel of Table 5 indicate that there are significant differences

between the cohorts of establishments. Establishments that entered earlier have significantly higher

productivity than establishments that entered later (0>:). These cohort effects could be driven by

selection and or learning effects. The results could reflect that the entrants from 1987- 92 who make it to

1997 are more productive entrants (selection), or that the earlier entrants had more time to learn than the

later entrants (learning).27 We attempt to disentangle these effects later in the paper.

        We also decompose these cohort effects into effects for new and continuing firms and show these

results in the lower panel of Table 5. We find that for both cohorts, entrants from continuing firms have

very high productivity relative to both incumbents in 1997 (0c>0 and :c>0) and other entrants (0c>0b and

:c>:b). On the other hand, establishment entrants that are new firms actually have lower productivity

than incumbents in 1997 (0b<0 and :b<0). Thus we find that a continuing versus new firm effect plays a

role here. However, interestingly, for either new or continuing firms, we find that the entrants from the

earlier cohort have higher productivity than the entrants from the latter cohort holding the firm status

constant (0c>:c and 0b>:b). Thus, selection and or learning effects seem to be playing a role for

establishments of a new cohort whether the establishment is part of a continuing firm or is a new firm.


         27
            Aw, Chen, and Roberts (2001) perform a related cohort analysis (but for Taiwanese
 manufacturers). They compare the productivity of the following pairs of groups: surviving and exiting
 firms of the same entry cohort, entrants and incumbents in the same year, entering firms in a cohort with
 recent exiters, and productivity of incumbents at the start date and at the end date.

                                                      32
        The results from these two sets of regressions make clear the role of entry and exit but do not

permit disentangling selection and learning effects. We shed some light on learning and selection effects

via regressions that use additional information about establishments that entered between 1987-92. By

dividing this entering cohort into exiters and survivors, we can characterize selection and learning effects.

Thus in our specification we have dummies for those from the entering cohort who then die (ENTDEA),

all other deaths (OTHDEA), and entering cohort that survive (SURV92 and SURV97) in addition to the

usual birth, year, and industry dummies. The specification is given by:



                                                                                                            (13)




        Using this specification, we make three comparisons. First, for exits, we distinguish among exits

in the 1992-97 period between those who entered during 1987-92 and those who did not (comparing " and

(). Second, among the entering cohort we distinguish between those that exit and those that survive to

1997 (comparing " and 2). Finally, for the surviving 1987-92 cohort, we also examine productivity in

1992 and productivity five years later (comparing 2 and 8). The results are shown in Table 6.

         Establishments that entered between 1987-92 and then exited are significantly less productive in

1992 than continuing incumbents in 1992 (who are not from that entering cohort, i.e., "<0). Of exiting

establishments, those that entered between 1987-92 are less productive in 1992 than other exiting

establishments ("<(). The exiting establishments from this entering cohort are also less productive in

1992 than the surviving members of this cohort ("<2). The latter findings are broadly consistent with

selection effects since it is the less productive establishments from the entering cohort that exit .

        The surviving members of the entering 1987-92 cohort are actually more productive than

incumbents (2>0) even upon entry. Moreover, for the entering cohort, we observe significant increases in

                                                      33
productivity over the five years (2<8), even though we control for overall year effects. This pattern is

consistent with learning effects playing an important role. It is noteworthy that once we have separately

accounted for the learning of the entering cohort, there is essentially no productivity growth for

incumbents between 1992 and 1997 who also were present in 1987 (<=0). Put differently, much of the

productivity growth from 1992 to 1997 is accounted for by the combination of the exit of the least

productive establishments and the learning amongst the cohort of establishments that entered between

1987 and 1992.

        We further decompose these selection and learning effects by controlling for new versus

continuing firms in the lower panel of Table 6. We find that the establishments that exit from a recent

cohort that are part of a new firm at entry have very low productivity ("b is very low). Thus, the selection

effects we have detected primarily reflect exit of establishments that are new firms. In contrast, we find

that entering establishments of continuing firms have high productivity upon entry and exhibit substantial

productivity growth after entry (2c is very high and 2c < 8c). Thus, the learning effects for survivors

appear to come primarily from new establishments in continuing firms. For surviving entering

establishments of new firms, we find virtually no productivity growth (2b = 8b).

        In sum, we find that net entry contributes disproportionately to productivity growth. The

disproportionate contribution is associated with less productive exiting establishments being displaced by

more productive entering establishments. New entrants tend to be less productive than surviving

incumbents but exhibit substantial productivity growth. The latter reflects both selection effects (the less

productive amongst the entrants exit) and learning effects. The selection effects are especially important

for the exit of establishments from the entering cohort of new firms. The learning effects are driven

entirely by the growth in productivity in the early years of entering establishments of continuing firms.



7.      Results for Selected Industries

                                                     34
        In all of the results presented thus far, we have controlled for four-digit industry effects but have

reported the effects for the “average” retail trade industry. There is undoubtedly considerable

heterogeneity in the technology, cost and demand variation across industries. In this section, we explore

the results for three selected industries: Department Stores, Miscellaneous General Merchandise Stores

(hereafter General Stores) and Catalog and Mail-Order Houses (hereafter Catalog Houses). We selected

these three industries because they exhibited especially robust productivity growth over this period of time

and anecdotal and descriptive evidence suggests that they experienced substantial structural change over

this period of time. Before turning to the empirical exercises, we next briefly describe these industries.

        The Department Stores industry has approximately 11,000 establishments generating 200 billion

dollars in sales on average over the census years in this study. The industry has a relatively small and

declining number of firms. There are less than 300 firms in any of the years under consideration. The

industry has become more concentrated over the time period: the four-firm concentration of sales rose

from 44 percent in 1987 to 53 percent in 1992 and continued to increase in 1997.28 Sieling et al (2001)

note that the Department Stores industry has shifted towards larger mass merchandise stores over this

period and that this type of operation often has increased use of self-service operations.

        The General Stores industry includes warehouse clubs, catalog showrooms, and similar discount

houses. There are approximately 12,000 establishments in this industry generating 50 billion dollars in

sales on average over the years in our study. The industry contains a relatively large number of firms,

more than 5,000 in each of the three years, but the number of firms has been falling over time. The

General Stores industry has also become more concentrated over time: the four-firm concentration of sales

rose from 36 percent in 1987 to 58 percent in 1992 and rose further in 1997. The information technology

revolution has played an important role in this industry through the management of inventories. These



         28
              The concentration ratios for 1997 have been suppressed for disclosure reasons.

                                                      35
stores depend upon high volume of sales as they offer low prices on a wide range of goods and

management of inventories is especially critical for these businesses. Sieling et al (2001) attribute much

of the productivity growth in General Stores to advances in computer technologies. Dumas (1997) notes

that warehouse clubs in particular exhibited rapid growth and changes in size, merchandise mix, and

services provided.

        Over the years of our study, the Catalog Houses industry had on average approximately 8,000

establishments generating 40 billion dollars in sales. In contrast to the other two industries, the number of

firms has increased over the time period (from about 6,000 to 9,000) and the concentration has remained

relatively low and constant over the period in question (the firm-four concentration of sales is about 16

percent). This industry is of particular interest as new e-commerce retail businesses would be classified in

this industry over this period of time (although the amount of this might be limited by 1997). More

generally, the IT revolution could potentially substantially change business practices in this industry via

changes in telecommunications and computer technologies. Sieling et al (2001) site a study which finds

that 95 percent of all catalog companies also sold on the internet.

        The gross reallocation rates of employment over 1987-97 for these three industries are shown in

Table 7. All three industries exhibited dramatic net growth in employment (21 percent for Department

Stores, 25 percent for General Stores, and 50 percent for Catalog Houses). Moreover, large gross flows

account for the net growth in all three industries. In both General Stores and Catalog Houses the

employment creation rates are above 75 percent and the corresponding destruction rates are about 50

percent. The creation and destruction rates are lower for Department Stores, at about 55 percent and 35

percent respectively. Entry and exit dominate the gross flows in all three industries: shares of creation due

to entrants range from 72 percent to 83 percent and shares of destruction due to exits range from 63

percent to 90 percent. These three industries exhibit substantially larger net flows than the average

industry in retail trade (compare to Table 2). Moreover, General Stores and Catalog Houses have larger

                                                     36
gross flows than the average industry.

        The contribution of continuing versus non-continuing firms to net entry differs across industries.

For the Department Stores and General Stores industries, a large fraction of the job creation from new

establishments comes from continuing firms. For Catalog Houses, a much smaller fraction of the job

creation from new establishments comes from continuing firms. This difference across industries in the

importance of new firms may partially reflect differences in their structures. Single unit firms comprise a

much larger fraction of sales and employment in Catalog Houses than in the other two industries. In

General Stores and Catalog Houses, much of the job destruction from exiting establishments is associated

with exiting firms. Exiting firms are not as important for Department Stores.

        The decompositions of labor productivity per hour for 1987-97 are shown in Table 8. For

Department Stores, overall productivity growth is strong (18 percent) and is accounted for equally by

within establishment productivity contributions (56 percent) and net entry contributions (59 percent). The

importance of the within share contrasts sharply with the other two industries, particularly for General

Stores. Combined with the relatively lower creation and destruction rates for the Department Stores

industry, this suggests that the reallocation of workers across establishments is not as important for

productivity growth in Department Stores as it is for other retail trade industries. Notice also that

Department Stores have the lowest productivity growth of the three industries. The contributions of entry

and exit in terms of the impact of continuing and non-continuing firms are also shown in Table 8. Most of

the contribution from births for Department Stores is due to births into continuing firms, while the

contribution from exits are evenly divided between continuing and exiting firms.

        For the General Stores industry, overall productivity growth is large and positive (23 percent) but

the within-establishment contribution is substantially negative (-46 percent). Thus, more than all of the

productivity growth in this industry is accounted for by reallocation, and in particular by net entry. Net

entry accounts for 142 percent of the change in productivity. Combining the productivity and reallocation

                                                      37
results, it is apparent that this industry exhibited huge between-establishment restructuring and that this

restructuring had an enormous productivity payoff. While much of the restructuring is between

establishments, it does not appear to be between firms on the creation side. The positive contribution of

births is entirely from continuing firms, establishment births into new firms contribute negatively to

productivity growth. The positive contribution of exits is due largely to exiting firms.

        For Catalog Houses, the story is substantially different. For this industry, overall productivity

growth is again very large and positive (39 percent) over 1987-97. However, while most of the increase in

productivity is due to reallocation effects via net entry, about 30 percent is a within-establishment effect.

In this industry, there is apparently substantial within and between establishment restructuring and both

had substantial productivity payoffs. In marked contrast to the other two industries, the contribution of

births is largest for births into new firms. Finally, the contribution from deaths for Catalog Houses is all

from exiting firms since exits from continuing firms contribute negatively.

        As before, we ranked groups of establishments in terms of their productivity relative to

continuing establishments in 1987. Department Stores and Catalog Houses have the same rank ordering

as the average industry: productivity relative to 1987 incumbents is higher for 1997 incumbents, higher for

entrants, and lower for exiters. In contrast, for General Stores productivity relative to 1987 incumbents is

lower for 1997 incumbents, slightly higher for entrants, and very much lower for exiters. In sum, the

results suggest that productivity growth in Department Stores is largely a within establishment

phenomenon; in General Stores exits, particularly of establishments of exiting firms, are important; while

in Catalog Houses births, especially of those establishments in new firms, are important.

        The results of the net entry regressions are shown in Table 9 (the specification is given by

equation (8)). Entering establishments have substantially higher productivity than exiting establishments

even after controlling for average overall growth in productivity (*>$). In addition, for all three

industries, entering establishments in 1997 are more productive than 1987 incumbents (*+<>0). For

                                                      38
Department Stores entering establishments in 1997 are less productive than 1997 incumbents (*<0) as

was true for the average industry in retail trade, but for the General Stores and Catalog Houses industries

entrants are more productive than incumbents in 1997 (*>0). In the General Stores and Catalog House

industries, and to a lesser extent in the Department Stores industry, establishment entrants to continuing

firms are more productive than entrants to new firms (*c >*b). In all three industries, establishment exits

from exiting firms are the least productive establishments with productivity lower than that of

establishments exiting from continuing firms ($c >$d).

        The cohort regressions results are reported in Table 10 (the specification is given by equation (9)).

The results show that older entrants have higher productivity than younger entrants for all three industries

(0> :). Again, we attempt to disentangle the selection and learning effects that could account for this

pattern. The selection and learning regression results are shown in Table 11 (the specification is given by

equation (10)). For all three industries, as with the average industry results, establishments that entered

between 1987-92 and then exited are significantly less productive in 1992 than continuing incumbents in

1992 ("<0) and are also less productive in 1992 than the surviving members of this cohort ("<2). The

latter finding is broadly consistent with selection effects since it is the less productive establishments from

the entering cohort that exit. However, the relationship between exiting establishments that entered

between 1987-92 in 1992 and other exiting establishments (" and () for these three industries differs from

the average. In these three industries, there is either no significant difference between the two groups (as

for Department Stores and Catalog Houses) or the exiting establishments from the 1987-92 cohort are

more productive in 1992 than other exiting establishments (">().

        As with the industry average, the surviving members of the entering 1987-92 cohort are actually

more productive than incumbents (2>0) even upon entry. However, we find evidence of learning effects

(2<8) only for General Stores. For General Stores those that survived from the entering cohort exhibited

an 18 point log increase in productivity from 1992 to 1997 relative to other surviving incumbents. This

                                                      39
latter post-entry growth effect holds (roughly) for entrants from both continuing and new firms. The

finding of significant learning effects for surviving entrants of new firms contrasts with the findings we

report for the average industry in the prior section (where learning effects are confined to entrants of

continuing firms). Recall that for the industry average, once we separately account for the learning of the

entering cohort, there is essentially no productivity growth for incumbents between 1992 and 1997 who

also were present in 1987 (<=0). This is not the case for the three industries: Department Stores and

Catalog Houses show positive productivity growth for incumbents (<>0) while General Stores shows

negative productivity growth for incumbents (<<0).

        In many ways, these three industries are more dramatic versions of what we observed for retail

trade as a whole. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of these industry-specific results is that we observe

substantial differences in the importance of the within-establishment contribution. All of the industries

exhibit rapid productivity growth with net entry playing a very large role. However, in one case the

within component is almost as large as the net entry component (Department Stores), in another case it is

about half as large as the net entry component (Catalog Houses), and in the third case the within

contribution is actually negative (General Stores). The most natural interpretation is that continuing

establishments in the Department Stores and Catalog Houses industry were able to find ways to improve

their productivity internally while continuing establishments in the General Stores apparently were not

able to reinvent themselves in such a positive manner. Interestingly, in this latter industry, net entry more

than compensated for the poor performance of continuing businesses. We only found evidence of strong

learning effects in General Stores. Moreover, it was especially entry of establishments from continuing

businesses and exiting establishments from exiting businesses that generated the large impact of net entry.



8.      Concluding Remarks



                                                     40
        The evidence that we have presented in this paper suggests that aggregate productivity dynamics

in retail trade are driven by the reallocation of inputs and outputs from less productive to more productive

establishments. Specifically, our main findings can be summarized as follows. Retail trade businesses

exhibit continuous large scale reallocation of output and labor across establishments within the same

narrowly defined industries. Much of the reallocation is accounted for by entry and exit of

establishments but a substantial fraction of the between establishment reallocation is due to within firm

reallocation. We also find that retail trade businesses in the same four-digit industry exhibit tremendous

productivity differences and for continuing businesses these differences are highly persistent. We find

that new establishments enter at roughly equal rates across the distribution of labor productivity, but

exiting establishments disproportionately are from the lowest percentiles of the labor productivity

distribution.

        When we decompose industry-level productivity growth into reallocation and within-

establishment effects we find that net entry accounts for virtually all of the labor productivity growth in

retail trade. Exiting establishments are substantially less productive than incumbents (about 25 percent)

and entering establishments exhibit about the same productivity as incumbents at the point of entry.

Further investigation from tracking cohorts of entrants shows that these entry and exit dynamics are

closely linked. For any new cohort, many of the new establishments fail and those that fail are

substantially less productive than incumbents. For successful entrants, we find that they exhibit more

rapid productivity growth in the first five years after entry than incumbents over that same period of time

suggesting learning by doing. Moreover we find that there are distinct differences in the dynamics of

entry and exit of establishments from continuing firms and from non-continuing firms. Exiting

establishments from exiting firms exhibit extremely low productivity, while entering establishments from

continuing firms exhibit very high productivity.

         Finally, having provided a broad picture of the link between aggregate and micro productivity

                                                     41
dynamics in the retail trade sector by focusing on the average industry, we narrow our focus to concentrate

on three industries in the sector. We find that the sources of productivity growth differ greatly across the

industries. In some industries within-establishment effects make an important positive contribution, but in

others the within-establishment effects are negative. In addition, while selection effects (especially those

from entering cohorts) are evident in all three industries that we study, learning (by doing) effects are only

evident in one of the industries.

        Broadly speaking, these findings show that reallocation effects dominate productivity growth in

retail trade. Compared to the results for U.S. manufacturing in the existing literature, in retail trade net

entry is virtually the entire story while in U.S. manufacturing net entry accounts for only about one third

of the story. Indeed, in an accounting sense, without churning retail trade would not have exhibited any

productivity growth. The clear message that emerges is that in the U.S. retail trade sector new ways of

doing business are introduced and successfully contribute to productivity growth via entry and exit.

Within-establishment restructuring does not contribute much to productivity growth for the overall sector

but we did find some detailed industries where the within-establishment contribution is substantially

greater. We do find that within-firm restructuring does contribute substantially but as noted above it is the

within-firm interacting with the between-firm restructuring that is especially important (i.e., entrants from

continuing firms versus exits from exiting firms). While these findings are interesting, they raise many

questions that deserve further attention. For one, it would be of interest to document the precise nature of

the organizational and structural changes that are driving the enormous pace of entry and exit in the retail

trade sector. We have found that in industries where the descriptive evidence suggests substantial

restructuring we observe such restructuring and that it contributes substantially to overall productivity

growth. A natural next step is to link the establishment-level productivity and employment dynamics that

we have been exploiting here with observable indicators of the types of technological changes (broadly

speaking) that are observed across establishments. There is some scope to do this with the Census of

                                                      42
Retail Trade data since there is much information about the types of establishments that we have not yet

exploited.

        While the churning appears to be productivity enhancing for the entire retail trade sector, it would

be of interest to explore whether this finding holds up for all industries and for all types of businesses.

Market imperfections such as imperfect capital markets can distort the reallocation process. It may be that

such market imperfections are more important for small businesses so it would be of interest to focus

attention on the role of churning for small businesses. In addition, the smallest retail establishments are

often single establishments with an owner/manager. The dynamics of such owner-managed businesses

may be very different as we know for example that the presence of an owner-manager at an establishment

yields a lower probability of exit (see, e.g., Holmes and Schmitz (1992)). Examining the connection

between churning and productivity growth for such owner-managed businesses is another area for future

work.

        Finally, lurking underneath all of this analysis are difficult measurement and conceptual issues in

terms of measuring productivity at the micro and industry level in retail trade. The official statistical

agency measures of productivity in the retail trade sector are primarily measures based upon sales per

worker. In a like manner, the micro based measures we use here primarily reflect sales per worker.

Under strong assumptions, these measures correspond to (or are highly correlated with) what we are really

interested in: some measure of value-added per hour in the retail trade sector at the micro and aggregate

levels. Some of the measurement difficulties are shared at the micro and industry level (e.g., inadequate

measures of gross margins) but some of the measurement problems are more severe at the micro level so

that measurement error at the micro level is likely non-trivial. We believe that the measurement

difficulties at the micro level deserve much further attention and as such our results should be viewed with

appropriate caution and seen as exploratory. However, it is worth noting that it may be that the

measurement error at the micro level implies that we have understated the contribution of net entry to

                                                      43
productivity growth in retail trade. If we interpret the micro measurement error as classical then such

classical measurement error will lower the estimated differentials we have detected across entering and

exiting establishments and, in turn, imply that we have understated the contribution of net entry to

aggregate industry growth.

                                         Data Appendix

A.1     Administrative Records in the Census of Retail Trade
         The Census Bureau relies on administrative records to gather data on nonemployers and selected
small establishments. The definition of selected small establishments varies by year. In general the
selected small establishments are business firms with paid employees and with payrolls below a specified
cutoff. Although the cutoff varies by kind of business, the small-employer segment generally includes
firms with one to three paid employees. This group usually represents about 10 percent of total retail
sales. See Bureau of the Census (1992, 1996, 2000) for further discussion.

A.2     Bureau of Labor Statistics Data
         For all of the four-digit industry indices that we are using from BLS, there are 24 four-digit
industries that do not meet BLS standards for publication. The BLS deflators that we use are industry
implicit price deflators. “In the case of retail trade industries, the industry price index is developed by
combining current-year consumer price indexes with weights based in sales for each category of
merchandise in census years (Bureau of Labor Statistics (1997), p.105).29 ”
         The BLS employee hours index is for “all employees”which includes the self-employed and
unpaid family workers (except for industries 5311 and 5511 which are all paid employees). The index of
hours is created by dividing a measure of total hours in the industry in each year by the hours for the base
year. Total hours are measured for each industry as the industry’s annual employment times the industry’s
average weekly hours times 52.

A.3     Creating Longitudinal Links
         One of the first tasks in preparing the micro data is to link each establishment’s data over time.
These links allow us to measure establishment births and deaths and to measure productivity growth over
time. In theory these linkages can take place via the unique permanent establishment number (PPN) that
is assigned to each establishment. In practice there are often problems with the PPNs that cause links to be
incorrectly severed. We improve our links by using additional identifiers on the files and sophisticated
matching software which uses the name and address information from the business establishment list that
Census maintains.30
         Another data issue concerns the existence of active establishments with zero total employment.
Roughly speaking, an active establishment is one with positive payroll over the current year. It is not
surprising to find active establishments with zero employment since employment is measured only for the
pay period including March 12th. Since we use total employment (or employment times hours) in the
denominator of our productivity measure and employment (or employment times hours) weights to


         29
              Concerning the BLS price index, Nakamura (1998) discusses the price mismeasurement in
 retail trade introduced by the adoption of electronic scanners which allow establishments to switch prices
 (as for sales promotions) relatively costlessly. In this case, the establishment’s measured price is higher
 than the actual price paid by consumers, resulting in an upwardly biased price index.
           30
              An additional problem with relying on the PPN for links is the existence of duplicate PPNs in a
 given census year. This is a relatively small problem: the duplicate PPN establishments account for only
 0.5 percent of establishments in 1987, 0.06 percent in 1992, and 0.01 percent in 1997. These duplicate
 PPNs do not appear to be predominantly in any one of the industries within retail trade. We drop these
 duplicate PPNs from our analysis.

                                                     48
aggregate, these observations would be dropped and or contribute nothing to aggregate in year with zero
employment. A concern about this is that the loss of an observation can potentially cause a false birth or
death if the establishment has positive employment in the other years. Since we are interested in births and
deaths it is important that we avoid creating false births and deaths. For this reason, we delete
establishments that have positive payroll but zero total employment in any of the three years in our
analysis. Approximately 13 percent of the total three year sample is dropped using this rule. Of these
observations that are dropped using the zero employment rule, the majority have zero employment or
missing employment in all three years under consideration and thus would be dropped from all three years
even with a less strict rule. The reason for this is that "true" entry and exit are so large that a substantial
fraction of those establishments who have one observation of positive payroll and zero employment are
not in the Census in other years. In fact, 68 percent of these dropped observations have missing
employment in the other two years under consideration (recall one year must have zero employment to be
in this group). In any event, we believe that this methodology yields a more conservative estimate of the
contribution of entry and exit to the reallocation and productivity dynamics -- that is, if anything we are
undercounting the contribution of entry and exit. 31

A.4     Comparing Our Data to BLS’ Data
          Since the CRT data have not been extensively used and our methodology is based on aggregating
up micro data, it is helpful to compare the productivity measures based on the Census data to those
officially published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The BLS creates a labor productivity per hours
index for each of the 64 four-digit industries in retail trade. It is not practical for us to attempt to replicate
BLS’ index numbers since BLS uses a Tornqvist index which would require us to use merchandise line
data. Instead of attempting to replicate their methodology, we compare growth rates of the BLS series and
our series at the industry and retail trade levels.
          To create our measure of labor productivity growth, we create establishment-level productivity
growth series which we aggregate up to the four-digit level using the manhours weights and then to the
retail trade level using gross average nominal output weights by industry. For the BLS measure, we
calculate the four-digit growth rate by taking the log difference of their four-digit productivity by hours
index over the appropriate year pairs. We aggregate this from the four-digit industry level to the retail
trade level using the same weights as for the Census measure so that we may concentrate on the within
industry differences in these measures. At the time in which we did the empirical analysis, BLS data
contained some known problem industries, we also calculated these measures excluding the industries
which BLS designated as problematic. As is evident from Table A, the two measures of productivity
growth are roughly similar across all three sets of years. The correlations at the industry level for 1987-97
are 0.80 for all industries and 0.81 for the subset of industries that meet BLS’ standards for publication.
The five-year aggregate growth rates implied by the Census data are higher for 1987-92 (about 5 percent
versus about 4 percent) than the BLS growth rates, but are lower for 1992-97 (about 6 percent versus
about 9 percent). Interestingly, the growth rates over the ten-year horizon are also reasonably close
(especially for the BLS published industries).




         31
              These establishments could be seasonal establishments with sales/payroll activity at other
 times of year. They could be late year births or early year deaths (prior to March 12). We suspect that
 this latter case is more prevalent and this implies we may be undercounting the contribution of entry and
 exit to our analysis.

Notes: Results are based upon regression of pooled 1992 and 1997 data with dependent variable the
measure of productivity. The explanatory variables include year effects, an entry dummy in 1997, the
exit dummy interacted with whether the plant is in the 87-92 entering cohort, and a surviving dummy
for the 87-92 entering cohort interacted with the year effects. Note that the results in the lower panel
also include the year effect and it is the same as in panel A All results are weighted regressions with
manhours weights. Standard errors in parentheses.
