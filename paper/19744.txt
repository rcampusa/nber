                                           ABSTRACT

Mortgages are long-term loans with nominal payments. Consequently, under incomplete asset
markets, monetary policy can affect housing investment and the economy through the cost of new
mortgage borrowing and real payments on outstanding debt. These channels, distinct from
traditional real rate channels, are embedded in a general equilibrium model. The transmission
mechanism is found to be stronger under adjustable- than fixed-rate mortgages. Further, monetary
policy shocks affecting the level of the nominal yield curve have larger real effects than transitory
shocks, affecting its slope. Persistently higher inflation gradually benefits homeowners under
FRMs, but hurts them immediately under ARMs.

1         Introduction

Mortgages are long-term loans with regular nominal payments, consisting of interest and
amortization. The payments are set up so as to guarantee that, given the mortgage interest
rate, the principal is gradually repaid in full by the end of the mortgage term, typically 15
to 30 years. A ﬁxed-rate mortgage (FRM) has a ﬁxed nominal interest rate and constant

nominal payments, set at origination, for the entire term of the loan; an adjustable-rate
mortgage (ARM), in contrast, sets nominal payments on a period-by-period basis so as,
given the current short-term nominal interest rate, the loan is expected to be repaid in full
during its remaining term. Various mortgage loans build on these two basic contracts and

in most countries, typically, one or the other type dominates.1
        While the long-term nominal aspect of mortgages—a form of nominal ‘rigidity’—has
been studied in the household ﬁnance literature (e.g., Campbell and Cocco, 2003), a formal
analysis of its consequences at the aggregate level has been missing (see Campbell, 2013).
This is despite the fact that mortgages, in the minds of policy makers, constitute an integral

part of a monetary transmission mechanism (e.g., Bernanke and Gertler, 1995; Bernanke,
2007; Mishkin, 2007).
        In major economies, already the size of mortgage ﬁnance would suggest that its role in the
monetary transmission mechanism must be important. Mortgage payments are equivalent to

15-22% of homeowners’ pre-tax income in the U.S. (average for the past 30-40 years); 15-20%
in the U.K. (Hancock and Wood, 2004); 27% in Germany (European Mortgage Federation,
2012b); 36.5% in Denmark (ﬁrst-time homeowners; European Mortgage Federation, 2012c);
and 30% in France (ﬁrst-time homeowners; European Mortgage Federation, 2009). And the
    1
    Countries in which FRMs—with interest rates ﬁxed for at least 10 years—have traditionally dom-
inated the mortgage market include Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, and the United States; in
most other countries, either ARMs or FRMs with interest rates ﬁxed for less than 5 years prevail; see
Scanlon and Whitehead (2004) and European Mortgage Federation (2012a). Research is still inconclusive
on the causes of the cross-country heterogeneity, but likely reasons include government policies, historical
path dependence, sources of mortgage funding (capital markets vs. bank deposits), and inﬂation experience;
see Miles (2004), Green and Wachter (2005), and Campbell (2013). Countries also diﬀer in terms of prepay-
ment penalties, costs of reﬁnancing, recourse, prevalence of teaser rates, the frequency of ARM resets, and
the ARM reference rate. Our analysis abstracts from these details.
mortgage debt to (annual) GDP ratio in developed economies has reached on average 70% in
2009, although there is a large cross-country variation (International Monetary Fund, 2011,
Chapter 3). In some countries outstanding mortgage debt is even larger than government
debt and its maturity is longer.2

       In light of these facts, this paper provides a conceptual and quantitative analysis of the
role of the long-term nominal nature of mortgages in the monetary transmission mechanism
at the aggregate level. In order to accommodate the mortgage market structure of diﬀerent
countries, both FRM and ARM contracts are studied. First, in a simple partial equilibrium

setup, the paper describes the channels through which mortgage contracts transmit nominal
shocks to the real economy. These channels are then embedded in a calibrated general
equilibrium model. The purpose of this exercise is to impose general equilibrium discipline
on the problem, given its aggregate context, and assess the quantitative importance of the

mechanism. To keep the analysis transparent, we abstract from all other nominal rigidities
(sticky prices, wages), as well as other channels through which housing ﬁnance aﬀects the
macroeconomy (e.g., default or the role of home equity lines of credit in providing liquidity).
       The transmission mechanism is studied in an environment in which homeowners do not

trade a full set of state-contingent securities with mortgage investors. Consequently, the
eﬀective discount factors of the two agent types are not equalized state by state and risk
sharing is limited. In this setup, we identify two channels through which mortgage con-
tracts transmit nominal shocks into the real economy. Both channels are distinct from the
traditional real rate channel of monetary policy transmission.3
       One channel works through the cost of new mortgage loans (‘price eﬀect’). In essence, it is
a dynamic version of the tilt eﬀect, previously studied in static settings (e.g., Schwab, 1982).
Expected future inﬂation, transmitted into nominal mortgage interest rates, redistributes
real mortgage payments over the life of the loan so as to leave mortgage investors indiﬀerent
   2
      Hilscher, Raviv, and Reis (2014) document that in the United States government debt has predominantly
short-term maturity.
    3
      The real rate channel, whereby the central bank directly aﬀects the ex-ante short-term real interest rate,
is described by, e.g., Bernanke and Gertler (1995). In our model, the real interest rate responds to monetary
policy shocks only indirectly through general equilibrium eﬀects.


                                                       2
between new mortgages and other assets. If this results in real payments increasing in
periods/states in which income has high value to homeowners, the eﬀective cost of the
mortgage to homeowners increases. This eﬀect is qualitatively the same under both FRM
and ARM.

       The other channel works through the eﬀects of inﬂation on the real value of mortgage
payments of outstanding debt (‘income eﬀect’).4 Under incomplete asset markets, the nom-
inal nature of mortgages translates inﬂation shocks into shocks to real disposable income.
This channel is qualitatively diﬀerent under the two contracts. Under FRM, higher inﬂation

reduces real mortgage payments; under ARM, higher inﬂation increases real mortgage pay-
ments, if it suﬃciently transmits into higher nominal interest rates. Under FRM, the eﬀects
grow gradually over time through accumulated inﬂation; under ARM they are immediate
and resemble the eﬀects of an increase in the real interest rate, even when the real rate itself

does not change.
       The general equilibrium model, which embeds the two channels, consists of homeowners
and capital owners/mortgage investors. There is a representative agent of each type. Such
a coarse split of the population is motivated by Campbell and Cocco (2003): in the data,

the 3rd and 4th quintiles of the wealth distribution represent typical homeowners; the 5th
quintile represents capital owners.5 As an approximation to the characteristics in the data,
homeowners in the model derive income from labor and invest in housing capital, ﬁnancing
a given fraction of housing investment with mortgages. Capital owners do not work and
invest in capital used in production, one-period nominal bonds, and mortgages, pricing the

assets competitively by arbitrage. Homeowners can also access the one-period bond market,
but at a cost. The production side is standard and monetary policy is characterized by an
interest rate rule.
       We study the transmission mechanism under (i) FRM and ARM in isolation, (ii) the
   4
     Bernanke and Gertler (1995) and Mishkin (2007) refer to this eﬀect also as a ‘cash ﬂow’ or ‘household
balance sheet’ eﬀect.
   5
     The 1st and 2nd quintiles are essentially renters with no assets and little liabilities and are not included
in the model.



                                                       3
co-existence of the two contracts and the endogenous choice between them, and (iii) reﬁ-
nancing. In equilibrium, the stochastic properties of short- and long-term nominal interest
rates depend on the parameters of exogenous shock processes. Using the model, the persis-
tence and standard deviations of two shocks—to the monetary policy rule (a nominal shock)

and the one-period bond market (a real shock)—are estimated by matching the volatility
and persistence of the long-term nominal interest rate and the long-short spread. Similarly
to Atkeson and Kehoe (2009), the nominal shock turns out to be highly persistent, shifting
the level of the nominal yield curve and inﬂation, the other shock fairly temporary, aﬀecting

the slope of the yield curve and the ex-ante real interest rate. Given these estimates, the
model is used as a laboratory to study the eﬀects of the nominal shock, which—like the level
factor in the data, e.g., Piazzesi (2006)—is the more important of the two shocks for nominal
interest rates (in contrast, existing money-macro literature mainly studies shocks aﬀecting

the real rate). The main focus is on housing investment, where the shock should matter the
most, but responses of other variables are also studied.6
       The ﬁndings can be summarized as follows. First, the real eﬀects of the nominal shock
turn out to be stronger under ARM than FRM: a one percentage point (annualized) down-

ward shift of the nominal yield curve and inﬂation generates, on impact, a 1.8% increase in
housing investment under ARM, whereas a 0.7% decline under FRM (0.15% decline with
reﬁnancing).7 The magnitude of the response under ARM is similar to those reported in the
literature as occurring due to real rate shocks, making the transmission mechanism under
ARM as potent as traditional real rate channels. The ﬁnding that the eﬀects are stronger

under ARM than FRM may seem surprising as, a-priori, one may expect that a contract
ﬁxing nominal payments for the entire term will generate larger real eﬀects. The failure to
do so is because under FRM the increase in real mortgage payments due to lower inﬂation
   6
     There are two additional shocks: to total factor productivity and the marginal rate of transformation
between housing and nonhousing use of output. Together, the four shocks produce standard deviations of
endogenous variables, and their correlations with output, consistent with the cyclical moments of U.S. data.
In addition, we cross-validate the model against existing empirical studies with respect to the responses of
housing investment, under FRM and ARM, to shocks to the real interest rate and the size of the marginal
propensity to consume out of homeowners’ income. The model lines up well with both.
   7
     The responses are symmetric for an upward shift of the yield curve, except in the case of reﬁnancing.


                                                     4
is only gradual and is partially oﬀset by the price eﬀect (less expensive new loans). Under
ARM, the decline in real mortgage payments is immediate and is further strengthened by
the price eﬀect. Reﬁnancing, while in principle making FRM look like ARM when interest
rates decline, does not overturn the result. This is because, once calibrated to the data,

reﬁnancing accounts for only a small fraction of the outstanding debt (2% per quarter on
average for total reﬁnancing and less than 1% when cash-out reﬁnancing, not necessarily
related to interest rates, is excluded).8 When FRMs and ARMs coexist, the real eﬀects lie
in-between the two separate cases. Under U.S. calibration, the results are still closer to the

FRM case than the ARM case.
       Second, under both contracts, the size of the real eﬀects declines with the persistence
of the nominal shock (i.e., when the shock starts to aﬀect mainly the slope of the yield
curve). This is because what matters with long-term loans is the expected path of inﬂation,

and nominal interest rates, over the entire term of the loan.9 And third, persistently higher
inﬂation redistributes income from capital owners to homeowners under FRM, but (at least
initially) from homeowners to capital owners under ARM. The redistribution is gradual
under FRM, but immediate under ARM.

       The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 connects the paper with the literature. Section
3 explains the main ideas. Section 4 describes the general equilibrium model. Section 5
maps it into data. Section 6 cross-validates the model. Section 7 reports ﬁndings from
the main computational experiments. Section 8 concludes and oﬀers suggestions for future
research. Supplemental material contains (i) equilibrium conditions, (ii) computation, (iii)

data counterparts to the variables, and (iv) estimates of mortgage debt servicing costs for
the United States.
   8
     Even though the reﬁnancing fraction can as much as double in response to realistic drops in interest
rates, it is still insuﬃcient to overturn the ﬁndings. Of course, given the large size of the stock, the small
variation in the fraction of the stock shows up as a large variation in the share of reﬁ loans in new loans,
reported periodically by Fredie Mac.
   9
     The model abstracts from the possibility that monetary policy may tilt the slope of the yield curve by
aﬀecting term premia. All the eﬀects on the slope work in the model through the expectations hypothesis.
We also abstract from potential eﬀects of monetary policy on mortgage markups and the primary-secondary
spread.

2        Related studies

The paper is related to diﬀerent strands of a growing literature on monetary policy, housing,
and debt.10 First, following Iacoviello (2005), a number of studies focus on the interaction
between sticky prices and the collateral value of housing, whereby housing facilitates bor-
rowing for general consumption purposes, similar to home equity lines of credit (Iacoviello,

2010, contains a brief summary of this line of research). To this end, loans in these mod-
els are one-period loans.11 We abstract from this channel, focusing instead on the role of
mortgages as loans for house purchase (i.e., ﬁrst mortgages) and stressing their long-term
nominal aspect in transmitting nominal shocks to the real economy.12

       Second, following Doepke and Schneider (2006), there is work on the redistributive ef-
fects of inﬂation under incomplete markets and nominal debt (Meh, Rios-Rull, and Terajima,
2010; Sheedy, 2013; Doepke, Schneider, and Selezneva, 2015). This research focuses exclu-
sively on debt contracts with ﬁxed nominal payments, similar to FRM loans. However, we
show that the redistributive consequences of inﬂation are quite opposite under ARM con-

tracts. Policy recommendations based on this literature, such as nominal GDP targeting
(Sheedy, 2013), are thus inappropriate for countries with a large fraction of ARMs.13
       Third, a line of research investigates, in various contexts, the eﬀects of inﬂation on hous-
ing: the tax code (Piazzesi and Schneider, 2012), money illusion (Piazzesi and Schneider,

2007; Brunnermeier and Julliard, 2008), and substitution between market and home pro-
  10
     The role of housing ﬁnance, both ﬁrst mortgages and home equity lines of credit, has been also studied in
the context of home ownership, consumption smoothing, optimal mortgage choice, reﬁnancing, default, the
recent ﬁnancial crisis, and the cyclical dynamics of residential investment (see Davis and Van Nieuwerburgh,
2015, for an overiew of this broader literature). Many of these studies model housing market decisions in
great detail, but the models are either partial equilibrium or steady-state models. Our model is general
equilibrium model with aggregate shocks, but compromises on the details of the housing market.
  11
     Rubio (2011) extends the Iacoviello (2005) framework by considering one-period loans with interest rates
evolving in a sluggish manner, as a weighted average of past interest rates, interpreting such loans as FRMs.
Calza, Monacelli, and Stracca (2013) distinguish between ARMs, modeled as one-period loans, and FRMs,
modeled as two-period loans.
  12
     Ghent (2012) considers long-term FRM loans denominated in real, rather than nominal, terms. The
monetary transmission mechanism in her model works through the long-term real interest rate, which re-
sponds only little to monetary policy shocks.
  13
     Auclert (2014) studies redistributive eﬀects of monetary policy working through a real rate channel.
Redistributive eﬀects of monetary policy are also at the heart of the transmission mechanism proposed by
Sterk and Tenreyro (2013).

duction (Aruoba, Davis, and Wright, 2012).14 In our model, inﬂation transmits to housing
investment through mortgage contracts.
       Finally, in recent years, a few studies investigated empirically connections between mon-
etary policy and mortgage contracts. Villar Burke (2015) compares interest rates on out-

standing mortgage debt and new mortgage loans in a sample of Eurozone countries in a
period around the cut in the European Central Bank’s policy rate in 2008/2009. In coun-
tries in which FRMs dominate (Germany and France) there was almost no change in the
interest rate on the pool of outstanding mortgages, despite relatively stable house prices. In

contrast, in countries in which ARMs dominate (Spain and, to a smaller extent, Italy), the
interest rate on the pool declined almost in parallel with the policy rate. The responses of
interest rates on new loans also diﬀered across countries, declining more moderately in FRM
countries than in ARM countries. Consistency with these empirical ﬁndings is at the core

of the mechanism in our model.
       Calza et al. (2013), using a VAR model based on the usual identiﬁcation strategy, ﬁnd
stronger negative responses of housing investment to positive monetary policy shocks in ARM
then FRM countries.15 The shock they identify is closer to the real interest rate shock in our
model, than the nominal shock we focus on, in the sense that it increases the real interest
rate. Our model is consistent with their ﬁnding, producing stronger negative responses to
the real interest rate shock under ARM than FRM. Even quantitatively, the responses are
comparable.
       Di Maggio, Kermani, and Ramcharan (2014) and Keys, Piskorski, Seru, and Yao (2014)

exploit the variation across U.S. counties in the use of FRM and ARM contracts to investigate
the responses of consumption to the 2008 cut in the Fed funds rate using household-level
data. Both studies ﬁnd that counties with a larger share of ARMs in the existing pool
of loans experienced a much larger boost in homeowners’ consumption than counties with

a larger share of FRMs. While the authors are careful to control for other channels that
could potentially lead to such an outcome, identiﬁcation can always be an issue in reduced-
form analysis. Our model provides a theoretical general-equilibrium underpinning for such
empirical ﬁndings, generating larger responses under ARM than FRM for both types of

interest rate shocks, nominal and real. Furthermore, the model replicates the empirical
marginal propensities of consumption, out of the extra income saved on mortgage payments,
for a slightly lower than the benchmark persistence of the interest rate shocks.16



3     A simple partial equilibrium model

The main ideas can be conveyed within a simple partial equilibrium model. We describe the

two channels of transmission (price and income eﬀects) under FRM and ARM, explain why
the combined eﬀect is stronger under ARM, and discuss under what conditions monetary
policy is neutral and to what extent the results also apply to other forms of nominal debt.
Reﬁnancing and the choice between FRM and ARM are delayed until the full model, although

we touch on these issues in Section 3.7, which provides numerical illustrations of the price
and income eﬀects.
    Throughout this section, the real interest rate and real labor income are held constant,
the one-period nominal interest rate is varied exogenously, and the current inﬂation rate is

also exogenous. All these variables are endogenized in the general equilibrium model. The
details of FRM and ARM loans diﬀer across countries. We abstract from the details and
focus on the key common features.17
  16
     Cloyne, Ferreira, and Surico (2015) also use household-level data. They attempt to identify changes in
nominal interest rates in the United States and the United Kingdom due to monetary policy surprises. While
they ﬁnd substantial diﬀerences in the responses between outright homeowners and mortgagors, they do not
ﬁnd large diﬀerences between the responses of mortgagors in the two countries.
  17
     For instance, in the United States, the ARM rate may not change at the same frequency as the monetary
policy rate, as in our model. Typically, the ARM rate changes only once a year. In addition, many ARMs
have an initial period for which the rate is ﬁxed. In contrast, tracker mortgages, common for instance in
Ireland, change the mortgage rate whenever the policy rate of the European Central Bank changes.

3.1    A mortgage-ﬁnanced house purchase

There are three periods, with time denoted by t = 1, 2, 3. Each period a household is endowed

with constant real income w and in t = 1 has no outstanding mortgage debt (outstanding
debt is considered later). In t = 1, the household makes a once-and-for-all house purchase,
ﬁnancing a fraction θ of the purchase with a loan and a fraction 1 − θ with income. The loan
can be used only for house purchase and the house lasts for t = 2, 3, then it fully depreciates.
                                                                         
The life-time utility function of the household is V = 3t=1 β t−1 u(ct ) + 3t=2 β t−1 g(h), where
β is a discount factor, ct is period-t nonhousing consumption, h is housing, and u(.) and g(.)
have standard properties. The household maximizes utility with respect to c1 , c2 , c3 , and
h, subject to three per-period budget constraints: c1 + h = w + l/p1 , c2 = w − m2 /p2 , and
c3 = w − m3 /p3 , where l = θp1 h is the nominal value of the loan, m2 and m3 are nominal

mortgage payments, and pt is the aggregate price level (i.e., the price of goods in terms of
an abstract unit of account; this section abstracts from house prices).
   Assume there is a ﬁnancial market that prices assets by the no-arbitrage principle but
in which the household does not participate due to, for instance, high entry costs. This

exclusion is reﬂected in the sequence of the budget constraints above, which do not allow for
ﬁnancial instruments other than the mortgage (in the full model this assumption is partially
relaxed, but maintaining it at this stage brings out the key aspects of the mechanism more
clearly). Assume that monetary policy controls the one-period nominal interest rate it . No-

arbitrage pricing implies the Fisher eﬀect: 1 + πt+1 = (1 + it )/(1 + r), where 1 + r is a gross
real interest rate, given by some exogenous eﬀective discount factor (intertemporal rate of
substitution) of investors, μ∗ = (1 + r)−1, and πt+1 ≡ pt+1 /pt − 1 is the inﬂation rate between
periods t and t + 1.
   Mortgage payments have a general form, m2 ≡ (iM
                                                 2 +γ)l and m3 ≡ (i3 +1)(1−γ)l. Here,

rate in the ﬁrst period of the life of the mortgage, when the outstanding nominal debt is l.


                                               9
In the second period, the outstanding nominal debt is (1 − γ)l and the amortization rate is
equal to one (i.e., the mortgage is repaid in full). For a standard mortgage, γ is calculated
                                              18

       In the FRM case, no-arbitrage pricing by investors means that iF satisﬁes

3.2       Price eﬀect

The price eﬀect refers to the eﬀect of monetary policy on the cost of new mortgages.19
By ‘monetary policy’ we mean a sequence of short-term nominal interest rates i1 and i2 .
The sequence is known to the household (and the investors). Generally speaking, diﬀerent
sequences of nominal interest rates lead to diﬀerent sequences of real mortgage payments
over the life of the loan, so as to ensure that the present value of the one-dollar loan is equal

to one dollar, as dictated by the no-arbitrage pricing by investors. This, however, aﬀects the
value of the loan from the household’s perspective, as the household does not have the same
  18
     It is easy to verify that a higher iM
                                         2 implies higher mortgage payments, despite the fact that γ changes
to equalize the payments between the two periods. Observe that to equalize the payments, γ = 1/(2 + iM     2 ).
Therefore, dγ/diM  2 =  −1/(2+i  M 2
                                 2  ) ∈ (−0.25, 0). That is, when the mortgage rate increases, the amortization
rate needs to decline, but the decline is small. Overall, mortgage payments therefore increase. As a ﬁrst
pass, we can therefore abstract from changes in the amortization rate when studying the eﬀects of interest
rates on mortgage payments.
  19
     While the price eﬀect is discussed in a deterministic setup, which is the simplest setup in which it can
be demonstrated, it is straightforward to extend it to stochastic settings.

valuation of the real mortgage payments as the investors. This is due to the assumed market
incompleteness, which prevents an equalization of the eﬀective discount factors across the
two agent types.
   Speciﬁcally, after substituting the budget constraints in the utility function, the ﬁrst-

order condition for the utility maximization problem of the household with respect to h
gives
                                    u (c1 )(1 + τH ) = β(1 + β)g (h),

where

is a wedge between the marginal utility of period-1 nonhousing consumption and the marginal
lifetime utility of housing. Further, μt,t+1 ≡ βu(ct+1 )/u (ct ) is the household’s eﬀective
discount factor. The wedge—working like a relative price of housing—captures the cost of
mortgage ﬁnance from the household’s perspective. To see this, observe that the expression
in the square brackets is the present value of real mortgage payments, discounted with the

household’s eﬀective discount factor, μt,t+1 , rather than the eﬀective discount factor of the
investor, μ∗ . In the case of FRM

where, in the second term, we have used the Fisher eﬀect (1 + i2 )/(1 + π3 ) = (μ∗ )−1 .

   To explain the eﬀect of monetary policy on the wedge, it is easier to start with the ARM
case. A decline in i1 , for instance, reduces the real payments in the ﬁrst period of the life of
the loan, (i1 + γ)/(1 + π2 ). To see this, observe that through the Fisher eﬀect, π2 declines



                                                     11
one-for-one with i1 but—as γ is less than one—the eﬀect of i1 on the numerator is larger than
the eﬀect of π2 on the denominator. The decline in π2 , however, increases the real payments
in the second period of the life of the loan, (μ∗ )−1 (1 − γ)/(1 + π2 ). If the household’s eﬀective
discount factor assigns a suﬃciently large weight on payments in the ﬁrst period of the life

of the loan, mortgage ﬁnance becomes cheaper for the household and the wedge declines,
inducing more housing investment. In the FRM case, the eﬀect is similar, as long as iF
suﬃciently declines in response to the decline in the short rate. This will be the case if the
decline in the short rate is persistent; i.e., both i1 and i2 decline. The lower inﬂation rates,

π2 and π3 , increase real payments in the second period of the life of the FRM loan, but again,
the wedge declines if the those payments are suﬃciently discounted.20


3.3       Income eﬀect

The income eﬀect refers to the eﬀect of monetary policy on the real value of payments on
outstanding mortgage debt. It concerns ex-post changes in inﬂation and, in the case of ARM,

also nominal interest rates. Eﬀectively, the nominal aspect of mortgages translates nominal
shocks to inﬂation and nominal interest rates into shocks to real mortgage payments and
disposable income.
       To make the discussion concrete, consider a household in period t = 1, that took out a

mortgage in period t = 0. The mortgage matures in t = 3 (to show the income eﬀect under
ARM, the minimum length of the loan has to be three periods). By ‘monetary policy’ we
mean a sequence π1 , i1 , and i2 , which becomes known to the household in period t = 1;
i.e., one period after the household took out the loan (in this sense it is a monetary policy
  20
    Holding the nominal payments to income ratio constant across loans of diﬀerent maturities (i.e., adjusting
the size of the loan accordingly), the front- and back-end eﬀects become stronger the longer is the term of
                                                                       iM +γ
the loan. At the front end, for a suﬃciently small inﬂation rate, t+1   t+1
                                                                   1+πt+1   ≈ iM             M
                                                                               t+1 + γt+1 ≈ it+1 , which
holds since γt+1 → 0, as the term of the loan increases. Changes in real mortgage payments at the front
end are thus approximately equal to changes in the nominal interest rate. At the back end, for a small
                                      iM +γt+ι                     γt+ι
enough nominal interest rate, (1+πt+ιt+ι)+...+(1+πt+1 ) ≈ (1+πt+ι )+...+(1+πt+1 ) , which holds since γt+ι → 1 as
the end of the term approaches. The denominator becomes larger with the term of the loan, increasing the
accumulated inﬂation eﬀect at the back end. In contrast, when the loan is a one-period loan (γt+1 = 1),
(iM                                 M
  t+1 + 1)/(1 + πt+1 ) = 1 + r, as it+1 = it , and there is no price eﬀect.

Fisher eﬀect, i1 and i2 again pin down π2 and π3 , respectively.

                                  3 +1
                     =                             (1 − γ2 )(1 − γ1 )
                                                                     l0 ,       in t = 3,

where γ1 and γ2 are the amortization rates in the ﬁrst and second periods of the life of the

loan and 
         l0 ≡ l0 /p0 is the real size of the loan in period t = 0.
       Unlike the case of the price eﬀect, the income eﬀect works in opposite directions under
FRM and ARM. Broadly speaking, in the FRM case, accumulated inﬂation aﬀects the real
value of mortgage payments over the life of the loan. In the ARM case, at least in the near
term, changes in the nominal interest rate have the dominating eﬀect on the real payments,

as in the case of the price eﬀect. The following paragraphs provide the details.
       Starting with the payments in t = 1, the mortgage rate iM
                                                               1 is predetermined; it is equal

to some iF0 under FRM and to i0 , the period-0 short rate, under ARM, both determined in
period t = 0. Clearly, a decline in π1 generates a negative income eﬀect for the household in

t = 1.
       Regarding payments in t = 2, there is still the lingering eﬀect of the decline in π1 . More
importantly, however, the payments are aﬀected by i1 . In the FRM case, iM    F
                                                                         2 = i0 and a

decline in i1 increases the real payments further due to the resulting decline in π2 . In the

ARM case, the eﬀects are diﬀerent. Here, iM
                                          2 = i1 and a decline in i1 reduces the real

mortgage payments, even though π2 declines one-for-one with i1 (again, as γ2 ∈ (0, 1), the
eﬀect of i1 on the numerator is larger than the eﬀect of π2 on the denominator). The decline
  21
    In the general equilibrium model, such a joint decline in nominal interest rates and current inﬂation is
an equilibrium outcome.



                                                    13
in the nominal interest rate thus works like a decline in the real interest rate, reducing real
interest payments on the loan.
   Finally, the payments in t = 3 increase under both contracts, due to the accumulated
eﬀect of persistently lower inﬂation.


3.4    Both eﬀects

What happens when both eﬀects are taken into account? Under FRM, a decline in the
nominal interest rate reduces the cost of new housing investment, but increases real pay-
ments on outstanding debt. Under ARM, both the cost of new housing investment and real
payments on outstanding debt decline (the latter at least in the near term). Furthermore,

the increase in real mortgage payments on outstanding debt under FRM is gradual, whereas
the decline under ARM is immediate. Potential general equilibrium adjustments aside, one
would therefore expect monetary policy to be more potent under ARM than FRM loans.


3.5    Monetary policy neutrality

Generally speaking, if asset markets were complete, the Modigliani-Miller theorem would

apply in our setting and debt ﬁnance (including its form, FRM or ARM) would be irrelevant.
As a result, monetary policy would be neutral.
   Speciﬁcally, start by observing that the mortgage pricing conditions (1) and (2) can be
re-written as
                                        ∗ ∗ (i3 + 1)(1 − γ)
                                    M         M
                                 ∗ i2
                                  +γ
                           1=μ        +μ μ                     .
                               1 + π2       (1 + π2 )(1 + π3 )

Thus, if asset markets were complete—implying μt,t+1 equal to μ∗ —the expression in the
square brackets in equation (3) would be equal to one and the wedge τH would be equal
to zero. Intuitively, the household’s valuation of mortgage payments in every period (and

more generally in every state) would be the same as that of the investor. And because
the investor’s no-arbitrage pricing implies that the present value of mortgage payments is
equal to one, the household’s valuation would also be equal to one. This holds regardless

                                              14
of what monetary policy does. Furthermore, under complete markets, the agents would
be mutually insured against redistributive income shocks, making their income immune to
monetary policy surprises. The income eﬀect would therefore be eliminated.
   Monetary policy would also be neutral if asset markets were generally incomplete, but

complete with respect to inﬂation. That is, if the nominal rigidity in mortgages could be eﬀec-
tively removed from the economy. Suppose μt,t+1 = μ∗ , but consider, for instance, mortgages
that are index-linked, adjusting the principal for changes in the price level. The nominal pay-

                                   2 + γ)(1 + π2 )l and m3 = (i3 + 1)(1 −γ)(1 + π2 )(1 + π3 )l
ments of such mortgages are m2 = (iM                           M


and no-arbitrage pricing implies iM    M
                                  2 = i3 = r. Converting the nominal payments to real,

m2 /p2 = (r +γ)
               l and m3 /p3 = (r +1)(1−γ)
                                         l, shows that the real payments do not depend on
nominal variables. The income eﬀect is thus absent. The wedge also does not depend on nom-
inal variables, but is generally nonzero: τH = −θ {1 − [μ12 (γ + r) + μ12 μ23 (r + 1)(1 − γ)]}.


3.6     Discussion: other types of nominal debt

The focus of the paper is on mortgages, as opposed to corporate debt, as long-term corporate
assets are less debt-dependent than housing and presumably corporations operate closer to
complete asset markets than do households.22 Nevertheless, the two channels of transmission
in principle apply also to the corporate sector. Long-term corporate debt usually takes the

form of coupon bonds, which result in our setup when γ1 = γ2 = 0. With such amortization
structure, the nominal payments are concentrated in the ﬁnal period of the loan and the real
eﬀects of monetary policy work predominantly by aﬀecting the real value of those payments
through accumulated inﬂation.23

   Within the household sector, our analysis applies also to auto loans, which have a similar
payment structure as FRMs. We abstract from auto loans as mortgage debt has a longer
term (the usual term of auto loans is only ﬁve years) and makes up a much larger fraction
  22
     Long-term corporate assets are typically more than 75% ﬁnanced through retained earnings and other
forms of equity (Rajan and Zingales, 1995).
  23
     Gomes, Jermann, and Schmid (2013) study nominal corporate debt in a model in which monetary policy
aﬀects its default value.

of household debt than auto loans.


3.7       Numerical illustrations

The three-period model has limitations to illustrate how the price and income eﬀects vary
with inﬂation persistence and what is the realistic size of the eﬀects for a typical household.

For this purpose, we rely on numerical examples, based on a standard 30-year mortgage.
       Figure 1 plots debt-servicing costs—the ratio of real mortgage payments (mt /pt ) to real
income (w)—over the term of the loan (120 quarters) under two alternative paths of it ; a
constant ‘steady-state’ it = 4% and a mean-reverting decline of it to 1% in period 1, which
we refer to as ‘monetary policy easing’. The persistence of the decline is 0.95, which is the

average quarterly autocorrelation of the short rate in the data. All the assumptions of the
simple model—constant r and w and no-arbitrage pricing, with equation (1) extended to 120
quarters—are maintained here. The parameterization is r = 1% per annum and 
                                                                           l = 16w,
i.e., four times annual income. In the full model of the next section, the household chooses 
                                                                                             l

optimally (by choosing h). The point here is simply to illustrate the size of these eﬀects for
one particular loan size.24
       At the steady-state interest rate, debt-servicing costs are front-loaded and decline mono-
tonically over the life of the mortgage from 29% to 6.5%. This is the standard ‘tilt eﬀect’

(e.g., Schwab, 1982), occurring due to a positive inﬂation rate (in this case 3%). This path
is a baseline against which to compare the debt-servicing costs under the monetary policy
easing.
       Starting with the case of a new loan, under both FRM and ARM, monetary policy easing

reduces debt-servicing costs at the front end, where they are the highest, and somewhat
increases them at the back end, where they are the smallest. The decline under FRM is
  24
    The parameterization of the loan size is based on the average ratio, 1975-2010, of the median price of a
new home (assuming a loan-to-value ratio of 76%) to the median household net income (assuming an income
tax rate of 23.5%). The data on house prices and gross incomes are from the U.S. Census Bureau. The loan-
to-value ratio is the average ratio for single family newly-built home mortgages (Federal Housing Finance
Agency, Monthly Interest Rate Survey, Table 10); the tax rate is a NIPA-based estimate. A historical 2%
markup is added to the interest rate.

smaller than under ARM because the FRM interest rate, due to the mean-reverting nature
of the short rate in this example, declines by less than the short rate itself. The ﬂattening
of the path of debt-servicing costs results in smoother consumption and thus a decline in τH
under a concave utility function (and/or suﬃciently small β). Using a log utility function

and β = 0.9883, a parameterization of the model of the next section, τH declines by 1.66
percentage points in the case of FRM and by 3.83 percentage points in the case of ARM.
Recall that (1 + τH ) can be interpreted as the eﬀective price of new housing investment and,
thus, these numbers represent quarterly percentage declines in this price.25

       For the case of an existing loan, we consider a loan with 119 periods remaining (the
magnitudes of the income eﬀect decline as the remaining term of the loan gets shorter for
reasons analogous to those in footnote 20). In the case of ARM, as the loan is only one
period into its life, the expected path of debt-servicing costs is essentially the same as that

for the new loan. Under FRM, however, the persistently low inﬂation leads to a gradual
increase in debt-servicing costs for the remainder of the term of the loan. The income eﬀect
under the two contracts thus goes in opposite directions.26
       Figure 2 plots the results of the same experiment, but for two alternative degrees of

persistence: 0.99 and 0.5. In the 0.99 case, the magnitudes are much larger than in the 0.95
case. Furthermore, for new loans, the results under FRM and ARM are more similar to
each other than in the 0.95 case, as the long rate drops almost as much as the short rate.
For existing loans, however, the eﬀects under FRM and ARM diverge further apart. When
the persistence is 0.5, the eﬀects on both new and existing loans are small, in fact hardly

noticeable in the FRM case.
  25
     As the decline in the wedge is larger under ARM than FRM, given the choice, the household would
prefer the ARM loan over the FRM loan. (Through out the paper we assume constant risk and therefore
the household’s responses are driven only by conditional means of inﬂation and interest rates.)
  26
     With reﬁnancing, in the aggregate, a fraction of the outstanding FRM debt would get reﬁnanced (the
whole stock would get reﬁnanced if reﬁnancing was costless). This would not be the case in the opposite
experiment of monetary policy tightening.

4     General equilibrium model

The general equilibrium model extends the model of the previous section to inﬁnite horizon,
formally introduces shocks, and endogenizes the variables that were either held constant
(real labor income and the real interest rate) or were treated as exogenous (the short-term
nominal interest rate and current inﬂation).


4.1     Environment

The economy’s population is split into two groups, ‘homeowners’ and ‘capital owners’, with
measures Ψ and (1 − Ψ), respectively. Within each group, agents are identical. An aggregate
production function combines capital and labor to produce a single good, which can be used
for consumption, capital investment, or as new housing structures; new homes consist of

new structures and new land. Capital owners own the economy’s capital stock, homeowners
supply labor. Capital owners play the role of mortgage investors, kept outside of the simple
model.27 Where applicable, the notation is the same as in Section 3. Only new variables
and functions are therefore deﬁned. When a variable’s notation is the same for both agent

types, an asterisk (∗) denotes the variable pertaining to capital owners. Through out the
model, ﬁscal variables—taxes, transfers, and government spending—are included only to
ensure sensible calibration, explained in Section 5.
  27
     The split of the population is motivated by Campbell and Cocco (2003). In the data, homeowners
(corresponding to the 3rd and 4th quintiles of wealth distribution) have one major asset, a house, and one
major liability, a mortgage. Their main source of income is labor income. In contrast, capital owners (the 5th
quintile) hold almost the entire corporate equity in the economy and housing is a less important component
of their asset composition; labor income is also a less important source of their income. The 1st and 2nd
quintiles are essentially renters with no assets and little liabilities and are not included in the model.

4.1.1     Homeowners

The representative homeowner’s problem is an extended version of the problem in Section

3. The homeowner maximizes expected life-time utility

                                       

                                       t=0


where v(., .) has standard properties and χt is a utility cost related to reﬁnancing and mort-
gage choice, described below. The maximization is subject to a sequence of constraints

                          bt+1                         lt mt                     bt

                                                    lt
                                                       = θpHt xHt ,                                             (5)

                                             ht+1 = (1 − δH )ht + xHt .                                         (6)

Here, xHt is newly purchased homes, pHt is their relative price, bt+1 is the homeowner’s
holdings of a one-period nominal bond between periods t and t + 1, wt is a real wage rate,

n is labor, which the household supplies inelastically, τN is a labor income tax rate, τ is a
transfer to capital owners, and δH ∈ (0, 1) is a depreciation rate of the housing stock.28 Υt−1
is a bond market participation cost, governed by a function Υ(−bt ), where bt ≡ bt /pt−1 is
the homeowner’s real holdings of the bond. The function Υ(.) is assumed to be increasing
and convex and it controls the extent to which homeowners can smooth out consumption

in the presence of income ﬂuctuations.29 In order to avoid the participation cost aﬀecting
  28
     As in the three-period model, θ is a parameter. Chambers, Garriga, and Schlagenhauf (2009a) make a
similar assumption and empirical evidence supports this assumption at the aggregate level: over the period
1973-2006, there has been very little variation in the cross-sectional average of the loan-to-value ratio for single
family newly-built home ﬁrst mortgages, despite large changes in interest rates and other macroeconomic
conditions (Federal Housing Finance Agency, Monthly Interest Rate Survey, Table 10).
  29
     It is further assumed that Υ(.) = 0 when bt = 0, Υ(.) > 0 when bt < 0 (the homeowner is borrowing),
and Υ(.) < 0 when bt > 0 (the homeowner is saving). We think of Υ(.) > 0 as capturing a premium
for unsecured consumer credit, which is increasing in the amount borrowed. Υ(.) < 0 can be interpreted
as higher intermediation costs for homeowners than capital owners, which reduces the homeowers’ returns
on savings below those of capital owners. In steady state, b = 0. A technical role of the cost function is
that, as in two-country business cycle models with incomplete markets, it prevents the one-period debt from


                                                            19
the deﬁnition of aggregate output, it is rebated to the homeowner in a lump-sum way as ψt ,
which the homeowner takes as given. The description of mortgage payments follows after
describing the capital owner.


4.1.2    Capital owners

A representative capital owner maximizes expected life-time utility

                                                    
                                                    ∞
                                               Et         β t u(c∗t ),
                                                    t=0


where u(.) has standard properties, subject to a sequence of constraints

               b∗t+1 lt∗                                                 b∗ m∗           pLt
 c∗t + xKt +        + = [(1 − τK )rt + τK δK ] kt + (1 − τbt )(1 + it−1 ) t + t + τt∗ +      , (7)
                 pt  pt                                                  pt  pt         1−Ψ

                                       kt+1 = (1 − δK )kt + xKt .                                        (8)

Here, xKt is investment in capital, rt is the real rate of return on capital, τK is a capital
income tax rate, δK ∈ (0, 1) is a capital depreciation rate (tax deductible), kt is capital, τt∗
is a lump-sum transfer, 1/(1 − Ψ) is new residential land, which the capital owner receives
each period as an endowment, and pLt is its relative price. In addition, τbt is a stochastic

tax rate on income from the one-period bond market. The tax rate follows a stationary
AR(1) process τb,t+1 = ρb τbt +     b,t+1 ,   where       bt   ∼ iidN(0, σb ). As discussed below, τbt shows
up as a wedge in the capital owner’s Euler equation for bonds. In a reduced form way, this
wedge captures various shocks and frictions in ﬁnancial markets, including those generating

a real rate channel of monetary policy. Šustek (2011) provides examples of explicit mappings
from such ﬁnancial market frictions to τbt .30 Under no-arbitrage pricing, the capital owner
is indiﬀerent across investing in mortgages, bonds, and capital. His composition of period-t
becoming a random walk in a log-linear solution of the model. In other words, it keeps the log-linearized
model stationary.
   30
      By subjecting only the capital owner to this wedge, it is assumed that the wedge captures frictions
related only to the ‘wholesale’ ﬁnancial market, in which mortgage investors participate, as opposed to the
‘retail’ ﬁnancial market, in which homeowners participate.


                                                          20
investment is therefore pinned down by homeowners’ demand for new mortgages and the
one-period bond.


4.1.3   Mortgages

In the interest of clarity, we start by describing FRMs and ARMs in their simple forms;
i.e., no reﬁnancing or choice between the contracts. The modeling of mortgages is based

on Kydland, Rupert, and Šustek (forthcoming), who consider inﬁnitely-lived loans, which
nevertheless contain the key characteristics of standard (ﬁnitely-lived) mortgages. Denoting
by dt the period-t stock of outstanding nominal mortgage debt of the homeowner, the nominal
mortgage payments the homeowner has to make in period t are


                                  mt = (Rt + γt )dt ,                                      (9)


where Rt and γt are, respectively, the interest and amortization rates of the outstanding
debt. The variables determining mt are state variables evolving as


                                 dt+1 = (1 − γt )dt + lt ,                               (10)


                                γt+1 = (1 − φt ) (γt )α + φt κ,                          (11)
                                       ⎧
                                       ⎪
                                       ⎨ (1 − φt )Rt + φt iF ,
                                                              t    if FRM,
                                Rt+1 =                                                   (12)
                                       ⎪
                                       ⎩ it ,                      if ARM,

with φt ≡ lt /dt+1 denoting the fraction of new loans in the outstanding debt next period. The

amortization rate γt+1 and the interest rate Rt+1 in the FRM case thus evolve as weighted
averages of the amortization and interest rates, respectively, on the existing stock and new
loans. κ, α ∈ (0, 1) are parameters. Speciﬁcally, κ is the initial amortization rate of a new
loan and α controls the evolution of the amortization rate over time. Notice that setting

α = 0 and κ = 1 implies γt = 1 ∀t. That is, lt becomes a one-period loan. Setting α = 1
results in a constant amortization rate γt = κ and thus declining nominal mortgage payments

                                               21
over the life of the loan. Recall from Section 3 that in order to keep mortgage payments
constant over the life of a loan, the amortization rate has to be increasing. When κ, α ∈ (0, 1),
the amortization rate increases, converging to one. Kydland et al. (forthcoming) show that
κ and α can be chosen so as to approximate the payments of a standard 30-year mortgage.31

       Mortgage payments received by the capital owner are speciﬁed analogously


                                            m∗t = (Rt∗ + γt∗ )d∗t ,                                       (13)


                                       d∗t+1 = (1 − γt∗ )d∗t + lt∗ ,                                      (14)

                                       ∗
                                      γt+1 = (1 − φ∗t ) (γt∗ )α + φ∗t κ,                                  (15)
                                             ⎧

                                             ⎨ (1 − φ∗ )R∗ + φ∗ iF ,
                                       ∗                 t     t     t t       if FRM,
                                      Rt+1 =                                                              (16)

                                             ⎩ it ,                            if ARM,

where φ∗t ≡ lt∗ /d∗t+1 . Under FRM, the ﬁrst-order condition for lt∗ pins down iFt such that
the capital owner is indiﬀerent between new mortgages and rolling over the one-period bond

from period t on. The ﬁrst-order condition is an inﬁnite-horizon counterpart to equation (1);
see Appendix A.


4.1.4      Reﬁ loans

Next, we turn to reﬁnancing. Chen, Michaux, and Roussanov (2013) document that, on
average, 60% of reﬁ loans in the United States between 1985 and 2013 were unrelated to

interest rate changes. Instead, they served the purpose of liquidity withdrawals, similar to
home equity lines of credit.32 Given our interest, we abstract from this type of reﬁnancing and
focus on the remaining 40%. At the aggregate level, as Chen et al. (2013) demonstrate, this
fraction is negatively related to a diﬀerence between the current 30-year mortgage interest
  31
     Under appropriate choice of κ and α, even though the loan has an inﬁnite life, it gets essentially repayed
within 30 years and the nominal payments are approximately constant for most of these 30 years, conditional
on a constant mortgage rate. Such modeling of mortgages is convenient, as both the agents and loans have
an inﬁnite life, thus allowing a simple recursive representation of the model with only a few state variables.
  32
     Hurst and Staﬀord (2004) also focus on the liquidity role of reﬁnancing


                                                      22
rate and an average of its past values. This is the relationship we intend to capture.
   With reﬁnancing, new loans consist of mortgages used for new house purchase (ﬁrst
mortgages) and reﬁ loans
                               lt = θ(pt pHt xHt ) + t (1 − γt )dt .                      (17)

Here, t is the fraction of the outstanding debt that is being reﬁnanced in period t (reﬁnancing
takes place after the regular period-t amortization payment is made). Mortgage payments

are still given by mt = (Rt + γt )dt , but now with laws of motion


                                dt+1 = (1 − t )(1 − γt )dt + lt ,                         (18)


                                 γt+1 = (1 − φt ) (γt )α + φt κ,                           (19)

                                  Rt+1 = (1 − Θt )Rt + Θt iFt ,                            (20)

where φt ≡ θ(pt pHt xHt )/dt+1 is the fraction of ﬁrst mortgages (net borrowing) in the stock
of debt next period and Θt ≡ lt /dt+1 is the fraction of all new loans (gross borrowing) in the
stock of debt next period. Observe that combining equations (17) and (18) gives back the

original law of motion for debt (10). An implicit assumption in the law of motion (19) is that
a new reﬁ loan starts with an amortization rate of the loan that it replaces (this captures
that, e.g., a loan that is reﬁnanced 10 years before maturity gets replaced with a 10-year
loan). This leads to a sharp characterization of reﬁnancing. Namely, in the homeowner’s
problem, reﬁnancing shows up only in the law of motion (20), as a change in the weights on

the old eﬀective interest rate Rt and the current market interest rate iFt , without tieing this
change to new house purchases. When t = 1, i.e., the whole existing stock is reﬁnanced,
Θt = 1 and the evolution of Rt+1 becomes the same as under ARM. When t = 0, Θt = φt
and the evolution of Rt+1 becomes the same as in the case of the basic FRM loan, equation

(12).




                                                23
    The capital owner’s laws of motion are analogous,


                                     d∗t+1 = (1 − t )(1 − γt∗ )d∗t + lt∗


                                      ∗
                                     γt+1 = (1 − φ∗t ) (γt∗ )α + φ∗t κ,

                                       ∗
                                      Rt+1 = (1 − Θ∗t )Rt∗ + Θ∗t iFt ,

where φ∗t = [lt∗ − t (1 − γt∗ )d∗t ]/d∗t+1 and Θ∗t ≡ lt∗ /d∗t+1 , with t taken as given. The capital
owner’s ﬁrst-order condition for lt∗ (gross lending) again determines iFt . Observe that, as the

evolution of d∗t+1 depends on t , the FRM rate iFt depends on the reﬁnancing behavior of the
homeowner (i.e., ρt shows up in a ﬁrst-order condition for lt∗ ).33
    The homeowner’s decision to reﬁnance is modeled as follows
                                      ⎧
                                      ⎪
                                      ⎨           and       χt = 0            if iFt ≥ Rt ,
                                 t =
                                      ⎪
                                      ⎩ t        and       χt = Γ (
                                                                     t )      if iFt < Rt .


Here,  is a reﬁ fraction in steady state (occurring due to exogenous reasons, such as moving
house), t is chosen optimally, and Γ(.) is a function with Γ() = 0, Γ(.) > 0, and Γ(.) > 0.
The utility cost χt can be interpreted, for instance, as a time loss.34 When we abstract
from reﬁnancing, we set t ≡ 0 and χt ≡ 0. Characterization of t is provided in Section 7,
together with the quantitative ﬁndings.


4.1.5    Mortgage choice

Allowing for endogenous choice between new FRM and ARM loans requires keeping track
of the two types of debt separately. Therefore, mortgage payments of the homeowner are
mt = m1t + m2t , where m1t are payments on outstanding FRM debt and m2t are payments
    33
       With reﬁnancing, the left-hand side of the capital owner’s budget constraint (7) needs to be modiﬁed:
lt∗ gets replaced with lt∗ − t (1 − γt∗ )d∗t (in both cases it is net lending).
    34
       Even though, at an individual level, reﬁnancing costs often involve a ﬁxed component, at the aggregate
level of the representative homeowner, assuming a cost function like Γ(.) is a more appropriate modeling
choice.


                                                     24
on outstanding ARM debt. These two variables are determined by separate laws of motion
(10)-(12), as applicable, each with its own new loans, l1t for FRM and l2t for ARM. The
mortgage payments received by the capital owner are speciﬁed analogously. The ﬁnancing
constraint of the homeowner becomes lt = θpt pHt xHt , with lt = l1t + l2t . In order to avoid a

bang-bang solution, it is assumed that the homeowner faces a convex cost function Φ(l2t /lt ).
The cost function is assumed to satisfy Φ(l2 /l) = 0, where l2 /l is a steady-state share of
ARMs in new loans, a parameter. Further, Φ(.) > 0 and Φ(.) > 0. It is assumed that
the cost takes the form of the utility loss χt . A way to think about the steady-state share

l2 /l and the cost function is as reﬂecting various institutional and historical factors, noted
in footnote 1 and not modeled here. This is a reasonable modeling strategy, given our focus
on temporary ﬂuctuations, rather than the long run.
   The capital owner takes the mortgage choice by the homeowner as given but the ﬁrst-
                     ∗
order condition for l1t again determines the mortgage rate iFt , so as to leave the capital owner
indiﬀerent between the two types of new loans (and other assets).


4.1.6   Technology

An aggregate production function, operated by perfectly competitive producers, is given by
Yt = At f (Kt , Nt ), where Kt is the aggregate capital stock, Nt is aggregate labor, and f (., .)
has the standard neoclassical properties. Total factor productivity (TFP) follows a stationary

AR(1) process log At+1 = (1 − ρA ) log A + ρA log At +      A,t+1 ,   where A is the unconditional
mean and    At   ∼ iidN(0, σA ). The real rate of return on capital, rt , and the real wage rate,
wt , are determined by the marginal products of capital and labor, respectively. The resource
constraint of the economy is Ct + XKt + qt XSt + G = Yt , where Ct is aggregate consumption,

XKt is aggregate investment in capital, XSt is new housing structures, and G is (constant)
government expenditures. Here, qt is the marginal rate of transformation between new
housing structures and the other uses of output, and hence the relative price of new housing
structures. It is given as qt = ηt q(XSt ), where q(XSt ) is a convex function that makes the



                                                25
economy’s production possibilities frontier (PPF) concave in the space of (Ct + XKt + G)
and (XSt )—a speciﬁcation akin to that of Huﬀman and Wynne (1999), a stand-in for the
costs of moving factors of production across diﬀerent sectors of the economy. The purpose
of the function q(.) is to ensure realistic volatility of new housing structures in response to

shocks; if the production possibilities frontier was linear, the volatility would be too high.
Further, ηt is a shock following a stationary AR(1) process ηt+1 = (1 − ρq ) + ρq ηt +            q,t+1 ,

with unconditional mean equal to one and          qt   ∼ iidN(0, σq ). This shock can be thought of
as a housing construction shock. The shocks At and ηt are relevant only for cross-validating

the model against business cycle moments of the data.
   As in Davis and Heathcote (2005), new homes consist of new housing structures and
land and are produced by perfectly competitive homebuilders according to an aggregate
production function XHt = g(XSt , XLt ). Here, XHt is the aggregate number of new homes

constructed in period t, XLt is the aggregate new residential land, and g has the standard
neoclassical properties.


4.1.7   Monetary policy

Monetary policy is characterized by a Taylor-type rule with a stochastic inﬂation target (e.g.,
Ireland, 2007)
                           it = (i + π t − π) + νπ (πt − π t ),   νπ > 1,                          (21)

where i is the steady-state short-term nominal interest rate, and π t is the inﬂation target.
The inﬂation target follows a stationary AR(1) process π t+1 = (1−ρπ )π +ρπ π t +       π,t+1 ,   where

π is a steady-state inﬂation rate, and    π,t+1   ∼ iidN(0, σπ ). Notice that the interest rate rule
can be rewritten in a more typical form as it = i+νπ (πt −π)+ξt , where ξt ≡ −(νπ −1)(π t −π).
   As shown below, when ρπ is close to one, the inﬂation target shock works in equilibrium
like a ‘level factor’, moving short and long rates equally, and allows the model to reproduce
the observed volatility and persistence of the 30-year mortgage rate. A highly persistent

monetary policy shock is usually required in macro models to match the statistical prop-


                                                   26
erties of long-term nominal interest rates (Gallmeyer, Holliﬁeld, Palomino, and Zin, 2007;
Atkeson and Kehoe, 2009). Here, it has an interpretation as an inﬂation target shock.


4.2     Equilibrium

To economize on space and notation, the equilibrium is deﬁned only for the case of separate
FRM and ARM loans in their basic form.35 Let zt ≡ [log At , πt , τbt , ηt , pt−1 ] be the vector
of exogenous state variables and a lagged value of the price level, s∗t ≡ [kt , b∗t , d∗t , γt∗ , Rt∗ ] the

vector of the capital owner’s state variables, st ≡ [ht , bt , dt , γt , Rt ] the vector of the home-
owner’s state variables, and St ≡ [Kt , Ht , Bt , Dt , Γt ,             t]   the vector of aggregate endogenous
state variables, where the elements are, respectively, aggregate capital, housing stock, bonds,
outstanding mortgage debt, and its amortization and interest rates. Next, write the capital

owner’s optimization problem as

                                                                                       
                                                                                             
                       U(z, S, s∗ ) =       max           u(c∗ ) + βE[U(z  , S , (s∗ ) )|z] ,            (22)
                                        [xK ,(b∗ ) ,l∗ ]



where a prime denotes a value next period and the constraints (7), (8), and (13)-(16) are
thought to have been substituted in the utility and value functions. Similarly, write the
homeowner’s problem as


                                                                         
                                                                               
                        V (z, S, s) = max v(c, h) − χ + βE[V (z  , S , s )|z] ,                          (23)
                                        [xH ,b ]



where the constraints (4)-(6) and (9)-(12) are thought to have been substituted in the utility
and value functions. Let Wt ≡ [XKt , pt , iM
                                           t , XHt , Bt+1 ] be the vector of aggregate decision

variables and prices, where iM    F                M
                             t = it under FRM and it = it under ARM. Deﬁne a function

Wt = W (zt , St ).36
  35
     Accommodating reﬁnancing and mortgage choice simply involves expanding the vector of decision vari-
ables of the homeowner by including the additional choice variable, either t or l2t . In the case of mortgage
choice, the state space is larger than in the case of the separate contracts, as there are two sets of the
mortgage state variables, one for each type of debt.
  36
     With reﬁnancing, the capital owner’s laws of motion (14)-(16) are replaced with their reﬁ counterparts.
Similarly, the homeowner’s laws of motion (10)-(12) are replaced with their reﬁ counterparts. In addition,

                                                             27
    A recursive competitive equilibrium consists of the functions U, V , and W such that:
(i) U and V solve (22) and (23), respectively; (ii) rt and wt are given by the respective
marginal products of capital and labor, pHt and pLt are given by the respective marginal
products of structures and land, and qt = ηt q(XSt ); (iii) it is given by the monetary policy

rule (21); (iv) the bond, mortgage, housing, and land markets clear: (1 − Ψ)b∗t+1 + Ψbt+1 = 0,
(1 − Ψ)(lt∗ /pt ) = ΨθpHt xHt ,      ΨxHt = g(XSt, XLt ), and XLt = 1; (v) aggregate consistency
is ensured: Kt = (1 − Ψ)kt , XKt = (1 − Ψ)xKt , XHt = ΨxHt , Bt = Ψbt , Ht = Ψht ,
(1 − Ψ)m∗t = Ψmt , (1 − Ψ)d∗t = Ψdt = Dt , γt∗ = γt = Γt , Rt∗ = Rt =                     t,   and (1 − Ψ)τt∗ =

τK (rt − δK )Kt + τN (wt N − Ψτ ) + Ψτ + τbt (1 − it−1 )Bt /pt − G; (vi) the exogenous state
variables follow their respective stochastic processes and the endogenous aggregate state
variables evolve according to aggregate counterparts to the laws of motion for the respective
individual state variables; and (vii) the individual optimal decision rules of the capital owner
                                                                    
(for xK , (b∗ ) , and l∗ ) and the homeowner (for xH and b ) are consistent with W (z, S).37
    The computational procedure is described in Appendix B. Before computing the equi-
librium, the model is made stationary by dividing all nominal variables by either pt or pt−1 .
Given a relatively large number of state variables, the model is solved by log-linear approxi-

mation (appropriately modiﬁed in the case of reﬁnancing). Thus, in the quantitative results
presented, the linear equilibrium decision rules and pricing functions are characterized by
certainty equivalence, whereby only current realizations and the conditional ﬁrst moments
of future shocks (not higher moments) aﬀect agents’ decisions and market clearing prices.
The FRM rate in the log-linear model is thus based on expectations hypothesis.38
the homeowner’s maximization is also with respect to t and an aggregate counterpart to t is an element
of Wt . Further, the mortgage market clearing condition noted below is replaced with (1 − Ψ)(lt∗ /pt ) =
Ψ[θ(pHt xHt ) + t (1 − γt )dt /pt ]. With mortgage choice, the homeowner’s maximization is also with respect
to l1t and l2t , subject to l1t = θ(pt pHt xHt ) − l2t , and the aggregate counterpart to l2t is a part of Wt . In
the capital owner’s problem, maximization with respect to lt∗ is replaced with l1t ∗
                                                                                     . Mortgage market clearing
                   ∗    ∗                                   ∗
requires (1−Ψ)(l1t +l2t ) = Ψθ(pt pHt xHt ) and (1−Ψ)l2t = Ψl2t . The choice of xHt and l2t by the homeowner
                   ∗       ∗
thus pins down l1t   and l2t .
  37
     In the case of ARM, iM  t = it makes the capital owner indiﬀerent between new mortgages and bonds and
the ﬁrst-order condition for lt∗ can be dropped from the description of the equilibrium. In the case of FRM,
the ﬁrst-order condition is needed to determine iF    t .
  38
     We have explored the eﬀects of (constant) second moments of the shocks on the equilibrium decision
rules and pricing functions, using a special case of Epstein-Zin preferences (i.e., with unitary intertemporal
elasticity of substitution) that is easy to handle by the computational method. But like Tallarini (2000) and


                                                       28
4.3     Equilibrium nominal interest rates and inﬂation

The capital owner’s ﬁrst-order conditions for b∗t+1 and xKt yield the Fisher equation. In a

linearized form: it − Et πt+1 ≈ Et rt+1 + Et τb,t+1 , where (abusing notation) the variables are
in percentage point deviations from steady state. Notice that, for a given expected rate
of return on capital Et rr+1 , determined by the expected marginal product of capital, an
increase in Et τb,t+1 increases the ex-ante real interest rate, it − Et πt+1 . In this sense, τbt is a

real rate shock.
   Given stochastic processes for rt and τbt , the Fisher equation and the monetary policy
rule (21) determine, by forward substitutions, it and πt . For ρπ close to one, excluding
explosive paths for inﬂation (a common assumption), the resulting expression for it is

                                ∞     j
                                     1                  νπ ρb
                           it ≈            Et rt+1+j +         τbt + π t .                         (24)
                                j=0
                                     νπ                νπ − ρb


Substituting it from equation (24) back into the policy rule (21) gives the equilibrium inﬂation

rate
                                  ∞    j
                              1  1                       ρb
                         πt ≈              Et rt+1+j +         τbt + π t .                         (25)
                              νπ j=0 νπ                νπ − ρb

Thus, under the assumption that ρπ is close to one, the equilibrium short-term nominal
interest rate and inﬂation move, subject to general equilibrium adjustments in the expected
path of rt , one for one with the highly persistent inﬂation target shock π t . In this sense, in

contrast to the τbt shock, the inﬂation target shock is a purely nominal shock.
   Because movements in it occurring due to the π t shock are highly persistent, the long
rate iFt moves almost as much as the short rate in response to this shock. In this sense, the
π t shock works like a level factor shock. In contrast, the τbt shock, if less persistent, has only

a temporary eﬀect on the short rate. It thus has only a small eﬀect on the long rate and
moves predominantly the long-short spread. We exploit these properties in calibration.
Backus, Ferriere, and Zin (2015), we have found little eﬀect of the second moments on the model dynamics
for a wide range of the risk aversion parameter.




                                                  29
5     Calibration

As most of the required historical data are readily available for the United States, the
calibration is based on U.S. data, even though the mechanism applies more generally. One
period in the model corresponds to one quarter.


5.1    Functional forms

The following standard functional forms are used: u(c∗ ) = log c∗ , v(c, h) = ξ log c + (1 −
ξ) log h, f (K, N) = K ς N 1−ς , g(XS , XL ) = XS1−ϕ XLϕ . Further, as in Kydland et al. (forthcoming),
q(XSt ) = exp(ζ(XSt − XS )), where ζ > 0 and XS is the steady-state ratio of new housing
structures to output (Y is normalized to be equal to one in steady state). A similar func-

tional form is used also for the bond market participation cost: Υ(−bt ) = exp(−ϑbt ) − 1,
where ϑ > 0 and bt = 0 in steady state. It is straightforward to check that this function
satisﬁes the properties set out in Section 4.


5.2    Debt-servicing costs

A particular challenge arises due to the need to match debt-servicing costs—mortgage pay-
ments to income ratio—of homeowners. This requires the model to be consistent with
the cross-sectional distribution of income, in addition to the standard aggregate targets:
XK /Y = 0.156, XS /Y = 0.054, K/Y = 7.06, H/Y = 5.28, and rK/Y = 0.283, all aver-

ages for 1958-2006. Oﬃcial data for mortgage debt servicing costs are not published for the
United States. Estimates, however, can be obtained from diﬀerent sources (see Appendix D),
resulting in long-run averages in the ballpark of 18.5% of homeowners’ pre-tax income. The
                                                  
model’s steady-state counterpart to this ratio is M/(wN               = (R+γ)D/(1+π),
                                                        −Ψτ ), where M        
      being the debt-to-output ratio.
with D

    Consistency with the observed cross-sectional distribution of income is achieved through
τ . Recall that homeowners in the model are an abstraction for the 3rd and 4th quintiles of
the wealth distribution, while capital owners are an abstraction for the 5th quintile. In the

                                                30
data, while the 5th quintile get substantial income from capital, they also receive income
from transfers and labor. Thus, if the only source of income of capital owners in the model
was capital, and given that the model is required to match the observed average capital
share of output (rK/Y = 0.283), capital owners would account for too small fraction of

aggregate income (28.3% in the model v.s. 48% in the data; SCF 1998), while homeowners’
share would be too large. As a result, the steady-state debt-servicing costs would be too
low (or the required debt-to-output ratio would have to be too high, making it inconsistent
with the observed XS /Y ratio, the land share in new housing, the loan-to-value ratio, and

the amortization schedule). The parameter τ adjusts for this discrepancy, transferring some
of the homeowners’ labor income to capital owners.


5.3       Parameter values

The parameter values are listed in Table 1, where they are organized into eight categories:
Ψ (population); β, ξ (preferences); δK , δH , ς, A, ζ, ϕ (technology); τK , τN , G, τ (ﬁscal); θ,

α, κ (mortgage contracts); ϑ (bond market); π, νπ (monetary policy); and ρA , σA , ρπ , σπ , ρb ,
σb , ρq , σq (stochastic processes).39 Wherever possible, calibration targets are for the period
1958-2006. The calibration is mainly based on steady-state relations and unconditional ﬁrst
moments of the data. Most parameters can be assigned values without solving a system

of steady-state equations, three parameters (ξ, τK , τ ) have to be obtained jointly, and
two parameters (ζ, ϑ) are assigned values together with the parameters of the stochastic
processes by matching unconditional second moments of the data. Calibration of the three
sets of parameters is described in turn.

      First, the share of homeowners Ψ is set equal to 2/3. The capital share ς is set equal
to 0.283, an estimate from National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) for aggregate
output close to our measure of output (see Appendix C). The share of land in new housing
ϕ is set equal to 0.1, an estimate reported by Davis and Heathcote (2005). The depreciation
 39
      Parameters speciﬁc to reﬁnancing and mortgage choice are dealt with in Sections 7.2 and 7.3, respectively.



                                                       31
rates δK and δH are set equal to 0.02225 and 0.01021, respectively, to be consistent with
the average ﬂow-stock ratios for capital and housing, respectively. The level of TFP, A,
is set equal to 1.5321, so that steady-state output is equal to one. The labor income tax
rate is derived from NIPA using a procedure of Mendoza, Razin, and Tesar (1994), yielding

τN = 23.5%. The role of this parameter is to map the observed debt-servicing costs, which
are based on gross income, into net income. The parameter G is measured to be equal to
0.138 (see Appendix C).40 We focus on conventional mortgages and therefore set θ equal to
0.6. This is based on the observation that conventional loans make up, on average, 80% of

single family newly-built home mortgages (Construction Survey, 1973-2006) and the average
cross-sectional mean of their loan-to-value ratio is 0.76 (Freddie Mac’s Monthly Interest
Rate Survey, 1973-2006). As in Kydland et al. (forthcoming), the amortization parameters
are κ = 0.00162 and α = 0.9946, approximating the amortization schedule of a 30-year

mortgage. The weight on inﬂation in the monetary policy rule νπ is set equal to a fairly
standard value of 1.5. The steady-state inﬂation rate π is set equal to 0.0113, the average
(1972-2006) quarterly inﬂation rate. In steady state, the ﬁrst-order condition for lt∗ constrains
iF to equal to i. The ﬁrst-order condition for b∗t then relates i and π to β. The above value of π

and iF = 9.31% per annum (the 1972-2006 average for 30-year FRM rate) imply β = 0.9883.
       Given the above parameter values, the second set of parameters (ξ, τK , τ ) is calibrated by
matching the observed average K/Y ratio, H/Y ratio, and debt-servicing costs. The rela-
tionship between the three parameters and the targets is given by the steady-state versions of
the ﬁrst-order conditions for xKt and xHt and the expression for steady-state debt-servicing

costs noted above (see Appendix A for the ﬁrst-order conditions). These restrictions yield
ξ = 0.5003, τK = 0.3362, and τ = 0.4693.
       Finally, given the values of the ﬁrst and second set of parameters, ζ and ϑ are calibrated,
together with the parameters of the stochastic processes, by minimizing an equally-weighted

distance between the following second moments of the data and their simulated model coun-
  40
    Having government expenditures in the model ensures a realistic expense of the tax revenues, which
otherwise would have to go into transfers, thus aﬀecting the distribution of income.



                                                  32
terparts41 : (i) the standard deviations and autocorrelations of the 10-year government bond
yield (a longer series used as a proxy for the 30-year mortgage rate) and of the long-short
spread (10-year minus 3-month), (ii) the standard deviation and autocorrelation of output,
(iii) the standard deviation and autocorrelation of house prices, and (iv) the standard de-

viations of housing and capital investment. These are 10 targets for 10 parameters. The
resulting parameter values are reported in Table 1. Here, instead of going over the values,
we brieﬂy discuss how the targets map into the parameters. Targets (i) help pin down the
parameters of the inﬂation target and bond market shocks, as explained in Section 4; tar-

gets (ii) help pin down the parameters of the TFP shock; targets (iii) help pin down the
parameters of the shock to the marginal rate of transformation; and targets (iv) help pin
down the parameter controlling the curvature of PPF and the parameter of the cost function
for homeowners’ participation in the bond market.42 As reported and discussed in the next

section, the cyclical properties of the model are similar under FRM and ARM, in line with
cross-country data. The parameter values, therefore, are not particularly sensitive to which
contract is used to simulate the model to match the moments (the reported values are based
on FRM).



6        Model cross-validation

Before proceeding to quantitatively assess the transmission mechanism under investigation,
we use three diﬀerent sets of available empirical observations to cross-validate the model: (i)
business cycle moments, (ii) responses to a real interest rate shock, and (iii) the marginal
propensity to consume (MPC) of ARM homeowners.

       First, the business cycle moments—standard deviations and correlations with output—
  41
     Both the U.S. and simulated data are expressed as percentage (percentage point, for interest rates)
deviations from HP-ﬁlter trend.
  42
     Speciﬁcally, the bond market cost function controls the extent to which homeowners can indirectly invest
in capital, thus aﬀecting the volatility of capital investment. The curvature of PPF controls the volatility of
housing investment.




                                                      33
are reported in Panel A of Table 2.43 Six standard deviations in the table are part of the set
of moments used to calibrate the model under FRM. Nonetheless, the remaining standard
deviations—of consumption, the short rate, and inﬂation—also line up well with the data.
The model also correctly predicts positive correlations with output of consumption and the

two types of investment, with the correlation of consumption being the highest and the
correlation of housing investment being the lowest of the three. However, it overpredicts
the strength of these relations. This also applies to house prices. Such ﬁnding should be
expected, as the number of shocks in the model is limited. The short and long interest rates,

the long-short spread, and the inﬂation rate have correlations with output similar to those
in the data.
       The ﬁndings in Table 2 show that the cyclical properties of the model are not particularly
sensitive to whether FRM or ARM contract is used to simulate the model. This may seem

surprising as one would expect that, especially, the moments of housing investment should
be sensitive to the type of the loan. Housing investment is indeed less positively correlated
with output under ARM than FRM, and its volatility is lower under ARM than FRM, but
the diﬀerences are small. Is this true in the data? Panel B of the table shows that the

diﬀerences in the model are similar to those between a set of FRM countries and a set of
ARM countries.44 The reason for the similarity is that the TFP shock is the dominating
shock in the model and housing investment responds similarly to such a shock under both
contracts. However, as in the data, it responds a little less under ARM than FRM because
the responses get dampened by procyclical movements of interest rates, to which housing

investment is more sensitive under ARM than FRM, as shown below.
       Second, we scrutinize the model responses to the τbt shock, which directly aﬀects the
ex-ante real interest rate. Recall that this shock can be thought of as capturing the real rate
channel of monetary policy transmission. The identiﬁcation of such shocks in the data is well
  43
     The data are quarterly. Both the actual and simulated data are expressed as percentage (or percentage
point, for interest rates and the inﬂation rate) deviations from HP-ﬁlter trend.
  44
     The countries used are the only countries for which quarterly housing investment data are available going
back to at least 1980. FRM counties: BEL, FRA, US; ARM countries: AUS, CAN, UK. The moments are
taken from Kydland et al. (forthcoming).


                                                     34
understood, unlike the identiﬁcation of the shock we focus on. Calza et al. (2013) employ a
typical identiﬁcation strategy to study the responses of housing investment in a sample of
FRM and ARM countries. They ﬁnd that, in response to a one-percentage point (annualized)
increase in the short-term nominal interest rate, increasing the real rate, housing investment

declines more in ARM than FRM countries. Figure 3 shows that the model is consistent with
this ﬁnding. Panel A shows responses under the calibrated persistence of the τbt shock, panel
B shows responses under calibration that reproduces the persistence of the nominal interest
rate in Calza et al. (2013).45 In the latter case, the quantitative response under FRM falls

within the error bands reported in their paper. Under ARM, the initial decline somewhat
exceeds their error bands (−1.95% in the model vs. −1.4% in their paper). This is likely
due to the fact that the interest rate of the ARM contract in the model adjusts immediately,
whereas in their study the classiﬁcation of countries as ARM countries is based on interest

rates ﬁxed for up to ﬁve years.
       Finally, in Table 3, we compare the MPC of ARM homeowners in the model to the
empirical MPC from the study by Di Maggio et al. (2014) described brieﬂy in Section 2 (the
study does not contain MPC of FRM homeowners). In both the data and the model, the

MPC is calculated as an increase in consumption of ARM homeowners divided by the extra
income brought about by a decline in real mortgage payments occurring due to a drop in
the nominal interest rate. In the model, the nominal interest rate can decline due to both
the τbt and π t shocks (i.e., it can decline due to a decline in the real rate or in line with
inﬂation), whereas the empirical study is silent on the sources of the decline. We therefore

consider both scenarios. As the empirical study is based on reduced form analysis, it does
not address the question of the agents’ expectations of the persistence of the interest rate
decline. When we use the calibrated persistence of the shocks, the model implies MPC of
around 0.28. However, a modest reduction in the persistence of the π t shock, from 0.994

to 0.95, replicates the empirical MPC of 0.17 (the MPC value of 0.28, however, is in the
  45
    The calibrated persistence is based on the long-short spread, which may be aﬀected by other factors,
such as time-varying risk premia, than just the channels identiﬁed by Calza et al. (2013).



                                                  35
ballpark of estimates from the ﬁscal stimulus literature, e.g., Johnson, Parker, and Souleles,
2006; Parker, Souleles, Johnson, and McClelland, 2013). As demonstrated below, reducing
the persistence of the shock to 0.95 does not change the main message of the paper. In the
case of the τbt shock, the persistence needs to be brought down to 0.7 (interestingly, a value

in-between our calibrated value of 0.9 and the value implied by Calza et al., 2013, of 0.5).



7       Findings from computational experiments

The purpose of the computational experiments is to impose general equilibrium discipline on
the transmission mechanism laid out in Section 3 and to explore its quantitative importance.
In order to demonstrate the general equilibrium eﬀects of FRM and ARM contracts in

their starkest form, we start by studying the responses of the model economy under the
two contracts separately, abstracting from the choice between them and reﬁnancing. This
exercise, while not strictly applicable to the United States, is relevant for other countries, in
addition to its purpose of isolating the eﬀects of each contract. In many countries, ARMs (of

various types) are the only contract available; see footnote 1. And in some FRM countries,
reﬁnancing is less common than in the United States. For instance, as noted in Section 2,
Villar Burke (2015) shows that the interest rate on the pool of existing mortgages stayed
almost intact in Germany and France, following the European Central Bank’s interest rate

cut to near zero in 2008/2009, despite declines of interest rates on new loans and relatively
stable house prices. After this initial exercise, we scrutinize the mechanism under reﬁnancing
and mortgage choice.


7.1     Responses under FRM and ARM

7.1.1    Baseline responses

The quantitative assessment of the transmission mechanism under the two separate contracts
is contained in Figure 4. The ﬁgure plots the responses of selected variables to a positive


                                               36
(1 percentage point, annualized) π t shock in period 1. The ﬁrst two charts demonstrate the
nominal and level factor nature of the shock: the short-term nominal interest rate and the
inﬂation rate, and in the case of the FRM economy also the FRM rate, all increase more or
less in parallel by approximately one percentage point (annualized).46 The next chart plots

the responses of real mortgage payments (mt /pt ). The chart conﬁrms the eﬀects discussed
in Section 3. Due to higher inﬂation, real mortgage payments decline on impact (period 1)
under both contracts by the same amount. But this decline is dwarfed by the magnitudes
in subsequent periods. Under FRM, real mortgage payments display a persistent gradual

decline, while under ARM the payments increase sharply (and persistently) one period after
the shock. Under FRM, both homeowners’ consumption (Ct ) and housing investment (XSt )
increase in response to growing real disposable income.47 In contrast, under ARM, both
variables decline in response to the drop in real disposable income. Further, the responses

under ARM are stronger than under FRM. For instance, the decline in housing investment
is 1.8% on impact under ARM, compared with a 0.7% increase under FRM.48 House prices
(pHt ), not plotted due to space constraints, increase on impact by 0.2% under FRM, and
decline by 0.5% under ARM. The last chart shows that capital owners’ consumption (Ct∗ )

responses are opposite to those of homeowners, but are smaller and smoother. This reﬂects
the fact that mortgage payments are a quantitatively smaller fraction of capital owners’ than
homeowners’ income (6.4% vs 24.2% of after-tax income) and that capital owners can better
smooth out ﬂuctuations in income.


7.1.2    Comparison with a real rate channel

It was argued in Section 3 that, under ARM, the eﬀect of a one-for-one increase in the

nominal interest rate and inﬂation works like an increase in the real interest rate. How does,
  46
     The model is stationary. Thus, even though convergence back to steady state may not be apparent from
the plots, eventually all variables converge back to steady state. This, however, takes longer than the 40
periods displayed in the charts.
  47
     The ﬁgure plots responses of XSt but the responses of XHt are similar.
  48
     The responses of consumption and housing investment do not exactly copy the responses of real mortgage
payments as homeowners have some access to the one-period bond market to smooth out the impact of the
changes in disposable income.


                                                    37
then, the transmission mechanism under ARM quantitatively compare with a real interest
rate channel? To answer this question, we rely again on the τbt shock that aﬀects the ex-ante
real interest rate. Using again the calibration based on the VAR study of Calza et al. (2013),
ρb is set equal to 0.5. Figure 5 contains the results of this comparison. It plots the responses

of selected variables (it − Et πt+1 , mt /pt , XS , and Ct ) to a one percentage point (annualized)
increase in the short term nominal interest rate, occurring due to either the τbt or the π t
shock. Observe that under the τbt shock the ex-ante real interest rate (it − Et πt+1 ) increases,
whereas under the π t shock it stays almost unchanged (it gradually declines due to small

general equilibrium eﬀects working through capital accumulation). The immediate eﬀect on
real mortgage payments, however, is the same under the two shocks and the subsequent eﬀect
is even more persistent under the π t shock than under the τbt shock. Housing investment
under both shocks declines by roughly 2% on impact, but the decline is more persistent

under the π t shock. The same applies to consumption. The transmission mechanism studied
in this paper is thus at least as potent, under ARM, as the traditional real rate channel.


7.1.3   The role of persistence

Recall that the calibration of ρπ is based on replicating the persistence of the 10-year nom-
inal government bond yield, used as a proxy for the 30-year mortgage rate. How do the
quantitative ﬁndings change when the persistence of the shock is reduced? Figure 6 provides

the answer. Focusing on the ARM case, in which the real eﬀects are generally larger, the
initial response of housing investment is reduced from 1.8% to 1.1% as the persistence is
reduced from the calibrated value of 0.994 to 0.95 (recall that the latter value is required to
match the MPC of homeowners in Di Maggio et al., 2014). When the persistence is further

reduced to 0.5, the real eﬀects become negligible. At this degree of persistence, the real
eﬀects working through the traditional real rate channel are much stronger (refer back to
the bottom panel of Figure 3). Notice that as the persistence is reduced, the shock starts
to aﬀect the long-short spread, rather than the level of the yield curve. The transmission



                                                38
mechanism proposed in this paper is thus quantitatively more relevant for monetary policy
shocks that primarily aﬀect the level of the yield curve, rather than its slope.


7.2     Reﬁnancing

The previous analysis has abstracted from reﬁnancing. This is a reasonable approximation

for countries like Germany and France, as argued at the start of this section, but not for
the United States. Does optimal reﬁnancing make the responses of the economy under FRM
look more like under ARM when interest rates decline? As described in Section 4, when
iFt < Rt , the homeowner optimally chooses the fraction of outstanding debt t to reﬁnance.
We assume that the reﬁ cost function is Γ(.) = υ(t − )2 , with υ > 0. For this cost function,

the ﬁrst-order condition for t takes a simple form

                                                             
                                (1 − γt ) dt     −βEt VR,t+1
                      t −  =                                 (Rt − iFt ),
                                (1 + πt ) dt+1      2υ

where VRt < 0 is the derivative of the homeowner’s value function with respect to Rt ,
capturing the marginal life-time gain of reducing the eﬀective interest rate on outstanding
debt.

   The parameter  is set so that, in steady state, the share of reﬁ loans in new loans,
(1−γ)d/l, is equal to 0.4, a long-run average from Freddie Mac’s Primary Mortgage Market
Survey (1987-2007). This implies  = 0.02, i.e., 2% of the outstanding debt is reﬁnanced
quarterly in steady state, a fraction reported also by Chen et al. (2013). The reﬁ cost

parameter υ is set equal to 12.0, so as to match, in equilibrium, the local elasticity of the
share of reﬁ loans in new loans with respect to the FRM rate. This elasticity is approximately
a 32 percentage point increase in the reﬁ share for a one percentage point decline in the 30-
year FRM rate.

   Figure 7 shows the responses of selected variables to a 25 basis point quarterly (one
percentage point, annualized) decline in the FRM rate, occurring due to the π t shock, with
the calibrated persistence of ρπ = 0.994. For comparison, the ﬁgure also plots responses under

                                               39
FRM without reﬁnancing and under ARM. As expected, the responses under reﬁnancing lie
in-between the other two cases. Quantitatively, they are closer to the FRM responses. This
is because the increase in the reﬁ share of outstanding debt, t , is fairly small: an increase
from 0.02 to 0.026 on impact. Notice, however, that (given the size of the stock) such a

modest increase in t shows up as a large increase in the reﬁ share of new loans: an increase
from 0.4 to 0.48 on impact (equivalent to an increase to 0.72 for a one percentage point
decline in the FRM rate). The increase in reﬁnancing is persistent, resulting in a sustained,
though modest, decline in real mortgage payments for several periods after the shock. As

reﬁnancing converges back to steady state, the eﬀect of persistently low inﬂation takes over
and real mortgage payments start to increase, converging to the basic FRM case. Due to the
attenuated response of real mortgage payments, the negative responses of consumption and
housing investment observed under the basic FRM contract are now weaker, close to zero,

in fact, for several periods.


7.3     Mortgage choice

In many countries, the only type of mortgage contract available are ARM loans (see footnote
1). However, in the United States, and a few other countries, homeowners have a choice be-
tween FRMs and ARMs. On average (1982-2007), ARMs in the United States accounted for

30 percent of new loan originations but this share has not been stable over time. Various stud-
ies document that the ARM share moves positively with the long-short spread, or its various
proxies (Koijen, Van Hemert, and Van Nieuwerburgh, 2007; Moench, Vickery, and Aragon,
2010; Badarinza, Campbell, and Ramadorai, 2014).49 Is our model consistent with this be-

havior once we allow for mortgage choice? And does mortgage choice aﬀect the responses of
the model economy to the π t shock? Campbell and Cocco (2003) provide a thorough theo-
retical analysis of mortgage choice at the household level. They show that mortgage choice
is sensitive to short-run movements in interest rates (and thus in the long-short spread)
  49
     Koijen et al. (2007) go further and argue that it is the term premium component of the long-short spread
that is the key driver of the movements in the ARM share.


                                                     40
when households have limited ability to smooth out ﬂuctuations in real mortgage payments
through other ﬁnancial instruments. Such a ﬁnancial market friction is present in our model.
       As in the case of reﬁnancing, the cost function is assumed to be quadratic, Φ(.) =
ω(l2t /lt − l2 /l)2 , where (as noted in Section 4) l2t /lt is the fraction of ARM loans in newly

originated loans and l2 /l is its long-run average. The long-run average is parameterized and
captures various factors noted in footnote 1. Given our focus on temporary ﬂuctuations,
treating the long-run ratio as a parameter seems reasonable. With this functional form, the
optimality condition for mortgage choice is

                                    l2t l2   1 F RM
                                        − =    (τHt − τHt
                                                       ARM
                                                           ),
                                     lt  l  2ω

       F RM      ARM
where τHt   and τHt  are wedges for FRM and ARM contracts, respectively. According
to the optimality condition, the larger is the FRM wedge relative to the ARM wedge, the
larger is the ARM share in new loans. For the general equilibrium model, the wedges are
derived in Appendix A, but they are straightforward generalizations of the wedges in the

simple model of Section 3. Recall than under complete markets the wedges are identically
equal to zero. In such a case, mortgage choice is irrelevant.
       The steady-state share l2 /l is set to the long-run average of 0.3 and the cost parameter
ω is set so as to replicate the empirical elasticity of the ARM share to the long-short spread,

equal to 7.0 (i.e., a seven percentage point increase in the ARM share in response to a one
percentage point increase in the long-short spread). This elasticity implies ω = 0.0055.50
To assess if the model is consistent with the empirical observations on the movements in
the ARM share described in the literature, we study responses to the τbt shock, which is
the main driver of the long-short spread in the model. Panel A of Figure 8 shows that

the model is consistent with the basic feature of the data: the ARM share of new loans
  50
    This value is much smaller than that for the cost parameter in the case of reﬁnancing. This is because
the potential gain from reﬁnancing is much larger than the gain from mortgage choice as reﬁnancing applies
to the stock, whereas mortgage choice applies only to new loans. The fact that in the data only a small
fraction of the stock is reﬁnanced in response to a percentage fall in the mortgage rate implies a relatively
large reﬁ cost in the model.



                                                     41
declines when the long-short spread declines. Similarly to the case of reﬁnancing, while the
response of the share in new loans is substantial, it translates to only a small change in
the share of outstanding debt. The response of housing investment is mainly aﬀected by
the steady-state share of ARMs and lies in-between the responses under the separate FRM

and ARM contracts reported in panel A of Figure 3. Given that the model is consistent
with the basic observations on mortgage choice in the data, we ask if mortgage choice plays
an important role in the transmission mechanism with respect to the π t shock. Panel B
of Figure 8 provides a negative answer. As the π t shock is highly persistent, it has almost

no eﬀect on the long-short spread and thus no eﬀect on mortgage choice. The response of
housing investment is only aﬀected by the steady-state share of ARMs and lies in-between
the responses under FRM and ARM, reported in Figure 4.



8     Concluding remarks

Mortgage payments constitute a substantial part of homeowners’ mandatory expenses. In

combination with the fact that mortgages are long-term loans set in nominal terms, it is
natural to ask: what role do mortgage contracts play in the transmission of monetary policy?
This paper attempts to establish these connections. Like goods market imperfections provide
a breeding ground for nominal price rigidities to play a role in the transmission of monetary

policy in New-Keynesian models, ﬁnancial market imperfections (incomplete asset markets)
facilitate transmission of monetary policy through mortgage contracts in our framework.
    Three key properties of the mortgage transmission mechanism emerge. First, the trans-
mission mechanism is found to be stronger under adjustable- than ﬁxed-rate mortgages.

Second, monetary policy shocks aﬀecting the level of the nominal yield curve have larger
real eﬀects than transitory shocks, aﬀecting its slope. And third, persistently higher inﬂa-
tion gradually beneﬁts homeowners under FRMs, but hurts them immediately under ARMs.
In terms of quantities, on impact, housing investment increases by 1.8% under ARM and
declines by 0.7% (0.15% with reﬁnancing) under FRM, in response to a one percentage point

                                             42
(annualized) downward shift of the nominal yield curve (and inﬂation). Under ARM, the
strength of the transmission mechanism is comparable to a traditional real rate channel.
This is despite the fact that, in equilibrium, the real interest rate in our model hardly moves
in response to monetary policy shocks.

   In the interest of transparency, we have abstracted from the usual nominal frictions and
other channels through which housing ﬁnance aﬀects the macroeconomy. The number of
shocks was also limited. A natural extension is therefore to incorporate these additional
features and study their interaction with the mechanism proposed here.

   Another interesting avenue is to study the price and income eﬀects in an overlapping
generations setup with realistic life-cycle dynamics. It is likely that the agents who face the
price eﬀect are diﬀerent from those who face the income eﬀect, and the importance of the
income eﬀect further varies with the homeownership life-cycle. This can lead to an additional

dimension of monetary policy redistribution, redistribution across diﬀerent homeowners.
   Finally, an important normative question regards optimal monetary policy. Such a policy
is likely to depend on the prevalent mortgage type, FRM or ARM, in the economy. Diﬀerent
countries may thus follow diﬀerent policies depending on their mortgage markets. This

question may be quite complex for the Eurozone, which includes countries with very diﬀerent
mortgage markets. Extending the model to allow for default and banking may also generate
interesting interactions between monetary and macroprudential policies. The framework
developed in this paper provides a groundwork for addressing these additional questions.

T-bill yield is used for it ; the ratio of the average price of new homes sold
(Census Bureau) and the GDP deﬂator is used for pHt (1975-2006). The
model moments are averages of moments for 150 runs; the artiﬁcial data of
each run are of the same length as the U.S. data and are also HP ﬁltered.
Details of U.S. data are in Appendix C.
Notes B: FRM countries are BEL, FRA, US; ARM countries are AUS, CAN,
UK. The moments, based on HP-ﬁltered data, are taken from Kydland et al.
(forthcoming). The classiﬁcation is based on Footnote 1.

Figure 5: Findings II: comparison of two transmission mechanisms under ARM. Responses to
the real rate (bond market) shock and to the nominal (inﬂation target) shock under ARM. Real
rate shock = circles. Nominal shock = solid line. Interest rates are measured as percentage
point (annualized) deviations from steady state, quantities are in percentage deviations. The
persistence of the real rate shock is 0.5, based on the VAR estimate of Calza et al. (2013).
The persistence of the nominal shock is the calibrated value of 0.994, based on matching the
autocorrelation of the long rate. In both cases, the initial response of the short-term nominal
interest rate (not plotted) is one percentage point (annualized). One period = one quarter.

Supplemental material
The supplemental material covers (A) equilibrium conditions, (B) computation, (C) data
used in calibration, and (D) estimates of mortgage debt servicing costs for the United States.

Appendix A: Equilibrium conditions
This appendix lists the conditions characterizing the equilibrium deﬁned in Section 4 for
the basic FRM and ARM cases. We use these conditions to solve for the steady state (a
situation in which all shocks are equal to their unconditional means and all real variables,
interest rates, and the inﬂation rate are constant). The steady state is used to calibrate
the model and serves as the point of a local approximation of the economy in our solution
method described in Appendix B. Interested readers may also ﬁnd these conditions useful if
they wish to compute the equilibrium by log-linearization of the equilibrium conditions. Our
computational method does not rely on approximating these conditions. Instead, it takes
a linear-quadratic approximation of the Bellman equations within the recursive competitive
equilibrium problem described in Section 4 and then solves the LQ problem. Details are
provided in Appendix B. As is well known, the two methods yield the same approximate
decision rules and pricing functions. To solve for the case of reﬁnancing, the standard method
needs to be modiﬁed, as explained in Appendix B. The steady state, however, is the same
for the basic FRM case, the ARM case, reﬁnancing, and the mortgage choice problem. This
is because, in the steady state, it = iFt = Rt . (As a result, steady-state reﬁnancing and ARM
share are parameterized, as noted in the text.) The conditions below can thus be used to
solve for the steady state under all contract types considered in this paper.

Throughout, the notation is that, for instance, uct denotes the ﬁrst derivative of the function
u with respect to c, evaluated in period t. Alternatively, v2t , for instance, denotes the ﬁrst
derivative of the function v with respect to the second argument, evaluated in period t.

Mortgage pricing

   Notice that for a once-and-for-all mortgage loan (lt∗ = l∗ in period t and lt∗ = 0 thereafter)
and no outstanding mortgage debt (d∗t = 0 in period t), we have ζDt         ∗           ∗
                                                                               = 0 and ζl,t+j = 0, for

j = 1, 2, .... In this case, the ﬁrst-order condition for lt (A3) and the BS condition for Udt (A4)
simplify, as the terms related to Uγt and URt drop out. Once combined, the two optimality
conditions result in an equation that is a straightforward inﬁnite-horizon extension of the
mortgage-pricing equation (1) in the two-period mortgage example of Section 3:

The terms related to Uγt and URt in the general form of the optimality conditions arise be-
cause the mortgage payment m∗t entering the budget constraint of the capital owner pertains
to payments on the entire outstanding mortgage debt, not just the new loan. In this case,
the terms related to Uγt and URt capture the marginal eﬀect of lt∗ on the average interest
and amortization rates of the outstanding debt, and thus the marginal eﬀect of lt∗ on the
mortgage payments on the outstanding debt.

For the same reasons as above, the wedge is more complicated than in the case of the two-
period mortgage. It becomes a straightforward inﬁnite-horizon extension of equation (3) in
Section 3 if the housing investment decision is once-and-for-all and there is no outstanding

Appendix B: Computation

Overview

    The equilibrium is computed using a linear-quadratic (LQ) approximation method for
distorted economies with exogenously heterogenous agents (see Hansen and Prescott, 1995),
adjusted along the lines of Benigno and Woodford (2006). Further modiﬁcation, described
below, is made to handle reﬁnancing.
    In a nutshell, the method approximates the recursive competitive equilibrium problem of
the original economy, speciﬁed in Section 4, with a corresponding linear-quadratic problem.
The method involves iteration on quadratic Bellman equations (one for each agent type)
subject to linear individual, aggregate, and market clearing constraints. The ﬁxed point of
the iteration is a pair of (quadratic) value functions for the homeowner and capital owner,
P#H (z, S) and P#C (z, S), and a set of (linear) aggregate decisions rules and pricing functions,
$ (z, S), where z is a vector of exogenous state variables and S is a vector of endogenous
W
aggregate state variables, as speciﬁed in Section 4. This function is accompanied by a
                                                                                   #
resulting set of linear laws of motion for the endogenous state variables, S  = Ω(S,   z).
    The centering point of the LQ approximation is the steady state, satisfying the equilib-
rium conditions listed in Appendix A, and the LQ approximation of the original Bellman
equations is computed using numerical derivatives. All variables in the approximation are
either in percentage deviations or percentage point deviations (for interest, inﬂation, and
amortization rates) from the steady state. Before computing the equilibrium, the model is
made stationary by expressing all nominal variables in real terms and replacing ratios of
price levels with the inﬂation rate, as in Appendix A (as a result, pt is replaced with πt in
the vector Wt , speciﬁed in Section 4, and pt−1 drops out of the vector zt ).

Return functions in Bellman equations

    The Hansen-Prescott method needs to be modiﬁed along the lines of Benigno and Woodford
(2006) because the laws of motion for the mortgage variables are nonlinear. This means that
these equations cannot be substituted out into the per-period utility functions, as is normally
done in LQ approximation procedures. The modiﬁcation involves forming a Lagrangian for
each agent, consisting of the per-period utility function and the respective laws of motion for
the mortgage variables. The Lagrangian is then used as the return function in the Bellman
equation being approximated. This adjustment is necessary to ensure that second-order
cross-derivatives of the utility function and the constraints are taken into account in the
LQ approximation. This modiﬁcation, as applied to the homeowner, is described in detail
by Kydland et al. (forthcoming). The speciﬁcation for the capital owner is analogous. We
therefore refer the reader to that paper for details.
    An alternative procedure would be to log-linearize the equilibrium conditions in Appendix
A and use a version of the Blanchard-Kahn method, or a method of undetermined coeﬃ-
cients, to arrive at the equilibrium decision rules and pricing functions. As is well known,
these methods yields the same linear equilibrium decision rules and pricing functions as the
modiﬁed LQ approximation method.



                                               65
Certainty equivalence

   The linear equilibrium decision rules and pricing functions computed as described above
are characterized by certainty equivalence. That is, the coeﬃcients of the linear functions
$ (z, S) loading onto z and S depend only on the conditional means of future values of the
W
exogenous state variables, implied by their AR(1) processes. Not on higher moments. One
implication of the certainty equivalence is that the FRM rate in the approximated model
conforms with the expectations hypothesis.

Computing business cycle moments and impulse-responses

    The business cycle moments used to cross-validate the model are based on artiﬁcial data
from 150 runs of the model. In a single run, a sequence of innovations [ At , πt , bt , qt ], for
t = 1, ..., 150, is drawn from their respective iid normal distributions. The AR(1) processes
for the exogenous state variables are then used to generate a sequence of the vector z (for
t = 1, ..., 150), which is then fed into the endogenous functions W$ (z, S) and S  = Ω(S,
                                                                                      #    z) to
recursively generate a sequence of the endogenous variables of interest.
    When computing impulse-responses, either to cross-validate the model or in the main
computational experiments, all exogenous state variables except the one of our interest are
held constant at their unconditional means. A path for the exogenous state variable of our
interest is generated by setting its innovation equal to a particular value in period t = 1
and to zero in all subsequent periods. The path of the state variable is then generated using
the variable’s AR(1) process and this path is fed into the endogenous functions W   $(z, S) and
       #
S  = Ω(S,   z) to recursively generate a sequence of the endogenous variables. Because the
model is stationary, after the initial impulse in t = 1 that moves the economy away from the
steady state, all variables converge back to the steady state.

Handling reﬁnancing

    The computational method needs to be modiﬁed in the case of reﬁnancing. With reﬁ-
nancing, the economy can operate under two regimes: one in which iFt ≥ Rt and t = 
and another in which iFt < Rt and t = t . We therefore compute two sets of approximate
equilibrium decision rules and pricing functions, W    $1 (z, S) for the ﬁrst regime and W$2 (z, S)
for the second regime (and two sets of the corresponding laws of motion for S). The point of
approximation is the steady state, which (as explained in Appendix A) is common to both
regimes. Given that the economy can operate under two regimes, the endogenous linear
functions W $1 (z, S) and W
                          $2 (z, S) have to take into account the fact that the economy can
switch between them. This is relatively straightforward to implement in the case of the
experiments of Section 7. There are two reasons for this. First, after the initial decline,
in response to the negative inﬂation target shock, iFt converges monotonically back to the
steady state. Second, from the law of motion for the interest rate on outstanding debt follows
that iFt is a marginal rate of Rt+1 . Therefore, if iFt falls below the steady state and converges
back monotonically, iFt and Rt cross paths only once. That is, the economy switches from the
regime iFt < Rt (which occurs on impact of the shock) to the regime iFt ≥ Rt only once along
the convergence path. Therefore, once the economy is in the latter regime, it stays in it until
it converges to the steady state. Further, the point in which it switches is deterministic. It
occurs some N periods after the initial impact of the shock, where N is endogenous.

    To compute the equilibrium decision rules and pricing functions for the impulse-responses
under reﬁnancing, we proceed in two steps. First, we compute the approximation W       $1 (z, S)
for the case it ≥ Rt . This involves the usual procedure described above, as the economy
               F

stays in this regime once it is in it. Denote the pair of the ﬁxed-point quadratic value
functions (one for each agent type) that result from this step as P#1 (z, S). To compute the
equilibrium decision rules and pricing functions for the case of iFt < Rt , we modify the
usual procedure in two ways. First, we use as a staring point of the iterative procedure
on the Bellman equations the pair of value functions P#1 (z, S). Second, we do not iterate
until a ﬁxed point, but only N times. After obtaining W    $1 (z, S) and W
                                                                         $2 (z, S) this way, we
generate impulse-response functions and check whether the N we have used in computing
$2 (z, S) is consistent with the resulting impulse-responses; i.e., whether iF and Rt cross
W                                                                               t
paths N periods after the shock. If not, we change N and repeat the steps until consistency
is obtained. For the calibrated persistence of the shock, N = 60. It turns out that for N
this far in the future, the responses in the ﬁrst 40 periods we are looking at obtained for the
two-regime economy are almost identical to the responses obtained under ‘naive’ decision
rules and pricing functions that do not take into account the fact that the economy will
switch to the second regime 60 periods after the shock (the naive decision rules and pricing
functions are obtained as a ﬁxed point of the usual iterative procedure assuming that the
economy is always in the iFt < Rt regime).

Appendix C: Data counterparts to variables
This appendix describes the data used to calculate the aggregate ratios employed in cali-
brating the model. Adjustments to oﬃcial data are made to ensure that the data correspond
conceptually more closely to the variables in the model. To start, for reasons discussed
by Gomme and Rupert (2007), the following expenditure categories are taken out of GDP:
gross housing value added, compensation of general government employees, and net exports.
In addition, we also exclude expenditures on consumer durable goods (as our ‘home capital’
includes only housing) and multifamily structures (which are owned by corporate entities
and rented out to households mainly in the 1st and 2nd quintiles of the wealth distribution).
With these adjustments, the data counterparts to the expenditure components of output in
the model are constructed from BEA’s NIPA tables as follows: consumption (C) = the sum
of expenditures on nondurable goods and services less gross housing value added; capital in-
vestment (XK ) = the sum of nonresidential structures, equipment & software, and the change
in private inventories; housing structures (XS ) = residential gross ﬁxed private investment
less multifamily structures; and government expenditures (G) = the sum of government
consumption expenditures and gross investment less compensation of general government
employees. Our measure of output (Y = C + XK + XS + G) accounts, on average (1958-
2006), for 74% of GDP. BEA’s Fixed Assets Tables and Census Bureau’s M3 data provide
stock counterparts to capital and housing investment: capital stock (K) = the sum of private
nonresidential ﬁxed assets and business inventories; housing stock (H) = residential assets
less 5+ unit properties.51
  51
     Separate stock data on 2-4 unit properties are not available, but based on completions data from the
Census Bureau’s Construction Survey, 2-4 unit properties make up only a tiny fraction of the multifamily
housing stock.

Appendix D: Estimation of mortgage debt servicing costs
A key measurement for calibrating the model concerns the mortgage debt servicing costs of
homeowners. Unfortunately, such information for the United States is not readily available.
Four diﬀerent procedures are therefore used to arrive at an estimate. The four procedures
exploit the notion that the homeowners in the model correspond to the 3rd and 4th quintiles
of the U.S. wealth distribution. Some of these estimates arguably overestimate the debt ser-
vicing costs, while others underestimate it. Nevertheless, all four procedures yield estimates
in the ballpark of 18.5% of pre-tax income, the value used to calibrate the model.

1. Estimate based on income from the Survey of Consumer Finances

    The ﬁrst procedure, for FRM (1972-2006) and ARM (1984-2006), combines data on
income from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) and the model’s expression for debt
servicing costs. Suppose that all mortgage debt is FRM.52 The model’s expression for steady-
state debt-servicing costs, (R + γ)D/(pwN − pτ Ψ), can then be used to compute the average
debt-servicing costs of homeowners. The various elements of this expression are mapped into
data in the following way: D/(pwN − pτ Ψ) corresponds to the average ratio of mortgage
debt (for 1-4 unit structures) to the combined personal income (annual, pre-tax) of the
3rd and 4th quintiles, equal to 1.56; R corresponds to the average FRM annual interest
rate for a conventional 30-year mortgage, equal to 9.31%; and γ corresponds to the average
amortization rate over the life of the mortgage, equal to 4.7% per annum. This yields debt-
servicing costs of 22%. This estimate is likely an upper bound as some of the outstanding
mortgage debt in the data is owed by the 5th quintile (the 1st and 2nd quintiles are essentially
renters) and the eﬀective interest rate on the stock in the data is likely lower than the average
FRM rate due to reﬁnancing. When all mortgage debt is assumed to be ARM, this procedure
yields 17.5% (based on the average Treasury-indexed 1-year ARM rate for a conventional
30-year mortgage).

2. Estimate based on Financial Obligation Ratios

    The second estimate is based on Federal Reserve’s Financial Obligation Ratios (FOR) for
mortgages (1980-2006). FOR report all payments on mortgage debt (mortgage payments,
homeowner’s insurance, and property taxes) as a fraction of NIPA’s share of disposable
income attributed to homeowners. For our purposes, the problem with these data is that
members of the 5th quintile of the wealth distribution are also counted as homeowners in
the data (as long as they own a home), even though they do not represent the typical
homeowner in the sense of Campbell and Cocco (2003). To correct for this, we apply the
share of the aggregate SCF personal income, attributed to the union of the 3rd, 4th, and
5th quintiles of the wealth distribution, to aggregate disposable income from NIPA. This
gives us an estimate of NIPA disposable income attributed to these three quintiles. This
aggregate is then multiplied by the ﬁnancial obligation ratio to arrive at a time series for
  52
    Federal Reserve’s Flow of Funds Accounts provide data on mortgages and we equalize mortgage debt in
the model (D) with the stock of home mortgages for 1-4 family properties. The Flow of Funds data, however,
include mortgage debt issued for purchases of existing homes, second mortgages, and home equity loans. In
contrast, the model speaks only to ﬁrst mortgages on new housing. The data thus provide an upper bound
for D in the model.

total mortgage payments. Assuming again that all mortgage payments are made by the
3rd and 4th quintiles, the total mortgage payments are divided by NIPA personal (pre-tax)
income attributed to just these two quintiles (calculated by applying the SCF shares). This
procedure yields average debt-servicing costs of 20%.

3. Estimate based on wealth quintiles from the Survey of Consumer Finances

    Third, we use the ratio of all debt payments to pre-tax family income for the 50-74.9
percentile of the wealth distribution, reported in SCF for 1989-2007. The average ratio
is 19%. About 80% of the payments are classiﬁed as residential by the purpose of debt,
yielding an average ratio of 15.2%. A key limitation of this procedure is that the data
exclude the 1970s and most of the 1980s—periods that experienced almost twice as high
mortgage interest rates, on average, than the period covered by the survey. Another issue is
that the information reported in the survey is not exactly for the 3rd and 4th quintiles.

4. Estimate based on Consumer Expenditure Survey

    The fourth procedure is based on the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX), 1984-2006.
This survey reports the average income and mortgage payments (interest and amortization)
of homeowners with a mortgage. To the extent that homeowners without a mortgage are
likely to belong to the 5th quintile of the wealth distribution—they have 100% of equity in
their home and thus have higher net worth than homeowners with a mortgage—the survey’s
homeowners with a mortgage should closely correspond to the notion of homeowners used in
this paper (CEX does not contain data on wealth). The resulting average, for the available
data period, for mortgage debt servicing costs of this group (pre-tax income) is 15%. Given
that the data do not cover the period of high mortgage rates of the late 1970s and early
1980s, like the third estimate, this estimate probably also underestimates the debt servicing
costs for the period used in calibrating the model.

   Taken together, the four procedures lead us to use 18.5%, a value in the middle of the
range of the estimates, as a target in calibration.
