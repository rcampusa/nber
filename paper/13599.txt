                                            ABSTRACT

This article estimates the mortality cost of smoking based on the first labor market estimates of the
value of statistical life by smoking status. Using these values in conjunction with the increase in the
mortality risk over the life cycle due to smoking, the value of statistical life by age and gender, and
information on the number of packs smoked over the life cycle, produces an estimate of the private
mortality cost of smoking of $222 per pack for men and $94 per pack for women in 2006 dollars, based
on a 3 percent discount rate. At discount rates of 15 percent or more, the cost decreases to under $25
per pack.

1. Introduction

         Cigarette smoking substantially reduces life expectancy. Although several studies have

addressed the financial externalities of smoking, there have been no comparably detailed

examinations of the potentially much more substantial value of the mortality cost to smokers.1

The appropriate valuation of private mortality risks is the value of statistical life (VSL) at the age

of death. To provide a basis for this calculation, we develop the first estimates of VSL by

smoking status, age, and gender and use these values in valuing the mortality risks. These

results, which are of independent interest in their own right, are used to value the mortality risks

of smoking. In addition, our estimates of the mortality cost of smoking take into account the

temporal distribution of the increased mortality associated with cigarette smoking, as well as the

pattern of smoking over the life cycle.

         Previous studies have indicated fairly similar values for the mortality cost per pack with

values of $20 by Sloan et al. (2004), $22 by Cutler (2002), and $30 by Gruber and Köszegi

(2001). The methodology in the studies assumes that the loss of life due to smoking occurs at

the end of smokers’ lifetime and that the value of this loss can be based on a value per life year

lost of $100,000.2 This value of statistical life year (VSLY) approach is based on the

assumptions that VSL equals the present discounted value of a series of annual values and that

each year of life has an identical value.

         In Section 2 we provide an overview of our estimating methodology. Specifically the

present value of the mortality cost of smoking is the discounted value of the incremental

probability of death at different ages for smokers relative to otherwise comparable nonsmokers,

multiplied by the pertinent VSL. This section also introduces the hedonic wage equation model

used to estimate VSL. In Section 3 we estimate hedonic wage equations by smoking status,

allowing for age variation in the VSL. We find that the VSL does not vary substantially by

smoking status. Moreover, there is no evidence of a significant decline in VSL for the age range

of the working population. This absence of a steady drop in VSL with age implies that VSL

estimates calculated specifically by age will be much larger than those in which VSL is

constructed based on an assumed constant unit value per year of life. Section 4 estimates the

mortality cost based on the VSL estimates derived from the results in Section 3. Our cost

calculation is on a year-by-year basis, taking into account the differential mortality risk of

smokers in each year and recognizing the specific expected age of death and the appropriate

discounting of these losses. Use of the appropriate age-specific VSL levels leads to a substantial

increase in the estimated mortality cost of smoking.

       The results of the analysis are quite striking. The discounted expected mortality cost per

pack using a 3 percent discount rate for male smokers is $222 in 2006 dollars, and for female

smokers is $94. While the mortality cost varies with the discount rate, at all reasonable rates of

discount the mortality cost remains considerably above previous estimates.



2. Procedure for Calculating Mortality Cost

       In this section we provide an overview of the approach that we implement in Sections 3

and 4. Intuitively, the mortality cost of smoking is the expected number of years of life lost due

to smoking multiplied by the economic value of these years. The general formulation of the

present value of the mortality cost of smoking c used in this paper is given by

                                        100
                                               ( x st − x nt )v(t )
                                   c=∑                              ,                            (1)
                                       t =t0       (1 + r ) t −t0


                                                         2
where t0 is the age at which the person became a committed smoker, xst is the probability that this

smoker dies at age t, xnt is the probability that a comparable nonsmoker would have died at age t,

v(t) is the value of death at age t, and r is the rate of discount. The mortality cost per pack is

obtained by dividing c by the discounted number of packs smoked, taking into account the life

cycle pattern of smoking.

       We use t0 equal to age 24 as the demographic reference point. By that age, short-term

smoking experimentation has been completed. This focus on 24 year old committed smokers

parallels the assumption embodied in the tables by Sloan et al. (2004) in which life expectancy is

based on continued smoking behavior excluding quitters. Our focus on continuing smokers

ensures a comparable matchup of smoking-related mortality risks and patterns of cigarette

consumption over the life cycle. The scientific estimates for mortality risks of smoking over the

life cycle are much more reliable for committed smokers than for quitters at different ages.

       To calculate the incremental mortality risk from smoking, (xst − xnt), we use the

‘nonsmoking smoker’ as the reference point, as in Manning et al. (1989, 1991). This approach

uses as the baseline the risk profile of a nonsmoker who otherwise has the demographic and risk

profile of a smoker and thereby correctly reflects the increased smoking-related mortality risk

that will be experienced by smokers specifically due to their smoking behavior. Because our

estimates adjust for smokers’ demographic risk profiles, the life expectancy loss estimates are

lower than those used in some other studies. If we had not used the nonsmoking smoker

reference point, our cost estimates would be even higher.

       The most critical component of the calculation is the unit mortality value parameter v(t).

Following the standard economic approach, the ideal measure of v(t) is the VSL at age t. For




                                                   3
smokers age 65 or over, we do not have a VSL based on labor market tradeoffs so instead will

construct this value using the VSLY levels for workers age 55-64.

        The relation between VSL and VSLY is based on the quantity-adjusted value of life

analysis introduced by Moore and Viscusi (1988). If people lived forever and had a constant

value per year of life, the VSL would equal VSLY⁄ r, where r is the rate of discount. To account

for a finite lifespan, denote the remaining life expectancy by L. The VSL equals

                                         VSLY       1 ⎡VSLY ⎤
                               VSL =          −                    .                            (2)
                                           r    (1 + r ) L ⎢⎣ r ⎥⎦

Solving for VSLY, and using the subscript s to indicate that the estimates are conditional on

being a smoker,

                                VSLYs = r (VSLs ) [1 − (1 + r ) − L ] .                         (3)

The Hedonic Model

        Our estimates employ a variant of the canonical hedonic wage equation to derive

estimates of v(t), allowing v(t) to vary by smoking status, age, and gender. Our paper makes use

of the state-of-the art approach to estimating VSL. We advance the literature by utilizing more

refined fatality risk measures by industry-age-gender than in any previous study and by

presenting the first wage-fatality risk premiums by smoking status in the literature.

        Specifically, the canonical hedonic wage equation is the form

                       ln (w i ) = α + G i' Ψ + θ1 p i + θ 2 q i + θ 3 q i b i + ε i ,          (4)

where

        wi = the worker’s hourly wage rate,

        Gi = a vector of personal characteristics and control variables for worker i,

        pi = the fatality risk for worker i’s industry-age-gender cell,



                                                          4
        qi = the nonfatal injury risk for worker i’s industry-age cell,

        bi = the state legal maximum workers’ compensation replacement rate for temporary total

             disability in the worker’s state,

        εi = the random error term,

and α, θ1, θ2, and θ3 are scalar coefficients, while Ψ is a coefficient vector.3

        Using the coefficient on fatality risk from the wage equations, and assuming 2,000 hours

worked per year, the general formulation for the VSL is

                                  VŜL = θˆ 1 ∗ w ∗ 2,000 ∗ 100,000 .                                        (5)

We will compute this value for different age-gender-smoking status groups. This formulation

ensures that the VSL estimates will have a time frame comparable to the annual fatality risk

variable. If, for example, smokers worked less than 2000 hours per year, their annual fatality

risk would decline proportionally as well, so that equation 5 would still be the appropriate

formula for generalizing the hourly wage-fatality risk tradeoff to calculate the pertinent VSL

estimate.

        The hedonic labor market equilibrium reflects the joint influence of market opportunities

and preferences, and these factors may differ for smokers and nonsmokers. Viscusi and Hersch

(2001) find that smokers face a wage-nonfatal risk offer curve that has a lower intercept and a

flatter slope than that available to nonsmokers, and that on average, smokers have a lower

implicit value of nonfatal injury risk. Whether wage-fatality risk tradeoffs differ for smokers and

nonsmokers is an open empirical question. We estimate separate wage equations for smokers

and nonsmokers so that the market offer curve and worker preferences toward risk can vary by

smoking status. Additionally, we allow for differences by age.

 Although the equations will subsequently be estimated by smoking status, for simplicity we suppress these
subscripts.

3. The Value of Statistical Life by Smoking Status, Age, and Gender

Data Description and Empirical Framework

        To estimate equation 4, we use information from the monthly Current Population Survey

(CPS) and the CPS Tobacco Use Supplements on individual wage rates, labor market

characteristics, and smoking status, matched with industry-age-gender fatality rates calculated

from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI),

industry-age nonfatal injury rates calculated from the BLS Survey of Occupational Injuries and

Illnesses, and state-level workers’ compensation replacement rates.

        The CPS Tobacco Use Supplement has been administered as a supplement to the CPS

about every three years beginning in 1992, with three surveys conducted in each wave. We use

data on smoking status and packs smoked per day from the supplements conducted in 1995–

1996, 1998–1999, and 2001–2002.4 A smoker is defined as someone who has smoked at least

100 cigarettes in his/her lifetime and reports currently smoking either every day or some days.

Nonsmokers include never-smokers as well as former smokers.

        The monthly CPS provides the remaining information on individual worker

characteristics. The dependent variable is the log of the real hourly wage rate (in December

2000 dollars).5 In addition to the risk variables defined shortly, we control in the wage equation

for potential experience (defined as age − years of education − 5), potential experience squared,




4
  The CPS Tobacco Use Supplements were administered in September, January, and May for the 1995–1996 and
1998–1999 waves, and in June, November, and February for the 2001–2002 wave.
5
  Hourly wage is defined as weekly earnings divided by usual hours per week and adjusted for price level changes
using the monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI-U-RS, Consumer Price Index Research Series Using Current
Methods. Weekly earnings flagged by the CPS as topcoded are multiplied by 1.5 before the hourly wage is
calculated.


                                                        6
years of education,6 part-time employment, union membership or coverage, government

employment, metropolitan residence, race (Black, Native American, Asian), whether Hispanic,

sex, and marital status.

         The CPS surveys each household for four consecutive months and surveys the same

household one year later for four more months. Earnings information is provided only in the

fourth and eighth months that the household is surveyed (MIS 4 and MIS 8, where MIS is the

‘month in sample’). The survey month that the CPS Tobacco Use Supplement is administered

will only correspond to the survey month that earnings information is reported at most one-fourth

of the time.7 To increase the sample with both earnings and smoking information, we match

individuals’ Tobacco Use Supplement responses to their earnings information across CPS

months. For example, individuals with MIS 3 when they answered the CPS Tobacco Use

Supplement questions in January 1996 are linked to their earnings information in the February

1996 CPS when their MIS is 4.8

         To calculate fatality rates, we use data from the CFOI for the years 1996–2001. The

CFOI reports the number of work-related fatalities by two-digit SIC industry, age group (8 age

groups), and gender. To construct fatality rates, we use as the numerators the number of

fatalities in each two-digit SIC industry by age group and gender.9 The denominators are the

hours-weighted levels of industry employment by age group and gender for 1996–2001 from the
6
  Years of education are imputed from categorical information on highest grade or degree completed and duration of
graduate degree program.
7
  Respondents in their outgoing rotation of the February 2002 CPS did not participate in the Tobacco Use
Supplement, reducing even more the sample with both smoking and earnings information in the same survey month.
8
  Respondents are matched using household identification number, person’s line number, and MIS. To mitigate
incorrect matching, matches are rejected if the person’s sex or race was different across the two months, or if the
person’s reported ages in the two survey months are more than one year apart. Not all respondents to the Tobacco
Use Supplement can be matched to a different month of the CPS because the CPS does not follow households or
individuals if they move.
9
  Job-related fatalities are not available by smoking status, so it is not feasible to construct a fatality risk variable
specific to smokers and nonsmokers. Previous gender-specific job risk measures used in compensating differential
studies are those for nonfatal injuries in Hersch (1998) and fatalities in Leeth and Ruser (2003). Aldy and Viscusi
(2007) and Viscusi and Aldy (2007) use fatality measures by age and industry.

CPS for those with MIS 4 or MIS 8. Because the fatality risk measure includes an hours worked

adjustment, unlike published fatality risk measures or variables used in other studies, it explicitly

accounts for differences in hours worked over the life cycle. We use the average fatality rate per

100,000 full-time workers over the six-year time period in order to give a more stable estimate of

the risk workers face in industries for which fatalities are relatively rare events. We exclude

fatalities for those in the under 16 and 16-19 age groups and for those over age 64. The fatality

rate is thus a gender-specific fatality risk measure by two-digit industry groups in five age

groups: 20-24 years, 25-34 years, 35-44 years, 45-54 years, and 55-64 years.

        A longstanding issue in the hedonic wage literature has been the potential influence of

measurement error with respect to the fatality risk variable.10 Our construction of the risk

variable mitigates some of the concerns in the early literature. First, the CFOI dataset is a

comprehensive census of all work-related fatalities rather than a sample. Second, by

constructing the fatality risk variable by industry, age, and gender, it is pertinent to the individual

worker.

        The nonfatal injury rates are constructed in a similar manner using data on the number of

nonfatal injuries from the BLS Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses, except we do not

calculate gender-specific rates for injury risk. We use the total number of occupational injuries

and illnesses involving at least one lost workday by industry within the same five age groups

used to calculate the fatality risk measure, divided by hours-weighted total employment by

industry and age group calculated from CPS data. The BLS does not report the number of




10
  Black and Kniesner (2003) and Viscusi and Aldy (2003) review the measurement error issues and the different
fatality risk measures used in the literature.


                                                       8
injuries in several industries in which fatality data are reported. We drop from the sample all

workers in these industries in the wage equation estimation.11

         As a final risk-related measure, we control for the expected workers’ compensation

replacement rate, denoted as qibi in equation 4. This variable is the interaction between the age-

group-specific nonfatal lost workday injury risk and the state legal maximum workers’

compensation replacement rate for temporary total disability in the worker’s state.12 This

interactive formulation is appropriate since the value that workers attach to workers’

compensation benefits increases with their likelihood of injury.

         The sample used to estimate the hedonic wage equation is comprised of wage and salary

workers 20 to 64 years old who earn between $2 and $100 per hour and whose smoking status is

reported.13 The final sample consists of 278,911 observations, with 212,067 nonsmokers and

66,844 smokers. Our wage equations are estimated separately by smoking status. Means by

smoking status for all variables used in the analyses are reported in Appendix 1.

         Table 1 summarizes the average fatality risk per 100,000 full-time workers by smoking

status, sex, and age group. Because fatality rates are imputed to individual workers by industry,

age, and gender, these averages are implicitly weighted by the frequency of workers in each

industry-age-gender category. Women face a substantially lower fatality risk than do men in




11
   These industries are U.S. Postal Service (SIC 43), private household services (SIC 88), miscellaneous services
(SIC 89), and all industries in public administration (SIC 91-97 and 99). Injuries in the industry ‘pipelines, except
natural gas’ (SIC 46) were not reported by age group or by gender, so workers in this industry are also dropped.
12
   The workers’ compensation rates were gathered from two sources: Alliance of American Insurers, Survey of
Workers’ Compensation Laws (various years), and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Analysis of Workers’
Compensation Laws (various years). For states in which the worker’s compensation base is the after-tax or
spendable wage, the replacement rate is multiplied by 1 minus the average tax rate for the state including state and
federal average rates. The source of tax rates is the NBER and its TAXSIM model available on-line at
http://www.nber.org/~taxsim. See Feenberg and Coutts (1993).
13
   In addition to workers in industries excluded because nonfatal injury data is not available, we also exclude
workers in agriculture, fishing, or forestry industries or occupations.


                                                           9
every age group, and smokers incur significantly greater risks than nonsmokers of the same

gender. Also note that fatality risk rises with age.14

Regression Estimates

         Table 2, Panel A reports the coefficient estimates on the fatality risk variable in equation

4, with robust standard errors in parentheses and standard errors corrected for clustering by

industry and age group in brackets. The full equations appear in Appendix 2.15 Results for

nonsmokers are in column 1, and those for smokers are in column 2.16 The coefficients on

fatality risk, which are used to calculate the VSLs, are statistically significant at the 95 percent

level or better.17

         The last row of Panel A in Table 2 reports the VSL levels by smoking status and gender.

The average estimated VSL is $7.39 million for nonsmokers and $7.32 million for smokers.

Wage rates for men and women differ, leading to different VSL levels by gender within the same

smoking status. For males, the average VSL is $8.51 million for nonsmokers and $8.14 million

for smokers. The average VSL for females is $6.35 million for nonsmokers and $6.37 million

for smokers. Despite the similarity in the fatality risk valuations for nonsmokers and smokers,

the effect of nonfatal lost workday risk follows the pattern found in Viscusi and Hersch (2001).18



14
   Viscusi and Aldy (2007) examine the age variations in fatality risk for specific occupations and industries and find
the same age pattern as is exhibited here. Although worker injury rates decline with age, the severity increases with
age, producing the positive age-fatality risk relationship. For a survey of labor market estimates of age variations in
VSL, see Aldy and Viscusi (2007).
15
   Appendix 2 reports only the clustered standard errors to save space.
16
   The null hypothesis that the vector of coefficients in the nonsmoker and smoker equations is equal is rejected at
the 1 percent level.
17
   As the results in Appendix 2 indicate, the coefficients on the nonfatal job risk variable and the workers’
compensation variable also are statistically significant and have the expected signs, as workers receive a premium
for nonfatal injury risk and incur a wage offset for expected workers’ compensation benefit.
18
   The full effect of the lost workday injury rate variable must take into account the interaction of the injury rate with
the state level workers’ compensation replacement rates in constructing the expected workers’ compensation
replacement rate variable. Based on the results in Appendix 2 and evaluated at the mean workers’ compensation
replacement rates of 0.681 for nonsmokers and 0.682 for smokers, the marginal effects of the lost workday injury
rate variable on log wages is 0.0096 for nonsmokers and -0.0026 for smokers.


                                                           10
Age Variation in VSL

         To take into account the age distribution of smoking-related mortality, we examine

whether there is age variation in VSL. In a world of perfect capital markets, VSL will steadily

decline as a function of age in recognition of the shorter expected remaining lifetime for people

who are older. Previous analyses of the mortality cost of smoking have used a constant VSLY

based on this formulation. If capital markets are imperfect, then the steady decline of VSL with

age need not hold, as Shepard and Zeckhauser (1984) present numerical simulations indicating

an inverted-U shaped relationship between VSL and age when there is no borrowing or lending.

More recent theoretical models developed by Johansson (2002) link VSL to the pattern of

lifetime consumption, implying that there may be no unambiguous conclusions one can draw

about the theoretical relationship between VSL and age.19

         The principal consequence of the absence of evidence indicating a steady decline of VSL

with age is that VSLY is not a constant value, and it is important to estimate how VSL and

VSLY vary with age in order to assess accurately the mortality cost of smoking. To explore

possible age differences, we let the coefficients on the risk variables in equation 4 vary with

age.20 The four age groups, which are indexed by k, have separate risk variable coefficients θ1k,

θ2k, θ3k, and θ4k. Equation 4 is augmented to become

                                     4                  4                  4

   Previous empirical studies indicate a rising VSL with age, followed by a continued increase for healthy workers,
as in Smith et al. (2004), a flattening due to life cycle consumption patterns as in Kniesner, Viscusi, and Ziliak
(2006), or a slight decline as in Viscusi and Aldy (2007). Reviews of the mixed evidence in the literature appear in
Aldy and Viscusi (2007) and Krupnick (2007).

   Our approach follows that in Viscusi and Aldy (2007), which in turn is a modification of the Smith et al. (2004)
model.

           Table 2, Panel B reports the age variation in the fatality rate coefficients for the

nonsmoker sample and the smoker sample. Based on the clustered standard errors, one cannot

reject the hypothesis that the θ1k coefficients are equal for all values of k for both nonsmokers

and smokers.21 As a result, to calculate the variation in the VSL with age, we use age group-

gender wage levels coupled with the fatality risk coefficients reported in Panel A of Table 2.

           Table 3 reports the VSLs for the sample overall evaluated at the average sample age and

for each age group, with values reported separately for age 24, our base age. For example,

consider males at age 24. Their VSLs(24) of $5.98 million is calculated using equation 5, where

the fatality rate coefficient is that reported in Table 2, Panel A, and the wage is the average wage

for 24 year old males.

           The columns in Table 3 following VSLs report the corresponding standard errors for these

values, which are calculated taking into account the fact that the VSL is constructed using the

product of the fatality risk coefficient and the wage rate for the groups, both of which are random

variables.22 For VSLs levels for each gender, there are ten possible pairwise tests of equality of

the age group VSL. All paired comparisons indicate statistically significant differences at the

0.01 level, with the exception of the VSLs levels for males age 45-54 as compared to males age

55-64 (p = 0.29) and for females age 35-44 as compared to age 55-64 (p = 0.02). Other than

these exceptions, VSLs increases through ages 45-54.

Estimating the Value of a Statistical Life Year

           The failure of VSL to decline steadily with respect to age implies that VSL is not simply

the discounted sum of annual unit values of life. Consequently, for the ages for which we have

21
  Based on the robust standard errors rather than the clustered standard errors, the joint hypothesis that the θ1k
coefficients are equal for all values of k can be rejected at the 1 percent level for the nonsmoker sample. Test of
individual coefficient pairs shows that only the coefficient for the lowest age group differs from the other three age
group coefficients.

     Our calculations follow equation 7 of Goodman (1960) and assume independence of θ̂1 and w k .

VSL estimates, it is preferable to use these age-specific values for v(t). However, because most

smokers who die prematurely die after age 64, an age range for which we do not have VSL(t)

estimates, it is necessary to approximate their v(t) values using the VSLY for the age range of 65

years and over.

           For the discussion below we denote the VSL and VSLY for committed lifetime smokers

at age t by VSLs(t) and VSLYs(t). In the VSLY calculation, we use values for L that are derived

from life tables developed by Sloan et al. (2004). Sloan et al. define current smokers as those

who either smoked at the time of the survey or had quit smoking less than five years earlier.

Their study provides survival rates at every age, which we convert into years of remaining life

expectancy for each age t by dividing the sum of person years lived from age t to 100 years of

age by the number of persons surviving to age t.23 Our analysis of the cost of smoking by gender

incorporates the gender-specific difference in the survival probabilities between smokers and

nonsmokers. Based on these calculations, the remaining life expectancy for 24 year old

committed smokers is 47.09 years for males and 53.34 years for females. The excess mortality

risk from smoking is considerably higher for men than for women, in part because of the greater

number of cigarettes smoked by male smokers. For both groups, the mortality risk of smoking

escalates once smokers reach their sixties.

           Using equation 3 in conjunction with the remaining life expectancy L of a 24 year old

committed male smoker and a discount rate of 3 percent leads to an estimated VSLYs(24) of

$238,738. This figure will be the basis for calculating the annual smoking fatality costs v(t)

using the VSLY approach.

           Table 3 also presents the VSLs(t) and VSLYs(t) estimates for the other age groups. The

calculations follow an analogous procedure using the average gender-specific wage for the age

group and the remaining gender-specific life expectancy for committed lifetime smokers at the

midpoint of the age cell. The VSL estimates for these other age groups are used below to

calculate the cost of smoking based on the VSL methodology. Note that a shorter remaining life

expectancy boosts the VSLY for any given VSL value, which accounts for the large VSLYs for

those 55-64.

       It is clear from the age variation in VSLY levels that VSLY is not a constant over the life

cycle. Rather, the VSLY varies from youngest to oldest by a factor of three for men and a factor

of two for women.



4. Smoking Mortality Cost over Time

Discounted Mortality Cost

       The calculation of the discounted mortality cost of cigarettes is based on the lifetime

incremental mortality risk distribution from smoking, the value of the period of life lost, and the

number of packs smoked. The value of the mortality cost from death in any year t is based on

the economic loss in that year, which is discounted back to the reference age 24. We consider

two sets of estimates, one based on VSL levels over time, and the other based on VSLY levels.

       Using the VSL method, mortality cost is valued based on the VSL for the person’s age

range at the time of death. Thus, if a male smoker dies at age 53, the pertinent VSL loss is $9.31

million based on the male VSL numbers in Table 3. Similarly, female smokers who die are

assigned the VSL value for females at the age range at time of death from Table 3. Because the

last age range for which we have VSL estimates is for workers 55 to 64, the valuation of the

deaths of smokers at ages beyond 64 requires additional assumptions to impute a mortality cost

to this age group. In the absence of any empirical evidence about the pattern of VSLYs levels for




                                                14
workers older than 64, we assume that the VSLYs for the 55 to 64 age group, denoted by

VSLYs(60), can be used to estimate the value of the mortality cost for death at any age. Thus,

once a smoker reaches age 65, the calculated VSLs for that smoker is the discounted present

value of the VSLYs levels for the remaining years of the smoker’s expected life. This

formulation consequently leads to an imputed VSLs that is steadily declining with age starting at

age 65. The procedure consequently takes into account the shorter remaining life expectancy of

older smokers, whereas use of VSLs for a younger age group would not.

         In implementing equation 1, the mortality cost calculation consists of two components of

losses – the losses from ages 24 to 64 for which we have VSLs estimates and the losses from

ages 65 to 100 for which we approximate the losses using the VSLY estimates. The value of

discounted expected mortality cost c(VSL) using the VSL approach is given by
                                                                                         100

where xnt is the probability that the 24 year old nonsmoker dies during year t, xst is the

probability that the 24 year old smoker dies during year t, and yst is the probability that the 24

year old smoker has survived to year t.24 The first cost term in equation 7 directly parallels

equation 1. The VSLs(t) values equal v(t), and the incremental probability of death is (xst − xnt).

The specific values of xnt and xst in equation 8 are from Sloan et al. (2004).

         The second cost term in equation 8 is the cost from ages 65 to 100 based on VSLY

estimates. The formulation also follows that of equation 1 where v(t) is approximated by




24
  The values for xst and yst are, of course, related. The age-specific probability of death is equal to the number of
deaths between year t and t+1 divided by the number who survived to year t. That is, xst = (yst − yst+1)/yst.


                                                                 15

stream lost due to premature mortality at age t. The ratio yst ' / yst is the relative probability of

survival to age t′ for a smoker who has lived to age t. The VSLY loss consequently reflects

smokers’ additional risk of death at subsequent ages had they not died in year t.

          The denominator of the cost per pack calculation is the discounted expected number of

packs of cigarettes smoked over the lifetime. The rationale for dividing the present value of the

discounted expected mortality cost c by the discounted expected number of packs smoked is that

doing so establishes the proper unit mortality cost for a pack of cigarettes. To see this, suppose

that smokers were entirely ignorant of the mortality risk of smoking. What unit excise tax on

cigarettes will lead smokers to internalize the mortality risk? Taking into account the life-cycle

pattern of consumption is necessary because the average number of packs smoked varies over the

life cycle. The appropriate value captures not only the effect of risks on lifetime mortality cost,

but also the effect on the lifetime number of packs smoked. Discounting costs and risks is also

necessary so that the present value of a uniform cost value per pack will just equal the present

value of cost given by c.25

          To calculate the discounted number of packs, let zst be the number of packs smoked in

year t for the particular gender-specific smoker who is alive in year t. The present value d of the

number of packs at age 24 is given by



25
  To see why the appropriate denominator for the mortality cost per pack calculation is the discounted number of
packs rather than the undiscounted number of packs, consider the following simple two-period example. Let the
present value of cigarette mortality costs c=100, smokers’ cigarette consumption be z1 packs in period 1 and z2
packs in period 2, and r be the discount rate. What cost of mortality per pack t will have a present value of 100?
Dividing the cost by the total lifetime number of packs yields a value of t=100/(z1+z2), which in turn yields a present
value of lifetime costs of [100z 1 /( z 1 + z 2 )] + [100z 2 /( z 1 + z 2 )(1 + r )] < 100 . If, instead, the discounted number of
packs denominator is used and the value of t is set equal to t = 100 [z 1 + z 2 (1 + r )] , it is straightforward to verify
that the present value of lifetime costs based on the per pack cost of t will equal the c value of 100.


                                                               16

The mortality cost per discounted expected pack smoked based on the VSL approach is

c(VSL)/d.

         To estimate the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per year zst, we use information

from the CPS Tobacco Use Supplement.26 The estimated coefficients (with standard errors in

parentheses) from the regression of packs smoked per year on age, gender, and an interaction of

age with gender are

     z st = 17.76 (11.10) + 12.28 (0.59) * Age − 0.11(0.01) * Age 2 + 30.84 (14.57) * Female

           − 3.22 (0.77) * Female * Age + 0.02 (0.01) * Female * Age 2 .                                            (9)

Figure 1 illustrates the lifetime consumption pattern for male and female smokers. The fitted

number of packs at age 24 is 251 for males and 218 for females. The peak levels of smoking are

at age 58 for men, at 374 packs, and at age 54 for women, at 294 packs. The lower number of

packs smoked by women will reduce the denominator d of the mortality cost per pack

calculation, but it will also reduce the risks per pack that affect the numerator.27

         We also calculate the mortality cost based entirely on the VSLY approach for comparison

with the literature. The basis for the calculation is VSLYs(24), reported in Table 3. Thus,

mortality loss values are based on the discounted expected value of the stream of lost VSLY

amounts. This calculation parallels previous assessments of the cost of smoking in that the

economic value of the life lost due to smoking declines steadily with age.



26
   We use self-respondents ages 15-90 to estimate the packs per year equation. Only self-respondents were asked
how many cigarettes they smoked per day.
27
   Female smokers may also differ in the kinds of cigarettes they smoke, how they smoke, and their dose-response
relationships with respect to smoking. For these reasons, it is important to use gender-specific mortality risk as in
our study and Sloan et al. (2004).

This formulation parallels the second term in equation 7. The estimate of the discounted number

of packs smoked is given by equation 9 as before. We define the cost per pack in this case as

c(VSLY)/d.

       Table 4 summarizes the present value of total mortality cost and the mortality cost per

pack using the two different approaches. All estimates are in 2000 dollars, so to convert to 2006

dollars the cost estimates should be increased by 17 percent based on the change in the CPI-U

over that period. Panel A reports the present value of the total cost, and Panel B reports the cost

per pack amounts c(VSL) and c(VSLY). The present value of mortality cost of smoking

averages over $1.54 million for male smokers and $0.56 million for female smokers. In 2006

dollars these values are $1.80 million for males and $0.66 million for females. The VSLY cost

estimates for men and women are closer in relative terms, with costs of $562,000 for men and

$259,000 for women. Men have a higher mortality cost because of both their higher mortality

risk from smoking and their higher wage rates, which boost their VSL estimates. Their greater

loss of life expectancy due to smoking also boosts the VSLY(60) estimate used to calculate the

value of mortality cost at age 65 and above. The c(VSL)/d of $189 per pack for men is 2.4 times

the $80 cost for women.

       Our estimated ratios of the male to female costs are somewhat greater than the ratio

derived from estimates of $175,000 in costs for men and $94,000 for women in the study by

Sloan et al. (2004) because their study used the same v(t) for men and women. The more




                                                            18
striking difference is the much higher level of cost estimates, which are six times greater based

on the VSL approach and at least three times greater based on the VSLY estimates.

        The cost per pack estimates shown in Table 4, Panel B indicate cost levels that dwarf past

estimates as well. The mortality costs per pack based on the VSL approach is $189 for men and

$80 for women. In 2006 dollars, these values are $222 for men and $94 for women. The VSLY

costs per pack estimates are $69 for men and $37 for women. These latter estimates are based on

a methodology most similar to that in Gruber and Köszegi (2001), Cutler (2002), and Sloan et al.

(2004), who estimated mortality costs per pack of $30, $22, and $20.

        A substantial portion of the discrepancy between our estimates and those in the literature

is our accounting for mortality risks throughout life rather than assuming that the mortality risk is

at the end of life. Suppose first that the mortality consequence of smoking is to reduce 6 years at

the end of one’s life. Incorporating this assumption in our analysis, which is in line with the

approach in Gruber and Köszegi (2001) and Cutler (2002), produces a cost per pack value of

$121.12 for men and $84.98 for women. If instead the lost life expectancy at the end of life is

4.4 years for men and 2.4 years for women, as in Sloan et al. (2004), the cost per pack is $90.83

for men and $35.76 for women. 28 The Sloan et al. (2004) estimates are the more direct

counterpart to our mortality cost values because our calculations use the age-specific mortality

rates developed by Sloan et al. (2004). Up to half of the difference between our estimates and

those in the literature stems from our recognition of the mortality risks of smoking at all ages.

        The analysis thus far has assumed a rate of discount equal to 3 percent, which is one of

the rates recommended by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget for regulatory policy

evaluations. Because of the long latency period for cigarette-related illnesses and death, most of


28
  All these calculations assume remaining life expectancy at age 24 of 47 years for committed male smokers and 53
years for committed female smokers.


                                                       19
the risks of smoking are deferred, increasing the importance of the choice of the discount rate.

Figure 2A illustrates the cost per pack based on the VSL approach for different levels of r. Both

the present value of mortality cost and the present value of packs smoked are functions of r, with

the net relationship being a steeply declining value of c(VSL)/d. Undiscounted, the costs per

pack are about $150 for females and over $300 for males. At discount rates of 0.15 or more, the

costs per pack are under $25 for both groups. Thus, if the personal rates of time preference for

smokers are higher than the social rate of discount, then the mortality cost will not loom as large

as in our calculations.29

         Figure 2B shows the comparable results based on the VSLY approach. These estimates

have a more complicated dependence on r, as the VSLY value used in computing v(t) is also a

function of r. These costs per pack numbers are consistently well below those in Figure 2A. At

discount rates of 0.15, the costs per pack are under $15 for both men and women.

         The methodology of this paper is based on the direct theoretical linkage between the

labor market wage-risk tradeoffs and the price-risk tradeoffs for risky products such as cigarettes.

If individuals face continuous choices with respect to levels of job risk and levels of product

safety, then they will equate their implicit value of statistical life across products and jobs.30

This equivalence is, however, for small changes in risk. Whereas the average annual

occupational fatality risk faced by smokers is 1/25,000, the lifetime mortality risk from cigarettes

is on the order of one-sixth to one-third, which is considerably larger. The willingness-to-pay

amount for any incremental reduction in risk diminishes with the extent of the risk reduction.31



29
   High personal rates of discount also could contribute to smoker choices. See the discussion by Gruber and
Köszegi (2001).
30
   Viscusi (1994) develops a model in which the marginal value of statistical life is equated across different domains
of individual decision.
31
   For a single-period model of the diminishing willingness-to-pay for successive improvements in product safety,
see Viscusi, Magat, and Huber (1987).


                                                         20
Analogously, the willingness-to-accept value for incremental increases in the risk will increase

with the amount of the risk increase. Applying local estimates of the VSL from the job safety

context will consequently lead to estimates that bracket the willingness-to-accept and

willingness-to-pay values for changes in the risk level of cigarettes.

       The interpretation of this result for smoker behavior is as follows. Suppose that the

smoker is completely unaware of the risks of smoking but otherwise makes fully rational

decisions. For simplicity, consider the marginal smoker who currently reaps no consumer

surplus from smoking behavior. Then the estimate for the mortality cost per pack will understate

the amount that the smoker must be compensated to continue smoking. Similarly, if the smoker

is currently fully knowledgeable of the risks of smoking, then the estimate of the mortality costs

per pack will overstate how much the smoker is willing to pay for a risk-free cigarette.



5. Conclusion

       The economic value of the premature mortality due to smoking dwarfs the purchase price

of cigarettes. The mortality cost per pack for men is $222 in 2006 dollars. For women, the cost

is much lower than that for men but is still large, with a cost per pack of $94 in 2006 dollars.

The sources of the gender difference include the greater mortality effect of smoking on men, the

nearer term impact of these mortality losses for men, and the greater VSL for men due to their

higher wage rate.

       The substantial costs per pack stem from two principal factors. First, the discounted

expected value of the mortality risks of smoking is high because smoking increases the mortality

risk throughout a smoker’s life, not just at the end of the smoker’s expected lifetime. Second,

using VLS estimates by age to value the mortality cost indicates that the value of this loss is




                                                 21
quite substantial. Notwithstanding their smoking decision, smokers have a high VSL throughout

their lives, which in turn implies that their premature mortality imposes enormous personal costs.
