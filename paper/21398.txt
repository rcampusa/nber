Do Building Energy Codes Have a Lasting Effect on Energy Consumption? New Evidence
From Residential Billing Data in Florida

                                              ABSTRACT

This paper provides an ex post evaluation of how changes to a building energy code affect energy
consumption. Using residential billing data for electricity and natural gas over 11 years, the analysis
is based on comparisons between residences constructed just before and just after a building code change
in Florida. While an earlier study using 3 years of data for the same residences showed savings for both
electricity an natural gas, new results show an enduring savings for natural gas only. These findings
underscore the importance of accounting for age versus vintage effects and all sources of energy consumption
when conducting evaluations of building codes. More broadly, the results provide a counterpoint to
the growing literature casting doubt on whether ex ante forecasts of energy efficiency policies and
investments can provide useful information about actual energy savings. Indeed, more than a decade
after Florida's energy code change, the measured energy savings still meets or exceeds the forecasted
amount.

1         Introduction
Are building energy codes e¤ective at saving energy? The answer to this question is impor-
tant given the growing reliance on building codes as a central part of energy and climate
policy in the United States and abroad. The promotion of building energy codes is a priority
at the U.S. Department of Energy, which estimates energy expenditure savings in the hun-
dreds of billions of dollars by 2030, with emission reductions equivalent to taking millions of
vehicles o¤ the road (US DOE 2011). In the European Union, all member countries must
comply with the revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive that seeks to promote
energy e¢ ciency and help meet the EU’s greenhouse-gas emissions targets (EU 2012). De-
spite the growing emphasis on building codes as a regulatory instrument, our understanding
of the actual impacts on energy consumption remains thin. There are only a handful of
peer-reviewed studies that seek to evaluate the extent to which building energy codes af-
fect construction practices and energy consumption, and among these studies the results are
quite mixed.1
        In one of the more recent papers, Jacobsen and Kotchen (2013), hereafter referred to as
J&K, study the e¤ects of a change in Florida’s building code using residential billing data
for electricity and natural gas. Their study is based on a comparison between residences
in Gainesville, Florida that were constructed just before and just after an increase in the
stringency of Florida’s energy code in 2002. J&K …nd that the code change caused a 4-percent
decrease in electricity consumption and a 6-percent decrease in natural gas consumption,
and these savings were close to those predicted ex ante for the code change. They also …nd
that energy consumption in post-code change residences is less responsive to weather shocks
in ways consistent with greater energy e¢ ciency, and that the social and private payback
periods for code compliance range between 3.5 and 6.4 years, respectively.
        Even more recently, Levinson (2014) studies the e¤ect of building energy codes on elec-
tricity consumption in California. Despite the fact that California is often perceived as a
model state promoting energy-e¢ cient buildings, Levinson (2014) …nds no evidence that
building codes have any e¤ect on residential electricity consumption.2 An important aspect
of Levinson’s contribution is the careful attention given to building age as a distinct fea-
ture from building vintage with respect to codes. He shows that newer homes consume less
electricity simply because they are new, and this observation can be problematic for reli-
    1
      Studies that focus explicitly on the e¤ects of regulatory building codes include Ja¤e and Stavins (1995),
Horowitz and Haeri (1990), Arroonruengsawat et al. (2009), Costa and Kahn (2010), Jacobsen and Kotchen
(2013), and Levinson (2014).

      Levinson’s (2014) paper has received a substantial amount of media attention given its counterintu-
itive …nding. Readers may …nd of interest a 30-minute Freakonomics podcast dedicated to the paper at

ably estimating the e¤ect of building codes. Hence careful methods are needed to separate
age from vintage e¤ects, that is, older and newer homes from those built before or after a
building code change.
       The potential importance of separately identifying age from vintage e¤ects raises ques-
tions about J&K’s research design and …ndings in Florida. Did the post-code change resi-
dences consume less energy simply because they were new? And, over time, will the energy
consumption of post-code change residences more closely resemble the pre-code change res-
idences as the di¤erences in age re‡ect less of a newness e¤ect? Indeed, Levinson (2014)
writes, “I suspect if we revisited those Gainesville homes today, 10 years later, we would …nd
no di¤erence in energy use for households built before and after the 2002 code change” (p.
8).
       This conjecture is the starting point for the present paper. I test whether J&K’s …ndings
still hold 11 years after the building code change. This is important for at least two reasons.
First, J&K’s approach provides a clear identi…cation strategy for estimating building code
e¤ects, and their results are some of the very few that …nd an e¤ect. Knowing whether the
results endure is therefore highly policy relevant. Second, regarding energy e¢ ciency invest-
ments more generally, a growing literature …nds that ex ante engineering studies signi…cantly
overestimate realized savings in ex post evaluations.3 Yet J&K’s study provides a counter-
point in the important context of building codes. Because they …nd that the engineering
forecasts are in line with the estimated savings, the question is whether or not the results
hold up.
       This paper also contributes with new insight about the e¤ect of building codes on energy
consumption over time and how future studies should approach ex post evaluations. The
results do not yield a simple “yes” or “no” to an enduring building code e¤ect. There are
di¤erences between the results for electricity and natural gas. While the initial estimates
of the building code e¤ect on electricity consumption diminish over time in ways consistent
with Levinson’s (2014) conjecture, the original results for natural gas underestimate the
longer-term energy savings. Nevertheless, the overall net e¤ect on energy consumption in
a combined measure of million British thermal units indicates a rather consistent level of
code-induced energy savings over the 11-year period. Together, the results highlight the
importance of not focusing exclusively on electricity consumption— as most studies have
done— and for waiting a few years after an energy code change to begin evaluation.

al. (2015).

2         Empirical Setting and Data Collection
Florida’s residential building code that took e¤ect in March 2002 included provisions to
strengthen the energy e¢ ciency of newly constructed houses. The new requirements focused
on energy used for space heating, space cooling, and water heating.4 To evaluate the e¤ect
of the code on residential energy consumption, J&K use monthly billing data on electricity
and natural gas consumption for residences in Gainesville, Florida. They focus on residences
constructed 3 years before and 3 years after the building code change. A unique feature
of their data set is that billing data were combined with information about the physical
characteristics of each residence, in addition to monthly weather data.
        Figure 1 illustrates the basic research design, the original data set, and the expanded
data set used in the present paper. Before code change residences (BCCRs) were built
in years 1999-2001, and after code change residences (ACCRs) were built in years 2003-
2005. Unless otherwise indicated, residences built in 2002 are excluded from the analysis
because they cannot be clearly identi…ed as having been subject to the before or after code
change requirements. J&K used billing data for the years 2004-2006 to test for di¤erences
in energy consumption between the before and after code change residences. In this paper,
I use an expanded data set that includes billing and weather data for the additional years
2007-2014, yielding 11 years total of energy consumption data after the building code change.
Importantly, the additional billing data is for the identical set of before and after code change
residences.
        Most of the expanded data are from the same sources. Billing data were obtained from
Gainesville-green.com, and weather data on monthly average cooling degree days (ACDD)
and average heating degree days (AHDD) were obtained for the weather station located at
    4
        See J&K for a detailed description of speci…c changes to the 2002 code and methods of compliance.

the Gainesville Regional Airport.5 The new data were merged with the original to form
a monthly panel from January 2004 through December 2014 for 2,239 residences, of which
there are 1,293 BCCRs and 946 ACCRs.6 The time-invariant variables on the physical
characteristics of each residence are square footage; number of bathrooms, bedrooms, and
‡oors; and indicators for central air-conditioning and a shingled roof.7
        The top panel of Figure 2 shows the average monthly electricity and natural gas consump-
tion for all residences from January 2004 through December 2014. The hotter months of the
year— May through October— are shaded in the …gure. There is a clear pattern where elec-
tricity consumption is higher during the summer months when demand for air-conditioning
is greater, and natural gas consumption is higher during winter months when demand for
heating is greater. The bottom panel of Figure 2 shows the patterns of monthly ACDD and
AHDD based on the standard 65 Fahrenheit threshold. Comparisons between the panels
of Figure 2 reveal how electricity demand closely follows cooling degree days, while natural
gas follows heating degree days.


3         Before and After Code Change Comparisons
3.1        Overall Di¤erences
The key estimates from J&K are regression-based, average di¤erences in electricity and
natural gas consumption between before and after code change residences. The preferred
speci…cation is
                               Yijt = CodeChangei + X i + vjt + "ijt                                         (1)

where the dependent variable represents consumption of either electricity (kilowatt-hours,
kWhs) or natural gas (therms) in residence i, zip-code j, and month t; CodeChangei is
an indicator for whether a residence was built after the code change; X i is a vector of the
observable residence characteristics; vjt represents zip-code by month-year …xed e¤ects; and
"ijt is an error term. The residence characteristics included in the model are the natural
    5
     One di¤erence in the source of data was necessary because natural gas data were not fully up to date
at Gainesville-green.com. I obtained natural gas billing data from October 2013 through December 2014
directly from the Gainesville Regional Utilities (GRU), which makes all billing data publicly available for
the two most recent years and ultimately provides the source for updating Gainesville-green.com.
   6
     Two areas of missing billing data are for the majority of residences between April 2007 and February
2008, and natural gas data for all residences in July 2014. Attempts to obtain the missing data from GRU
have been unsuccessful. In what follows, I include all of the available data in the analysis, but all results are
robust to dropping the months were there are missing data.
   7
     Summary statistics for residence characteristics remain unchanged from J&K’s original analysis (see
J&K’s Tables 1 and 2). The only di¤erence with a potentially meaningful magnitude and statistical signi…-
cance is that ACCRs are 4.5 percent smaller.

      Table 1 reproduces J&K’s results with the original 2004-2006 data for electricity and
natural gas in the …rst column. I report the coe¢ cients of interest, the ’s, along with the
mean monthly consumption and percentage di¤erence between before and after code change
residences. J&K found that ACCRs consumed 4.27 percent less electricity and 6.67 percent
less natural gas. The second column of Table 1 reports analogous results using the expanded
data set through 2014. With the longer span of data, the di¤erence in electricity consumption
between before and after code change residences is no longer statistically signi…cant and has
a point estimate very close to zero. Levinson’s (2014) conjecture is therefore consistent with
the data for electricity; however, the pattern is very di¤erent for natural gas. The di¤erence

    J&K also estimate models that include simply month-year …xed e¤ects. Unless otherwise indicated,
I focus throughout this paper on models with zip-code by month-year …xed e¤ects because they are less
restrictive and therefore preferred.

in natural gas consumption between before and after code change residences for the initial
2004-2006 period provides an underestimate of the di¤erence over the whole period through
2014. Using the full series of data, I …nd that ACCRs use 13.5 percent less natural gas on
average— double the initial estimate, and with a high level of statistical signi…cance.
      The bottom panel of Table 1 reports the results of new models that combine electricity
and natural gas into a single measure of overall energy consumption, quanti…ed as millions of
British Thermal Units (mmBtu).9 Combining electricity and natural gas into a single mea-
sure of energy consumption has the advantage of estimating an overall e¤ect that accounts
for potential substitution between energy sources. The focus on overall energy use is also
more appropriate for a performance-based code, such as Florida’s, where builders can trade
o¤ among di¤erent energy options. Because compliance is based on an overall rating, rather
  9
      The exact conversion is based on mmBtu = 0:0034121416      kW hs + 0:1    therms:



                                                     6
than conforming to speci…c requirements, there is no reason to expect that consumption of
both electricity and natural gas would necessarily decrease. These results indicate that for
the initial period of 2004-2006, ACCRs consume 5.14 percent less energy overall, and the
di¤erence is highly statistically signi…cant. Then, when using all the data through 2014, the
average di¤erence remains nearly identical, at 5.09 percent with the same level of statistical
signi…cance.


3.2       Di¤erences by E¤ective Year Built
The previous estimates are for overall di¤erences in energy consumption between BCCRs
and ACCRs. As shown in Figure 1, residences are partitioned into the two groups by their
e¤ective year built. The overall estimate can therefore be decomposed further into average
di¤erences by e¤ective year built. This is useful for examining potential di¤erences in energy
consumption by the age of residences within and between the two groups. Speci…cally, the
model is
                                Yijt = EY B i + X i + vjt + "ijt ,                                   (2)

which di¤ers from (1) because EY B i is a categorical variable for each e¤ective year built
from 1999 through 2005. J&K estimate the same model, and as in the original analysis, I
include residences built in 2002 as the omitted category.
       Figure (3) illustrates the estimated ’s graphically for electricity, natural gas, and com-
bined energy consumption. There is no trend in electricity consumption by e¤ective year
built. This result is consist with no observable, enduring e¤ect of the energy code change on
electricity consumption. With natural gas, however, the results are again di¤erent. While
there is no trend for the BCCRs, consumption is declining for the ACCRs. Yet it appears
that it may take a year or so for the decline to begin after the code change, raising the pos-
sibility that residences with an e¤ective year built in 2003 (and maybe some in 2004) might
still have been subject to the before code change requirements. The results for combined
energy consumption, which is e¤ectively a weighted average of electricity and natural gas,
more closely resemble those for natural gas. The important take away from the …gure is
that the trend in energy consumption appears the break around the time of the energy code
change, suggesting that the code change had an e¤ect on energy consumption, rather than
the estimates simply capturing an age e¤ect.10
  10
    J&K’s Figures 3 and 4 present results for electricity and natural gas using only the …rst 3 years of
consumption data. Those reported here di¤er by clearly showing no code change e¤ect on electricity, but a
more clear e¤ect on natural gas. J&K did not provide separate estimates for combined energy consumption.

3.3    Yearly Di¤erences
While the energy code change is associated with lower energy consumption overall, as mea-
sured with mmBtu, the results in Table 1 clearly indicate that something di¤erent is hap-
pening over time with electricity compared to natural gas. This motivates closer scrutiny of
how the estimated building code e¤ects di¤er over time. Accordingly, I estimate additional
models of the form

                          Yijt = CodeChangei         Y ear t + X i + vjt + "ijt             (3)

where Y ear t is a categorical variable for each year in the sample. Estimation of this model
yields distinct energy code e¤ects for each year, where the ’s capture di¤erences in the
annual averages between BCCRs and ACCRs. I estimate separate models for electricity,
natural gas, and mmBtu and report the results graphically.
   Figure 4 includes all three sets of results. The ’s are scaled as a percentage di¤erence from
average consumption for the corresponding energy measure and year. It is worth keeping

between before and after code change residences, with 95-percent con…dence intervals


in mind that when the estimates are based on annual di¤erences, there is less statistical
power, yet the trend in point estimates is of primary concern here. The results for electricity
illustrate an upward trend and clearly show how focusing on the …rst three years of data
provides an overestimate of the electricity savings.11 Indeed, ACCRs appear to consume
even more electricity in the more recent years, despite initially consuming less. But the trend
clearly di¤ers for natural gas. After the …rst two years, the ACCRs consume signi…cantly
less natural gas, with point estimates ranging between 10- and 20-percent less, and the
di¤erence endures over time. Finally, the results for overall energy consumption indicate
that ACCRs uniformly consume less energy, but the di¤erences vary from year to year, with
point estimates ranging between 2-percent and 10-percent less. In this case, we can see
visually how the short-run estimate over three years is actually quite close to the 11-year
estimate.
       What might explain the pattern of di¤erences for electricity and natural gas over the 11-
  11
    Recall that ACCRs are continuously entering the data set in 2004 and 2005. Estimates for these years
are therefore based on a smaller set of ACCRs with monthly observations not uniformly spread over months
of the year.


                                                                                     9
year period? With respect to electricity, Levinson (2014) posits that such a pattern might
arise because ACCRs are simply newer, and the newness e¤ect might dissipate over time.
Although better insulated when newly constructed, residences may quickly lose some of the
tight envelope that increases initial e¢ ciency. New heating and cooling systems are more
likely to have clean and e¢ cient air …lters that are subsequently changed less regularly. It
may also take the occupants of new residences time to fully move in and acquire the same
set of appliances as those in older residences.
   An alternative explanation for the electricity results is that, despite the small di¤erences
in the e¤ective year built between BCCRs and ACCRs, occupants of the ACCRs may be
di¤erent, perhaps younger and more likely to add members to a growing family. Younger
families may also have relatively increasing demands for goods that use electricity in ways
una¤ected by the building code (e.g., televisions and electronics). In this case, however, the
relative increase in electricity consumption in ACCRs over time would not mean the code
change had no e¤ect. Instead, it would raise questions about the identi…cation assumption
underlying the regression models for estimating average di¤erences, a topic to which I return
in Section 4.
   The natural gas results show a consistent pattern of energy savings from the building code
after the …rst two years. While there may be an initial adjustment period for natural gas
consumption in new residences, perhaps because new occupants are learning to use systems,
I prefer an explanation that simply discounts estimates for the …rst two years because all
ACCRs are not yet fully included in the data set. That natural gas shows a consistent energy
code savings beginning in 2006 is surely consistent and plausible given the focus of the code
change on space and water heating, the main drivers of natural gas consumption other than
cooking.


3.4    Monthly Di¤erences
A fourth set of models examines di¤erences in electricity and natural gas consumption over
months of the year. J&K conducted this analysis to show that ACCRs consumed less elec-
tricity in the summer and less natural gas in the winter, because of lower energy demand
for air-conditioning and heating, respectively. Here I examine the patterns of monthly con-
sumption with models of the form

                  Yijt = CodeChangei          M ontht + X i + vjt + "ijt ,                 (4)

where M ontht is a categorical variable for month of the year. In this case, the ’s provide
estimates of the di¤erences in consumption between before and after code change residences

                                              10
for each month of the year.
       Figure 5 illustrates the results graphically for electricity and natural gas.12 I report results
using the original 2004-2006 data and the full set of data through 2014. The top panel shows
the pattern for electricity described by J&K: using data three years after the code change,
there are no di¤erences in electricity consumption between before and after code change
residences during the colder and winter months, but the ACCRs consume less electricity
during the hotter and summer months when demand for air-conditioning is greater.13 When
using all the data through 2014, the pro…le of electricity consumption remains the same, yet
the di¤erence between before and after code change residences tends to be greater across all
months of the year. We have already established in Figure 4 that electricity consumption
is increasing over time in the ACCRs compared to the BCCRs, and Figure 5 shows that
the increase occurs because of greater baseline demand rather than a seasonal e¤ect.14 The
natural gas results in the bottom panel reveal lower consumption of natural gas in ACCRs
in the colder and winter months, indicating greater e¢ ciency with heating. With natural
gas, however, there does not appear to be an increasing or decreasing trend over months of
the year when using the full set of data, and this is consistent with the ACCRs consuming
uniformly less natural gas in Figure 4.


4        Di¤erences in Weather Responsiveness
An advantage of the analysis in the previous section is that it yields an estimate of the
average e¤ect of the building code change on residential energy consumption. A disadvan-
tage of the approach is potential vulnerability to omitted variable bias. If there is some
unobserved variable that is correlated with energy consumption and the BCCR-ACCR cat-
egorization, for reasons unrelated to the building code change, then the estimates could
be biased. As discussed previously, examples include di¤erences in families that purchased
homes in Gainesville a few years later, and di¤erences in the stock of appliances in newer
residences. Although observable, the age versus vintage e¤ects could still pose problems for
similar reasons because they are not separately identi…ed in the previous estimation strategy.
This is e¤ectively Levinson’s (2014) critique.
  12
      I do not report the results for mmBtu because the reason for estimating monthly di¤erences is to gain
insight into the seasonal patterns of consumption for the original sources of energy demand, electricity and
natural gas. But, of course, similarly formatted results for mmBtu are available upon request.
   13
      The results presented here are based on models with zip-code by month-year …xed e¤ects rather than
simply month-year …xed e¤ects as shown in J&K’s Figures 1 and 2.
   14
      Although I do not …nd evidence for it here, a seasonal e¤ect of comparatively increasing demand for
electricity in the summer by ACCRs would be consistent with an air-conditioning rebound e¤ect.

con…dence intervals


       To address these concerns, I estimate models to test for di¤erences in the way BCCRs and
ACCRs adjust energy consumption in response to weather shocks. The approach is essen-
tially a di¤erence-in-di¤erences strategy that takes account of unobservable, time-invariant
heterogeneity with the inclusion of residence …xed e¤ects. While J&K estimate similarly
speci…ed …xed e¤ects models for electricity and natural gas consumption separately, I focus
here on the combined measure of mmBtu.15 The combined measure is preferable because,
as mentioned previously, it yields an overall e¤ect that accounts for potential substitution
between electricity and natural gas.
  15
    Though not reported here, I also estimated separate models for electricity and natural gas. The speci-
…cations are identical to those in J&K’s analysis but with the expanded data set through 2014. The main
results continue to hold, whereby ACCRs are less responsive in electricity due to ACDD and less responsive
in natural gas due to AHDD. These results are available upon request.




                                                                          12
          The …rst model takes the form

                Yit =     CodeChangei            [ACDDt ; AHDDt ] + [ACDDt ; AHDDt ]                         (5)
                         +M ontht + Y ear t +         i   + "it ;

where the dependent variable is monthly mmBtu consumption, the code change indicator is
interacted with the weather variables, M ontht is a set of month of year dummies, Y ear t
is a set of year dummies, and          i   is a residence …xed e¤ect. The model provides estimates of
the how temperature variation a¤ects monthly energy consumption in the BCCRs (the s),
and how the estimates di¤er in the ACCRs (the s).
          Two other speci…cations provides alternative estimates of the di¤erence-in-di¤erences—
that is, the s— but control for the direct weather e¤ects more ‡exibly. One speci…cation
is
                      Yit = CodeChangei            [ACDDt ; AHDDt ] + vt +                i   + "it ;        (6)

where vt represents month-year …xed e¤ects. Note that the weather variables do not enter
on their own because with one weather station, they are not separately identi…ed from the
month-year …xed e¤ects. The other speci…cation is the same expect for the inclusion of
zip-code by month-year …xed e¤ects, vjt , as speci…ed in previous models.
          Table 2 reports the results of all three models using all of the data through 2014. The
results of speci…cation (5), reported in the …rst column, show the unsurprising result that
greater ACDD and AHDD in a month increases energy consumption. This is re‡ected in the
positive and statistically signi…cant estimates of                  ACDD   and   AHDD ,   as well as a the linear
combinations         ACDD   +   ACDD   and     AHDD   +     AHDD .    The results also show that the before
and after code change residences respond di¤erently, as indicated by the negative and statis-
tically signi…cant estimates of        ACDD     and   AHDD .        Speci…cally, the ACCRs increase energy
consumption by less than the BCCRs, and this is consistent with the ACCRs being more
energy e¢ cient. The same results hold with similar magnitudes and statistical signi…cance
for the more ‡exible models in columns (2) and (3).16
          To get a sense for the magnitude of how much BCCRs and ACCRs di¤er in their re-
sponsiveness, it is useful to focus on the results in column (1). Speci…cally, the ratios of
     16
     Studying California residences over decades, Chong (2012) and Levinson (2014) …nd evidence that more
recently constructed houses subject to more stringent building codes increase electricity consumption more
in response to hotter weather. Chong (2012) explains his results for Riverside, California as increased air-
conditioning ownership having outweighed other energy-saving impacts. While Levinson (2014) is able to
control for air-conditioning ownership over a broader geographic area, the same explanation could under-
lie his results because his models control for average air-conditioning e¤ects without allowing electricity
responsiveness to vary di¤erently among residences with and without air-conditioning.

coe¢ cients     ACDD = ACDD     =     0:123 and     AHDD = AHDD       =     0:292 have useful interpreta-
tions.17 The …rst implies that a unit increase in the monthly ACDD causes the ACCRs to
increase energy consumption by 12 percent less on average than the BCCRs. The second
implies that a unit increase in the monthly AHDD causes the ACCRs to increase energy
consumption by 29 percent less on average than the BCCRs. These magnitudes suggest
that the building code change had a substantial e¤ect on tempering energy consumption in
response to more extreme temperatures.
       Because we have seen important di¤erences in how the building code a¤ects energy con-
sumption over time, it is worth considering how the estimated di¤erences in responsiveness
to weather shocks might change over time. The …nal model that I estimate expands on
speci…cation (5) as follows:

            Yit =      CodeChangei            [ACDDt ; AHDDt ]          Y ear t                                (7)
                     + [ACDDt ; AHDDt ]            Y ear t + M ontht + Y ear t +           i   + "it ;

where Y ear t is interacted with the weather variables to estimate the coe¢ cients of interest
separately for each year. Then, after estimating the model, I derive the ratio                       kt = kt   for
k = ACDD; AHDD and t = 2004:::2014 along the the 95-percent con…dence intervals (see
footnote 17 for details) and report the results graphically in Figure 6.
       Despite the very di¤erent empirical strategy from that in Section 3, there is a now
familiar pattern to the results. Soon after the building code change, ACCRs increase energy
consumption signi…cantly less is response to more ACDD, and this suggests greater e¢ ciency
with air-conditioning.18 But the di¤erence between before and after code change residences
appears to dissipate over time, until there is no evidence of an energy code a¤ect about
8 years later. This pattern is clearly consistent with a relative newness e¤ect in ACCRs
that is not enduring. In contrast, the di¤erence in responsiveness to AHDD appears roughly
constant over the 11 years and is always statistically di¤erent from zero, with point estimates
ranging between 20 and 30 percent. This result suggests that the energy code had real e¤ects
on the e¢ ciency of residences for heating, and this tracks the previous …ndings for natural
gas.
  17
     These ratios are nonlinear combinations of two coe¢ cients. Test statistics are derived using the delta
method, and both ratios are statistically di¤erent from zero at the 99-percent level. The 95-percent con…dence
intervals for the ACDD and AHDD ratios are (-0.186, -0.059) and (-0.340, -0.243), respectively.
  18
     The large con…dence interval for the point estimate in 2007 is most likely do to having fewer observations
to estimate an e¤ect for that year. Recall the missing data mentioned in footnote 6.

5     Conclusion
This paper considers the question of whether building energy codes actually save energy.
Using more than a decade’s worth of billing data for residences in Gainesville, Florida, the
answer is “yes,”but the results di¤er for electricity and natural gas. Despite what appears to
be an initial code change e¤ect that reduces electricity consumption, the di¤erence between
before and after code change residences disappears after a few years. In contrast, the code
change has a signi…cant and enduring e¤ect on natural gas consumption, causing a reduction
of more than 10 percent. Both the electricity and natural gas results are consistent with
the way before and after code change residences respond to weather shocks. In particular,
ACCRs increase natural gas consumption by nearly 30 percent less than BCCRs in response
to marginally colder weather.
    Comparison of results from the present paper to those in J&K’s original study yields
two important methodological insights. First, future studies that take advantage of the
discontinuity design of comparing before and after code change residences should wait several


                                                                           16
years after the code change before using billing data for analysis. The reason appears to be
Levinson’s (2014) critique about confounding age and vintage e¤ects. Second, evaluation of
building codes should not focus exclusively on electricity consumption, which has been the
case in most previous studies. Energy codes seek to improve the e¢ ciency of space heating,
space cooling, and water heating. While natural gas is used primarily for these purposes, a
growing share of residential electricity consumption is for others uses, including appliances,
electronics, and televisions.
   Finally, the results of this study have broader implications for the evaluation of energy
e¢ ciency policies. While a growing number of studies …nd that engineering forecasts sig-
ni…cantly overestimate realized savings of e¢ ciency investments, this does not appear to be
the case with Florida’s building code. Forecasts predicted that the 2002 code change would
translate into a 2-percent increase in residential energy e¢ ciency. The revised estimate here
is very close to the forecast: a 2.9-percent savings in overall energy use. Nevertheless, this
savings does not necessarily imply that building codes are an e¢ cient or even desirable pol-
icy. Following the same approach outlined by J&K, the revised estimates imply social and
private payback rates of about 10 and 16 years (up from 4 to 6), respectively. Whether
Florida homeowners would …nd this private payback rate desirable, and how the social net
bene…ts from building codes might compare to other policy instruments to promote energy
e¢ ciency are open and important questions for future research.
