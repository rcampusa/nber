                                            ABSTRACT

Models with constant-elasticity of substitution (CES) preferences are commonly employed in the
international trade literature because they provide a tractable way to handle product differentiation
in general equilibrium. However this tractability comes at the cost of generating a set of counter-
factual predictions regarding cross-country variation in export and import variety, output per variety,
and prices. We examine whether a generalized version of Lancaster's 'ideal variety' model can better
match facts. In this model, entry causes crowding in variety space, so that the marginal utility of new
varieties falls as market size grows. Crowding is partially offset by income effects, as richer
consumers will pay more for varieties closer matched to their ideal types. We show theoretically and
confirm empirically that declining marginal utility of new varieties results in: a higher own-price
elasticity of demand (and lower prices) in large countries and a lower own-price elasticity of demand
(and higher prices) in rich countries. Model predictions about cross-country differences in the
number and size of establishments are also empirically confirmed.

I. Introduction
        Beginning with Krugman (1979, 1980), the Dixit-Stiglitz (1977) framework of product

differentiation has become a workhorse of the international trade literature. A short list of

applications includes the literatures on intra-industry and north-north trade, economic geography,

regional integration, gravity modeling of trade flows, and multinational firms.

        The model is widely used because it is highly tractable. In its most commonly used form

the model assumes constant elasticity of substitution (CES) demand, which has several important

features. Varieties are not assigned to any particular “address” and product space is effectively

infinite. As a consequence, differentiated varieties may exhibit a high or low degree of

substitutability, but this is invariant to the number of products in the market. Further, consumers

“love” variety, in the sense that increased variety improves welfare. Curiously, the marginal

utility consumers derive from new variety is not declining in entry, whether new entrants

represent the 20th or 200th variety on the market.

        These assumptions carry pronounced normative implications. Trade economists are often

bemused that the gains from trade in neoclassical models are small. However, as Romer (1994)

demonstrates in a simple calibration, trade liberalization that increases the number of traded

varieties can be a source of much larger welfare gains.1 In a related empirical exercise, Feenstra

(1994) shows that under a maintained hypothesis of CES demand, variety-corrected price indices

for a set of US imports have fallen much lower than the uncorrected indices would seem to

indicate.2

        In sum, the CES model’s core assumptions yield useful tractability, and the model’s

predictions about variety expansion imply tremendous welfare gains from trade in markets large

and small. But are the central empirical predictions of this structure correct? Consider a few

stark implications of the model that can be shown by comparing, ceteris paribus, a large and a

small closed economy. The larger country will enjoy entry of new varieties at a rate proportional

to its country size. Because this entry does not “crowd” variety space, the own-price (and cross-

price) elasticity of demand is the same as in the small country. This implies that prices, which

depend only on marginal cost and the demand elasticity, are the same in the two markets. It also

implies that the quantity per variety is the same in the two markets: fixed costs of entry are the

same in the two markets, and markups are the same, so the same quantity per variety clears zero-

profit conditions in both places. These predictions are not incidental. It is precisely this strong

symmetry in prices and quantities, and the strict proportionality between number of varieties and

market size which makes these models so tractable and widely-employed.

         Hummels and Klenow (2002) use cross-country data to examine how the variety and

quantity per variety of imports co-vary with market size. They show that, while the number of

imported varieties is greater in larger markets, variety differences are less than proportional to

market size. That is, larger countries import more varieties, but also import higher quantity per

variety.3

        What could cause a less than proportional expansion of import varieties with respect to

market size? Two candidates come to mind. Perhaps there are fixed costs of importing as

modeled in Romer (1994), but these are rising in market size so that the cost of new varieties at

the margin is higher for larger markets as in Klenow-Rodriguez Clare (1997). Alternatively, it

may be that goods become more substitutable as more varieties enter the market, so that the

marginal benefit of new varieties falls with market size. We emphasize the latter channel,


3
 Hummels and Klenow (2002,2005) found a similar pattern for exports: variety and quantity per variety expands
with exporter size, but less than proportionally. We focus on cross-importer facts in this paper.


                                                       2
examining the empirical implications of a generalized ‘ideal variety’ model.

       Lancaster (1979) originally developed a model of trade in ideal varieties in which variety

space is finite, and varieties have unique addresses in product space. This means that entry

causes “crowding” – goods become more substitutable as more enter the market so that the own

price elasticity of demand increases with market size. This has important implications for prices,

the average size of firms and the rate of variety expansion.

       Again consider a ceteris paribus comparison of a large and small country. In the large

country, entry drives up the price elasticity of demand, leading to lower markups. Since firms in

the large market must be able to recoup their fixed costs of entry despite lower markups, they

must sell a larger quantity. This, in turn, implies that new variety expansion will be increasing in

market size, but less than proportionally.

       We generalize the preferences in the ideal variety framework. Lancaster (1979) assumes

that the equilibrium choice of variety is independent of consumption quantities, so that

consumers get no closer to their ideal regardless of expenditures. We allow the opportunity cost

of the ideal variety to depend on consumers’ individual consumption levels. When incomes rise,

consumers increase the quantity consumed, but also place greater value on proximity to the ideal

variety. The price elasticity of demand drops and prices rise. In equilibrium, the market

responds by supplying more varieties, with lower output per variety. Essentially, economies of

scale forsaken are compensated for by the higher markups that consumers are now willing to

pay.

       We examine, and confirm, these implications in three exercises focusing on cross-country

variation in average firm size, prices of traded goods, and the own-price elasticity of demand.

First, we use the UNIDO Industrial Statistics Database to measure the average value added per




                                                 3
firm for 152 3-digit ISIC sectors in 54 countries from 1990-2000. Controlling for country and

industry effects so that we exploit purely time series variation, we show that average firm size

co-varies positively with GDP, and negatively with GDP per worker (conditioning on GDP).

This result is robust to alternative measures of firm and market size.

       Next, we examine the model’s predictions for prices. We use Eurostats trade data for

1990-2003 that reports bilateral export prices for 11 EU exporters selling to all importers world-

wide in roughly 11,000 products. This variation allows us to relate over-time changes in prices

for an importer-exporter-product to changes in importer characteristics. We find that price

changes co-vary negatively with GDP growth and co-vary positively with growth in GDP per

capita (conditioning on GDP growth), consistent with model predictions.

       Finally, we use the TRAINS database on bilateral trade and trade costs to identify the

own-price elasticity of demand and examine its co-variation with importer characteristics. We

find that the own-price elasticity of demand is increasing in importer GDP and decreasing in

importer GDP per capita, consistent with model predictions. The data reveal substantial

variation in these elasticities across importers.

       This paper relates, and adds to, several literatures. First, we contribute to a relatively new

but growing literature providing empirical evidence on models of product differentiation in trade.

Most of these papers employ cross-exporter facts to understand Armington v. Krugman style

horizontal differentiation as in Head and Ries (2001) and Acemoglu and Ventura (2002), or the

importance of quality differentiation as in Schott (2003), Hallak (2004), and Hummels and Skiba

(2004), or some combination of the two, as in Hummels and Klenow (2005). We emphasize

cross-importer facts, and depart from the CES utility framework that dominates this literature.

       Second, we contribute to a literature in which market entry affects the elasticity of




                                                    4
demand facing a firm. Most of the trade theory literature has emphasized oligopoly and

homogeneous goods as in Brander and Krugman (1982). The more sparse empirical literature

has focused on plausibly homogeneous goods within a single country, such as the markets for

gasoline, Barron, Taylor, Umbeck (2005) and concrete, Syverson (2004). In contrast, our model

emphasizes free-entry monopolistic competition in a general equilibrium with multiple countries

and differentiated goods. The model’s predictions for market size and the elasticity of demand

are similar to quadratic utility models as in Ottaviano and Thisse (1999). However, we also

allow for income effects operating through an intensity of preference for the ideal variety that

can potentially counteract pure market size effects.4 These income effects significantly improve

our ability to fit the model to the data.

         Finally, this paper adds to the literature on price variation across markets. The literature

on Balassa-Samuelson effects emphasizes the importance of nontraded good prices in explaining

why price levels are higher in richer countries. We provide a theoretical explanation and

empirical evidence supporting the idea that prices of traded goods are also higher in richer

countries.

         The literature on pricing-to-market (see Goldberg and Knetter 1997 for an extensive

review) has shown that the same goods are priced with different markups and thus have different

price elasticities of demand across importing markets. We differ from, and add to, this literature

in two ways. First, we show how markups systematically vary across importers depending on

market characteristics. Second, we provide a complementary explanation for the variation in

markups. The pricing-to-market literature focuses on movements along the same, non-CES,

demand curves (e.g., Feenstra 1989, Knetter 1993) so that variation in quantities caused by tariff


4
 Perloff and Salop (1985) also include preference intensity but do not link it explicitly to observable characteristics
of consumers, or consider a trading equilibrium.


                                                           5
or exchange rate shocks yields variation in the elasticity of demand. We show that variation in

market characteristics (size, income per capita), yields different demand curves and thus different

price elasticities of demand across countries.

         The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II uses a simplified closed

economy setting to motivate the generalization of Lancaster compensation function and to

concentrate on the comparative statics in the model with a single differentiated product.

Appendix 2 demonstrates that the key empirical predictions can also be derived in an open

economy model that nests the generalized ideal variety framework into a Ricardian continuum

model in the manner of Dornbusch-Fischer-Samuelson (1977). Sections III-V provide empirical

examinations of model implications for average firm sizes, prices, and the own-price elasticity of

demand. Section VI concludes.



II. Model

A. Demand Functions

       Preferences of a consumer are defined over a homogeneous numeraire product q0 , and a

differentiated product q , which is defined by a continuum of varieties indexed by ω ∈ Ω :

                                           µ
(1)     U = q01− µ u ( qω | ω ∈ Ω )                                              0 < µ < 1,

where subutility u ( qω | ω ∈ Ω ) is defined later in this section. The budget constraint is:


(2)     q0 + ∫       qω pω = I ,
               ω∈Ω


where pω are the prices of the varieties being produced and I is income in terms of the

numeraire.

       Varieties can be distinguished by a single attribute. We assume that all varieties can be



                                                   6
represented by points on the circumference of a circle, with the circumference being of unit

length.

          Each point of the circumference represents a different variety. Each consumer has his

most preferred type, which we call his ‘ideal’ variety, and which we denote as ω . It is ideal in

the sense that given a choice between equal amounts of his ideal variety ω and any other variety

ω consumer will always choose ω . Moreover, utility is decreasing in distance from ω : the

further is the product from the ideal variety the less preferable it is for the consumer. These

assumptions are usually incorporated in the formal model with a help of Lancaster’s

compensation function h ( vω ,ω ) , defined for 0 ≤ vω ,ω ≤ 1 . Lancaster’s compensation function is

defined such that the consumer is indifferent between q units of his ideal variety ω and

h ( vω ,ω ) q units of some other variety ω , where vω ,ω is the shortest arc distance between ω and

ω . It is assumed that:

(3)       h ( 0 ) = 1 , h ' ( 0 ) = 0 , and h ' ( vω ,ω ) > 0 , h '' ( vω ,ω ) > 0 for vω ,ω > 0 .

          The subutility of variety ω for consumer whose ideal variety is ω is usually assumed to

have the following separable form (e.g., Lancaster 1979, 1984, Helpman and Krugman 1985):

                                                                             qω
                                                    u ( qω , ω , ω ) =
                                                                          h ( vω ,ω )

          The subutility function, which includes all varieties ω ∈ Ω , can then be formulated as

                                  q              
(4)       u ( qω | ω ∈ Ω ) = max        ω
                                                  
                                  h ( vω ,ω ) 
                             ω∈Ω



          Given the weak separability of the utility function (1), we can use a two-stage budgeting

procedure. From the second stage we find that the consumer spends µ I on the differentiated




                                                                  7
product. In the first stage, we can maximize the subutility subject to the budget constraint, µ I ,

and given the prices of differentiated varieties, pω . The solution to this problem is:

                  µI
         qω ' =          ,    qω = 0           for ω ≠ ω ',
(5)               pω '
         where ω ' = arg min  pω h ( vω ,ω ) | ω ∈ Ω  .

        In (5), the utility maximizing variety is independent of expenditures. For example,

imagine that the consumer’s ideal beverage is apple juice, the price of which is five times higher

                                                                                          µI
than the price of water: p AJ = 5 pW . Equation (5) suggests that the consumer will buy         units
                                                                                           pW

of water if 5 > h ( vW , AJ ) . This answer holds whether income allows him to buy five cups or fifty

gallons of water.

        Consider a more general formulation in which the strength of preference for the ideal

variety depends on quantities consumed. Formally, we define a generalized compensation

function, h ( qω , vω ,ω ; γ ) , having the following properties:

(6)      h2 ( qω , vω ,ω ; γ ) > 0 and h22 ( qω , vω ,ω ; γ ) > 0 for vω ,ω > 0

( 7)     h ( qω , 0; γ ) = 1 , h2 ( qω , 0; γ ) = 0

(8)      h ( 0, vω ,ω ) = 1 , h12 ( qω , vω ,ω ; γ ) > 0 for qω , γ , vω ,ω > 0

(9)      h ( qω , vω ,ω ;0 ) = h ( vω ,ω )

where the parameter γ ≥ 0 defines the degree to which the consumer is “finicky”, or willing to

forego consumption to get closer to the ideal.

        The standard properties associated with the distance from the ideal variety are

represented by (6) and ( 7). By (8) we assume that the consumer is not finicky at all at a zero



                                                                  8
consumption level, but when his consumption of a differentiated good increases he becomes

increasingly finicky. Finally, (9) nests Lancaster’s compensation function: if γ = 0 , the

compensation function does not depend on consumption volumes. An additional condition needs

to be introduced to address the fact that in the generalized compensation function, the quantity of

the chosen variety appears both in the nominator and in the denominator of the subutility

function (4). Consequently, while the quantity consumed increases, the cost of being distanced

from the ideal variety might increase so fast that it outweighs utility gains from the higher

consumption level of this variety. This would contradict the standard assumption of the non-

decreasing (in quantity) utility function. It is easy to show that the necessary and sufficient

condition for utility to be increasing in the quantity consumed is:

(10)      h ( qω , vω ,ω ; γ ) − qω h1 ( qω , vω ,ω ; γ ) > 0               ∀ω ∈ Ω

The difference between the Lancaster and generalized compensation functions is illustrated by

Figure 1.

          In order to derive a closed form solution of the model, we chose a specific functional

form of the generalized compensation function:

(11)      h ( qωγ , vω ,ω ) = 1 + qωγ vωβ ,ω                              β > 1, 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1,

          It is easy to verify that the restrictions imposed on the parameters β and γ in (11) are

necessary and sufficient for properties (6) – (10) to hold. The corresponding subutility function

is then

                                      qω                 
(12)      u ( qω | ω ∈ Ω ) = max                          .
                             ω∈Ω  1 + q γ v β
                                       ω ω ,ω            

          Now we can apply the two-stage budgeting procedure in order to maximize (1) subject to

(2) using a subutility function defined by (12). Given that the upper-case utility function is


                                                                  9
Cobb-Douglas, the consumption of the homogeneous good and expenditure on the chosen

differentiated varieties are:

(13)    q0 = (1 − µ ) I ,


(14)    ∫ω∈Ω
               qω pω = µ I .

        Consumption of a differentiated variety ω ' is found by maximizing the subutility (12)

subject to budget constraint (14):

                 µI
        qω ' =          ,   qω = 0   for ω ≠ ω '
(15)             pω '
        where ω ' = arg min  pω (1 + qωγ vωβ ,ω ) | ω ∈ Ω  .




B. Market Equilibrium

        Each individual is endowed with z efficient units of labor, which he supplies

inelastically in a perfectly competitive labor market. The homogeneous good is produced with

constant returns to scale with labor requirement equal to one. Consequently, the wage is equal to

one in terms of the numeraire and an individual’s income is equal to his labor endowment:

(16)    I = z.

        Varieties of the differentiated product are produced by monopolistically competitive

firms, with identical technology. Production requires a fixed number of workers α , payable in

each period that the variety is produced, and marginal labor requirement c . Given that the wage

equals one, α and c are also interpreted as fixed and marginal costs.

        The firms play a two-stage non-cooperative game under the assumption of perfect

information. Each firm chooses a variety in the first stage and a price in the second stage. Each

variety is produced by one firm, and firms are free to enter and exit. Finally, consumer



                                                        10
preferences for ideal variety are uniformly distributed over the unit length circumference of the

circle and the population density on the circumference is equal to L .

         Under these assumptions, it is possible to show that all existing equilibria are zero-profit

Nash equilibria. Moreover, there will exist symmetric Nash equilibria characterized by identical

prices and output levels for the individual firms. In these equilibria, the specification of the

varieties produced will be evenly spaced along the spectrum.5 In the following analysis, we will

focus exclusively on such symmetric equilibria in which all varieties are equally priced and

equally distributed on the circumference of the circle.

         Next we solve for aggregate demand and the price elasticity of demand for variety ω .

The solution to this problem is described by Lancaster (1984) and Helpman and Krugman

(1985), and for completeness is included in Appendix 1. In the symmetric equilibrium, in which

the prices of all varieties are the same and all varieties are equally distanced from each other, the

demand for any produced variety ω ∈ Ω is:

               d µ zL
(17)     Q=           ,
                  p

where d is the shortest arc distance between any two available varieties, and p is the price of

each available variety. The corresponding price elasticity of demand is:

                             γ       β
                   1  p   2  1− γ
(18)     ε = 1+              +    > 1.
                  2β  µ z   d  2β

         Knowing the cost structure and the price elasticity of demand, we can find the profit-

 The proof of existence and the detailed characterization of equilibria is provided by Lancaster (1979). An
extension of Lancaster’s proof for the form of the utility function in (12) is available upon request from the authors.


                                                            11
Knowing the expenditure on each product from (14), and the size of firms from (19), we can find

the equilibrium number of firms:

              µ zL
(20)     n=        .
              αε

The circumference length is equal to one, so the distance between the closest varieties is:

              1 αε
(21)     d=    =     .
              n µ zL

Now we can rewrite (18) using (19)–(21):
                                     γ
                 1      cε             2µ zL  β 1 − γ

                2β      µ z ( ε − 1)    αε       2 β

         The equilibrium value of the price elasticity of demand is unique, since the LHS of (22)

is increasing in ε , while the RHS is decreasing in ε . From (19) and (20) we can show that the

equilibrium price, quantity per variety, and number of varieties are also unique.



C. Comparative Statics

         We examine changes in population density L and the individual labor endowment z , and

their effect on the equilibrium price elasticity of demand, price, output per variety, and the

number of varieties. By implicit derivation of (22) we get

                                  γ                                         −1
         ∂ε L   µ z ( ε − 1)                                         
                                                     −β
                                          2µ zL               γ
(23)         = 2ε                                    +           + 1 .
         ∂L ε        cε                αε              β ( ε − 1) 
                                                                       

The resulting expression is strictly positive and strictly less than one6; that is, the price elasticity

of demand is increasing in population density at a less than proportional rate.

         To explain this result we follow Lancaster (1979) in defining the market width of variety
6
  All addends in curly brackets are strictly positive and include the value 1, which makes their sum strictly greater
than 1. The inverse of this sum is then between zero and one.


                                                             12
ω as the portion of the total spectrum of consumers buying this variety rather than some other

variety. The extreme values of market width in this model are one and zero, which approximate

pure monopoly and perfect competition. An increase in L increases purchasing power on each

interval of the spectrum, and thus each firm needs a smaller interval to get the same total

revenue. As a result, in the new zero-profit equilibrium, the market width for each produced

variety shrinks. Consequently, the distance between the neighboring varieties decreases, thus

making consumers more sensitive to the variation in price.

       Equation (19) indicates that the increase in the price elasticity of demand leads to a

decrease in the equilibrium price per variety, and an increase in the output per variety. The

intuition is straightforward. Entry crowds variety space, driving up ε and lowering the markups

firms can charge. Since prices are lower each firm must sell a higher quantity to break even.

Consequently, growth in firm size uses resources that would otherwise have been used to expand

variety; the number of varieties increases less than proportionally with labor force growth. This

can also be seen in equation (20) which shows that a rising population leads directly to an

increase in the number of varieties that is partially offset by the induced rise in ε .

       These predictions are summarized in the last column of Table 1. The contrast with the

standard constant elasticity model, as in Krugman (1980), is clear. If the price elasticity of

demand is independent of market size, then prices and output per variety are also independent of

market size, and the elasticity of n with respect to market size is one.

       Next we examine changes in the individual labor endowment z , which can be interpreted

both as an increase in productivity and in income per capita. By implicit derivation of (22) we

can find:




                                                  13
                                                   γ                                    −1
                                  µ z ( ε − 1)   2 µ zL                       
                                                                  −β
        ∂ε z  γ                                                            γ
            = 1 −              2ε                               +          + 1 ,

(24)                                                                                
             ∂ε z
        0<        < 1.
             ∂z ε

        An increase in z has two effects, raising ε through an increase in the aggregate labor

endowment, zL , and lowering ε by raising income per worker. The effect on the aggregate

labor endowment is captured by the inverse portion of (24). By comparing this expression with

(23), we see that this channel yields the same changes in all variables of interest as an increase in

population density.

        The effect of rising income per worker, holding fixed aggregate output, is captured by the

             −γ
                  {...}
                          −1
expression                     in (24). Conceptually, compare two countries with the same GDP but
             β

differing labor productivity. Let country A have a smaller population and more productive (and

therefore richer) workers than Country B. Then country A has a lower ε , higher prices, more

firms, and lower output per firm.

        This result is interesting because it indicates that, ceteris paribus, an identical variety

produced using the same technology in both poor and rich countries will be priced higher in the

rich country. As income rises, consumers place greater value on proximity to the ideal variety

and are willing to pay a higher price for a larger degree of diversification. The market responds

by supplying more varieties, even though economies of scale are utilized to a lesser degree for

produced varieties.

        These predictions are summarized in Table 1. Here, the contrast with the original

Lancaster (1970) model is instructive. Since the Lancaster model is a special case of the

generalized model, the predictions of the Lancaster model can be easily obtained from (23) and



                                                             14
(24) by setting γ equal to zero. Comparative statics with respect to market size are similar7, but

the income effect is operative only in the generalized model. In Lancaster, an increase in worker

productivity has no affect on model outcomes after controlling for market size.



D. Open economy

    To this point, we have focused on closed economy comparative statics. In the closed

economy, our predictions for the number of varieties, quantity per variety, price elasticity, and

prices refer to domestic output, which is also domestic consumption. Of these, data on the

number of firms and output per firm are available from domestic data for many countries, and we

test model predictions in section III. Unfortunately cross-country domestic data on prices and

price elasticities are not available in sufficient detail for many countries to test the model. Trade

data are better in this regard, but to use them we must re-interpret the model in an open economy

context. This extension is derived in detail in Appendix 2, and described briefly here.

    Solving the ideal variety model required a symmetric equilibrium in which varieties on a

circle are equally spaced and have the same prices. A trivial way to extend the model to the open

economy is to maintain this symmetry for foreign and domestic firms. That is, foreign varieties

pay some fixed cost to enter the market that is identical to that of domestic firms, and that the

delivered marginal cost of foreign varieties (inclusive of production, tariffs or other trade costs)

matches domestic production costs.

    We rely on a more general solution that has been employed previously in the literature in a

two-country setting by Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson (1977), and in a multi-country setting

by Eaton and Kortum (2002). In these models there is a continuum of homogeneous goods


7
 That is, the signs on the market size comparative statics are the same for the Lancaster and generalized ideal
variety models are the same, but magnitudes differ.


                                                         15
arranged according to strength of comparative advantage. At any point on the continuum we can

compare the price of domestic goods to the delivered price of foreign goods and discern whether

the products will be imported, exported, or neither.

   We show in Appendix 2 that it is possible to nest the ideal variety framework into the

continuum; each good is no longer a single point on the continuum, it is now a circle. The key

features of the equilibrium are that, as in Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson and Eaton and

Kortum, each country will buy goods on a particular circle from only one supplier. This ensures

that all varieties in a particular product space are symmetric. We show that all our model

predictions from the closed economy case extend to the open economy case, provided that we

focus on the import or non-traded segments of the goods continuum. In this case, our

comparative statics in equations (23) and (24) now describe variation in the price elasticity of

demand facing a common exporter when selling to importers who vary in market size (GDP) and

per capita income (conditional on market size). The corresponding predictions for number of

varieties, quantity per variety, and prices go through as in the closed economy case.



III. Empirics – The Number and Average Size of Firms

       In this section we examine model predictions regarding the number and size of firms

within a country. We can think of this either as a test of the closed economy version of the

model, or as a test of the open economy version when focusing only on the non-traded segments

of the goods continuum. In both cases, output characteristics within a country are determined by

demand characteristics in that country not the world as a whole. Simply, the model predicts that

the number of firms expands less than proportionally with market size so that the average size of

firms is rising in market size. Conditioning on market size, growth in income per capita leads




                                                16
consumers to prefer a closer match to their ideal types which increases the number of firms, and

lowers their average size.

        To examine these predictions we employ data from the UNIDO Industrial Statistics

Database. We have data on the number of establishments, total employment, value added, and

gross output by 152 ISIC 3-digit industries for 54 countries from 1990-2000. There are

undoubtedly important differences across countries and industries in industrial and government

regulatory structure, as well as subtle differences in data definitions (e.g. what constitutes an

“establishment”). As a consequence, cross-sectional differences in the number and size of firms

are likely to be extremely noisy. Instead, we exploit the panel structure of the data to examine

how changes in market size and income per capita affect changes in the number and size of

establishments within a country.

        Our estimating equations for number of establishments is

                                  Yit
( 25)   ln N itk = α ik + β1 ln       + β 2 ln SIZEitk + eitk
                                  Lit

where the dependent variable N ik is the number of establishments in country i, industry k, at

time t, SIZEitk is the size of the industry (measured variously as total employment, gross output,

                   Yit
or value added),       is real GDP per capita taken from the World Bank’s World Development
                   Lit

Indicators, and α ik is a country-industry fixed effect.

        We also examine average establishment size,

            SIZEitk                 Yit
                        = α i + β1 ln + β 2 ln SIZEit + eit
                              k                      k    k
( 26)   ln     k
            N it                    Lit

where SIZEitk is again measured variously as employment, gross output, or value added. We also




                                                                17
employ total market size for all sectors (ln GDP from the World Bank WDI) in place of sector

specific measures on the right hand side.

        Results are reported in Table 2. In the first 3 columns we see that the prediction of the

generalized ideal variety model for number of establishments is borne out. Conditioning on a

country and industry, growth in the total size of an industry leads to a less than proportional

expansion in the number of establishments. This holds for all three measures of industry size.

The number of establishments is also rising in income per capita.

        The next six columns examine the average size of firms. Regardless of the measure

employed, we see that average size of establishments is increasing in industry size and

decreasing in income per capita. The same holds true when we employ GDP instead of sector

specific measures, though the regression fits are much lower in this case.



IV. Empirics – Cross-Importer Variation in Prices

        Next, we empirically examine the theoretical predictions regarding cross-importer prices:

prices should be lower in large markets and higher in rich markets after conditioning on market

size. We employ bilateral export data from the Eurostats Trade Database for the period 1990-

2003. These data report values and quantities (weight in kilograms) of trade for each of 11 EU

exporters and over 200 importers worldwide, measured at the 8 digit level of the Harmonized

System (roughly 11,000 categories). Because we have exporter-importer-product-time

variation, we can control for many factors outside our model, and relate changes in import prices

at the border (i.e. prior to any value-added in distribution or retailing) to changes in importer

characteristics.

        We write export prices as




                                                 18
                                          Yit
    pijtk = c kjtα ijk m k (aik , Yit ,       ),
                                          Lit

with indices j=exporter, i=importer, k = HS8 product, and t = time. The term c kjt captures

influences that are specific to an exporter-product-time period. These include variation in

marginal costs of production and product quality.8 The term α ijk captures time invariant

influences specific to an importer-exporter-product. For example, Hummels-Skiba (2004) show

that prices vary across bilateral pairs due to Alchian Allen effects, i.e. variation in tariffs and per

unit transportation costs induce changes in the quality mix and observed prices. Similarly, for

reasons outside the model Germany may happen to ship higher priced cars to the US than it does

to France. To the extent that these effects change little over time, they are captured in α ijk .

               Finally, m() is a markup that depends on importer-commodity characteristics (such as

market or regulatory structure not captured in our model), as well as market size and per capita

income. For simplicity we approximate this markup rule as a separable log-linear function in its

arguments, mitk = exp α ik (Yit )         ( )      m2k
                                                         (Yit   Lit )
                                                                        m3k




               This allows us to write log export prices as

                                                                   Yit
ln pijtk = c kjt + α ijk + aik + m2k (ln Yit ) + m3k (ln               ).
                                                                   Lit

               In order to eliminate variation across importer-products aik and bilateral pair-products

α ijk we take long differences of the data, examining changes in log export prices between the



8                                                                         k
    Prices are the value of trade divided by weight. c jt then also includes a conversion of a common price measure
(value per kg) into commodity specific units.

beginning and end of the sample. Using t = 0,1, we have9

                                                                                Y           Y 
                        (              )

                                                                                L           Li ,0 
                                                                                   i ,1


Finally, to capture any evolution in product cost or quality that is specific to an exporter-product

and constant across importers, we employ a vector of exporter-product fixed effects, a kj . This

gives us a final estimating equation that allows us to relate changes in prices to changes in

importer market size and per capita income.

                                                                            Y           Y 

                                                                            L           Li ,0 
                                                                               i ,1


          Initially, we pool over all commodities in our sample, which is equivalent to assuming

that the effect of market size and income per capita is identical across products. The resulting

estimate is10

                                                                                            Y       Y 
                     ln pijk ,1 − ln pijk ,0 = a kj − .185(ln Yi ,1 − ln Yi ,0 ) + .251 ln i ,1 − ln i ,0  + eijk
                                                      (.009)                       (.009 )  Li ,1   Li ,0 
                                                                                           

The results match our theoretical predictions. Prices fall for importers for whom GDP is

growing, and rise for importers for whom income per capita is growing.

          Next, we estimate equation ( 27) by pooling over all HS8 commodities within each HS

two-digit group and estimating effects for each HS2 group separately. While this eliminates

many degrees of freedom it also relaxes the assumption of identical effects across all products.

Results for each HS2 industry are reported in Table 3, along with counts of significant

coefficients. For categories representing over 80 percent of trade by value, statistically



9
  We experimented with using only end years 1990 and 2003, as well as constructing average prices over two and
three year windows at the beginning and end of the sample. Results were unaffected.
10
   All coefficients are significant at 1% level. Number of observations is 1,043,566 and within-R2=.001


                                                                     20
significant coefficient estimates match the theory11. Conditioning on an exporter and product,

prices are decreasing in importer’s GDP growth, and increasing in importer’s GDP per capita

growth. The effects are not trivial in magnitude. Figure 2 is a histogram showing the

distribution of coefficients over the HS2 groups. Because the value of trade differs dramatically

across each HS2 group we weight the point estimates by that HS2 groups share in trade. For the

median product, a 1% increase in GDP decreases prices by 0.5%, while a 1% increase in GDP

per capita increases prices by 0.5%.

         Of course, the impact of incomes on prices may be due in part to a rise in demand for

quality as incomes increase. Recall however that our estimates condition on the level of prices

for an importer-exporter pair, and on growth in prices for an exporter-commodity. This sweeps

out much of the cross-exporter quality variation found, for example, in Schott (2003), Hallak

(2004), and Hummels-Klenow (2005), and the cross-bilateral pair quality variation found in

Hummels-Skiba (2004). It may be that exporters adjust their quality mix over time and direct

changing quality differentially to specific importers depending on their changing characteristics.

However, we are unaware of any direct evidence on this point.



IV. Empirics – Own Price Elasticity of Demand

         In this section we examine the generalized ideal variety model’s predictions for how the

own-price elasticity of demand varies across markets. Unfortunately, this model does not yield a

convenient structural form for estimating the own-price elasticity. Our approach is to take as the

null hypothesis that import demand is derived from a CES utility function with a common price-

elasticity of demand across all markets. We then examine whether we can reject this null in


11
  “Wrong-signed” and statistically significant estimates occur in categories representing only 2 percent of trade by
value.


                                                         21
favor of a model in which the elasticity varies systematically across markets. In particular,

equations (23) and (24) predict that the own-price elasticity of demand is higher in large markets,

and lower in rich markets (conditional on market size).

           Our approach, detailed below, requires data on bilateral trade and bilateral trade costs for

many importers. Ideally, we would have those data in a panel in order to relate over-time

changes in the price elasticity of demand within an importer to changes in that importer

characteristics. Unfortunately, bilateral trade cost panel data are not available. Instead we use

cross-sectional data from the TRAINS database, which reports bilateral trade values and tariffs

for many importers and exporters at the 6 digit level of the Harmonized System classification

(roughly 5000 goods). While we are not able to use the time series to difference out unobserved

characteristics as in the firm size and price regressions above, we can still use multiple bilateral

observations for each importer to similar effect.



A. Methodology

           We begin by constructing a test of the CES null hypothesis. The subutility function for

product k (k = 6 digit HS good), for importer i, facing j = 1…J exporting sources for k is given


               (∑                        )
                                             1/ θ k
                    J
                        λ k (qijk )θ                                                      λ kj is a demand shifter, which could
                                     k

                                                      where θ k = (σ k − 1) / σ k , and

represent quality differences, or (unobserved) differences in the number of distinct varieties

available from each exporter. As is well known, we can write the import demands as

                                      −σ k
                 Ek       pijk   
( 28)      qijk = ik      k      

                                 

Where Eik denotes expenditures, and Π ik is the CES price index. Under the CES null, the price




                                                                         22
elasticity of demand is constant across all markets, so we can write the delivered price in market

i as a function of the factory gate price at j, multiplied by ad-valorem trade costs, pijk = p kj tijk .

         When estimating this for k = HS 6 digit level of aggregation, everything in ( 28) is

unobservable except the nominal value of bilateral trade and trade costs. To isolate these terms,

we multiply both sides of ( 28) by exporter prices, and sum over all importers c ≠ i to get j’s

exports to rest of the world, r.

                                                                    Eck k

Writing this in share terms eliminates unobserved price and quality (variety) shifters specific to

j.12 We assume trade costs take the form ln tijk = ln(1 + τ ik ) + δ k ln d ij , where τ ik is an MFN tariff

facing all exporters in importer i, product k, dij is the distance between countries, and δ k is the

elasticity of trade costs with respect to distance.

         To simplify this expression, we employ importer i – product k fixed effects α ik

(implemented by mean differencing) which eliminates the importer expenditure share, the CES

price index, and MFN tariff rates. This leaves variation in bilateral distance to trace out the

variation in trade costs. The final term is exporter specific; we assume it to be orthogonal to the

distance between bilateral pair ij and include it in the error.13                                 We now have


12
   Alternatively, we could also write ( 29) by expressing i’s imports relative to any particular importer, or set of
importers, rather than the world.
13
   Since we cannot measure the price indices or the elasticity of substitution it is difficult to include this last term
explicitly. We cannot verify that trade costs between i and j are orthogonal to the real expenditure weighted sum of
trade costs between j and all other countries. However, simple proxies for this term such as a sum over nominal


                                                                      23
( 30)    ln sijk = α ik − σ k δ k ln dij + eijk

        In the CES model, we can interpret the coefficient on distance as β k = −σ k δ k , which is

invariant to the importer. We will test whether the constant elasticity is rejected by the data in

favor of a form consistent with the generalized ideal variety model, by interacting distance with

importer GDP and GDP per worker.

                                                                           Yi
( 31)    ln sijk = α ik − β1k ln dij + β 2k ln dij ln Yi + β3k ln dij ln      + eijk
                                                                           Li

         Before proceeding to the results, a few notes regarding interpretation are in order.

Ideally, we would estimate ( 31) separately for each exporter and commodity in order to examine

how the own-price elasticity of demand varies across markets for the same product. However, in

order to identify the importer-commodity fixed effects and generate sufficient data variation it is

necessary to pool over multiple exporters. Pooling in this way is equivalent to restricting the

own-price elasticity to be the same across all exporter and products over which we pool, i.e.

imports of Japanese TVs respond to a change in the price of Japanese TVs in the same way that

imports of Korean TVs respond to a change in the price of Korean TVs. In the estimates that

follow, we employ two pooling strategies. For simplicity, we first pool over all exporters and 6

digit products. Then, we pool over all exporters and 6 digit products within a particular 2 digit

aggregate. In both cases, the importer fixed effects are still calculated with respect to the 6 digit

product.

        Second, the use of bilaterally varying trade costs exactly identifies price variation under

the CES null, but imperfectly identifies price variation in the variable elasticity case. With

variable elasticity preferences a rise in trade costs will be partially offset by a fall in the factory


GDP weighted distances are very weakly correlated with distances and tariffs between i and j. We show below that
our results are robust to an alternative specification in which this omitted term does not appear.


                                                             24
gate price so that only a part of the trade cost is passed through to the final price. That is, the

true destination price includes a pricing-to-market adjustment, which is an omitted variable in

our specification that is negatively correlated with trade costs. This omission will create a bias in

the price elasticity toward zero. For a similar reason, if the interaction terms are significant,

PTM will cause a bias in these estimates toward zero. This is problematic if we want to

precisely identify the own-price elasticity of demand. It is less concerning if our primary interest

lies in testing the CES null since we will be biased toward not finding a significant interaction

between tariffs and importer characteristics.



B. Results

           We begin estimating equation ( 31) by pooling over all exporters and products. The

resulting estimate is14

                                                                                           Yi
                         ln sijk = α ik − .668ln dij − .057 ln dij ln Yi + .101ln dij ln      + eijk

We can immediately reject the hypothesis that the response of imports to price changes (via trade

costs) is the same in all markets, as both interaction terms are significant, with signs matching

the theory. In large markets the effect of trade costs on trade are more pronounced, that is,

demand becomes more elastic. In higher income markets, the effect of trade costs on trade are

less pronounced, that is, demand becomes less elastic.

           Of course, not all products are likely to fit the model equally well, and the relevant

pooling restrictions are unlikely to be met. Accordingly, we estimate equation ( 31) separately

for each 2 digit HS product. Full details for each HS2 product are reported in Table 3, along

     All coefficients are significant at 1% level. Number of observations is 1,183,696 and R2=.17.



                                                               25
with counts of significant coefficients. Figure 3 shows the distribution of coefficients across the

HS2 products, weighted by their value in trade.

        In HS2 categories representing 84 percent of trade by value we estimate significantly

negative coefficients on the ln dij ln Yij interaction. Figure 3 shows that estimates of this

interaction term lie primarily between 0 and -0.2. In HS2 categories representing 76 percent of

trade we estimate significantly positive coefficients on the ln dij ln Yij / Lij interaction, with most

of these coefficients lying between 0 and 0.2. It is clear from these figures that, while the effect

differs significantly across industries, the basic message of the interaction from the pooled

regression comes through. The response of trade to trade costs (the price elasticity of demand) is

greater in large markets and smaller in rich markets.

        The model performs well on sign and significance, but does it imply significant

differences in the price elasticity of demand across markets? A problem with interpreting these

interaction terms is that we have a product of the price elasticity and an elasticity of trade costs

with respect to distance.

( 32)   βˆ1k ln d + βˆ2k ln d ln Y + βˆ3k ln d ln (Y / L ) = δ k (σ k + σ yk ln Y + σ yk / l ln (Y / L ))

To isolate the price elasticity, we can express the combined distance and interaction terms as a

ratio for countries of different size and income. For countries 1 and 2, we have

        δ k (σ + σ y ln Y1 + σ y / l ln (Y / L )1 )
               k      k            k

( 33)
        δ k (σ k + σ yk ln Y2 + σ yk / l ln (Y / L )2 )

Note that the elasticity of trade costs with respect to distance falls out, leaving only the elasticity

of substitution and any interaction effects with importer Y and Y/L.

        For each HS 2 product we take the regression point estimates, and combine them with

importer data on Y and Y/L in order to calculate the combined interaction effects for each



                                                            26
country in ( 32). We then rank them from most to least elastic, and express the elasticity ratio in

( 33) using the 90th percentile / 10th percentile country. This gives, for each HS 2 product, a

measure of the range of elasticity over importers in the sample. For example, a value of two

means that the price elasticity of demand for the 90th percentile country is twice that of the price

elasticity for the 10th percentile country. In Figure 4 we plot a distribution of this statistic over

all HS 2 products. Most of the distribution lies between 1.2 and 2.5.



C. Robustness: tariffs as an alternative trade cost measure

        Ideally we would have data on bilaterally varying ad-valorem trade costs, rather than

using a distance proxy for them. Our TRAINS also includes tariff rates for each trade

observation, but has insufficient variation across exporters for a given importer-product for us to

use this variable in estimating ( 31). There is some variation in the tariff schedule across export

sources for a given importer and six digit HS, but most of the high tariff observations correspond

to zero trade values. Of the pairs where trade is observed, in about 90 percent of the cases

TARijk = median(TARik ) . This means that tariffs in the data can reasonably be treated as identical

across exporters as we model above, in which case employing importer-product (ik) fixed effects

eliminates tariffs as a useful source of variation for trade costs

        We experimented with an alternative specification that allowed us to exploit cross-

importer variation in tariffs. Starting from ( 28), we multiply both sides by exporter prices to get

(observable) nominal values for bilateral trade. We include exporter j – commodity k fixed

effects, α kj , to eliminate all exporter-specific effects, including the last term in ( 29) which we

had omitted as unmeasurable in our primary specification. Finally, we proxy for real

expenditures in equation ( 29) using importer GDP and GDP per capita so that the estimating



                                                   27
equation becomes

         ln pqijk = α kj + γ 1 ln Yi + γ 1 ln      + β 4k ln dij

                   + β1k ln 1 + τ ik + β 2k ln 1 + τ ik ln Yi + β 3k ln 1 + τ ik ln
                                                                                      Yi
                                                                                      Li
                                                                                         + eijk


Here, the elasticity is identified using cross-importer variation in tariffs within a particular good.

The advantage of this specification is that one can read the coefficients on tariffs and its

interactions directly in terms of a price elasticity σ k , rather than as the product of two elasticities

σ k δ k . The disadvantage is that we omit the importer price index, which could plausibly affect

our estimated interaction terms.15

         We estimate ( 34) by pooling over all exporters and HS6 products within an HS2

aggregate. Table 3 reports full results, and Figure 5 reports the distribution over the HS2

products of coefficients on the interaction terms. The same basic message from Figure 3 goes

through. For 75 percent of trade by value, the signs match the predictions of the generalized

ideal variety model. Larger countries exhibit a higher price elasticity of demand. Conditioning

on size, richer countries exhibit a lower price elasticity of demand.

         Unlike the specification employing distance as a measure of trade costs, here we can

directly interpret the interaction coefficients in terms of their impact on the absolute price

elasticity. A coefficient of -0.5 on the GDP x tariff term implies that doubling GDP yields

demand that is 0.5 percentage points more elastic. Given the range of GDP variation in the

world, this represents substantial variation in the price elasticity across countries.



D. Robustness: Product Composition.

15
  To explain, large countries are likely to have larger domestic industries. If we believe the CES null, this translates
into a lower price index due to the value of greater variety (see Feenstra 1994).


                                                                   28
       Even for the estimates where we provide separate estimates for each HS2 category there

is likely to be heterogeneity across HS6 products in the price elasticity of demand. We might

falsely reject the CES null if there is a systematic relationship between these elasticities and

importer characteristics. For example, suppose the price elasticity of demand is constant across

markets, but rich countries are more likely to purchase low elasticity HS6 products while poor

countries purchase high elasticity HS6 products within the same HS2. This compositional effect

would show up in our regression as a negative coefficient on the trade cost * Y/L interaction.

       To address this, we experimented with allowing a different coefficient on the trade cost

variable for each HS6 product while still including the interaction terms with importer Y and

Y/L (common for all HS6 within an HS2). If the pure composition story is correct, we should

find significant differences across HS6’s within an HS2, and no significant interaction effect.

We did not. The coefficients on the interaction terms were unaltered by this change.

       Finally, one might argue that the ideal variety model is appropriate for consumer goods

but not industrial inputs. We used Yeats (1998) classification to separate HS6 products into two

groups: intermediate parts and components and all other goods. We then re-estimated equation

( 31) separately for each group, and found no significant differences between them. We do not

view this result as necessarily problematic for the model. It is possible that differentiated

consumer goods are formed from undifferentiated inputs with the differentiation coming entirely

from assembly. However, we think a more likely model is that the inputs themselves are critical

to differentiating ideal consumer varieties: wines becomes suited to particular consumer tastes in

part because they use specialized grapes; laptop computers are customized by assembling

differentiated components (screen, cpu, video chips) particularly desired by consumers.




                                                 29
VI. Conclusion

       We derive a generalized version of the Lancaster (1979) ideal variety model. In this

model, entry leads to a “crowding” of variety space, so that larger markets exhibit a higher own-

price elasticity of demand for differentiated goods, lower prices, and a larger average firm size.

Working against this crowding is an income effect: as consumers grow rich and quantities

consumed rise, their strength of preference for their ideal variety also rises. This gives firms

greater pricing power over consumers. Conditioning on market size, richer markets see a lower

own-price elasticity, higher prices, and fewer firms.

       We provide new evidence supporting the model’s predictions. Conditioning on country

and industry and exploiting time series variation, we find that average firm size is rising for

countries with rising GDP, and falling for countries with rising GDP per capita. Conditioning

on an exporter and product and exploiting time series variation in importer characteristics, we

find that prices of traded goods fall with importer GDP growth and rise with importer GDP per

capita. Finally, conditioning on an exporter and product and exploiting cross-importer variation

in bilateral trade shares, we find that the own-price elasticity of demand is higher in large

markets, and lower in rich markets.

       We see three implications of these findings. First, the theoretical and empirical literature

on product differentiation in trade has relied almost exclusively on constant-elasticity-of-

substitution utility functions. While these models are highly tractable, they yield counter-factual

implications on central empirical questions.

       Second, as has been pointed out by Romer (1994) and Feenstra (1994) and the literature

they have inspired, CES utility models imply substantial welfare gains from trade in new

varieties. Evaluating the welfare implication of new varieties in the generalized ideal variety




                                                 30
model is beyond the scope of the current paper. However, our results suggest two important

qualifications for existing welfare studies. First, variety space does appear to fill up with entry,

suggesting that the welfare gains from new variety may be substantially lower in large countries

than in small. Second, the news is not all bad in the sense that income effects partially trump the

crowding effect for some goods. Rich consumers want, and are willing to pay for, varieties

closely matched to their ideal preferences. GDP growth that occurs primarily through growth in

output per worker will still lead to substantial variety gains for some goods, albeit at the cost of

lowered economies of scale and higher prices.

       Finally, we know that prices are systematically higher in rich than in poor countries, a

fact that has typically been ascribed to cross-country differences in the prices of non-traded

goods as in Balassa (1964) and Samuelson (1964). Our results show that the prices of traded

goods are also systematically higher in rich countries because the price elasticity of demand is

lower. Whether these traded goods price differences are a significant contributor to national price

levels as a whole, and constitute a challenge to the centrality of non-traded goods in explaining

them, we leave for subsequent work.

Appendix 1. Derivation of the aggregate demand and price elasticity of demand for

the differentiated varieties in the symmetric equilibrium.



        The derivation here is a slight modification of the corresponding derivations

provided by Helpman and Krugman (1985, Chapter 6).

        First we would like to find the aggregate demand function for variety ω̂ given
                                                                                               
that its closest competitor to the left is variety ω
                                                    , and its closest variety to the right is ω .

The corresponding prices are denoted as pω , pωˆ and pω . Next let us choose the varieties

                 
ω , ω ∈ d * (ω , ω ) such that

               (        )
         pω 1 + qωγ vωβ ,ω = pωˆ (1 + qωγˆ vωβˆ ,ω )
(A1)                                     ,
         pω   (1 + q v ) = p (1 + q v )
                       γ β
                        
                       ω ω ,ω      ωˆ
                                              γ β
                                              ωˆ ωˆ ,ω


                                                    
where d * (ω
            , ω ) is the shortest arc between ω
                                                and ω . We focus on the symmetric

equilibrium in which all prices are symmetric. Consequently, the market clientele for

variety ω̂ is a compact set of consumers whose ideal varieties range from ω to ω . Note

that from the first stage of the two-stage budgeting procedure we know the individual

                                             l:
consumption levels for each produced variety ω

                 µz
(A2)     qωˆ =
                 pωˆ
                                          ω           ω̂           ω        
                               ω                                       ω
                                               d           d

                                    Arc distance= d


                                                               *
                                          Arc distance= d

                                              Figure A1.




       In what follows, all varieties are identified by the shortest arc distance from

         : variety ω̂ is represented by d , variety ω is represented by ( d − d ) where
variety ω

d = vω ,ωˆ , and variety ω is represented by d + d = vω ,ω where d = vωˆ ,ω . Figure A1

illustrates these identifications graphically. Now we can update our notation and

substitute (A2) into (A1):


           
                                      β
                                               (
        pω 1 + ( µ z ) pω−γ ( d − d )  = pωˆ 1 + ( µ z ) pω−ˆ γ d β
                       γ                                  γ
                                                                        )
(A3)                                                                        ,

           
                       γ
                                              (
        pω 1 + ( µ z ) pω−γ ( d − d )  = pωˆ 1 + ( µ z ) pω−ˆ γ d β
                                      β                   γ
                                                                        )
where pω , pω , and pωˆ denote the prices of the corresponding varieties.

       From (A3) we can express the boundaries of the firm’s clientele as a function of

                                                                                (    )
the distance between its closest competitors’ varieties, their pricing pω and pω , the

firm’s own pricing ( pωˆ ) and variety choice (as measured by d ), and individual income

spent on the differentiated good:
        d = v  pωˆ , d , pω , pω , d * , µ z 
(A4)
        d = v  pωˆ , d , pω , pω , d * , µ z 

Thus we can write the demand function faced by a firm producing variety ω̂ as:

               v (.) + v (.)  µ zL
(A5)    Qωˆ = 
                        pωˆ

where µ IL is the aggregate expenditure on the differentiated varieties.

        Next let us derive the price elasticity of demand function defined by (A5). To do

it, we will first apply the implicit derivation to (A4) in order to find the response of the

market width towards an increase in price:

                     ( µ z ) + (1 − γ ) pω−ˆ γ d β
                                     −γ
         ∂v
              =−                                       <0
                 pω β pω−γ ( d − d ) + β pω1ˆ−γ d β −1
                                    β −1
         ∂pωˆ

(A6)
                         ( µ z ) + (1 − γ ) pω−ˆ γ d β
                                          −γ
         ∂v
              =−                                             <0
                 pω β pω−γ ( d * − d − d ) + β pω1ˆ−γ d β −1
                                          β −1
         ∂pωˆ


where the nominators of both fractions are strictly positive according to assumption (10).

Recall that we are focusing on the symmetric equilibria, and thus all prices are symmetric

                                                      d
and ( d * − d − d ) = ( d − d ) = d = d =               . Combining this fact with (A6), we can derive the
                                                      2

price elasticity of demand from (A5):

Appendix 2. Open Economy

        The model outlined in this section nests the generalized ideal variety model into

the Dornbusch-Fischer-Samuelson (1977) continuum of comparative advantage model.

There are two countries, Home and Foreign, which are indexed by superscripts H and

F , respectively. Consumer preferences are defined over a homogeneous product q0 and

over M differentiated products qk , k = 1, 2,..., M , where each of the differentiated

products is defined by a continuum of varieties indexed by ω ∈ Ω k :

                      M                       µ
(A8)    U = q01− µ ∏ uk ( qiω | ω ∈ Ω k )  M                               0 < µ < 1,
                     k =1



where subutility uk ( qkω | ω ∈ Ω k ) is defined as

                                          qkω         
(A9)    uk ( qkω | ω ∈ Ω k ) = max                     ,
                               ω∈Ω k  1 + q γ v β
                                           kω ω ,ω    

and the budget constraint is

              M
(A10) q0 + ∑ ∫              qkω pkω = I .
                     ω∈Ωk
              k =1


        The differentiated varieties are produced by monopolistically competitive firms,

with identical technologies. As in the closed economy model there are fixed and

marginal labor requirements. We now interpret α not as the fixed cost of production,

but as the cost of adjustment to each market. Consequently, the fixed cost is incurred for

each market the firm chooses to enter. The fixed cost of market adjustment is assumed to

be symmetric across the countries, products, and varieties:

(A11) α kHω = α kFω = α                                       ∀ω ∈ Ω k , k = 1, 2,..., M .

        In contrast, the marginal costs are assumed to differ across products and countries,
while remaining the same for all varieties of a given product and country.

         In particular, we assume that the Home’s marginal cost is increasing in the index

of the product:

(A12) ckH < ckH+1                                                        k = 1, 2,..., ( M − 1) ,

while, for Foreign, the order of marginal costs across products is the reverse:

(A13) ckF > ckF+1                                                        k = 1, 2,..., ( M − 1) .

         We assume that the parameters of the model are such that each country has a

Ricardian comparative advantage in the production of a certain subset of products, which

stimulates inter-product trade. The degree of comparative advantage differs across

products: it is decreasing in k for Home and increasing in k for Foreign.

         The transportation costs for the differentiated goods are of the ‘iceberg’ form, and

they are identical for all varieties of all the products and for both directions of trade:

         The homogeneous good can be traded at no cost. It is included in the model to

guarantee balanced trade and equality of wages across countries: the numeraire sector is

assumed to be large enough for each country to produce homogenous product under free

trade.

B. Market Equilibrium

         Consumers can potentially access both domestic and imported varieties. Hence,

our first step is to find out which varieties will be traded internationally. Consider a

single product l ∈ {1, 2,..., M } . We analyze whether consumption of product l in Home

consists of only domestic varieties, of only imported varieties, or both.
          First, consider the case when clH > tclF . Assume that there exists a domestic firm

producing variety ω ∈ Ωl and earning nonnegative profit by selling the amount Qlω at

price plω in the Home’s market. Then there exists p < plω such that a Foreign’s

producer can sell the same amount Qlω of the identical product in Home’s market at price

p and earn a strictly positive profit. By undercutting the Home producer’s price,

Foreign’s producer will crowd out Home’s producer from the market. Indeed, because

Foreign firms have a marginal cost advantage and are free to produce anywhere they like

on the product circle, none of Home’s producers is able to earn nonnegative profit at

Home’s market of product l . All varieties of this product in the Home’s market will be

imported from Foreign.

          In a similar fashion, it is possible to show that, if clH < tclF , no varieties of product

l will be imported from Foreign by Home. Finally, if clH = tclF , the varieties of product

l consumed at Home, can be produced both in Home and in Foreign. In this manner, we

guarantee that all varieties of a particular product within a market will be symmetric.

Similar analysis for Foreign can be conducted to determine the production location for

each good l consumed in Foreign.

          C. Comparative Statics

          How does a change in z or L affect the equilibrium? Because we have pinned

down the wage with the numeraire sector, cross-country differences in production costs

(cl
   H
       , clF ) for a given product are robust to changes in z, L. As a result, changes to z, L do

not affect the division of products into imported, exported, and nontraded segments, and
are instead absorbed entirely through changes in variety within a given product circle.1

        In the closed economy equilibrium defined by equations (17)-(22), zL defines a

country’s resource availability and income constraints. In the multi-good open economy

setting, the resource constraints can obviously not bind for each of the M products.

However, if we focus on products that fall in the non-traded or import segments of the

continuum, we can apply the closed economy solutions separately for each product.

Now, µzL in (16) becomes µzL/M, and defines total expenditures on each product. This

income constraint limits entry of firms, whether domestic firms for non-traded goods or

foreign firms for imports, in precisely the same way as before.

        Our comparative statics can now be interpreted as a cross-importer comparison:

how is the market for a particular exporter’s variety different in import markets with

differing z and L? Given the Cobb-Douglas upper level utility, expenditure shares are

fixed across countries, while total expenditures will vary across importers due to

variation in z and L. As a result, the comparative statics within each product category

with respect to z and L will be the same in both closed and open economy settings.

 This is in contrast to the standard DFS model where changes in L lead to wage changes and can affect the
set of traded goods.
