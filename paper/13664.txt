                                             ABSTRACT

This paper estimates the number of people at risk of contracting malaria in Africa using GIS methods
and the disease's epidemiologic characteristics. It then estimates yearly costs of covering the population
at risk with the package of interventions (differing by level of malaria endemicity and differing for
rural and urban populations) for malaria as recommended by the UN Millennium Project. These projected
costs are calculated assuming a ramp-up of coverage to full coverage by 2008, and then projected out
through 2015 to give a year-by-year cost of meeting the Millennium Development Goal for reducing
the burden of malaria by 75% We conclude that the cost of comprehensive malaria control for Africa
is US$3.0 billion per year on average, or around US$4.02 per African at risk.

                                        INTRODUCTION

       The burden of malaria in Africa continues to be extremely high, despite the existence of

effective interventions to curb the mortality and morbidity of the disease. Every year, up to three

million people die from malaria on the continent.1 The Millennium Development Goals set in

2000 recognize that malaria must be controlled if Africa is to escape from the cycle of extreme

poverty and disease. The MDG on malaria is to “Have halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the

incidence of malaria,” which has been made more specific by the UN Millennium Project’s

working group on malaria as “Reduce malaria morbidity and mortality by 75 percent by 2015

from the 2005 baseline level.” In January 2005, the working group on malaria recommended that

countries where malaria is rife should use an integrated package of preventive and treatment

methods to achieve this goal.2 The project also recommended that insecticide treated mosquito

bed nets and effective malaria drugs be given away free of charge, a move endorsed by UN

Secretary-General Kofi Annan in March, and by heads of state at the UN World Summit in

September 2005.

       There are existing, effective methods to control malaria: prevent people from being bitten

by mosquitoes — using insecticide treated bed nets and insecticide spray applications — treat

those who get infected with effective drugs such as artemisinin-based combination therapies

(ACTs), promote health education and communication, and conduct monitoring and evaluation.

This paper estimates the number of people at risk of contracting malaria in Africa using GIS

methods, and then estimates the yearly costs of covering the population at risk with the package

of interventions recommended by the UN Millennium Project.


                          DERIVATION OF POPULATION AT RISK




                                                 2
       Due to lack of adequate data collection in Africa’s health system, there is incomplete

information on the morbidity and mortality associated with malaria.3 The WHO Global Burden

of Disease program estimates burden in Africa through “active” case-detection studies of

populations living under different transmission intensity risks, which is subject to under-

detection. Several alternative studies have estimated population at risk using other methods,

including estimates based on national surveys,4 estimates based on climate suitability for malaria

transmission,5,6 and estimates based on maps of the geographic extent of malaria in a Geographic

Information System (GIS).7

       We follow the GIS-based strategy by overlaying the following maps: a high-resolution

(30 arc-seconds) map of 2005 human population;8 a map of country boundaries, the most recent

(2002) map of the extent malaria of risk9 (shown below); a map of malaria endemicity levels

constructed in 196810 (shown below); and a map of the extent of urban areas.8 The latter four

maps were rasterized to the same 30 arc-second cell size. Population sums were then calculated

by country for the following categories: total population within the malaria risk zone, population

within a malaria risk zone and within an urban zone, population within a malaria risk zone and

within a zone of unstable malaria transmission (either hypoendemic or mesoendemic zones in the

endemicity map), and population within a malaria risk zone, an urban zone, and a zone of

unstable transmission. (Note that areas showing up on the 1968 endemicity map but are outside

the area of 2002 malaria risk are considered to no longer have malaria and are ignored). The

resulting estimate for population at risk of malaria in Africa in 2006 is 672 million people, of

which 485 million are in rural areas (see Table 1). Finally, we used the UN Population Division’s

median forecast of projected population to calculate a population growth rate for each country,

and used it to estimate the population in each country in the above categories for every year




                                                 3
between 2006 and 2015. This now allows us to calculate the cost of each intervention, by country

and by year, based on the urban and rural population at risk, in stable and unstable malaria

transmission areas.




                 DESCRIPTION OF COMPREHENSIVE INTERVENTIONS

   The interventions included in this costing exercise encompass most of the key interventions

recommended by the UN Millennium Project, and many details of the costing follow those of the

report of the Working Group on Malaria.2 For prevention of disease, they include long-lasting

insecticidal bed nets (LLINs), indoor residual spraying (IRS) in unstable transmission areas,

training of community health workers, and cost of an information, education, and

communication program. For enhanced diagnosis and treatment, they include microscopy, rapid

diagnostic tests, effective drugs such as artemisinin-combination therapies (ACTs) for

uncomplicated malaria, and treatment of severe malaria. Finally, the costing includes resources


                                                4
for monitoring and evaluation, and for the overhead costs of a global push on malaria control.

Below are the assumptions made for each intervention:



   •   Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs): Following the UN Millennium Project’s

       recommendation, we calculate the cost of complete coverage of LLINs for the population

       at risk by the end of 2008, with a ramp-up of coverage during 2006, 2007, and 2008.

       Note that this is a more ambitious target than other costing exercises; the efficacy of

       LLINs and the mass action effect implies that the entire population, and not just children

       and pregnant women, should be targeted by LLIN distribution programs.11 We assume

       that one net is needed for every two people at risk. The cost of LLINs is around $5, with

       an additional $2 estimated cost of storage and distribution, and the net needs to be

       replaced after 5 years (as is the case with Olyset nets).12 Note that long-lasting nets do not

       need to be re-impregnated with insecticide during their 5-year lifespan.



   •   Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS): Selective vector control (including IRS) was part of

       the WHO’s Global Strategy for Malaria Control which was adopted by the Ministerial

       Conference in 1992 and subsequently endorsed by the World Health Assembly (WHA)

       and the UN General Assembly. The Global Strategy was also taken up by the RBM

       partnership for the use of selective control in appropriate epidemiological settings.

       Recently, the U.S.’s President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) has also emphasized the benefits

       of IRS. We have estimated the average annual cost of using IRS against malaria in

       unstable transmission areas at $206 million. However, the cost of blanket spraying all

       malaria transmission areas is $1.1 billion or up to $2 billion considering intense




                                                 5
transmission areas require more than one round of spraying per year. Thus blanket

coverage with IRS seems prohibitively expensive, especially since intense transmission

areas will be scaling up LLIN coverage, and LLINs are easier to distribute, last for up to

five years, face less complex logistic challenges than IRS, and require fewer human

resources. We therefore include costs for IRS in unstable transmission areas only, since

these areas higher risks of mortality (note that there are some stable transmission areas of

special economic consideration, such as resorts or mining operations, where private

sector budgets will cover the high per capita costs of IRS). We assume that Lysenko’s

map of endemicity in Africa continues to represent relative transmission strength in

Africa today, since unlike other parts of the world, the continent has benefited from few

anti-malaria interventions. We consider the areas of the 2002 extent of malaria risk which

are hypoendemic and mesoendemic in Lysenko’s map to be low- and moderate-

transmission and thus recommended for IRS. (This area, encompassing much of eastern

African, part of southern Africa and the Sahel countries is roughly the area experts

describe as having unstable transmission13). By overlaying this area with the population

map, we estimate that 149 million people lived in low- and moderate-transmission areas

in Africa in 2005. We follow the costing methodology of the UN Millennium Project

Working Group on Malaria. Since costs are at the household level, we assume an average

of 5 people per household, that each household has about 300 m2 of surface that needs to

be sprayed, that each square meter requires 2.67 grams of insecticide (DDT, the

insecticide of choice), add a ten percent margin of insecticide, and use a cost of US$4.3

per kilogram of insecticide (this cost corresponds to DDT). In addition, we cost labor

requirements for IRS. We divide number of households by 360 person-days to get the




                                         6
    number of spray persons needed. We assume 5 spray persons for each squad, 5 squads for

    each team and for each technician, and 1 supervisor for 5 teams. Wages were set at

    US$10 per day for the spray persons (for 40 days of work plus 6 training days), US$15

    per day for squad chiefs and technicians (both also for 46 days), and US$20 per day for

    supervisors (for 18 person-days of work). For field equipment, we include a tent

    (US$2000) for each team and each supervisor, and add $100 per person for all personnel

    for coveralls, handgloves, goggles, buckets, soaps, etc., and US$0.06 in forms and

    stationary for each household sprayed. For the first year (2006) we include the cost of the

    spray pump and spare parts (US$500) for each spray person. Finally, we recognize the

    costs of other logistics, including vehicles to transport equipment and personnel, spare

    parts and maintenance, fuel and lubricant, and insurance for the spraying team and

    vehicles. Since the UN Millennium Project Working Group on Malaria estimated costs

    for these items in Ethiopia based on number of districts, we cannot replicate the costing

    in this exercise (since we are only working with population at risk in each country). We

    therefore totaled these costs (for every year) in the Working Group’s exercise and found

    them to be 30% of the other costs of IRS (which we do model). We therefore added 30%

    of total IRS costs as an estimate of the cost of logistics.



•   Training Community Health Workers (CHW): An RBM survey indicated that

    between 70% and 90% of febrile children are treated at home.2 There is therefore an

    urgent need to treat uncomplicated malaria at the community level, especially given

    evidence of decreased child mortality among those who see a community health worker

    (CHW).14 A number of countries are seeking to improve coverage by extending health




                                               7
    services using CHWs for malaria diagnosis and treatment services. We assume that one

    CHW is needed per 500 population, and that training for malaria control lasts 8 days and

    costs $10 per day. .



•   Human Resource Development: Note that there are other needs in human resource

    development; the Malaria Working Group indicates that besides CHWs, training of

    nurses, physicians, entomologists and malariologists will be needed to guide and

    implement the program activities. However, these costs are estimated based on the size of

    the formal health sector (number of hospitals, etc.), and are not estimated based on the

    size of the population at risk. We approximate the costs based on the methodology of the

    Working Group on Malaria as follows: we consider the total cost of leadership training

    for program managers and topping up salary for medical officers, epidemiologists,

    entomologists, biologists, health officers, nurses, environmental health workers, and

    malaria technicians. The estimated costs total $704 million for Ethiopia from 2005--2015.

    Using our estimate of population at risk, we find that this number of human resource

    development needs translates into around $1.00 per person at risk per year, and use the

    same assumption for all countries in Africa based on population at risk.



•   Microscopy: We expect that health facilities such as health centers, rural hospitals, and

    all hospitals in urban areas will use microscopic examination of stained thick and thin

    blood smears, the gold standard for malaria diagnosis. The Working Group on Malaria

    estimates the cost of microscopy using the numbers of hospitals and other health centers

    in a country, which cannot be duplicated in this paper. We therefore estimate the cost of




                                             8
    microscopy as we did for topping-up of salaries. The Working Group on Malaria

    estimated that the total cost of microscopy for Ethiopia from 2005--2015 to be around

    $29 million. Using our estimates of population at risk, we find that this number is

    equivalent to around $0.04 per person at risk per year, and use this number to estimate

    microscopy costs for all the countries. Note that microscopes can be used for other

    purposes (TB, other parasitic and bacterial diseases).



•   Rapid Diagnostic Testing (RDT): Given that peripheral levels of the health system –

    particularly rural areas – often cannot meet the laboratory requirements for microscopy, a

    variety of simple and rapid diagnostic tests have been developed for accurate and reliable

    malaria diagnosis by community health workers and health facilities. We assume that

    RDT should be used only in unstable transmission areas, for all age groups.



    In areas of intense transmission, where severe disease and mortality are largely

    concentrated in children under five years of age, malaria should be treated on the basis of

    clinical suspicion of malaria and not on confirmed diagnosis by RDTs. People older than

    5 years of age have a well developed level of immunity, are at lesser risk of developing

    severe malaria and a significant proportion are asymptomatic in the presence of malaria

    parasites. This group (above 5 years old living in intense transmission areas) constitutes

    the bulk of the febrile cases in Africa (we estimate around 218 million fever episodes)

    and at the moment will be too expensive to subject every one of them to RDT

    examination. They should therefore be treated clinically on the basis of seasonality and

    clinical manifestation of the disease.




                                             9
    We use the UN Population Division’s World Population Prospects’ demographic

    breakdown for every year between 2006 and 2015 to divide our population at risk into

    groups aged 0--4, 5--9, 10--14, and 14+. Following WHO guidelines, the first age group

    does not require RDT, since in patients below age 5 every fever episode immediately

    receives malaria treatment due to the possibility of misdiagnosis.15 Following similar

    assumptions to the costing done by the UN Millennium Project Working Group on

    Malaria, the 5--9 and 10--14 age groups are assumed to experience one fever episode per

    year and the age 14+ group experiences 0.5 fever episodes per year (these are taken as the

    average number of fevers from all causes, across all endemicity levels). One RDT kit is

    needed for each of these fever episodes (again, we restrict ourselves to unstable

    transmission areas), and costs at US$0.61 per kit. Note, that we have built into the model

    a decrease in fever episodes as LLIN coverage increases: we assume that the proportion

    of the population covered by LLINs has a 50% reduction in fever episodes (measured

    reduction in morbidity has ranged from 44%--75%16,17,18,19). This decreases the need for

    RDT as LLIN coverage increases. Moreover, we have assumed that the number of fever

    episodes for populations living in urban areas is 25% smaller, since transmission tends to

    be lower in urban areas.



•   Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACTs): We again calculated fever

    episodes for each of the four age groups mentioned above (including the 0--4 age group,

    which we assume experience 2 fever episodes per year). We assume that RDT in unstable

    transmission areas will reveal that around 40% of the fevers are due to malaria and




                                            10
require ACTs (as was assumed by the UN Millennium Project Working Group on

Malaria). In intense transmission areas, on the other hand, we assume that 20% of the

fever episodes will be examined by microscopy, and these will have a slide positivity rate

of 40% (Ethiopia’s current slide positivity rate). The 80% of fevers not examined by

microscopy all require ACTs. Our total number of fever episodes requiring malaria

treatment in 2006 is 395 million, which is within the range of other published estimates.20

We assume that each treatment course can be treated with either artemether-lumefantrine

or artesunate-amodiaquine. Artemether-lumefantrine is assumed to cost US$0.45 for the

0--4 age group, US$0.90 for the 5--9 age group, US$1.35 for the 10--14 age group, and

US$1.80 for the 14+ age group.21,22 Artesunate-amodiaquine is estimated to cost US$0.23

for the children under 1, $0.45 for the 1--6 age group, US$0.80 for the 7--13 age group,

and $1.48 for the 13+ age group (we use RBM’s recommended dosages23 and averages of

prices from Sanofi-Aventis, Ipca, and Cipla,24 and adjust to match age groups in our

analysis). We use the average of the cost of artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-

amodiaquine. As above, we assume a 50% reduction in fever episodes for the population

covered by LLINs, and 25% fewer fever episodes among urban populations. For intense

transmission areas, this is a 50% reduction in all fevers; for unstable transmission areas, it

is a 50% reduction of fevers that needs ACTs, that is, a 50% reduction of the original

40% of total fevers. ACT production is a bottleneck, as discussed below; we assume that

enough ACTs will be produced to meet need starting in 2008, but for 2006 and 2007

there will be a shortage. We include a US$0.10 cost of using other drugs (sulfadoxine-

pyrimethamine (SP)-amodiaquine combination or SP-chloroquine combination) to treat

the fevers that will not be treated with ACTs in 2006 and 2007. It is expected that in a




                                         11
    year’s time, ACTs such as dihydroartemisinin piperaquine will become available,

    resulting in overall increased production and cost reduction.



•   Management of Severe Malaria: We include a rough approximation of management of

    severe malaria, using the median cost of $29.50 for managing a severe malaria case as

    derived by WHO/AFRO.25 We assume that about 1% of the malaria episodes would

    progress to severe malaria.26



•   Information, Education and Communication: A program to educate communities and

    promote behavioral change is an important element in successful malaria reduction. The

    program should produce information, education, and communication materials targeting

    health workers, community leaders, and communities; it should use radio spots,

    television, drama and other educational media to increase treatment-seeking behavior,

    compliance, and use of LLINs, target IRS; and organize sensitization and advocacy

    meetings at district, regional, and national levels. The Working Group on Malaria

    estimated that the cost of IEC for Ethiopia $614,000 per year. Using our estimates of

    population at risk, we find that this number is equivalent to around $0.011 per person at

    risk per year, and use this number to estimate IEC costs for all the countries.



•   Monitoring and Evaluation: Monitoring and evaluation are essential components of

    malaria control programs to track effectiveness of the interventions over time. Activities

    involve assessment of routine health services data and periodic community and

    household surveys in order to develop process indicators for implementation, and




                                             12
                         outcome indicators for case management, prevention, and program impact.27 In addition,

                         the effectiveness of antimalarials and insecticides must be monitored. Following the

                         standard practice in programs funded by the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria,

                         we add 7% of costs as monitoring and evaluation.



      •                  Overhead Costs: Finally, we add 10% of the cost to account for the overhead costs in a

                         global effort to reach full coverage of these malaria interventions by 2008.



Using our estimated population at risk and the costing assumptions above, we arrive at the

projected total yearly costs for all of Africa shown in Table 2 and graphed below:

The most striking fact from these numbers is their modest magnitude. Given that we are talking

about a disease that kills around two million African children every year, the fact that full



                                                                    13
coverage of LLINs and ACTs (plus the other interventions) costs only $3.00 per African (or

$4.02 per person at risk of malaria) is astounding and encouraging.

       We examined these numbers in comparison with earlier studies. The UN Millennium

Project Working Group on Malaria performed a detailed costing of interventions for Ethiopia,

and arrived at an average of US$238 million per year, which comes to around US$2.70 per

capita per year (compared to $3.00 in our results above; note that unlike the working group, we

include salaries for CHWs, without which our per capita cost is $2.29). Another costing estimate

(Kiszewski A and others, unpublished) of malaria interventions for Africa results in $1.7 billion,

an equivalent of around US$2.10 per person at risk per year. It is heartening that our GIS-based

approach and different costing assumptions produce similar results and corroborate the

magnitude of the per capita cost of these interventions.



                         SCALING UP TO FULL COVERAGE IN 2008

       Given that our model assumes full coverage of LLINs by the end of 2008, it is instructive

to look at costs before 2008 carefully. In order to reach full coverage of all interventions by

2008, the international community needs to begin planning ahead to guarantee sufficient

production of LLINs and ACT treatment courses. Full coverage in 2008 means that around 352

million nets must be distributed in Africa by the end of that year. Around 20 million nets have

been distributed in 2005 (the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria – the largest provider

of resources for malaria control in Africa – has approved purchases of around 22--31 million

LLINs between 2005 and 2007, and we looked at the GFATM disbursement reports and found

that roughly 20 million nets had been distributed in 2005). Our costing model above includes a

ramping up of distribution to 100 million new nets in 2006, 110 million new nets in 2007, and




                                                 14
122 million new nets in 2008. Since production of LLINs by the two producing companies

(Sumitomo and Vestergaard) in 2006 is currently planned for around 80 million nets, the donor

countries should commit as soon as possible to funding a scale up of production in 2007 and

2008 so that full coverage can be reached by 2008. Two other LLIN products from other

manufacturers are also expected to be in the market soon, which would alleviate the production

capacity constraint.

       With regard to treatment, the current estimate for production of ACTs in 2006 is 130

million treatment doses, which is insufficient to meet the estimated 395 million treatments

needed. In 2006 and 2007, our costing model assumes that fevers that cannot be treated with

ACTs will be treated with either SP-amodiaquine combination or SP-chloroquine combination,

which both cost about US$0.10. By 2008, we assume that enough ACTs will be produced to

meet the need, which our projections show to be around 251 million treatment courses. This

implies a doubling of ACT production between now and 2008. For our model, we use the

estimated 130 million treatment courses for 2006 production, and in order to ramp up to 251

million by 2008, we use 200 million as the number of ACT treatments produced in 2007. Again,

since ACTs are produced by private companies, this increase in production can only happen if

donors agree in advance to purchase the required treatment courses.

       Note that this costing exercise was carried out in early 2006; since scale up in 2006 has

been slower than expected, this implies a faster scale up will be needed in 2007 and 2008, and

full coverage could perhaps be reached by early 2009. The important point, however, is that full

coverage can be reached within approximately three years, and average annual costs between

now and 2015 are not high.

                                          CONCLUSION

       We have employed a GIS-based method to estimate the population in Africa at risk of

contracting malaria, and proceeded to calculate the cost of providing this population a

comprehensive set of interventions to reduce malaria incidence and mortality. The interventions

in our model are adjusted for urban areas and for unstable transmission areas. Although these

estimates are rough and cannot replace country-specific malaria planning and cost estimates, the

exercise shows that a GIS-based costing strategy comes up with comparable results to methods

that estimate population at risk using survey methods. In areas where survey methods may

severely underestimate population at risk, GIS-based estimates provide a useful alternative

method. Ideally, maps of malaria risk and intensity will be updated frequently in the future to

provide up-to-date estimates given the impact of interventions. Our results make it evident that

the costs of comprehensive malaria interventions are very low on a per-capita or per-patient

basis. Nevertheless, full coverage is beyond the reach of African government budgets. Given that

the disease kills millions, is readily preventable and curable, and has been shown to hamper

economic development, the international community should seize the opportunity to reduce

massively this human disease burden at such a low cost. Other public health efforts, such as

measles and polio campaigns currently underway, present an opportunity to synergize by also

delivering malaria interventions, especially bed nets.28,29
