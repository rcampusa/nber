                                              ABSTRACT

Theory indicates that internally-differentiated professional partnerships can promote matching between
heterogeneous consumers and professionals, particularly when consumers have imperfect information
or markets have barriers to referrals between firms. We test this in obstetrics markets, relying on random
assignment of patients to physicians to generate unbiased measures of a physician's treatment style
and skill, and on simulations to measure a physician's specialization. Consumers match to professionals
along all three dimensions -- specialization, style and skill -- based on consumers' observed characteristics
and unobserved preferences. We conclude that internally-differentiated partnerships promote matching
in ways that improve consumers' welfare and health.

I.      Obstetrics Markets

        Many theoretical models of professional service partnerships have been developed to

understand better the formation of such firms, their boundaries and their scopes. These models

have focused on the benefits to the professionals or firms themselves. For example, partnerships’

profit-sharing can effectively spread the risk of demand shocks across the members (Gaynor and

Gertler 1995). Alternatively, Chou (2007) proposes that human-capital intensive firms merge to

establish a single brand identity that obfuscates the individual market value of the individuals or

firms within the larger firm. The rationale for mergers between firms in this model is the merged

firm’s ability to capture more of the investment in human capital such as knowledge, skill, or

specialization. Other models have considered the ability of partnerships to signal higher quality to

consumers in markets where quality is not readily observable, which they achieve by screening

out low-quality professionals through their hiring decisions (Levin and Tadelis 2002) or by

creating incentives for members to invest in quality-improving human capital (Morrison and

Wilhelm 2004).

        Other theoretical models have focused on the advantages of firms with heterogeneous

workers. Firms with specialized workers can coordinate their production (Alchian and Demsetz

1972; Garicano 2000; Hart and Moore 2005), facilitate the flow of information among specialists

(Bolton and Dewatripont 1994), and match them with the most appropriate tasks (MacDonald

1982). In professional services markets, “tasks” can refer to individual, heterogeneous customers.

The welfare implications of product differentiation in markets with heterogeneous consumers

depend on the ability of consumers to match with products. In markets with imperfect or

asymmetric information, firms can facilitate matching of consumers with goods and services by

reducing consumers’ search and diagnosis costs (Wolinsky 1993) or by eliminating or reducing

disincentives to refer consumers (Garicano and Santos 2004). In Garicano and Santos (2004),

under many but not all conditions, professional partnerships create incentives for within-firm


                                                 3
referrals that enhance matching between specialists and uninformed consumers beyond those

achieved through (post-diagnosis) spot markets or (pre-diagnosis) retainer contracts between

professionals in different firms.

        In this paper we empirically consider the consumer benefits from firms of professionals

who are differentiated in specialization, style and skill. We study these effects conditional on the

existing makeup of firms rather than testing the various models that explain the organization of

professionals into firms. Specifically we analyze whether obstetrics partnerships promote

matching between heterogeneous consumers (patients) and professionals, as proposed by

Garicano and Santos. In this context, “partnerships” refer to physician group practices that share

costs and revenues in ways that permit referrals without violating anti-kickback regulations that

prevent payments between firms. The three specific types of matching we consider in this paper

are: 1) whether a patient with a specific health condition is assigned to a physician who

specializes in treating that condition; 2) whether a patient who prefers to be treated intensively is

assigned to a physician with an intensive treatment style or skill advantage for that treatment; and

3) whether a patient who is medically appropriate for cesarean section is assigned to a physician

who is skilled at performing that treatment.

        One empirical challenge to identifying producer differentiation, subsequent matching and

their welfare implications is the endogenous matching of workers with jobs (Ackerberg and

Botticini 2003). We rely on simulations to quantify the extent of specialization, and we capitalize

on the random pairing of physicians and patients on weekends to measure physicians’ styles (i.e.

propensity to perform a cesarean section) and skills (as revealed by maternal health outcomes)

without bias due to matching on unobserved patient or physician characteristics. To do this, we

exploit the fact that because the timing of childbirth is uncertain and physicians’ weekend call

schedules are predetermined, most women being treated by a physician in a group practice who

go into labor on the weekend are randomly assigned to a member of the practice who is on call at

the time. We first confirm this feature and then use it to determine whether group practices match


                                                  4
physicians skilled at performing cesarean sections with patients clinically appropriate to receive

the procedure, as well as whether patients with preferences for being treated by cesarean section

match with physicians who have the appropriate treatment style or skill advantage. We also rely

on the random pairing to identify the health benefits of matching specialization by comparing the

health outcomes of high-risk patients randomly assigned to physicians who specialize in that

particular health condition to the outcomes of other high-risk patients in the practice who were

randomly assigned to non-specialists.

           We find that the proportion of high-risk patients matched with a specialist is larger

among internally-differentiated group practices (i.e., practices where some but not all physicians

specialize) than among solo practitioners or homogeneous groups for 11 of the 12 specific health

conditions we examine. This additional matching is most pronounced for health conditions that

develop during a pregnancy, when physicians’ financial disincentives to refer across firms are

largest. Although in most cases this matching does not affect maternal health outcomes during the

delivery or the subsequent hospital stay1, when it does affect maternal health, the magnitudes of

the estimated effects are large.

           We also find that physicians in group practices vary from their fellow group practice

members in treatment style and skill levels. Although we do not find clear evidence that groups

match patients with preferences for cesarean section with physicians who have a high propensity

to perform them (style), our results indicate that they are treated by physicians in the group who

are relatively more skilled at cesarean sections. Likewise, group practices direct patients for

whom cesarean sections are more clinically appropriate to these more skilled physicians. Taken

together, our results indicate that differentiation among physicians within an obstetrics practice

promotes patient-physician matching in ways that improve welfare.

           This paper is structured as follows. Section II provides an overview of obstetrics markets

and Section III describes the data. In Section IV we examine whether group practices promote

                                                        5
physician specialization and whether differentiated groups enhance physician-patient matching

based on patients’ health conditions relative to patients treated by obstetricians in homogeneous

practices. We then analyze the effects of matching and mismatching on mothers’ delivery

outcomes in Section V. In Section VI we examine whether patients in group practices match with

physicians based on patient treatment preferences and physicians’ treatment styles, as well as

based on physicians’ skills and patients’ clinical characteristics. Section VII concludes.



II.      Obstetrics Markets

         Obstetrics markets are characterized by heterogeneous consumers, asymmetric

information, heterogeneous professionals often organized into partnerships, and disincentives for

referrals between practices. These markets differ from the assumptions of the Garicano and

Santos (2004) model in several important ways. First, “self-referral” regulations commonly

known as the “Stark law”2 prohibit both spot markets and retainer contracts between physicians

who are not members of the same group practice. At the same time, payment for prenatal care

typically is bundled with payment for the delivery, with all or almost all of the payments made to

the physician performing the delivery.3 One implication of this is that a physician’s expected

profit-margins are lower at the outset of the pregnancy than they are closer to the delivery.

Because partnerships typically share revenues, members of a group medical practice have no or

smaller financial disincentives to avoid referrals between members of the same group. Together

these provide strong disincentives for a physician to refer outside of but not within his own

practice, particularly later in the pregnancy when the marginal expected profits are higher. As a

result, groups might be especially effective at promoting matching on clinical characteristics that

become known later in a pregnancy, such as preterm gestation, malpositioned fetus, pregnancy-

related hypertension, congenital anomalies or chromosomal abnormalities.4 In addition to these

physician disincentives for late-term referrals across groups, high search costs and switching

costs might discourage patients from changing practices (Wolinsky 1993), which creates an

additional option value from selecting a partnership over a solo physician. Moreover, while

Garicano and Santos (2004) assume consumers are uninformed, expecting mothers are likely to

acquire information regarding their health condition and the characteristics of obstetricians

through a number of sources, including referring primary care physicians, their own experiences,

word-of-mouth, or externally-produced comparisons such as quality report cards (Hoerger and

Howard 1995). Thus we would expect some matching to occur between patients and obstetricians

in homogeneous practices (including solo physicians) based on information that is available to

patients and their referring physicians. Although we cannot observe referrals directly, if the same

amount of information exists ex ante in the market regarding physicians in homogeneous groups

and those in groups with differentiated physicians, the additional matching that occurs in

differentiated groups would be due purely to within-group referrals.

        Groups with differentiated physicians have the potential to promote matching, but

relative to homogeneous groups they also could foster more mismatches because of how group

practices schedule obstetricians, hospital staffing patterns, and the emergent nature of childbirth.

Most obstetrical group practices designate a physician to perform deliveries on all patients from

the practice that go into labor during a particular 24-hour period, although some physicians make

themselves available to perform their patients’ deliveries during the week (but not weekend) even

when not on call (Schauberger, Gribble and Rooney 2007).5 Thus many patients who go into

labor naturally (i.e., without being induced) are randomly assigned to a member of the group

practice, particularly on weekends.

4
  Although risk factors observed at the outset might provide evidence to physicians about the likelihood of
developing hypertension from pregnancy, to our knowledge women have equal observable risk of having a
malpositioned fetus.
5
  In other practices, on weekdays physicians perform deliveries for patients who begin labor between 7am
and 5pm, but rely on physicians on “night call” to cover deliveries during the remaining hours.


                                                     7
        If a patient or the physicians in the group practice want to guarantee that a particular

physician performs a patient’s delivery, they can either schedule a cesarean section or schedule

labor to be induced when the preferred physician is on-call at the hospital. Induced deliveries and

scheduled cesarean sections are much more likely to occur on a weekday than a weekend because

hospitals are staffed more heavily during the week, and many physicians value leisure time on the

weekend more highly. Scheduled cesarean sections and induced deliveries are common, which

means there are many opportunities for intentional matching of patients and physicians on

weekdays. During our 1999-2004 sample period, 17.1 percent of all deliveries in Florida and New

York were scheduled cesarean sections, and almost all of these occurred on a weekday.

Nationally, 20 percent of deliveries in the United States in 2000 were induced, and these were 2.3

times more likely to occur on a weekday than a weekend (Martin et al. 2003).

III.    Data

        We construct our sample from the Florida and New York hospital discharge data sets for

the 1999 to 2004 time period. Our analytic data set contains information on 1.6 million deliveries

that occurred at every non-federal, short-term acute care hospital in those states.6 We observe the

mother’s demographic information (age, race), her insurance coverage (e.g., HMO, Medicaid),

codes for the principal and secondary diagnoses, procedure codes that allow us to determine

whether the baby was delivered vaginally or via cesarean section, a unique physician identifier

that is consistent across hospitals and years, a unique and consistent hospital identifier, and the

quarter and year the patient was discharged. The diagnoses codes allow us to control for objective

health conditions that affect the probability a physician will perform a cesarean section (e.g.,

whether a woman had a cesarean section prior to this delivery, whether the fetus was

malpositioned during the delivery, and whether the labor occurred before the fetus was full-term).


6
  There were a total of 2.38 million deliveries in Florida and New York hospitals between 1999 and 2004.
About 740,000 of these deliveries are excluded from the analysis because the physician performed fewer
than 100 weekend laboring deliveries, a woman received a scheduled cesarean section on a weekend, or we
could not identify the physician who performed the delivery in the physician databases.


                                                   8
Women are much more likely to receive a cesarean section in these situations (Gregory et al.

2002).7

          To minimize concerns about measuring physician specialization, treatment styles and

skill with error, throughout the paper we restrict the analysis to physicians who performed at least

100 deliveries between 1999 and 2004 for patients who went into labor and delivered on

weekends. We rely on the work of others (Henry et al. 1995; Gregory et al. 2002) to determine

whether a woman went into labor. Women who delivered vaginally or had codes indicating fetal

distress, labor abnormalities, cord prolapse, or a breech converted to vertex presentation were

interpreted as having labored.

          Because the physician identifiers are consistent and the data include all hospital

discharges, we are able to examine a physician’s entire inpatient practice. Using the physician

license numbers as a link, we obtained each physician’s telephone number(s) and office name in

April 2005 from the Florida State Licensure Database and American Medical Information, a

private company that tracks physicians for general marketing purposes. Where telephone numbers

or office names were missing, we relied on internet searches conducted in September 2005 and

January 2007 to identify them. If a physician had a unique telephone number in our sample, we

concluded that he is a solo practitioner; physicians who shared the same telephone number were

considered to be in the same group practice.8 Identical practice names and physicians with

multiple telephone numbers were used to identify two or more different locations of the same

practice.9

          A total of 1,655 physicians (930 in New York and 725 in Florida) performed 100 or more

weekend laboring deliveries between 1999 and 2004. On average, each physician performed 796

7
  Regression results below confirm this.
8
  Because physicians who performed fewer than 100 weekend deliveries between 1999 and 2004 are
omitted from the sample, some of the physicians who qualify as being solo practitioners may in fact be in a
group practice with other low-volume obstetricians, or with physicians who do not deliver babies (e.g.,
gynecologists.)
9
  We measure physicians’ practice affiliations with error if they changed between the start of our sample
period (1999) and when we identified them (2005 and 2007).


                                                     9
weekday and 187 weekend laboring deliveries over the six-year period. We identify 12 high-risk

health conditions (e.g., twins) that substantially increase the likelihood that a pregnant woman or

her baby will experience an adverse health outcome during delivery (Gregory et al. 2002). Table

1 reports sample means and standard deviations for patients treated by physicians who met the

threshold volume of weekend deliveries, separately for weekend and weekday deliveries. Overall,

26.2 percent and 17.3 percent of women who delivered during the week or on the weekend,

respectively, had at least one of these 12 conditions. The presence of a high-risk condition

substantially increases the probability that a woman will receive a cesarean section, which is a

surgical procedure, rather than delivering vaginally, and increases the probability that the mother

or the baby will have a negative health outcome during or shortly after the delivery. For example,

among women who delivered on a weekday, 54.6 percent of women who had a high-risk

condition received a cesarean section, versus 21.6 percent of women without a high-risk

condition.

IV.     Matching on Specialization

        Obstetricians can specialize in treating particular types of patients. For example, some

obstetricians perform a relatively large number of deliveries for women who have specific health

risks such as hypertension (high blood pressure, or pre-eclampsia), a malpositioned fetus (e.g., a

breech baby), or antepartum bleeding, while other obstetricians avoid such cases. A physician

who specializes in treating a specific health condition might produce better health outcomes for

the mother or the baby than a physician who avoids such cases, either due to innate skill

differences between obstetricians or from learning-by-doing (e.g., technical proficiency acquired

through experience) (Britt, Eden and Evans 2006). If this occurs, then the welfare effects of

specialization depend on the extent to which women with a particular health condition are able to

match with a physician who specializes in that health condition.




                                                10
         We compare the number of each type of high-risk delivery10 each obstetrician in Florida

and New York actually performed between 1999 and 2004 on weekdays, when patients have

opportunities to choose the delivering physician by scheduling a cesarean section or requesting an

induced delivery, to the number of deliveries expected if patients were randomly assigned to an

obstetrician in the market. An obstetrician is then categorized as a “specialist” if he performs

significantly more high-risk deliveries than expected, an “avoider” if he performs significantly

fewer high-risk deliveries than expected, or a “generalist” otherwise. This allows us to compare

the extent of specialization in group practices versus solo practices. It also defines whether the

practice consists of differentiated or homogeneous physicians. We use this to consider the effects

of within-practice differentiation on the proportion of patients who match (i.e., high-risk patients

assigned to specialist physicians or low-risk patients assigned to avoiders) or mismatch (i.e., high-

risk patients assigned to avoiders or low-risk patients assigned to specialists).

         In each of 1,000 iterations of a simulation, each weekday patient is randomly assigned to

a physician in the patient’s Local Health Council District (LHCD) in Florida, or Health Service

Area (HSA) in New York,11 such that each physician receives his actual number of weekday

patients for each year in the sample period. A physician is defined as a specialist in each of the 12

high-risk conditions if the prevalence of that condition among his actual patients exceeds the 99th

percentile of the simulated prevalence of that condition; an “avoider” if his actual prevalence falls

below the 1st percentile in the simulation; and a generalist otherwise.12

         In Table 2 we report the proportion of physicians who are specialists and avoiders for

each of the 12 high-risk conditions, as well as for the summary indicator of whether a woman has


10
   A delivery is counted separately for each high-risk condition a patient has.
11
   The 11 LHCDs in Florida were formed by the state for purposes of health planning (see
http://www.flhealthplanning.org/). The eight HSAs in New York were formed for a similar purpose. Each
consists of one or more contiguous counties.
12
   Our results are qualitatively similar if we instead set the thresholds at the 95th and 5th percentile, or if we
define the market as the hospital where the physician performs the majority of his deliveries. The
LHCD/HSA and the hospital approaches represent extremes of the possible market, because the former
definition is likely to be too large and the latter too small.



                                                        11
any of the 12 high-risk conditions. The conditions are arranged in descending order according to

the mean number of deliveries performed by a specialist physician over the six-year period

(shown in the last column). The results in the first column of Table 2 indicate that specialization

is infrequent. Based on the unweighted average across the 12 conditions, 13 percent of physicians

are specialists and 22 percent are avoiders. There is variation across conditions, from 7 percent of

physicians specializing in pregnancies with congenital anomalies or chromosomal abnormalities

up to 20 percent specializing in patients with any of the 12 high-risk conditions. The percentage

of physicians who are avoiders likewise ranges from a low of 11 percent for antepartum bleeding

to a high of 32 percent for uterine scarring. The difference in the volume of deliveries for patients

with each high-risk condition between a specialist and an avoider is substantial, as indicated in

the last column. Specialists perform two to 127 times more deliveries, on average, relative to

avoiders.

         In the second and third columns of Table 2 we report the proportions of physicians who

are specialists and avoiders, separately for solo practitioners and members of a group practice.

Physicians in group practices are slightly more likely than solo practitioners to specialize and are

less likely to be avoiders, although we cannot determine whether groups purposefully recruit

physicians different from their existing members or whether the organizational structure

facilitates differentiation. A larger proportion of physicians in group practices specialize in

patients who have a multiple birth, congenital anomalies, or hypertension, predominantly from

pregnancy-related severe hypertension, relative to solo practitioners. None of these risk factors is

observable until later in a pregnancy,13 which is consistent with groups’ referring relatively more

patients within the group when it is particularly costly to refer to a different practice. A smaller

proportion of physicians in group practices are avoiders for 8 of the 13 conditions relative to solo




13
  Of the 12 risk factors for which we have data, malpositioned fetus is the only additional one that is not
observable until later in the pregnancy.


                                                     12
practitioners, whereas the opposite is true for only a single condition. Thus the random

assignment of patients to on-call physicians appears to limit the number of avoiders in groups.14

         With these measures of physician specialization, for each risk factor we then determine

whether group practices are homogeneous (i.e., all specialists, all generalists, or all avoiders) or

differentiated (e.g., a specialist and two generalists). In column 6 and column 7 of Table 2 we

report the proportion of physicians who are specialists and avoiders separately for homogenous

groups and differentiated groups. Across all health conditions, the proportion of physicians in

differentiated groups who are specialists (17 percent) is more than twice that of homogenous

groups (7 percent), and the proportion of physicians in differentiated groups who are avoiders is

almost twice as large (25 percent versus 13 percent).

         To test whether differentiated groups facilitate matching and minimize mismatching, in

Table 3 we report the proportions of high-risk patients delivering on weekdays who are matched

with specialists and mismatched with avoiders, separately for patients of differentiated group

practices versus patients of solo practitioners or homogeneous groups. This indicates how many

more high-risk patients are assigned to an appropriate physician in practices that have chosen to

differentiate themselves and can refer between partners versus practices that by choice cannot

refer within the practice (solo practitioners) or have chosen not to differentiate from one another

(homogeneous group practices). On weekdays, differentiated groups achieve much greater

matching than solo practitioners and homogeneous groups. The proportion of high-risk patients

who are assigned to a specialist is higher among patients of differentiated group practices overall

and for 11 of the 12 individual high-risk health conditions. On average, the share of high-risk

patients who match with a specialist is 12 percentage points higher in differentiated group versus

solo or homogeneous group practices. Four of the five largest differences in matching rates occur


14
  About 25% of deliveries performed by physicians in solo practices were for mothers with at least one of
the 12 high-risk conditions, compared with 26% for physicians in group practice, suggesting that the
differences in specialization do not stem from solo practitioners’ positioning themselves to have healthier
patients in general.


                                                    13
in the conditions that develop late in a pregnancy, where members of a group practice do not face

the financial disincentives to refer that physicians in homogeneous practices do: multiple fetuses

(28 percentage point difference), malpositioned fetus (23 percentage point difference),

pregnancy-related severe hypertension (17 percentage point difference), and preterm gestation

(15 percentage point difference).

        High-risk patients in differentiated practices are slightly less likely to be assigned to

avoiders (i.e., to mismatch) than those in homogeneous practices. Patients of differentiated group

practices have a five percentage point lower mismatch rate than patients in homogeneous

practices for the summary high-risk health measure, and the differentiated group mismatch rate is

significantly lower for 5 of the individual measures of patient risk. These results are consistent

with models of partnerships that form to lower the barriers to referrals among differentiated

members (Garicano and Santos 2004).15

V.      Matching and Mothers’ Health Outcomes

        Given these differences in matching and mismatching due to within-firm specialization,

we next analyze whether and how matching and mismatching affect mothers’ health during the

delivery and subsequent hospital stay. Our identification of the health effect relies on random

pairings of particular types of patients (based on whether they have a specific high-risk health

condition) with a given type of physician (specialist, generalist, or avoider for that health

condition) to eliminate differences in unobservable patient characteristics between physicians in a

group due to referrals or other sources of patient-practice matching. As a result, we restrict the

sample to group practice patients who delivered on the weekend, because typically these patients

are randomly assigned to a physician within the group.



15
   We also compared the matching rates separately for patients who are uninsured or have Medicaid
insurance versus patients with private health insurance, and found them to be similar. This suggests that
maternal income and education do not appear to be important for creating matches, and that the benefits of
within-group referrals do not vary by socioeconomic status. These results are available from the authors by
request.


                                                    14
        A small number of weekend deliveries are scheduled for a cesarean section or

inducement, where scheduling can permit the patient and the physician to match intentionally.16

Thus we further restrict the weekend sample to deliveries where a woman goes into labor, thereby

excluding scheduled weekend cesarean sections and reducing the amount of non-random pairing

in this sample. Because we cannot observe from the discharge data whether a delivery was

induced, a small part of the weekend laboring sample might contain non-randomly-paired patients

and physicians. To ameliorate the potential for bias, we further restrict the sample to groups that

simulations indicate assign their weekend laboring patients randomly. The analysis considers only

within-group differences, because call schedules assign patients to physicians randomly only

within a group practice, and patient sorting into groups is likely to occur on the basis of

unobserved characteristics that affect outcomes. As a result, only internally-differentiated groups

can be used to identify the health benefits of matching.

        Whether a group is internally-differentiated and randomly assigns its patients is

determined separately for each health condition we examine. To identify and exclude any groups

that do not randomly pair weekend patients with physicians, we perform 1,000 iterations of a

simulation that randomly assigns a group’s weekend, laboring patients to the physicians in that

group, where the yearly number of simulated patients assigned to each physician equals his actual

volume of weekend laboring cases. After each iteration we record the mean patient characteristics

for each physician (e.g., the proportion of his patients who have antepartum bleeding, severe

pregnancy-induced hypertension, or a malpositioned fetus). Group practices with at least one

physician whose actual mean for a particular health condition is below the 5th percentile or above

the 95th percentile of the physician-specific distribution of the simulated mean of that health

condition are considered to violate the assumption that weekend patients are randomly assigned

for that health condition, and are excluded from the outcomes analysis. We perform this test for


16
   Previous studies indicate that most induced deliveries nationally occur on weekdays, when hospitals are
staffed more heavily (Martin et al. 2003).


                                                    15
ten of the 12 high-risk health conditions separately as well as for an indicator of whether a patient

has any of the 12 conditions. We omit the two health conditions where specialists are most

infrequent and have very low patient volumes: uterine scarring (a mean of 7.5 deliveries over a

six-year period for specialists) and congenital anomalies or chromosomal abnormalities (a mean

of 6 deliveries over a six-year period for specialists).

        To measure mothers’ outcomes, we use a coding system established by HealthGrades

(2007) to determine whether or not a woman experienced an adverse outcome during the delivery

or subsequent hospitalization. This system identifies 66 discrete diagnosis codes for adverse

outcomes for a cesarean section and 64 discrete diagnosis codes for adverse outcomes for a

vaginal delivery. Examples include injury to pelvic organs, rupture of the uterus, 4th degree

perineal laceration, anemia due to acute loss of blood, or major puerperal infection. In our

sample, adverse outcomes for the mother during or shortly after delivery occurred for 10.3

percent of deliveries where a woman went into labor and delivered on the weekend. To create a

single summary measure of mothers’ outcomes that allows the utility loss to vary across the

different adverse events, we conduct regressions of the form

        (1) Oi = φ 0 + φ1 Ri + Fi + ε 1

where Oi is the number of days that a woman spends in the hospital following a delivery, Ri is a

vector of indicator variables for whether the woman experienced each of the adverse events

specified by Health Grades, and Fi represents hospital fixed effects. This approach assumes that

the utility loss from an adverse event is proportional to the marginal effect of that event on the

length of a mother’s hospital stay, controlling for the hospital of admission.

        We estimate these regressions separately by state and delivery mode (i.e., vaginal and

cesarean section) using data from 1998, the year prior to the beginning of our sample. Results are

reported in Appendix A. In the cesarean section regressions, the coefficients are greater than 0.50

and significantly different from zero for 20 of the adverse outcomes in Florida and 19 in New




                                                  16
York, whereas in both Florida and New York 11 events in the vaginal delivery regressions have a

positive coefficient of that magnitude. That is, these events are associated with a woman spending

at least an extra half day in the hospital following the delivery. To generate a single, continuous

measure of each woman’s health outcome, we multiply the vector of adverse outcome

coefficients from the 1998 regressions by the vector of indicator variables for whether the woman

in the 1999-2004 sample actually experienced each adverse event, so that larger values indicating

a worse outcome.17

         With measures of patient types, physician types, and mothers’ outcomes, we analyze the

impact of matching on mothers’ health with regressions of the form

         (2) Ôi = σ0 + σ1Hi + σ2Sj + σ3Aj + σ4Hi*Sj + σ5Hi*Aj + σ 6Xi + σ7Y + σ8G + ε2

where Ôi is the predicted incremental length of stay due to adverse events experienced by a

patient estimated in equation (1), Hi is an indicator of whether a patient has high-risk condition i;

Sj and Aj are indicators for specialist and avoider physicians, respectively (with generalist

physicians as the reference category); Xi is a vector of characteristics of the patient and her

delivering physician; and G is a vector of group practice fixed effects. The vector Xi includes an

indicator of whether the physician is female, years of physician experience and its quadratic, an

indicator if experience is missing, an indicator for New York patients, calendar year indicators, a

patient’s age and its quadratic, an indicator if age is missing, an indicator is a patient is a minority

(black or Hispanic) and an indicator if race/ethnicity is missing, indicators for whether a patient is

uninsured or covered by Medicaid, an indicator for whether the patient has had a previous

cesarean section, and indicators for each of the other 11 high-risk conditions. It is worth repeating

that we classify physicians as specialists, generalists or avoiders on their weekday deliveries,



17
  As a robustness check, we also create a dichotomous outcome variable measuring whether a woman
experienced any of the major adverse outcomes, where major is defined as an outcome with an incremental
effect on length of stay (φ1 ) of 0.5 or greater. The overall pattern of results with this dependent variable
was similar.


                                                     17
when intentional matching occurs, whereas we examine the impact of matching due to within-

group differentiation on outcomes based on weekend deliveries, where our simulation has

validated the assumption that the call schedule randomly assigns high- and low-risk patients to

physicians within the practice.

         We rely on linear models to test the effects of matching on mothers’ outcomes. Because

the dependent variable is generated from the predicted coefficients from equation (1), we correct

for heteroskedasticity by weighting each observation in equation (2) by the inverse of the

standard error of the prediction of Ôi (Mayda 2006).18 Robust standard errors are calculated,

however no clustering is done: despite the hierarchical nature of the data, the intra-group

correlation coefficients of the regression residuals are all zero, indicating that clustering is

unnecessary and inefficient, particularly with the large number of patients per group.19

         If the following hold: (1) assigning a patient who has a particular (observed) health

condition to a physician within the practice who specializes in that condition (i.e., matching)

improves the patient’s delivery outcome, (2) assigning such a patient to an avoider (i.e.,

mismatching) worsens her outcome, (3) assigning a patient who does not have a particular health

condition to a physician within the practice who avoids that condition (i.e., matching) improves

the patient’s delivery outcome, and (4) assigning such a patient to a specialist (i.e., mismatching)

worsens her outcome, then we would expect the following results:

     -   σ2 > 0: low-risk patient outcomes are worse when randomly assigned to a specialist
         physician (i.e., a mismatch) rather than a generalist physician (the omitted category)
     -   σ3 < 0: low-risk patient outcomes are better when randomly assigned to an avoider (i.e., a
         match) rather than a generalist
     -   σ3 - σ2 < 0: low-risk patient outcomes are better when randomly assigned to an avoider
         rather than a specialist
     -   σ4 < 0: high-risk patient outcomes are better when randomly assigned to a specialist (i.e.,
         a match) rather than a generalist
     -   σ5 > 0: high-risk patient outcomes are worse when randomly assigned to an avoider (i.e.,
         a mismatch) rather than a generalist

18
   The pattern of results from these weighted least squares estimates was not different from the pattern of
estimates using robust standard errors alone to account for heteroskedasticity.

   Hansen (2007) provides additional details.

     -   σ4 - σ5 < 0: high-risk patient outcomes are better when randomly assigned to a specialist
         rather than an avoider.


         In Table 4 we report estimated coefficients and robust standard errors separately for a

woman’s delivery outcome if she has one of 10 specific health conditions, as well as whether she

has any high-risk condition. Overall, the results provide some evidence that matching improves

mothers’ outcomes and mismatching harms them. Of the 66 tests of the hypotheses listed above

(i.e., six tests in 11 regressions), the hypotheses are accepted at the five-percent level in seven

instances (10.6 percent), while providing statistically significant counterfactual evidence in only

one (1.5 percent) instance, indicating that the counterfactual findings are likely due to chance

while the supporting results are not

         The benefits of matching occur primarily from assigning low-risk patients to avoider

physicians as opposed to generalist or specialist physicians. Specifically, matching low-risk

patients with avoider physicians (σ3 < 0, or σ3 – σ2 < 0) significantly (at the five-percent level)

improves outcomes for women who do not have any high-risk condition, any hypertension, a

malpositioned fetus, or antepartum bleeding. Surprisingly, there is only one instance (for an

unengaged fetal head) of a statistically significant (at the five-percent level) benefit from

matching high-risk patients with specialists rather than generalists (σ4 < 0), and even here the

difference between a specialist and avoider is insignificant. Contrary to the hypotheses above, in

one case there is a statistically significant benefit associated with mismatching: assigning a

woman with any hypertension to a physician who avoids that condition rather than a specialist is

associated with improved outcomes, although being assigned to an avoider is not statistically

different from a generalist. Finally, there is only one case where mismatching has negative health

consequences for the mother: assigning a woman who does not have antepartum bleeding to a

specialist rather than a generalist (α2 > 0) is associated with worse outcomes.20


20
  Mismatching a pregnancy without unengaged fetal head to a specialist also has worse outcomes at the
ten-percent level.


                                                  19
        When they exist, the positive benefits of matching and the negative consequences of

mismatching are large. Based on the mean of the dependent variable for women who do not have

the specific health condition, there are large predicted improvements in a mother’s delivery

outcome if she is matched with an avoider physician rather than a specialist for any hypertension

(22 percent fewer predicted days in the hospital due to complications), malpositioned fetus (23

percent), or antepartum bleeding (52 percent). Similarly, mothers without any of the 12 risk

factors experience 19 percent fewer predicted hospital days due to complications when paired

with an avoider physician who treats few patients with any high-risk factors rather than a

generalist. In the one instance of negative consequences of mismatching, a woman who does not

have antepartum bleeding is predicted to spend 41 percent more days in the hospital due to

complications if assigned to a physician who specializes in that risk factor relative to being

assigned to a generalist.

        Our approach measures the effect of within-group specialization on the outcomes of

women who go into labor and deliver on the weekend. The results are likely to underestimate the

overall benefits of specialization and matching and underestimate the costs associated with

mismatching for several reasons. First, groups might respond to the potential risks of mismatches

for certain patients and assign them to specific physicians by inducing or scheduling their

deliveries during the week, as supported by the observed differences in the health conditions of

weekday and weekend patients (Table 1). If groups do this for the patients who benefit the most

from matching, then the weekend estimates, which rely on random assignment for the remaining

patients, should be lower-bound estimates of the benefits of non-random matching on health

characteristics. That is, we estimate the benefits of specialization and matching on a relatively

healthy group of patients who may benefit less from matching than the average patient. This also

holds true if matching occurs across groups for conditions that are known at the outset of the

woman’s pregnancy. Second, we consider matching only along a single dimension (either a single

risk factor, or an indicator for the presence of any risk factor) at a time, but the health outcomes


                                                 20
might depend on successful matching across multiple dimensions simultaneously.21 Third, we

observe matching only for the delivery itself, whereas matching for prenatal care might also be

important.22 Fourth, because of data limitations, we do not observe the delivery and subsequent

health outcome of the baby, who may be the primary beneficiary of specialization and matching.

         The benefits of matching in Table 4 occur primarily from matching low-risk patients (i.e.,

patients who do not have a specific health condition) with avoider physicians. This raises the

question of whether group practices are better able to facilitate such matches relative to solo

practitioners for weekday deliveries, when the greatest opportunity for within-group referrals

exists. To address this question we replicated Table 3 for low-risk instead of high-risk patients.

As shown in Table 5, low-risk patients in differentiated group practices are generally more likely

to be matched with an avoider physician than in solo or homogeneous group practices.

Differentiated groups have higher matching for 10 of the 12 risk factors individually, although

homogenous practices have a higher matching rate for the summary measure. Differentiated

groups are significantly more likely to match low-risk patients with avoider physicians for

antepartum bleeding (20% vs. 9%, p<0.001) and a malpositioned fetus (23% vs. 19%, p<0.001),

the conditions with the largest benefits of matching. For the other two risk factors where

matching significantly affected mothers’ health (any hypertension and unengaged fetal head),

however, homogeneous practices achieved greater matching. Similarly, low-risk patients in

differentiated groups are much more likely to be mismatched with a specialist for most conditions




21
   However, patient risk factors do not correlate highly. Only two pairs had correlations of at least 0.10
(multiples and malpositioned fetus, ρ=0.10, and multiples and preterm gestation, ρ=0.13).
22
   In order to address this issue, we created an indicator variable if there is a specialist (and separately for
an avoider) for a particular health condition in the patient’s practice, regardless of whether that specialist
actually delivered the baby on the weekend. These variables were interacted with the vector of dummies for
the patient’s health condition. Results from these models for the effects of matching for the delivery were
qualitatively similar to those reported in Table 4, and they indicated little additional effect due to the
potential to match for prenatal care.

including for antepartum bleeding (14% vs. 8%, p<0.001), where these mismatches resulted in

worse outcomes for mothers.23

V.      Matching on Style and Skill

A.       Within-group matching by physician cesarean section style and unobserved patient

        preferences

        There might be benefits of specialization beyond those based on a patient’s observed

health condition and a physician’s experience treating that condition. In this section we examine

whether group practices facilitate two other types of matching: directing patients who prefer to be

treated aggressively to physicians who have such treatment styles; and directing patients with

those preferences or high-risk patients to physicians who are skilled in a particular delivery

method (cesarean sections).

        Previous research suggests that obstetricians differ substantially in their treatment style,

defined as their propensity to perform a cesarean section conditional on a patient’s pre-delivery

health condition, although these measures might be biased due to patient-physician matching on

unobserved characteristics (Grant 2005; Epstein and Nicholson 2005). If patients have

homogeneous preferences for this dimension of a physician’s treatment style and there is a single

style that produces the best expected outcome for all types of patients, then this variation reduces

welfare. Although we are not aware of any research that has examined preferences for cesarean

sections specifically, mothers have strong, heterogeneous preferences for related factors in

obstetrics, such as the site of delivery (e.g., Donaldson, Hundley, and Mapp 1998; Miller 2006).

This suggests that some of the observed differentiation in physicians’ treatment styles might arise

when women with different preferences match with physicians who have particular styles. Such

differentiation would improve welfare (Wolinsky 1993).




23
  Differentiated groups were actually less likely to mismatch pregnancies with unengaged fetal head (15%
vs. 17%, p<0.001), which also had marginally significant negative health effects from such mismatching.


                                                   22
           We use the same data set to examine whether group practices with differentiated

physicians promote the matching of patients based on obstetricians’ style and skill. Our measure

of an obstetrician’s style is his risk-adjusted cesarean section rate for patients randomly paired

with him: that is, the probability that a patient who labors on the weekend would receive a

cesarean section if treated by the physician, controlling for the mother’s observed characteristics.

A cesarean section is a surgical procedure and, all else equal, is more expensive than a vaginal

delivery, requires a longer recovery period, and presents increased health risks for the mother. In

certain clinical situations, however, a cesarean section improves the expected health of the mother

and infant.

           The cesarean section rates in Florida and New York have increased sharply since the

mid-1990s. As of 2004, cesarean sections accounted for 34.4 percent of all deliveries in Florida,

as displayed in Figure 1. Cesarean sections either can be scheduled in advance of labor or can

occur after a woman goes into labor. The recent increase in the Florida cesarean section rate has

been driven primarily by a doubling of the scheduled cesarean section rate, from 10.9 percent in

1996 to 24.8 percent of all deliveries in 2004. Scheduled cesarean sections now account for about

two-thirds of all cesarean sections in Florida. Figure 1 also shows the percentage of total

deliveries that are scheduled cesarean sections separately for women with and without a high-risk

condition.24 The latter, sometimes referred to as “patient-choice” cesarean sections, now

constitute slightly more than one-half of all scheduled cesarean sections in Florida. Figure 2

shows comparable data on deliveries at in New York hospitals. Although cesarean sections are

used less frequently in New York than in Florida, the basic patterns in cesarean section rates over

time are similar between the two states.

           To generate each physician’s treatment style (cesarean section propensity), we perform

cross-sectional ordinary least squares regressions for all patients, separately for Florida and New



24
     We consider a woman to be high-risk if she has one or more of the 12 health conditions listed in Table 1.


                                                       23
York and separately for weekend deliveries for mothers who went into labor and weekday

deliveries (Baicker, Buckles, and Chandra 2006):

         (3) Cis = βjJ+ βpsXi + βysY + ε3s

         (4) Cdis = βdjJ + βdpsXi + βdysY + ε4s

         Cis is an indicator variable for whether a patient i in state s received a cesarean section; J

is a full vector of physician fixed effects; X is a vector of patient characteristics that affect the

likelihood of receiving a cesarean section (age, race, indicators for whether age or race were

missing, type of health insurance, and health conditions); Y is a vector of fixed effects for year of

delivery; and the superscript d refers to weekday deliveries. The coefficient estimates of the

patient characteristics from equations (3) and (4) are reported in Appendix B. From these

estimates we generate a predicted propensity to receive a cesarean section for each patient,

conditional on the patient’s characteristics and holding fixed the physician’s treatment style:

Cˆ is = βˆ j J * + βˆ ps X i + βˆ ys Yi for weekend laboring patients in state s, and

Cˆ isd = βˆ jd J * + βˆ psd X i + βˆ ysd Yi for weekday patients, where J* represents a physician selected

arbitrarily from J. The overall median predicted cesarean section propensity was 0.140.

         Among group practices that assign their weekend patients randomly, Equation 3 allows

us to measure group members’ treatment styles as if they were to treat an identical patient

population. Specifically, the coefficients on the physician indicators, βˆ j , in the weekend

regressions measure the average adjusted probability that physician j performed a cesarean

section on a patient randomly-assigned within the group practice, controlling for observed patient

characteristics. Thus differences in βˆ j within a given medical group should be due to differences

in style, i.e., physicians’ perceptions about how to treat a common set of patients who labor,

rather than due to within-practice physician-patient matching based on unobservable

characteristics. Therefore, only the 407 physicians in group practices that assign their weekend




                                                       24
patients randomly based on patients’ predicted cesarean section propensity are included in the

following analyses, where we use the simulation method described in Section III to identify

practices that randomize.25

           Because the randomness of the call schedule can eliminate unobserved differences in

patient characteristics only across physicians in a given group, we repeat the estimates of

equations (3) and (4) but replace the physician fixed effects with group practice fixed effects.

With these results, we then generate the group-demeaned measures of each physician’s c-section

       (          )
style, βˆ j − βˆ g , where the subscript g refers to a group practice. We find a degree of within-

group variation across physicians’ c-section style, spanning -0.024 (i.e., 2.4 percentage points) at

the 10th percentile to 0.021 at the 90th percentile, with a mean of -0.001 and a standard deviation

of 0.019.

           With measures of physicians’ treatment styles, we consider whether patients match with

physicians whose styles are consistent with their preferences. For example, a patient who places a

high cost on the adverse outcomes associated with a cesarean section could reduce the probability

she will have a cesarean section by scheduling her labor to be induced by a conservative

obstetrician with a low cesarean section style, or she may request that a particular physician

perform the delivery if she goes into labor during the week. Conversely, a woman in good health

who wants to avoid laboring altogether might be matched to a physician in the practice willing to

perform a patient-choice cesarean section.26

           If patients with particular preferences match within groups with physicians who have

commensurate treatment styles, patients who want intensive treatment would match with

physicians who have a large/positive βˆ j relative to their colleagues within the group practice

25
   One limitation of investigating within-firm heterogeneity and matching in this context is that many of the
firms are small: 45% of these physicians are in groups of 2, and the mean number of physicians in the
group is 3.2.
26
   An obstetrician quoted in a 2003 New York Times article confirms that these types of decisions occur:
“Obstetrics has become very consumer-driven. When a woman can’t get what she wants from one doctor,
she’ll go to another” (Brody 2003).


                                                     25
(βˆ   j        )
          − βˆ g , and patients who want less intensive treatment would match with physicians who

have a small/negative βˆ j . As a result, a physician who performs many patient-choice scheduled


                                                                        (          )
cesarean sections on weekdays, for example, would have a large βˆ jd − βˆ gd because his actual

proportion of cesarean sections will exceed the predicted proportion based on his patients’

observed characteristics, and vice versa for physicians who are attracting patients who want to be

treated conservatively.

             As a result, if group practices promote matching based on patient preferences and

physician styles, there would be more variation across physicians in a group in their weekday

cesarean section rates when there are ample opportunities for patients and physicians to

intentionally match than in their weekend rates: σdg/σg > 1 where σdg = variance(βdj | g).27 This

should be true even when cesarean section rates are adjusted for observed patient characteristics,

because patients with unobserved preferences will be matching with specific physicians.

Physician treatment styles on the weekend are measured less precisely than weekday styles

because the weekend sample size is substantially smaller. Therefore, we report the results of the

variance test both without and with a Bayesian shrinkage adjustment. The Bayesian shrinkage

adjustment will move a physician’s treatment style toward the sample mean if it has a low signal-

to-noise ratio (Hofer et al. 1999), which may result in less variation between physicians on the

weekend (due to a relatively small sample size) relative to the weekday.

             Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests reject normality of the distributions of these group-level

ratios of the weekday and weekend variances in physician cesarean section style. Consequently,

we report results from the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank tests in Panel A of Table 6.

These reject the hypothesis that σdg > σg. We confirm this by testing whether the median group’s

ratio of the weekend to weekday intra-group variances is equal to one, where we bootstrap the

27
  We would also expect σdg to exceed σg if patients with unobserved health characteristics that increase the
expected marginal benefit of cesarean sections to match with physicians who have a high propensity to
perform cesarean sections to improve their expected health outcome.

standard errors with 1,000 iterations. Results are similar when we consider only groups of three

or more physicians. These results are not consistent with sorting based on unobserved patient

preferences for physician treatment styles.

         One shortcoming of testing whether the weekday and weekend variances are equal is that

the variables are affected by both physician and patient decisions. For example, physicians with

high cesarean section styles might convince some of their patients that do not have strong

preferences for cesarean sections to schedule cesarean sections during the week. If this

phenomenon accounts for the similar variance between weekday and weekend treatment styles,

the welfare benefits are more ambiguous than they would be if the differences are driven by well-

informed patients.28

                                                            (                      )
         We therefore also test whether the correlation βˆ j − βˆ g , Q dj − Q gd is greater than zero,

where (Qdj – Qdg) is the difference between the number of weekday scheduled patient-choice

cesarean sections physician j performs and the average of his group practice. Finding that

physicians who perform more cesarean sections relative to their colleagues on randomly-assigned

laboring weekend patients also perform a large number of scheduled weekday patient-choice

cesarean sections would suggest that patient preferences are driving the matches. Scheduled high-

risk cesarean sections, on the other hand, could be initiated by either a patient or a physician.

                                                                  (                     )
         In Panel B of Table 6 we report the correlations of βˆ j − βˆ g , Q dj − Q gd for all cesarean

sections and each type of cesarean section separately. The correlations are significantly different

from zero for all cesarean sections and for both high-risk and patient-choice cesarean sections.

The latter are presumably initiated by the patient. Low-risk patients who nevertheless want an

28
   The ambiguity results from the fact that physicians with higher cesarean section propensities might also
have greater skill for cesarean sections than vaginal deliveries, thus leading to better outcomes (Chandra
and Staiger 2007), but this could be offset by the mothers’ preferences for a vaginal delivery. However, the
correlation of physicians’ cesarean section style and skill measures, relative to their peers’, is 0.05
(p=0.32), where the positive coefficient indicates that those with worse cesarean section outcomes tend to
perform more cesarean sections on their randomly-paired weekend laboring patients. This low correlation
allows us to separately test matching based on style and skill, which we investigate in the analysis that
follows.


                                                    27
elective cesarean section appear to match with a physician in the practice who has a style inclined

toward cesarean sections. This supports the interpretation that patient preferences create some of

the observed variation in obstetricians’ treatment styles. Physicians in the sample performed an

average of 13.6 weekday patient-choice cesarean sections per year. A physician who is at the 90th

percentile of the difference between his own weekend cesarean section rate and that of his group

is predicted to perform 8.8 more weekday patient choice cesarean sections per year than his

colleague who is at the 10th percentile of the distribution.29 This represents a fairly large (65

percent) increase in a physician’s annual quantity of patient-choice cesarean sections. The

apparent discrepancy between Panels A and B of Table 6 in whether unobserved patient

preferences contribute to weekday matching is due to the fact that physicians with styles geared

toward cesarean sections also perform a higher total volume of weekday deliveries relative to

their peers (ρ=0.12, p=0.019). The result is that these physicians’ weekday cesarean section

volumes are higher but their weekday styles are not farther from their group’s average , because

the definition of style depends on the total volume as well.



B.        Within-group matching by physician cesarean section skill

         We also test whether group practices match physicians and patients based on skill and

patients’ clinical characteristics and/or their unobserved preferences. Specifically, we first

examine whether a groups’ patients are matched with physicians during the week based on a

physician’s absolute or comparative advantage in performing cesarean section deliveries, relative

to his peers in his group, and the appropriateness of a c-section for the patient, predicted from

equation (4) above. To examine this, we estimate:

         (5) Oˆ i = ξ 0 m + ξ1m X i + ξ jm J + ε 5 m ,


29
  To calculate this, we regressed (Qdj – Qdg) on (βj – βg) and used the estimated coefficients to generate
predicted values of (Qdj – Qdg) at the 10th and 90th percentiles of (βj – βg). At the 10th percentile of (βj – βg)
(-0.027), the predicted value of (Qdj – Qdg) was -4.45, and at the 90th percentile of (βj – βg) (0.024), the
predicted value of (Qdj – Qdg) was 4.31.


                                                         28
separately by mode of delivery m for laboring weekend patients of groups that randomly assign

their weekend patients to physicians. Ôi is a woman’s delivery outcome generated from equation

(1) above; X is a vector of patient characteristics; J is a full set of physician indicator variables; ξjc

is the physician’s skill at performing cesarean sections; and ξjv is his skill at performing vaginal

deliveries. Lower values of Ôi indicate better outcomes. A physician will have a negative ξjc if

his patients who deliver by cesarean section have fewer or less severe complications than

expected given the patients’ observed pre-delivery health. Because we rely on the random within-

group pairing of physicians with patients who labor on the weekend, as before we restrict the

analysis to those groups that randomly assign patients based on clinical factors. Because this

identification strategy eliminates unobserved differences across physicians in the same group

only, we continue to examine group-demeaned measures of skill by repeating equation (5) to

          (          )
generate ξ jc − ξ gc .

         Physicians vary substantially in their skill at performing cesarean sections. For example,

weekend patients randomly assigned to physicians at the 10th percentile of the distribution of the

absolute advantage measure of skill average 0.20 more hospital days due to complications than

the group’s average than those treated by physicians at the 90th percentile, and the standard

deviation of this distribution is 0.10.

         To consider matching based on absolute advantage and the appropriateness of a cesarean

                                                           (                      )
section for a patient, we test whether the correlation ξ jc − ξ gc , Cˆ djs − Cˆ gsd is less than zero.

Results in Table 7 Panel A indicate that physicians with better weekend outcomes treat patients

for whom cesarean deliveries are more appropriate during the week, supporting the hypothesis

that weekday patients match with physicians based on skill and observed clinical characteristics.

This is consistent with group practices internally referring the most difficult cesarean section

cases to physicians who are skilled at performing cesarean sections. We also consider matching




                                                     29
based on absolute advantage and patient preferences by examining whether the correlation

(ξ   jc                    )                              (          )
          − ξ gc , β jsd − β gsd is less than zero. The term β jsd − β gsd is the physician’s group-demeaned,

risk-adjusted weekday cesarean section rate, which reflects differences in patients’ preferences.

Results in Table 7 suggest that this type of matching occurs.

             Alternative interpretations exist for both of these measures of matching based on skill.

Both correlations would also be negative if skill is acquired by learning through performing more

cases. Likewise the second correlation could be negative if physicians more highly skilled at

cesarean sections are more likely to perform them, holding observed and unobserved patient

characteristics fixed. Neither of these alternatives is supported by the correlation (ξjc – ξgc, Qdjc –

Qdgc), which indicates that physicians who perform more weekday patient-choice cesarean

sections did not have better weekend outcomes (ρ=-0.056, P=0.256). Likewise, the negative and

insignificant relationship between physicians’ cesarean section skill and style reported above does

not support the alternative explanation that physician treatment decisions rather than unobserved

patient preferences account for the higher propensity for physicians more highly skilled at

cesarean sections to also have higher weekday risk-adjusted cesarean section rates.

             Because absolute advantage in cesarean section skill ignores opportunity costs, we repeat

this analysis using physicians’ comparative advantage for cesarean sections over vaginal

                                             ⎛ξ    ξ ⎞
deliveries relative to his peers, defined as ⎜ jc − gc ⎟ . Results in Panel B of Table 7 are similar
                                             ⎜ξ        ⎟
                                             ⎝ jv ξ gv ⎠

to those in Panel A but smaller in size and significance. This greater importance of absolute

advantage is consistent with existing theory, which predicts that absolute advantage will be a

better proxy for optimal assignment than comparative advantage (MacDonald and Markusen

1985, Sattinger 1993.) Together these results suggest that groups match patients to physicians

based on their skill in welfare-increasing ways.

VI.     Conclusion

        In this paper we observed a professional services market in which firms play an important

role in coordinating differentiated high-skilled workers due to barriers in markets that derive from

imperfect or asymmetric information, incentives, and regulation. We found that the greatest

amount of additional matching due to firm coordination occurred in situations where regulations

and payment methods created the highest financial barriers to across-firm referrals. Specifically,

obstetrics partnerships appear to facilitate greater matching by promoting within-group referrals

and pairing specialized physicians with high-risk patients, particularly for health conditions that

become known only later in the pregnancy. In addition to matching based on patient and

physician clinical characteristics, we found some evidence of matching within groups along other

dimensions. Internally-differentiated partnerships appropriately matched patients with observed

clinical characteristics and unobserved preferences to physicians based on physicians’ absolute

skill advantage. However, the extent to which partnerships promoted matching based on

unobserved patient preferences and physician style was ambiguous.30 Despite the institutional

peculiarities of obstetrics markets, these results are consistent with a number of related theoretical

and empirical studies in other settings. Additional work could consider whether matching in this

context is also influenced by organizational characteristics other than the degree of specialization,

or the presence of a managerial hierarchy (Garicano and Hubbard, 2007).

        Partnerships of heterogeneous obstetricians and subsequent patient-physician matching

enhances welfare via both improved maternal health outcomes and greater incorporation of

patient preferences. Yet it remains unclear whether the overall level of differentiation across

physicians in obstetrics markets is optimal. Such issues are important to consider as various

technologies are developed to standardize physician treatment decisions. Similarly, from the

perspective of the industrial organization of and labor force planning for obstetrics, it remains


30
  The identification strategy precluded a direct comparison between the degree of matching in groups with
differentiated physicians with the degree in homogeneous groups and solo practices.


                                                   31
unclear whether greater matching and welfare would result from more within-firm heterogeneity,

more consolidation of physicians into larger partnerships, or expanded scope of existing

partnerships (Farrell and Scotchmer 1988).

        One reason for this ambiguity is due to the random pairing of patients and physicians

within obstetrics partnerships. While econometrically convenient to generate unbiased measures

of physicians’ styles and skills, it also incorporates a tradeoff into partnerships’ decisions about

the degree of internal differentiation. Referring patients between physicians allows a group

practice to match patients with appropriate physicians during the week, but this also creates

mismatches from patients and physicians being paired randomly due to call schedules on week

nights and weekends. We found that differentiated groups were less likely than solo practices to

have “avoider” physicians who treat fewer high-risk patients than expected, and more likely to

match low-risk patients with specialists. This random pairing of patients and physicians for

deliveries also might results in less heterogeneity than in other high-skilled labor markets.

Alternatively, the non-emergent nature of pregnancy, as opposed to the delivery itself, likely

contributes to more matching relative to other high-skilled labor markets, particularly in

medicine.

Notes: Ordinary least squares results for incremental length of stay due to major complications, controlling for group practice fixed effects, state, year, and
patient and physician characteristics listed in the text. To account for heteroskedasticity, each observation is weighted by the inverse of the standard error
of the dependent variable, which is the prediction from an auxiliary regression.
Robust standard errors in brackets.
