                                              ABSTRACT

John Ford and Alfred Hitchcock were experimental filmmakers: both believed images were more important
to movies than words, and considered movies a form of entertainment. Their styles developed gradually
over long careers, and both made the films that are generally considered their greatest during their
late 50s and 60s. In contrast, Orson Welles and Jean-Luc Godard were conceptual filmmakers: both
believed words were more important to their films than images, and both wanted to use film to educate
their audiences. Their greatest innovations came in their first films, as Welles made the revolutionary
Citizen Kane when he was 26, and Godard made the equally revolutionary Breathless when he was
30. Film thus provides yet another example of an art in which the most important practitioners have
had radically different goals and methods, and have followed sharply contrasting life cycles of creativity.

       The division between experimental and conceptual filmmakers can be traced back to the

earliest practitioners of the new art. A short history of French film began with the observation

that “Louis Lumière (1864-1948) has as strong a claim as anyone to the title of inventor of the

cinema.” Shortly thereafter, the volume continued:

               The second great figure in the French cinema, Georges Méliès (1861-1938), forms
               such a striking contrast to Lumière that their names are often used to define two
               major tendencies in the cinema. Where Lumière is concerned to portray life as it
               really is, Méliès deals with fantasy and imagination. He replaced his predecessor’s
               sober concern for everyday reality with his own taste for spectacle.1

Similarly, Gerald Mast and Bruce Kawin later wrote that

               If Lumière documented the world, Méliès transformed it. If Lumière established
               that the camera could record a factual record of an event, Méliès proved that the
               camera could create an event that never happened. Lumière set the pattern for
               realism; Méliès opened the door to the impossible. Méliès gave the cinema the
               tools of fantasy, illusion, and distortion.2

Interestingly, when the conceptual Orson Welles made a genealogical chart to trace the major

branches of cinema, he identified as his ancestors Méliès and two later great conceptual directors,

D.W. Griffith and Sergei Eisenstein.3

       A number of tendencies have separated directors who pursued reality from those who

favored fantasy and imagination. Since the introduction of sound in the 1920s, the relative

importance of images and words has become one of these. Experimental directors have been

more likely to believe that film should be primarily a visual art. In contrast, conceptual directors

tend to privilege words, because language is a more precise means of expressing ideas and

emotions.

John Ford (1894-1973)

               Pictures, not words, should tell the story.

                                                             John Ford4

       John Martin Feeney was born in Cape Elizabeth, Maine, the son of immigrants from

County Galway, Ireland. Over the years he would convince more than a few interviewers that he

had been baptized Sean Aloysius O’Fearna, though the records of St. Dominic’s Church in

Portland reveal that to have been, in the words of a biographer, “a load of Fordian blarney.”5 Yet

he never lost his pride in his Irish heritage, or the identification with the less privileged that came

from his childhood as the son of an immigrant saloonkeeper. Late in his life, he declared, “I am

of the proletariat. My people were peasants.” But he also never lost the belief in the American

dream that he gained from his family’s experience, as he continued, “They came here, were

educated. They served this country well. I love America”6

       As a boy, John was fascinated by nickelodeons, and the glamour of the movies. After

graduating from high school, instead of attending college he went to Hollywood, where his older

brother Francis, who had earlier run off to join the circus, had become a successful movie actor

and director. Francis had taken the surname Ford, and John followed him. Sponsored by his

brother, John worked in a number of different jobs, including stuntman, actor, property man,

cameraman, and assistant director. In 1917, just three years after his arrival in Hollywood, Ford

began directing his own films – mostly low-budget Westerns, starring Harry Carey.

       Ford and Carey became good friends, and made more than two dozen Westerns together

during the next five years. Their movies were based on a number of elements that Ford would

develop into a distinctive experimental style. He preferred images to words: “Scripts are

dialogue, and I don’t like all that talk. I’ve always tried to get things across visually.”7 Action

was the best way to accomplish this: “When a motion picture is at its best, it is long on action and

short on dialogue. When it tells its story and reveals its characters in a series of simple, beautiful,

active pictures, and does it with as little talk as possible, then the motion picture medium is being
                                                   5


used to its fullest advantage.” His favorite genre best fitted this approach: “I don’t know any

subject on earth better suited to such a presentation than a Western.”8 He always preferred to

leave the studio, and film outdoors in rugged and picturesque settings; the dramatic buttes and

mesas of Monument Valley later became important in creating atmosphere in his films, and Ford

believed “the real star of my Westerns has always been the land.”9 Ford defined technique as

“what you don’t see on the screen,” and he disliked any method that called attention to itself, such

as camera movement: “It says, ‘This is a motion picture. This isn’t real.’ I like to have the

audience feel that this is the real thing. I don’t like to have the audience interested in the

camera.”10 Alfred Hitchcock paid tribute to Ford’s success in this regard: “A John Ford picture

was a visual gratification – his method of shooting, eloquent in its clarity and apparent

simplicity.”11

       What mattered most to Ford was the actors: “After all, you’ve got to tell your story

through the people who portray it. You can have a weak, utterly bad script – and a good cast will

turn it into a good picture.”12 He used many of the same actors in one film after another: “Well,

it’s natural to use people whose capabilities one knows and also they know my method of

work.”13 The critic and director Peter Bogdanovich observed that this was just one of the

elements of continuity in Ford’s films: “Every Ford movie is filled with reverberations from

another – which makes his use of the same players from year to year, decade to decade, so much

more than just building ‘a stock company’ – and one film of his cannot really be looked at as

separate from the rest.”14

       As early as 1920, an interviewer reported that “‘In everything I want realism’ is Ford’s

continual cry,” and this remained central to his films; Orson Welles observed that “With Ford at

his best, you feel that the movie has lived and breathed in a real world.”15 Striking testimony to
                                                  6


Ford’s realism came from the novelist John Steinbeck. In 1938, Steinbeck travelled through

migrant camps in California, and the next year he published The Grapes of Wrath to dramatize the

tragedy of the victims of the Dust Bowl. When the novel became a best seller, the producer

Darryl Zanuck purchased the film rights, and offered it to Ford, who accepted: “The whole thing

appealed to me – being about simple people – and the story was similar to the famine in

Ireland.”16 Steinbeck was apprehensive, fearing a Hollywood studio would weaken the novel’s

harsh indictment of the exploitation of the migrants in California. Yet when he was given a pre-

release screening in December, 1939, he wrote to his agent in amazement, describing the film as

“a hard, straight picture in which the actors are submerged so completely that it looks and feels

like a documentary film and certainly it has a hard, truthful ring.”17

       Contemporaries recognized that Ford’s work gained in power as he grew older. So for

example he won Oscars as best director for The Informer, which he made at the age of 41, The

Grapes of Wrath (46), How Green Was My Valley (47), and The Quiet Man (58). Conspicuously

absent from this list, however, were Ford’s Westerns. He considered these his greatest

achievement – two years before his death he declared that “I want to be remembered as ‘John

Ford – a guy that made Westerns’” — but he believed they were unfairly slighted by critics out of

snobbery.18 Time has corrected this injustice. In a 2002 poll taken by Sight and Sound, the

journal of the British Film Institute, in which an international panel of critics were each asked to

list the 10 best movies ever made, the three of Ford’s films that received the most votes were all

Westerns: The Searchers ranked first, followed in order by The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance

and Stagecoach.19 These were made when Ford was 62, 68, and 45, respectively, and all three

starred John Wayne.
                                                   7


       These three great Ford Westerns shared several themes that reflected Ford’s beliefs about

American history. In each, civilization ultimately triumphed over chaos and lawlessness. Yet in

no case was this a simple tale of conquest of good over evil. In each instance the victory of

civilization was made possible only by the actions of a “good bad man” – played by Wayne –

who violated the rules of civilized society, taking the law into his own hands, to eliminate an evil

that stood in the way of the establishment of a society based on law. And in each case, Wayne’s

actions disqualified him from a place in the society he had brought into existence: ironically, his

very conquest of anarchy had made his own values obsolete, and unacceptable, in a civilized

world.20

       Ford’s great Westerns were thus not simple morality tales, for in each some degree of

irony undercut the simple opposition between good and evil. This reflected Ford’s belief that

“Westerns have been most inaccurate in overglamorizing and overdramatizing the heroes and

villains of the period . . . [I]t is true that much of the conversion to law and order was

accomplished by reformed criminals . . . It is equally wrong for the heroes to have been made out

to be pure Sir Galahads in so many cases, which is nonsense.”21 Nonetheless, in Ford’s last major

reflection on the West, a frontier newspaper editor chose to suppress the truth of the heroism and

magnanimity of John Wayne’s good bad man, and in so doing to perpetuate the lie by which

Wayne had allowed Jimmy Stewart to take the credit, and reap the rewards, for being the man

who had civilized his territory by killing the outlaw Liberty Valance. The movie was presented as

a flashback: Stewart had returned from Washington, D.C., where he was a senator, for the funeral

of Wayne, who had died in obscurity and poverty. After listening to Stewart’s retrospective

account of the true story, the editor tore up the notes of Stewart’s confession, famously declaring

“This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.”22 Ford explained that he
                                                  8


agreed with the editor’s decision, “because it’s good for the country. We’ve had a lot of people

who were supposed to be great heroes, and you know damn well they weren’t. But it’s good for

the country to have heroes to look up to.”23 Yet the irony of Ford’s statement in defense of myth

lies in the fact that his film, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, told precisely the story the editor

had chosen to suppress. Confronted with the judgment that his obvious sympathy for Wayne’s

character over Stewart’s reflected a tendency for his Westerns to have become sadder over time,

Ford grudgingly conceded, “Possibly – I don’t know – I’m not a psychologist . . . Maybe I’m

getting older.”24

       The great popularity of Ford’s films spread his influence widely into popular culture. In

one example, Buddy Holly saw The Searchers in Lubbock, Texas, in 1956, and seized on the

ironic catch phrase of John Wayne’s character as the title for a new song. That’ll Be the Day

became the breakthrough hit for Buddy Holly and the Crickets, as it rose to number one in both

the US and Britain the following year.25 Ford’s simple and powerful visual technique influenced

many younger movie directors. So for example Akira Kurosawa openly acknowledged Ford as

the greatest influence on his own movies, and Orson Welles declared that at the beginning of his

film career, Stagecoach was his “movie textbook.”26 Welles recalled that “Every night for more

than a month, I would screen [Stagecoach] with a different technician from RKO and ask him

questions all through the movie.”27 What Welles wanted was not a message, but a language: “I

didn’t need to learn from somebody who had something to say, but from somebody who would

show me how to say what I had in mind; and John Ford is perfect for that.”28 Later filmmakers

responded not only to Ford’s technique, but also to the irony and darkness of his late Westerns.

So for example Martin Scorsese included a clip from The Searchers in Mean Streets (1973), and

the plot of Taxi Driver (1976) parallels that of The Searchers, as Robert DeNiro’s obsessional
                                                  9


quest to destroy the pimp who corrupted a young girl is a contemporary urban version of John

Wayne’s search for the Comanche chief who massacred his brother’s family and kidnapped his

niece.29 The experimental Scorsese wanted to capture the look and feel of Times Square as

authentically as his predecessor had captured Monument Valley; thus Scorsese declared that

“John Ford made Westerns. We make street movies.”30

       Ford disdained pretension, and characteristically he told Bogdanovich that “I have never

thought about what I was doing in terms of art . . . To me, it was always a job of work – which I

enjoyed immensely – and that’s it.”31 Shortly before his death, he remarked that “I do think there

is an art to the making of a motion picture. There are some great artists in the business. I am not

one of them.”32 The critic and director François Truffaut understood Ford’s humility, writing that

“Ford was an artist who never said the word ‘art.’” Truffaut explained his admiration for Ford’s

experimental art: “His camera is invisible; his staging is perfect; he maintains a smoothness of

surface in which no scene is allowed to become more important than any other. Such mastery is

possible only after one has made an enormous number of films.”33

Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980)

               It is no use telling people; they have got to SEE.

                                                              Alfred Hitchcock34

       Growing up in east London, Alfred Hitchcock loved the theater and movies. He was also

an avid reader, and at 16 he found the works of Edgar Allan Poe. He never forgot a discovery he

made while reading “The Murders in the Rue Morgue”: “Fear, you see, is a feeling that people

like to feel, when they are certain of being in safety.” This had a lasting effect on him:

               Without wanting to seem immodest, I can’t help but compare what I try to put in
               my films with what Poe put in his stories: a perfectly unbelievable story recounted
               to readers with such a hallucinatory logic that one has the impression that this
                                                 10


               same story can happen to you tomorrow. And that’s the rule of the game if one
               wants the reader or spectator to subconsciously substitute himself for the hero.35

       Hitchcock got a job in the movie industry in 1920, when a company in London hired him

to design title-cards for silent movies. He worked his way up through a series of technical jobs,

learning all the details of how movies were made, and by 1925 he had begun directing. In 1929

he made the first English film with sound. During the next decade he directed a number of

popular thrillers, and he came to be considered the leading director in England. In 1939 he moved

to Hollywood, where he became an immediate success, as his first American film, Rebecca, won

an Oscar for best movie. He continued to make movies in Hollywood for the rest of his life. In

1972, he explained his devotion to the industry, in terms that echoed his early excitement: “I’ve

always believed in film as the newest art of the twentieth century because of its ability to

communicate with the mass audiences of the world.”36

       Throughout his career, Hitchcock presented a consistent vision of his goals and

philosophy. Late in his life, he stressed that “you have to remember that as well as being a

creative person I am a very technical person. The actual exercise of technique is very important

to me.”37 Skillful technique was to be used to accomplish the goal of “getting audiences on the

edge of their seats” through the creation of suspense.38 This required involving the audience:

“Watching a well-made film, we don’t sit by as spectators; we participate.”39

       Even after the introduction of sound, Hitchcock maintained that “films must still be

primarily a medium for telling a story in pictures.”40 Accordingly, he praised montage – the

juxtaposition of images to create emotions or ideas – as “pure film,” and scoffed at “photographs

of people talking” as irrelevant to film.41 Hitchcock believed that “in all artistic domains we

attempt to create an emotion. The importance of a work of art, no matter what sort, is to evoke a

reaction.”42 The story of a film was not of primary importance, for in his opinion the power of
                                                  11


movies – what made them most effective in evoking a reaction, and creating emotion – was “the

manner and style of telling the story.” This was the director’s job: “what gives an effect of life to

a picture [is] the feeling that when you see it on the screen you are watching something that has

been conceived and brought to birth directly in visual terms.”43 Hitchcock considered this his

strength: “my craft is that I handle the camera.”44

       Hitchcock valued images over words, and form over content. Tellingly, the great

experimental director compared himself to a great experimental painter: “Cézanne is one of the

precursors of the modern movement in art and . . . the most important thing for him was to

translate visual sensations. Similarly for me, when I take on a screenplay I feel the same

needs.”45 This parallel explained Hitchcock’s exasperation at the frequent criticism of his films

for their unimportant subjects, which he likened to “looking at a painting of a still life, say by

Cézanne, and wondering whether the apples on the plate are sweet or sour. Who cares? It’s the

way they’re painted.”46

       Over time, Hitchcock developed a set of practices that collectively constituted his

trademark style. He often spoke of “building up a picture,” and these components were

effectively fitted together to achieve his primary goal of creating suspense. He believed that the

best technique was unobtrusive – “beauty, the virtuosity of the camera, everything must be

sacrificed or compromised when it gets in the way of a story.”47 He frequently used “subjective

treatment” – close-ups of a character and point-of-view shots of what the character saw – to

increase the audience’s identification with the character.48 He favored simple, clear narratives

that “hold the attention of any audience and won’t puzzle them.”49 His films often featured the

pursuit of an innocent man, who was falsely accused, because he believed it gave the audience a

greater sense of danger: “It’s easier for them to identify with him than with a guilty man on the
                                                 12


run.”50 He sought realism in behavior – “When characters are unbelievable you never get real

suspense” – and in settings – “looking so natural that the audience gets involved and believes, for

the time being, what’s going on up there on the screen.”51

       Hitchcock considered that “the whole art of the motion picture is a succession of

composed images, rapidly going through a machine,” and his virtuosity in creating these

sequences produced many individual scenes famous for their visual impact. Prominent examples

include Cary Grant being chased across a Midwestern prairie by a crop-dusting plane in North by

Northwest, Jimmy Stewart struggling to control his vision – and mind – in the staircase of a tower

in Vertigo, and Janet Leigh being stabbed and killed in the shower in Psycho.52 Leigh’s murder

occupied only 45 seconds in the completed film, but used 78 separate cuts, and required seven

days to film.53 (Hitchcock was proud that his bold use of montage in the scene created an illusion

so vivid that it actually made audiences scream, and for this called Psycho “one of the most

cinematic pictures I’ve ever made.”54) The tower sequence in Vertigo, in which Hitchcock

created a visual representation of dizziness by having a camera simultaneously track away from

the staircase and zoom in on it, drew on years of deliberation:

               I always remember one night at the Chelsea Arts Ball at Albert Hall in London
               when I got terribly drunk and I had the sensation that everything was going far
               away from me. I tried to get that into Rebecca, but they couldn’t do it . . . I
               thought about the problem for fifteen years. By the time we got to Vertigo, we
               solved it by using the dolly and zoom simultaneously.

When he was told that the heavy machinery needed to lift the camera at the top of the stairs would

cost $50,000, Hitchcock pointed out that since there were no characters in the scene, they could

use a model of the stairway, laid on its side. The scene was filmed in this way, with the camera

tracking on the ground, at a cost of less than $20,000.55
                                                 13


       For much of his career, most critics regarded Hitchcock as a commercially successful

director whose work had no artistic merit; in a typical judgment, in 1949 the English critic and

director Lindsay Anderson remarked that “Hitchcock has never been a ‘serious’ director. His

films are interesting neither for their ideas nor for their characters.”56 This perception changed

during the 1950s, with the reevaluation of Hitchcock by a group of young French critics who later

became important directors. François Truffaut named Hitchcock as a filmmaker auteur, whose

work was worthy of serious artistic analysis.57 In 1957, Eric Rohmer and Claude Chabrol

published a monograph on Hitchcock’s films, in which they called him “one of the greatest

inventors of form in the entire history of cinema.”58 Jean-Luc Godard later eliminated the

qualification, calling Hitchcock “the greatest creator of forms of the twentieth century.”59

       Truffaut identified a key reason for Hitchcock’s importance, noting that “In Hitchcock’s

work a film-maker is bound to find the answer to many of his own problems, including the most

fundamental question of all: how to express oneself by purely visual means.”60 The instructional

value of his films helped to spread Hitchcock’s influence from Paris to Hollywood. So for

example a childhood friend of Steven Spielberg recalled that the director the young Spielberg

most revered was Hitchcock, whom he called “the Master” in recognition of his technical

excellence. Yet Spielberg also admired Hitchcock for his success in reaching a mass audience:

“[Spielberg] said, ‘The movies reach out and grab you.’ That’s what he thought was great about

Alfred Hitchcock.”61 Martin Scorsese recalled that Vertigo had been an early inspiration to him

and many of his contemporaries: “For such a personal work with such a uniquely disturbing

vision of the world to come out of the studio system when it did [1958] was not just unusual – it

was nearly unthinkable.”62 In 2004, a panel of experts polled by Movie Maker magazine ranked
                                                  14


Hitchcock as the most influential director in history. The magazine observed that Hitchcock was

“inarguably the most imitated motion picture artist of all time.”63

       In the 2002 Sight and Sound poll of critics, the Hitchcock film that received the most votes

was Vertigo, with Psycho ranked second. Hitchcock directed these films at the ages of 59 and 61,

respectively. He would not have been surprised at the appreciation of his late work, for he

considered his career a steady process of improvement. So in 1962 he told Truffaut that “your

evolution does follow a systematic pattern of consistent amelioration from film to film. If you’re

not sure an idea has been properly carried out in one picture, you’ll work it out in the next one.” 64

In comparing the version of The Man Who Knew Too Much he had made in England in 1934 with

the second version of the same film he made in Hollywood in 1956, Hitchcock commented, “the

first version is the work of a talented amateur and the second was made by a professional.”65

Hitchcock believed that “Style in directing develops slowly and naturally as it does in everything

else.” It could not be produced deliberately, but had to evolve from experience: “It must be the

result of growth and patient experimentation with the materials of the trade, the style itself

emerging eventually almost unconsciously.”66 What was true of a film was also true of a career:

“It takes so long, and so much work, to achieve simplicity.” 67

       Truffaut wrote of Hitchcock that “In examining his films, it was obvious that he had given

more thought to the potential of his art than any of his colleagues.”68 Hitchcock entered the

movie industry in its infancy, and saw it grow enormously during his five decades as a director. In

1963, he commented that “I believe we still have in our hands the most powerful instrument,

cinema, that’s been known.” He marveled at the fact that with film, unlike any other medium,

“different audiences of different nationalities can be shocked at the same moment at the same
                                                 15


thing.” This created a unique opportunity, and carried with it a responsibility: “I enjoy the fact

that we can cause, internationally, audiences to emote. And I think this is our job.”69

Orson Welles (1915-1985)

               I know that in theory the word is secondary in cinema but the secret of my work is
               that everything is based on the word. I do not make silent films.
                                                                   Orson Welles70

       Orson Welles joked that “The word genius was whispered into my ear the first thing I ever

heard while I was still mewling in my crib, so it never occurred to me that I wasn’t until middle

age!”71 Welles was the extremely precocious son of a prosperous family in Kenosha, Wisconsin,

and his mother’s desire to give him an artistic upbringing included having him make his stage

debut in the Chicago Opera at the age of three. When Orson was 10, a Madison newspaper

became the first to publish the epithet that would follow him throughout his life, as an article

titled “Cartoonist, Actor, Poet and Only 10,” referred to his “apparent genius.”72 Welles

recognized that his family’s encouragement had a major effect on his development: “I never

heard a discouraging word for years, you see . . . And there just seemed to me no limit to what I

could do.”73

       In high school Welles devoted most of his time to theater, directing as well as acting. He

was not interested in college, and at 16 he set out on a walking tour of Ireland. Running low on

cash, in Dublin he auditioned for the Gate Theatre, a repertory company. The theater’s co-

director, Michéal MacLiammóir, later wrote that Welles’ audition was “wrong from beginning to

end but with all the qualities of fine acting tearing their way through a chaos of inexperience.”

Even at first encounter, MacLiammóir saw that Welles had “some ageless and superb inner

confidence that no one could blow out. That was his secret. He knew that he was precisely what

he himself would have chosen to be had God consulted him on the subject at birth.”74 Welles’
                                                 16


first professional performance at the Gate was praised by the New York Times as “amazingly

fine.”75 He remained there less than a year, but the Gate had a lasting influence on Welles, for his

exposure to the theories of Hilton Edwards, the theater’s other co-director. Edwards believed that

the theater should not conceal its artifice: his directing was designed never to allow the audience

to forget that they were in a theater, where actors were performing. As a director himself just a

few years later, Welles would emulate Edwards’s antinaturalistic approach to the theater, and not

long thereafter he would extend Edwards’ theory to a different art, and apply the same

theatricality and stylization to film.76

        By the age of 20, Welles became established in New York as one of the most successful

actors on radio; he was in so many shows that he often commuted from one to another by

ambulance.77 In 1935 he joined the theater division of the Federal WPA as a director, and made

an immediate sensation with the “Voodoo Macbeth,” an all-black version of the play, staged in

Harlem, with its action transposed from Scotland to Haiti. A study of Welles’ early theatrical

productions concluded that foremost among his qualities was his “delight in sharing not only

illusion but the mechanics of illusion with his audience;” Welles himself wrote in this period that

the director’s job was “to make his playhouse a kind of magic trick in which something

impossible comes to be.”78 Welles’ growing fame as a director and actor landed him on the cover

of Time magazine in May of 1938. Later that year, his adaptation of H.G. Wells’ The War of the

Worlds caused mass hysteria, and became perhaps the most famous of all radio broadcasts.

Newspaper headlines identifying Welles as the source of a hoax that panicked America increased

his celebrity, and greatly raised his value to Hollywood.79 The next year Welles agreed to make

two movies for RKO, and his contract received extensive publicity both for his large salary and

for the unusual artistic freedom he would enjoy, as writer, producer, director, and actor.80

       Welles’ lucrative contract and his reputation as a boy wonder made many in Hollywood

hostile to the newcomer. F. Scott Fitzgerald published a short story in Esquire, “Pat Hobby and

Orson Welles,” in which an unemployed screenwriter bitterly warned a studio executive that

“Orson Welles is the biggest menace that’s come to Hollywood for years. He gets a hundred and

fifty grand a picture and I wouldn’t be surprised if he was so radical that you had to have all new

equipment and start all over again like you did with sound in 1928.”81 François Truffaut later

contended that Hollywood’s hostility posed a challenge: “Welles in 1939 must have felt that it

was necessary to offer the public not only a good film, but the film, one that would summarize

forty years of cinema while taking the opposite course to everything that had been done . . . a

declaration of war on traditional cinema and a declaration of love for the medium.”82 Welles’

careful preparation for Citizen Kane attests to his ambitious goals. So for example both his chief

cameraman, Gregg Toland, and the film’s composer, Bernard Herrmann, later wrote of the

considerable time they were given to plan their novel contributions before filming began, contrary

to standard Hollywood practice.83

       Welles deliberately set out to create a masterpiece, and there is remarkably widespread

agreement that he did — and at the age of 26 created the greatest movie ever made. So for

example Citizen Kane has ranked first in each of the five decennial polls of film critics Sight and

Sound has taken since 1962.84 Kane also placed first in a poll taken by the American Film

Institute in 1997, and again when the AFI repeated its poll 10 years later. Decades after he made

Kane, when Welles was asked if he had been aware of creating such an important film, he replied,

“I never doubted it for a single instant.”85 Despite his youth and inexperience, he gave no sign of

being intimidated: shortly after arriving in Hollywood, he described the RKO studio as “the

greatest railroad train a boy ever had.”86 He later recalled that he had recognized no constraints
                                                 18


— “I thought you could do anything with a camera, you know, that the eye and the imagination

could do” — so he made radical innovations “Simply by not knowing that they were impossible,

or theoretically impossible.” His lack of expertise didn’t faze him: “You know, the great mystery

that requires 20 years doesn’t exist in any field. Certainly not in a camera.”87 And he was

encouraged in this attitude by Toland, one of Hollywood’s best cinematographers, who assured

Welles he could teach him all he needed to know in a few days, “So we spent the next weekend

together and he showed me the inside of that bag of tricks, and like all good magic, the secrets are

ridiculously simple.”88

       Citizen Kane startled the film world with innovations in both sight and sound. Among the

most celebrated visual effects was what Toland called “human-eye focus,” with wide-angle lenses

that gave much greater depth of field than movies normally afforded, so action could occur

simultaneously at different distances from the camera.89 In sound, Kane used what Herrmann

called “radio scoring” — musical bridges to foreshadow transitions — and overlapping dialogue

tracks that mimicked the interruptions of real conversation.90 Truffaut observed that these and

other Kane trademarks, including the low camera angles that showed the action to viewers as if

they were seated in the front of a theater for a play, were imported from Welles’ earlier artistic

activities: “Welles’ thoughts as he embarked on the cinema could be summed up as follows: I’m

going to make a film that will present all the advantages of radio and theatre without their

disadvantages, with the result that my film will be unlike any other that has been made.”91

       One of Kane’s most striking achievements was its powerful marriage of form and content.

Jorge Luis Borges explained that the film’s subject was “the discovery of the secret soul of a

man,” and observed that “In astonishing and endlessly varied ways, Orson Welles exhibits the

fragments of the life of the man, Charles Foster Kane, and invites us to combine and reconstruct
                                                  19


them. Shapes of multiplicity and diversity abound in the film.”92 The film’s conspicuous

fragmentation of both images and sounds echoed and underscored the fragmentation of the

portrait of Kane that emerged from the divergent accounts of him given by a series of different

witnesses. Welles’ prominent use of stage tricks was not universally applauded: detractors have

criticized his technique as heavy-handed, as for example Jean-Paul Sartre contended that “all too

often, in Citizen Kane, one has the feeling that the image is too much in love with itself . . . Just

like a novel whose style keeps forcing itself into the foreground and in which we keep forgetting

the characters.”93

       In tribute to Citizen Kane, Truffaut declared that “This film has inspired more vocations to

cinema throughout the world than any other.”94 He loved the film’s exuberance and the freedom

of Welles’ imagination, and compared the director to the film’s protagonist: “When Thatcher

challenges him, ‘So, that’s really how you think a newspaper should be run?,’ the young Kane

answers, ‘I have absolutely no experience in running a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher. I just try out all

the ideas that come into my head.”95 The scholar David Bordwell traced Kane’s influence

through the greatest conceptual movie directors of the following decades: “As the ancestor of the

works of Godard, Bergman, Fellini, Bresson, and Antonioni, Kane is a monument in the modern

cinema, the cinema of consciousness.”96 Even more simply, the conceptual Truffaut wrote in

1972 that “everything that matters in cinema since 1940 has been influenced by Citizen Kane.”97

       Welles relished discussing his artistic philosophy. He believed movies should make

personal statements: “I have a passion for films that . . . are made of opinions, the expression of

the personality and ideas of the director.”98 Directors should be artists: “A film is never really

good unless the camera is an eye in the head of a poet.”99 Movies were magic: “A film is a ribbon

of dreams.”100 Judging films by their visual impact alone was a mistake, “like judging a novel
                                                  20


only by the quality of its prose.”101 Directors should consequently control both content and form:

“I don’t recognize a film as being completely a man’s work unless he’s also its author.”102 This

was the only way Welles could work: “I’m sure I can’t make good films unless I also write the

screenplay.”103 Language was primary: “I always begin with the dialogue. And I do not

understand how one dares to write action before dialogue . . . I must know what [the characters]

say before seeing them do what they do.”104 For Welles, what mattered most was concepts: “I am

a man of ideas . . . above all else.”105

        The focus of virtually all analyses of Welles’ career has been his failure to surpass, or

equal, Citizen Kane in the more than four decades that remained in his life: as the critic Andrew

Sarris succinctly observed, “The conventional American diagnosis of his career is decline, pure

and simple.”106 Many of Welles’ admirers have blamed Hollywood: Kane failed to make money,

and Welles never again enjoyed the full support of a major studio, forcing him to take acting roles

and make television commercials to raise money for his own films. Late in his life, Welles

himself reflected that “I think I made essentially a mistake in staying in movies,” and lamented

his lost time and effort: “I’ve wasted a greater part of my life looking for money and trying to get

along, trying to make my work from this terribly expensive paintbox which is a movie.”107

        Yet Welles did direct films of high quality after Kane.108 What haunted him was that he

could no longer make films that were as abundantly and conspicuously innovative. In 1960, when

an interviewer asked how he had had the confidence to make Kane at such an early age, Welles

replied, “Ignorance, ignorance, sheer ignorance — you know there’s no confidence to equal it.

It’s only when you know something about a profession, I think, that you’re timid or careful.”109

Welles claimed that directors did their best work both early and late in their lives — before thirty

and after seventy — but in fact it is likely that he understood that his youthful ignorance, and with
                                                 21


it his boundless confidence and creativity, had been irretrievably lost to the inevitable

accumulation of experience. His true feelings about old age were probably reflected in a

comment he made more than once late in his life: “‘Old age,’ said Charles de Gaulle, ‘old age is a

shipwreck’ — and he knew whereof he spoke.”110

       Many who knew Welles agreed with Ingrid Bergman’s judgment that “it must have been a

great burden for him to have made a masterpiece when he was twenty-five years old. And it must

have been very hard to live up to it all those years.”111 Yet at 25 Welles had changed the cinema:

as Jean-Luc Godard declared in 1963, “All of us will always owe him everything.”112

Jean-Luc Godard (1930 - )

               To me, especially since talking pictures were invented, the film is no longer a
               visual art.
                                                     Jean-Luc Godard113

       In June of 1950, while registered as an anthropology student at Paris’ Sorbonne, Jean-Luc

Godard began to write for a small magazine, La Gazette du cinema, that would survive for less

than a full year. Godard wrote under a pseudonym, in order not to interfere with his loftier

ambition of eventually publishing a novel with a prestigious publisher.114 Yet these articles

betrayed Godard’s true destiny. In a review of an obscure documentary, he declared that “At the

cinema we do not think, we are thought.”115 Godard thus revealed that he had already been

captured by film, because of his conviction that it could guide not only the vision of its audience,

but also their thought.116

       Godard soon joined a group of young cinephiles who became famous initially as critics for

a much more successful new journal, Cahiers du cinéma, that was founded in 1951. Under the

inspiration of the older critic André Bazin, these younger writers — notably François Truffaut,

Claude Chabrol, Jaques Rivette, and Eric Rohmer in addition to Godard — dedicated themselves
                                                   22


both to improving cinema by raising the quality of criticism, and to establishing film as an art

form as respectable as painting or literature. Their success was remarkable: in 1959, Godard

could justly declare that “We won the day in having it acknowledged in principle that a film by

Hitchcock, for example, is as important as a book by [the poet Louis] Aragon. Film auteurs,

thanks to us, have finally entered the history of art.”117

        Having revolutionized film criticism, in the late ‘50s the young Turks set out to

revolutionize film itself. In 1957, Truffaut had predicted a new kind of cinema: “The film of

tomorrow appears to me as even more personal than an individual and autobiographical novel,

like a confession, or a diary.”118 In 1959 he fulfilled his own prophecy, with the autobiographical

Les Quatre cents coups. The film became the first hit for what quickly became known as the

Nouvelle Vague — New Wave — film directors. In 1960, Godard took over leadership of the

movement with his own first feature film. To Godard, the transition from critic to director was a

natural one: “I think of myself as an essayist . . . only instead of writing, I film them . . . For there

is a clear continuity between all forms of expression.”119 Decades later, Godard recognized that

the whole movement had been a conceptual one: “The New Wave was a relationship with the

imaginary.”120

        Godard’s first feature, A bout de souffle (Breathless), was a sensation even before it

opened in Paris early in 1960. Its reputation sprang primarily from technical innovations that

made a radical break from basic Hollywood conventions. One of these was its “faux raccords” —

false matching shots — that violated normal continuity and narrative development: characters

might wear different clothes in successive shots within a single scene, and sudden exaggerated

shifts in angles of vision called attention to the camera. Another conspicuous device was its many

jump cuts, which abruptly advanced the action while disrupting the logic of the plot.121 Susan
                                                  23


Sontag compared Godard’s violation of such established film rules as the unobtrusive cut,

consistency of point of view, and clarity of story line to the challenge of the Cubists to realistic

figuration and three-dimensional pictorial space, and Godard stressed that the magnitude of the

challenge was deliberate, explaining that “What I wanted was to take a conventional story and

remake, but differently, everything the cinema had done. I also wanted to give the feeling that the

techniques of film-making had just been discovered or experienced for the first time.”122

Godard’s revolution was immediately embraced by the next generation. So for example the

Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci, who was 19 in 1960, recalled that “I saw A bout de souffle

during the early summer of 1960 in Paris, and I had the feeling that something was starting from

zero there, that all the films I had seen up to then constituted the cinema before A bout de

souffle.”123

        Although Breathless became famous for its technical innovations, it was in fact the first in

a series of remarkable films in which Godard displayed his fundamentally new conception of

cinema. In the 2002 Sight and Sound poll of critics, six films by Godard received two or more

votes, and all were made within a span of seven years, from Breathless in 1960, through My Life

to Live (1962), Contempt (1963), and Pierrot le Fou (1965) to Masculine/Feminine and 2 or 3

Things I Know About Her (both 1966).124 The three of Godard’s films that were ranked among

the 100 “most beautiful films in the world” in a poll of French experts published by Cahiers du

cinéma in 2008 — Breathless, Contempt, and Pierrot — were a subset of this same group.125

Godard’s films of this period constitute the most important statement of his complex philosophy

of film.

        A cornerstone of Godard’s philosophy was a conception of montage far more

encompassing than the usual definition of the term as a sequence of separate images. Early in his
                                                   24


career, Godard explained why he had given up literature for film:

               I wrote, “The weather is nice. The train enters the station,” and I sat there for
               hours wondering why I couldn’t just as well have written the opposite: “The train
               enters the station. The weather is nice” or “it is raining.” In the cinema, it’s
               simpler. There is something ineluctable about it.126

For Godard, this simultaneity of film’s recording of disparate elements made cinema both unique

and superior to literature.127 The camera also recorded the passage of time, and therefore life:

“The cinema is the only art which, as Cocteau says . . .‘films death at work.’ Whoever one films

is growing older and will die. So one is filming a moment of death at work. Painting is static: the

cinema is interesting because it seizes life and the mortal side of life.”128

       Godard in fact believed that film alone among the arts not only recorded life, but was in

effect life itself: “Cinema is not a dream or fantasy. It is life. I see no difference between the

movies and life. They are the same.”129 The cinema was privileged by the camera’s automatic

recording of reality: “Art is not only a mirror. There is not only the reality and then the mirror-

camera . . . I discovered you can’t separate the mirror from the reality.”130 For Godard, there was

consequently no division between filming and other activities: “I make my films not only when

I’m shooting but as I dream, eat, read, talk.”131 For him everything was cinema: “I want to

include everything . . . Everything should be put into a film.”132

       Godard believed movies should be personal: “I only like films which resemble their

creators.”133 His films expressed his ideas: “What I have to say, I don’t say myself but I have my

characters say it and that’s why they talk abundantly.”134 Plots were therefore merely vehicles: “I

don’t really like telling a story. I prefer to use a kind of tapestry, a background on which I can

embroider my own ideas.”135 It was not important for audiences to suspend their disbelief: “I

think it’s good to say to the audience . . . ‘This is a movie.’”136 A friend of Godard’s, the
                                                    25


philosopher Youssef Ishaghpour, compared Godard’s conceptual vision to that of Andy Warhol:

“for Godard, as for the Pop painters, reality was already image.”137

        Godard’s cinema has always drawn heavily on earlier art. He noted that at the start of his

career this was inevitable: “I knew nothing of life except through the cinema, and my first efforts

were ‘films de cinéphile’ . . . I didn’t see things in relation to the world, to life or history, but in

relation to the cinema.”138 He had intended Breathless to be a gangster film, but later realized it

wasn’t: “I thought it was a realistic film, but now it seems like Alice in Wonderland, a completely

unreal, surrealistic world.”139 Godard’s films are filled with countless references not only to

earlier movies, but also to the other arts: the critic Peter Wollen commented that “Godard treated

Hollywood as a kind of conceptual property store from which he could serendipitously loot ideas

for scenes, shots, and moods,” and a collaborator of Godard’s, Jean-Pierre Gorin, summarized

Godard’s entire career as “an assault on the notion of intellectual property.”140 Godard did not

dispute the characterization, explaining that “It’s very good to steal things. Bertolt Brecht said art

is made from plagiarism.”141

        Writing has played a large role in Godard’s films. A biographer observed that for Godard,

“writing is the privileged element which breaks the classic unity of the cinema . . . Writing is used

to comment on the action and to distance the viewer from the immediacy of the image.”142

Godard traces this to the primacy of expressing ideas: “I’m someone whose real country is

language, and whose territory is movies.”143

        Godard’s films have always highlighted the accidental. In 1963, he made a short movie he

called an “Action-Film,” and the cameraman recalled that to achieve spontaneity, “I filmed it like

a real event, as if it were a piece of documentary reality.” An artist in the film made what he

called “action sculpture” — “I take pieces of metal, I throw them, and the way they fall, I weld
                                                  26


them.”144 Godard’s use of spontaneity prompted comparisons of his art to the action painting of

the Abstract Expressionists.145 Yet Godard did not use chance like Jackson Pollock, as a point of

departure, but instead as an end in itself. Like the sculptor in his film, for Godard chance

occurrences were final products, and in this he resembled not the experimental Abstract

Expressionists, but rather the earlier conceptual Dada painters and poets, who used chance as a

means of eliminating style.146 Like the Dadas, Godard rejected consistency: “I have no ‘style,’ I

just want to make films.”147 As early as 1968, the critic Manny Farber commented on the protean

nature of Godard’s art: “Each Godard film is of itself widely varied in persona as well as quality .

. . At the end of this director’s career, there will probably be a hundred films, each one a bizarrely

different species . . . [T]he form and manner of execution changes totally with each film.”148

Three decades and 50 films later, Peter Wollen observed that “just as Farber predicted, each film

seems to be sui generis, quite unlike any of his previous work, the same only in being so

unpredictably, inconsistently different.”149

       In 1967, Godard concluded the movie Weekend with two title cards: the first read “End of

Film,” and the second “End of Cinema.”150 He participated in the student protests of May 1968,

and subsequently continued to make films, promoting such causes as Maoism and anti-

Semitism.151 But as noted above, his influential work ended in the 1960s. In 2008, a biographer

complained that Godard’s later work had been unduly neglected: “Godard is an artist as dominant,

as crucial, as protean, and as influential as Picasso, but he is a Picasso who vanished from public

consciousness and from the encyclopedias after the first heady flourish of Cubism.”152 In

assessing the biography, however, a New York Times reviewer declared that “Now we know how

one of the greatest of all filmmakers — the man who so radically changed cinema in 1959 with

his debut feature, Breathless — became an intolerable gasbag.”153
                                                  27


       Godard’s films of the 1960s spearheaded a conceptual revolution in film. Not

surprisingly, his innovations were not embraced by his elders. Orson Welles, for example,

conceded that Godard was “the definitive influence” of the ‘60s, but objected that “I just can’t

take him very seriously as a thinker.”154 But scores of younger filmmakers followed Godard’s

lead. The German director Volker Schlöndorff recalled that “The older generation said that

Godard didn’t know how to edit pictures, but . . . today nearly every film is edited in the way that

Godard cut A bout de souffle.”155 Quentin Tarantino, who named his production company in

honor of his favorite Godard movie, reflected that “Godard did to movies what Bob Dylan did to

music: they both revolutionized the forms.”156

       In a classic description of conceptual innovation, Peter Wollen observed that “Godard’s

films showed a contradictory reverence for the art of the past and a delinquent refusal to obey any

of its rules.”157 Godard attributed the urgency of Breathless to his early insecurities:

“Adolescence, youth, fear, despair, solitude.” But he admitted that it also displayed the brashness

of youth: “We barged into the cinema like cavemen into the Versailles of Louis the Fifteenth.”158

Directors and Audiences

       Ford’s attitude toward making movies was pragmatic: “This is a business. If we can give

the public what it wants, then it is a good business and makes money. The audience is happy and

we’re happy.”159 He didn’t consider it dishonorable to make popular movies: “I’ve got a whole

lot of respect for the people who go to see motion pictures. I think we ought to make pictures in

their language.”160 Ford didn’t feel superior to his viewers — “I am a peasant, and my pride is to

remain one” — so he saw no conflict between his taste and that of his audience: “I like, as a

director and as a spectator, simple, direct, frank films. Nothing disgusts me more than snobbism,

mannerism, technical gratuity (that the spectators pay for) and, most of all, intellectualism.”161
                                                   28


His criterion for accomplishment was straightforward: “For me, a film is a success if the

spectators leave the theater satisfied, if they identify with the characters, if they get joy or

energy.”162

        Ford’s films were consistently profitable, but Hitchcock’s were even more so. Hitchcock

was a shrewd businessman, and by adding the production of a popular television show to his

movies he became the wealthiest director of his generation.163 In view of this, it is not surprising

that he believed that “in the world of films and film production it is the public’s appetite that must

first be appeased.”164 His work was made for his viewers: “I’m a professional. I don’t put my

personal feelings into my pictures. I don’t indulge myself — I don’t make pictures to please me.

I make them to please audiences.”165

        Unlike Ford, Hitchcock believed that the need for commercial success acted as a

constraint on art, as he told one interviewer that “it is harder to make a film that has both integrity

and wide audience appeal than it is to make one that merely satisfies one’s own artistic

conscience.” Satisfying his own conscience while fulfilling his responsibility to his employers

made Hitchcock consider his job “a kind of constant tight-rope walking.”166 Hitchcock also

acknowledged that his trademark genre identification had an economic source: “If I were to make

films for my own satisfaction they would certainly be very different from those you see . . . The

reason why I have specialized, so to speak, in suspense is strictly commercial.”167 Hitchcock

vowed never to preach to his audience: “People don’t go to the movies to listen to sermons. If

that were the case, then instead of buying a ticket they’d put a coin in the collection plate and

make the sign of the cross before taking a seat in the stalls.”168 He never forgot why he made

movies: “I never think of the films I make as being my films. I’m not that vain or egotistical.”169
                                                    29


        Welles disagreed with Ford and Hitchcock on the purpose of making movies. In a speech

at the Edinburgh Festival in 1953, he contended that the quality of movies was deteriorating

because directors were expected to reach mass audiences. Welles declared that “The biggest

mistake we have made is to consider that films are primarily a form of entertainment. The film is

the greatest medium since the invention of movable type for exchanging ideas and information,

and it is no more at its best in light entertainment than literature is at its best in the light novel.”170

Late in his life, Welles insisted that “I would love to have a mass audience,” and claimed that he

had actively pursued that goal: “You’re looking at a man who’s been searching for a mass

audience.”171 Yet this effort apparently did not extend to his choice of subjects: in Edinburgh he

had observed that one way of escaping from banality was to return to the classics, and his projects

in later years included Kafka’s The Trial, adaptations of Shakespeare including Falstaff and The

Merchant of Venice, and Don Quixote.172 Welles’ true feelings toward compromising to increase

the size of his audience may in fact be revealed by the advice he gave a friend who was an

independent filmmaker: “never make a movie for anyone else, or on some idea of what other

people will like. Make it yours, and hope that there will be others who will understand. But

never compromise to make them understand . . . Make the movies you want to make. On your

own. And be free.”173

        Even early in his career as a director, Godard’s attitude toward the popularity of films was

closer to that of his fellow conceptual innovator Welles than to those of the experimental Ford

and Hitchcock. Thus in a 1961 interview, he commented that “There is certainly no reason why

the films I make should not displease some people,” and declared that “I no longer believe that

cinema should be aimed at the masses.”174 The next year, he distinguished his practice from that

of Hitchcock in moderate terms: “If Hitchcock . . . thinks that people will not understand
                                                  30


something, he will not do it. At the same time I feel that one must sometimes go ahead — light

may dawn in a few years time.”175

       By the pivotal year of 1968, Godard’s moderation had vanished. Thus he told an audience

that his goal of creating an art that was both popular and intellectual would not be easily achieved:

“We have to fight the audience.”176 Effectively making himself an heir of Sergei Eisenstein and

other conceptual directors who had believed film should be devoted to propaganda, Godard

declared that “We should abandon drama and psychology and go in more for politics.”

Defending his recent work against the charge that he had abandoned emotion for tedious

intellectual exposition of ideas, Godard explained that he had no interest in telling a love story in

La Chinoise (1967): “What’s important is to know what Marxism-Leninism is and how it helps

them in their love.” He admitted that “I don’t want people to come see my movies the way they

go to see other movies. This has to be changed.” When he was asked if he was trying to change

the audience, Godard replied, “I am trying to change the world.”177 Later in his career, Godard

echoed Welles’ objection to the use of film as entertainment. In 1995 he described cinema as “a

tool that we’ve misused,” and explained that “In the beginning, it was thought that cinema would

impose itself as a new instrument of knowledge, like a microscope or a telescope, but very

quickly it was prevented from playing its role and was turned into a toy. Cinema has not played

its role as an instrument of thought.”178 The contrast is stark: the experimental Ford and

Hitchcock loved film for its ability to entertain, whereas the conceptual Welles and Godard

valued it as a means of creating and disseminating knowledge.
