The Effect of Maternal Depression and Substance Abuse on Child Human Capital Development

JEL No. I1

                                            ABSTRACT

Recent models of human capital formation represent a synthesis of the human capital approach and
a life cycle view of human development that is grounded in neuroscience (Heckman 2007). This model
of human development, the stability of the home and parental mental health can have notable impacts
on skill development in children that may affect the stock of human capital in adults (Knudsen, Heckman
et al. 2006; Heckman 2007). We study effects of maternal depression and substance abuse on children
born to mothers in the initial cohort of the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), a
national household survey of high school students aged 14-22 in 1979. We follow 1587 children aged
1-5 in 1987, observing them throughout childhood and into high school. We employ a variety of methods
to identify the effect of maternal depression and substance abuse on child behavioral, cognitive, and
educational related outcomes. We find no evidence that maternal symptoms of depression affect
contemporaneous cognitive scores in children. However, maternal depression symptoms have a
moderately large effect on child behavioral problems. These findings suggest that the social benefits
of effective behavioral health interventions may be understated. Based on evidence linking early life
outcomes to later well-being, efforts to prevent and/or treat mental and addictive disorders in mothers
and other women of childbearing age have the potential to improve outcomes of their children not only
early in life, but throughout the life cycle.

1. Introduction

           New approaches to modeling the formation of human capital represent a synthesis

of the human capital approach and a life cycle view of human development that is

grounded in neuroscience (Heckman 2007). That literature highlights the importance of

the household environment on the development of children and the compelling evidence

that a child’s relationship with his or her care giver is important in determining the

development of the brain. Based on this model of human development, the stability of the

home and parental mental health can have notable impacts on skill development in

children that may affect the stock of human capital in adults (Knudsen, Heckman et al.

2006; Heckman 2007).

           There is a well developed literature that links mental illness in adults to lower

levels of employment, reduced productivity, lower earnings and early exits from the labor

force (Currie and Madrian 1999; Frank and Koss 2005).1 Empirical analysis of the causal

links between mental illness and labor market outcomes reveals evidence of

intergenerational effects of mental disorders on labor market outcomes. That is, working

age adults with parents that suffered from mental disorders had relative odds of working

that were 5 to 10 percent lower than otherwise similar adults that reported no mental

illness in their parents (Ettner, Frank and Kessler 1997). Similarly, parental mental illness

reduces earnings and hours worked in working adults, holding constant other factors

affecting labor supply. That research and other studies (Currie and Stabile 2008) also

suggest that the effect is due in part to an increased likelihood of experiencing a mental

illness if one’s parents had such illnesses (relative odds of 1.12 to 1.24). Understanding

how parental mental disorders can affect skill accumulation and adult human capital is

    When we refer to mental illnesses we include substance use and abuse disorders.


                                                                                               2
especially important given that there are cost-effective treatments for the most prevalent

mental illnesses that have been tested in women of child bearing ages at various income

levels (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 1999; Miranda, Chung et al.

2003). Thus, ameliorating parental mental health problems offers the potential to

efficiently bolster the development of human capital at an early age.

       In this paper we examine the impact of maternal depression and substance abuse

on the cognitive and behavioral development of children during their early school years.

We make use of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), 1979

cohort, to estimate the impact of maternal mental health on a set of cognitive and

behavioral outcomes in grammar school aged children. Our results show that, after

controlling for the mother’s early life circumstances, symptoms of maternal depression or

alcohol abuse/dependence primarily influence behavioral outcomes in children rather

than cognitive outcomes. As shown in recent work (National Research Council and

Institute of Medicine 2000; Heckman 2006; Cunha and Heckman 2007; Heckman 2007),

non-cognitive skills and attributes are important determinants of economic success that

have been under appreciated in policy circles.

       The paper is organized into five remaining sections. Section 2 summarizes

background literature on child development and maternal depression, including a

discussion of conceptual models relevant to our research. In section 3, we describe our

data and the empirical strategy in detail. The fourth section provides the results on how

maternal behavioral health influences maternal investments in children and child

outcomes. Section 5 presents factor analyses and Section 6 presents mother-fixed effect




                                                                                             3
models as robustness checks of our main results. Section 7 offers a discussion of our

conclusions and some policy implications.



2. Background and Theoretical Considerations

        Research in neurobiology and child development shows that stress in the home

environment can have important effects for the healthy development of children

(National Research Council and Institute of Medicine 2000; National Scientific Council

on the Developing Child 2005). This research also shows that early influences (positive

or negative) on emotional development in children can have lasting effects into

adulthood. The quality of maternal care early in life is known to be important in animals

and humans (McEwan and Seeman 1999). Stable and supportive care-giving

environments have been linked to an enhanced ability to cope with stress that reduces the

likelihood of mental health problems in children and with lasting effects into adulthood.

        Maternal depression and substance abuse is thought to disrupt the care giving

environment (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 1999; Kim-Cohen, Moffit

et al. 2005). Earlier literature on maternal depression established evidence that there are

important and lasting effects of maternal depression on child development (Cogill,

Caplan et al. 1986). Cogill and colleagues (1986) showed that maternal depression early

in a child’s life (1st year) has a negative and significant effect on cognitive skills

measured at age 4. A meta-analysis published in 1999 reviewed 33 studies of the

relationship between maternal depression and child behavior (Beck 1999). That review

showed a consistent relationship between maternal depression and child behavior. The




                                                                                              4
results showed that behavior problems occurred both in the pre-school period and among

school aged children.

       Two more recent studies are consistent with those from the 1980s and 1990s. In

one, (Petterson and Albers 2001), the authors analyzed the National Maternal and Infant

Follow Back Survey data to examine the impacts of maternal depression and poverty on

child development. They found that mothers with likely depression as measured by a

CESD score of 16 to 30 and 30 and above had young children that scored lower on

cognitive and motor skills development tests. They also found that higher income levels

appear to attenuate but do not eliminate the effects of maternal depression. A British

study examined the link between maternal depression and antisocial behavior in children

(Kim-Cohen, Moffit et al. 2005). Using data on twins, the authors examined the impact of

maternal depression that occurred during the first 5 years of the children’s life on

antisocial behavior measured at age 7. They also examined the incremental effects of

maternal depression that occurred when the children were aged 5 to 7 years. The results

indicated a significant impact on antisocial behavior at age 7 of both early life maternal

depression and more recent depression.

       The presence of mental health problems in school aged children has been linked

to long term reduction in the accumulation of human capital (Currie and Stabile 2008).

Currie and Stabile (2008) use the NLSY to examine the impact of mental disorders on

children and their subsequent academic achievement. They show that Attention Deficiet

and Hyperactivity Disorder and conduct disorders both have negative and significant

impacts on achievement test scores and levels of educational attainment. Together these




                                                                                             5
results suggest that maternal depression and substance abuse, treatable mental disorders,

may affect the accumulation of human capital early in life.

A Comment on Gene-environment interactions

       An emerging literature on the role of gene-environment interactions as predictors

of depression and substance abuse offers a final piece of background that is relevant for

framing our study. Both depression and addictive disorders have a large heritable

component, with estimates based on twin studies in the range of .4 to .5 as the share of

depression and alcohol disorders that are heritable (Sullivan et al. 2000; Caspi et al.

2008). Research has long struggled with understanding how and when genes lead to

psychiatric disorders. After a number of unsuccessful attempts to isolate particular genes

that “cause” specific illnesses, researchers have instead identified gene environment

interactions that likely cause depression and substance use (Heath and Nelson 2002;

Kendler, Garnder et al. 2002; Caspi and Moffit 2006).

       For example, stressful life events are common predictors of depression, but the

presence of symptoms and diagnoses of depression following stressful life events were

much more common among individuals exhibiting a particular polymorphism in one

region of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene (Caspi and Moffit 2006). Similarly,

alcoholism often runs in families, but it is unclear precisely how much of this relates to

familial environment compared with genetics. Evidence suggests that highly traumatic

events such as sexual abuse as a child, interact with elevated genetic risk of alcoholism to

raise the chance that individuals become alcoholics (Heath and Nelson 2002; Kendler,

Garnder et al. 2002; Caspi and Moffit 2006). Taken together, this evidence suggests that

an attempt to isolate the effect of maternal depression or substance abuse on children




                                                                                             6
requires rich information about the mother’s background. In addition, such evidence

suggests that a model of child development of human capital cannot treat all genetic

influence as fixed, as a model with child fixed effects might.



Theoretical Considerations

       Cunha and colleagues (Cunha, Heckman et al. 2006; Cunha and Heckman 2007)

have developed a model that links skills or capability (education, cognitive, emotional

and behavioral attributes that underlie economic success) formation in children to

parental capabilities and parental investments in child development. The model

developed by Cunha et al. (2006) also recognizes that there are multiple stages in child

development. The findings from the neuroscience literature (National Research Council

and Institute of Medicine 2000) indicate that parental capabilities and investments have

different impacts on child development at different stages of development. The model of

Cunha et al. (2006) yields several implications. First, cognitive, behavioral, physical and

other capabilities are interdependent. That is, cognitive skills obtained today depend on

investments in health and emotional development among other factors (possibly made at

an earlier point in time). Second, parental capacities to invest in child capabilities are

important and have varying impacts at different points in a child’s development. Third,

past investments affect the impact of current investments in child development.

       The empirical work presented in this paper takes these ideas as a point of

departure. Consider the skills formation function of Cunha et al. (2006)

       (1) St+1 = F( PS, St, It; Mt)




                                                                                              7
Where S is the level of skill formation, PS is parental skill attributes (education, cognitive

abilities, etc.), I is the investment in child capabilities at time t, and M is mother’s mental

health status at time t. We focus on mother’s mental health status because of the mother’s

central role as a care giver and the existing clinical evidence of a link between mother’s

mental health and child skills acquisition. We focus on depression and substance abuse

because they are relatively common behavioral health problems in women of child

bearing age and because they can disrupt care giving. We observe the impact of

depression and substance use and abuse on measures of cognitive and behavioral skills

formation early in a child’s academic career (grades 1-5 and again in grades 6-9). In our

conception, maternal depression and substance abuse can affect skill formation in

children by reducing the effective level of parent skills (PS) and by reducing the

productivity of parental investments in child skills development (I). The literature on the

impact of mental disorders on human capital formation shows that mental and substance

abuse problems affect productivity, conditioning on human capital attributes (Frank and

Koss, 2005).

        The empirical implications of these ideas are that models aimed at estimating the

impact of depression and substance use and abuse on child development should condition

on parental skill levels. Our empirical analysis tries to account for the mother’s stock of

human capital at the time of the child’s early schooling. We then estimate the impact of

proximate mental health shocks (maternal depression, substance abuse) on the parents’

level and effectiveness of investment in skill acquisition for their children. We adopt an

empirical strategy that directly examines the effect of symptoms of maternal depression

and substance abuse on indicators of maternal investments in child development,




                                                                                              8
essentially comparing maternal investments and child outcomes across groups of mothers

with and without significant symptoms of depression and/or substance abuse. To

strengthen this comparison, we combine the detailed information about the mother’s

family of origin with early measures of the mother’s behavioral health and substance use

to match mothers based on their risk of having significant symptoms of depression using

propensity score methods (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983). We condition out mother’s

measured human capital, family endowments, risk of mental health problems, and other

capabilities (Currie and Thomas 1999). This ensures that we are comparing mothers who

are similar with respect to observed characteristics that are associated with a high

likelihood of depression. Using these methods, we find consistent evidence that

symptoms of maternal depression, and to a lesser extent, symptoms of maternal alcohol

abuse/dependence have a significant and moderate sized adverse effect on child behavior.

These effects are also present in maternal fixed effect models that compare siblings with

and without exposure to maternal behavioral health symptoms in primary school.



3. Data and Empirical Strategy

The 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth

       We used the 1979 cohort of the NLSY (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2005) to follow

a cohort of women and their children through grade nine of the child’s schooling. The

NLSY conducted in-person interviews with individuals aged 14-22 in 1979, re-

interviewing them annually through 1994 and every 2 years since then. Blacks,

Hispanics, and economically disadvantaged non-black/non-Hispanic youths were over-

sampled. Until 1989, interviews were conducted using pencil and paper before




                                                                                            9
converting to Computer Assisted Personal Interviews in 1990. About 4,000 women were

interviewed over the period from 1979 through 2004. Initial response rates were high, 87

percent, and retention rates were about 90 percent through 1994. In the years since,

retention rates have ranged from 77 to 85 percent. The data set contains information on

demographics, household structure (both in the household of origin, and in new living

arrangements as respondents mature), education, income, cognitive ability, symptoms of

depression, substance use and symptoms use and dependence.

       Beginning in 1986, the NLSY collected information on all children of interviewed

females, through maternal reports, but also from direct assessments of children. For a

subset of questions, children age 10 and older were interviewed biennially regarding

family, school, and delinquent behavior. For our analyses, we selected all female

respondents with a preschool aged child (ages 0-4) in 1986. From this sample of 2,421

unique female NLSY respondents and their 3,333 children, we dropped 1327 children

missing one or more cognitive assessments. From the remaining 2006 children, we

dropped 116 children due to missing information on key variables such as maternal

depression and substance use, abuse, and dependence symptoms. We also dropped 303

children due to missing information on other covariates such as education and income.

This left us with a sample of 1587 children of female NLSY respondents. Each mother

was interviewed, 18 times, on average (from 1979 through 2004).

       Below we describe the behavioral and cognitive variables of interest. Because the

longitudinal nature of the NLSY implies some complexity regarding the timing of

different measures used, we display the timing of our most important measures, maternal

depression and substance use/abuse and child outcome measures in Figures 1 and 2 and




                                                                                         10
the means of our dependent and independent variables of interest are shown in Tables 1

and 2.

Maternal investments in children – the HOME scales

         To understand how maternal depression and problem substance use might

influence children, we first examine measures of investments in children made in the

home. The NLSY asked detailed questions regarding parental involvement with children

using the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment-Short Form, adapted

from the HOME inventory (Caldwell and Bradley 1984). The NLSY public use data set

includes two separate summary scales: a cognitive stimulation scale and an emotional

stimulation scale. Examples of cognitive stimulation scale questions include, “How

many children’s books does your child have?” and emotional questions like, “If your

child got so angry that he/she hit you, what would you do?” Questions differ based on

relevance for the child’s age. We used the continuous measures of these scales contained

in the NLSY as measures reflecting maternal inputs. Table 1 summarizes the scales we

use in analyses of maternal inputs. The total HOMES scale measure averages 985 with a

standard deviation of about 150. The cognitive stimulation score has a similar mean and

variance. The emotional stimulation score averages about 48, but with a standard

deviation close to 30.

Child outcomes

         We examine both the cognitive and behavioral outcomes of children. The

cognitive outcome measures were scores on the Peabody Individual Achievement Test

(PIAT) in Math and Reading Comprehension. We include two PIAT assessments for

each child, the first took place when the child was between the ages of 7 and 10, and the




                                                                                        11
second occurred when the child was between ages 11 and 14. In a separate assessment of

child behavior, mothers were asked multiple items regarding child behavior, the Behavior

Problem Index (BPI), which was adapted from Achenbach’s Child Behavior Check List

(Achenbach and Edlebroch 1978; Achenbach and Edlebroch 1979). As with the

cognitive measures, we include two measurements of the BPI , assessments between ages

7 and 10, and between ages 11 and 14. In addition, children aged 10 and older answered

9 items related to delinquency which were combined by NLSY staff to form a

delinquency scale (see the Appendix for details). For all children, we examine whether

the child has ever been suspended or expelled from school at any point during the

schooling years.

       Table 1 summarizes the child outcomes of interest for the 1587 children in our

sample. The cognitive measures are all standardized to have an average near 100 with

standard deviations in the range of 12 to 15. The behavior problems indices are similarly

standardized, although the variance is modestly higher for these (with standard deviations

ranging from 15-17). The delinquency scale is standardized to have a mean of zero with

higher numbers indicating increasing delinquent behavior. In this group of children born

to relatively young mothers, the average score on the scale is slightly positive, .055.

Finally, a sizeable minority of children in our sample, 22.4 percent, have experienced

suspension or expulsion from school.

Maternal mental health and substance abuse

        The empirical analysis described below, seeks to estimate the separate effects of

episodic symptoms of depression on investments in children and on cognitive and

behavioral outcomes of children. We chose this focus because there are many successful




                                                                                          12
psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatments available for individuals with mild

and moderate depression. Similarly, there are many effective treatments available for

individuals with substance abuse or dependence. As a result, the variables of interest

include maternal symptoms of depression, symptoms of alcohol abuse or dependence,

and heavy use of marijuana (which we use as a proxy for substance abuse or

dependence).

        The NLSY includes several direct and indirect measures of maternal mental

health based on interviews with the study participant.2 As part of our attempt to focus on

proximate symptoms of depression that occurred during a child’s primary school years,

we want to compare women at similar risk for having significant symptoms of depression

thus we take account of indicators of early depression in mothers before the child was

born. We also did this to account for the most recalcitrant cases of depression that might

be less amenable to treatment. In 1980 and 1987, the ten item Rosenberg scale of self-

esteem (Rosenberg 1965) was administered to mothers. Although this scale was not

designed to measure depression directly, in another data set, the Longitudinal Study of

Generations, measures of the Rosenberg and the commonly used 20 item CES-D, or

Center for Epidemiological Studies – Depression Scale (Radloff 1977) are quite highly

correlated, with a correlation coefficient of .56 to .64.3 We created our proxy indicator of

depression in 1980 using the standard cutoffs for low self esteem, a score below 10 on the

30 point Rosenberg scale. We then used these in our procedure for balancing risk of


2
  In the case of depression and substance abuse or dependence, diagnosis of these disorders relied heavily
on self-reported symptoms of the patient.
3
  We verified the correlation among female respondents in the National Longitudinal Survey of Generations
(Bengston 1997), a survey of California health maintenance organization enrollees age-matched to the
same cohort as the NLSY. In this survey, measures of the CES-D and the Rottenberg scale were
significantly (p<.0001) positively correlated with ρ ranging from .56 to .64 during years in which both
measures were available (1988, 1991, 1994, and 1997).


                                                                                                       13
depression in mother with and without depression during children’s primary school years.

Our approach is described more fully later in this section.

         In 1992, respondents completed the 20 item CES-D, or Center for

Epidemiological Studies – Depression Scale (Radloff 1977). Respondents answer

questions regarding their mood, energy level, feelings of worth, and related questions.

Generally, a score of 16 or higher on a scale from 0 to 60 indicates a cluster of symptoms

consistent with a high likelihood of a diagnosis of depression. Respondents also

responded to an abbreviated seven item CES-D in 19944, and again in the first interview

after age 40. Respondents answered a nine item CES-D scale when taking the age 40

assessment in 1998 and later. We coded women as having symptoms of depression if

they scored 16 or higher (1992 CES-D) and if they scored more than one standard

deviation above the mean on later CES-D scales.5 For the bulk of our analyses, we

categorize a mother as depressed (during a child’s schooling years) if she had a CES-D

score at or above the cutoff in both 1992 and 1994. We do this to minimize the

measurement error natural in population based measures of depressive symptoms. In

models that examine within-mother outcomes of multiple children, we use a single

measure of depression (1992, 1994, or age 40) closest to the child’s 7-10 year old

assessment.

Substance use, abuse, and dependence measures

         The NLSY asked respondents extensive questions regarding use of alcohol and

illicit drugs, and in selected years, respondents were asked to report a wide array of

symptoms associated with alcohol abuse or dependence. To target alcohol use associated

with functional impairment, we used questions from the 1985, 1989, and 1994 surveys to

code individuals with 2 or more symptoms of alcohol abuse or dependence (See the

appendix for a list of the questions used to identify symptoms.) Very few mothers

reported use of illicit drugs other than marijuana, so we focused on measures of heavy

marijuana use based on the 1984, 1992, and 1998 surveys. Marijuana use was considered

heavy for individuals that had used marijuana more than 5 times in the last 30 days

(1984), or at least 1-2 times per week in the last 30 days (1992 and 1998). Unlike the

NLSY questions on alcohol use, the survey provides no information regarding symptoms

related to marijuana use, and heavy use of marijuana in itself does not necessarily imply

that mothers were impaired by marijuana use.

       Table 2 summarizes the maternal characteristics of interest, the rate of mothers

likely to have depression, alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms, and heavy marijuana use;

it also summarizes the set of covariates employed in each analysis. As teenagers and

young adults, based on Rosenberg scores, the mothers had rates of depression of 18.6

percent. This rate is in line with epidemiological evidence from the National Co-

morbidity Study Replication, or NCS (Kessler, Berglund et al. 2005). The NCS collected

information on US adults aged 18 to 54. In this study, 11.6 percent of women report any

mood disorder in the past year (8.6 percent for depression), and 23.4 percent experienced

an anxiety disorder, and over 30 percent are estimated to have a diagnosis of any mental

or substance disorder in the course of the year (Kessler, Berglund et al. 2005). Just over

3 percent had symptoms of alcohol abuse and/or dependence, similar to national numbers

on the 12 month prevalence of alcohol abuse.




                                                                                          15
Overview of Empirical Approach

       Our analysis of the influence of maternal depression and substance use or abuse

on child outcomes faces several common methodological challenges due to potential

reverse causation and omitted variables that may be correlated with both measures of

interest (maternal depression and substance use and abuse) and the child outcomes.

Reverse causation could occur if children who have poor behavior or low cognitive skills

cause stress for mothers that might trigger symptoms of depression, alcohol abuse, or

lead to heavier use of marijuana. The second potential threat to our analysis is that

unobserved variables could influence both maternal behavioral health and child

outcomes. For example, if mothers with lower cognitive skills also are at higher risk of

poor mental health, and if maternal cognitive skills affect the way in which mothers

invest in children, we might erroneously attribute child outcomes to maternal depression

when in fact the mother’s low cognitive endowment causes both poor mental health and

poor child outcomes. We take multiple steps to address these threats to inference.

Addressing the Potential for Reverse Causation

        The longitudinal nature of the NLSY helps to ensure that we identify symptoms

of depression and/or substance abuse that precede child assessments of behavior and

cognitive outcomes. We experimented with alternative specifications regarding the

measurement of a mother’s mental health and the measurement of child outcomes. In

each case, the relationship between maternal depression and child outcomes were as

strong in models where depression measures preceded measures of childhood outcomes

as they were in models where depression may have been measured at the same time or

after child outcomes. For example, most of the child outcomes at age 11 to 14 were a




                                                                                         16
function of maternal depression measured in 1992 and 1994, before the outcomes were

measured (see Figure 2), but these results are equally strong compared with outcomes

measured when children were ages 7-10, but using the same depression measure.

       One might still worry about reverse causation in the event that the birth of a

difficult child launched a series of depressive episodes in the mother. However, we can

test the robustness of our findings to such a threat by estimating mother-fixed effect

models that examine siblings who were and were not exposed to maternal depression

symptoms at the time of age 7 to 10 assessments. Because these observations will

necessarily be after the birth of both children, women for whom a difficult child launches

repeated or chronic depression would have symptoms throughout the schooling years of

all the children we observe in the NLSY, and thus such mothers would be dropped from

any mother-fixed effect analysis.

Addressing Omitted Variables

       The rich data in the NLSY minimize the potential threat of unobserved variables

because we can control for an expansive set of covariates. They will help us address

three of the most serious threats to inference a) that maternal ability is correlated with her

behavioral health and her inputs to children; b) that the permanent income of the mother’s

family of origin or her family as an adult makes it difficult to invest in child human

capital and also contributes to poor behavioral health; or c) that the genetic endowment of

the mother, including her propensity to have poor behavioral health and or her ability to

invest in education might affect child-rearing independently of behavioral health

problems. The measures included in the NLSY make it possible to better address such

threats than does the typical household surveys. For example, for each NLSY




                                                                                           17
respondent, we have a measure of IQ based on her 1980 percentile on the Armed Forces

Qualification Test. We also know details regarding the mother’s household of origin

during her high school years, so we can control for household structure, a measure of

average annual income in the mother’s household of origin (measured over the period

from 1979-84) and educational attainment of the mother’s parents.

       A unique feature in the NLSY is that respondents report depression and/or anxiety

of their parents, as well as whether a mother or father had problematic drinking behavior.

Throughout the paper, we refer to the mother’s parents as grandparents, since we are

focused on child outcomes. Also, due to the structure of the NLSY sample frame, many

mothers have siblings in the NLSY; we have measures of depression and substance

use/abuse among siblings too. We use these family measures of parent and sibling

behavioral health to control for family-level factors such as genetic predisposition to have

behavioral health problems. Such variables help us to control for genetic factors passed

on through family members that would not be affected by treatment of behavioral health

symptoms. Third, we combine the detailed information about the mother’s family of

origin with early measures of the mother’s behavioral health and substance use to match

mothers based on their risk of having significant symptoms of depression using

propensity score methods. This ensures that we are comparing mothers who are similar

with respect to observed characteristics that are associated with a high likelihood of

depression. Finally, as described above, we test the robustness of our main findings

among a sample of mothers with more than one child, using fixed effect specifications to

measure within-mother differences in child outcomes related to contemporaneous

symptoms of depression and/or alcohol abuse. This last approach is similar to the




                                                                                         18
approach taken in a study of substance use and children (Chatterji and Markowitz 2001)

in the NLSY.6

Propensity Score Models

        We employ propensity score methods to achieve two empirical goals of our

analysis. First, we wish to account for the impact of the characteristics of the mother’s

family of origin, including parental and sibling measures of behavioral health, a measure

of income, and the household structure. Also, as mentioned before, to focus on

symptoms of depression or substance abuse that are episodic, rather than a chronic and

severe mental disorder that is less amenable to treatment, we control for measures of

depression, alcohol abuse, and marijuana use of the mother before the child was born.

Second, we wish to balance observed characteristics that are predictive of maternal

depression to ensure that we are comparing women with similar tendencies to be

depressed. Thus, we balance our data so that the women in our sample share common

attributes during their youth that are associated with depression (whether or not they

actually display symptoms). The advantage of the propensity score weighting approach

we describe below (or any propensity score approach) over simple regression-based

adjustment is that we will compare those women who, on the basis of observed

characteristics, appear very similar. This prevents us from attributing child outcome

effects to depression when the distribution of observed characteristics of depressed

mothers (those with an indicator for depression based on 1992 and 1994 CESD measures)

differs dramatically from that of mothers who are not depressed.


6
 We employ multiple measures of maternal depression symptoms, and we examine alcohol abuse whereas
Chatterji and Markowitz (2001) estimate the effect of substance use. Our narrower definition captures
women who are impaired by drinking behavior, and we incorporate the effect of maternal depression on
primary school outcomes for children.


                                                                                                   19
        Using an adaptation of weighting methods initially proposed by Hirano and

Imbens (2001), but modified as described in Li, Zaslavsky and Landrum (2007), we use

the extensive information available in the NLSY on the mother’s youth to predict her

likelihood of depression (Hirano and Imbens 2001; Li, Zaslavsky et al. 2007). The

propensity score model takes the following form:

(2) log[Pr(DEPRESSED)/(1-Pr(DEPRESSED)] = β 0 + β 1 X ijYOUTH + β 2 Z ijYOUTH

where X is a vector of early life characteristics of the mother and Z captures characteristics

of the mother’s family and household of origin. The X vector of mother’s characteristics

when she was a youth includes: a measure of depression using the 1980 Rosenberg scale,

whether the mother had 2 or more symptoms of alcohol abuse or dependence in 1985,

whether the mother used marijuana 6 times or more in the 30 days prior to the 1984 survey,

whether the mother was an oldest child, the mother’s race and ethnicity, immigrant status,

and her 1980-81 AFQT percentile. The Z vector includes: whether the mother reports that

either of her parents (the maternal grandparents) had alcohol problems, whether either

maternal grandparent had anxiety or depression, whether the maternal grandparents were

married in 1979, the mother’s mean real family income 1979-1984, the mother’s number of

siblings in 1979, two indicators for whether the maternal grandmother completed high

school or some college, indicators for whether the mother had a sibling NLSY participant

who was depressed in 1980, had symptoms of alcohol abuse in 1985, or used marijuana

heavily in 1984. We then used the estimated parameters from (1) to construct a propensity

score, pˆ i = βˆ1 X iYOUTH + βˆ 2 Z iYOUTH . The propensity score formed the basis of person-level

weights that balanced the observed characteristics (from equation 1) of depressed and non-

depressed mothers, giving more weight to the overlapping portion of the distribution of



                                                                                                20
propensity scores. Specifically ω i = pˆ i , if the mother was not depressed in 1992 and 1994,

and ω i = 1 − pˆ i , if the mother was depressed in 1992 and 1994. This propensity score

weighting approach, described briefly in Li, Zaslavsky, and Landrum (2007), like more

commonly discussed inverse probability weighting techniques (Hirano & Imbens, 2001),

balances observed characteristics across treatment and control groups. However, in this

case, characteristics are balanced to resemble those among overlapping portions of the

treatment and control distributions of observed characteristics. This adapted technique

obtains average treatment effects, over the distribution of covariates in the population

where the treatment and control groups overlap, as opposed to the entire population. This

approach also minimizes the variance of our estimates, which can be excessively large in

inverse probability weighting techniques when individuals have a very low propensity

score. By construction, this propensity score weighting technique forces the distribution

of observed characteristics in the propensity model to be identical across the two groups.7

All estimates in the paper weight each observation with the propensity-score-based

weight.

           Table 2 displays a summary of variables used to predict maternal depression in

the propensity score models. One surprising statistic is the high rate of problem drinking

women report among their parents, 20 percent. This measure is admittedly crude, but we

would expect it to be considerably higher than the mother’s own alcohol abuse or

dependence both because of the measure (which likely includes drinking that does not

cause functional impairment) and because this variable reflects the perceived drinking

behavior of both parents, rather than a single individual. In fact, this number is close to

                                                                                            21
national estimates of the share of adults reporting that they lived with an alcoholic parent

any time before age 18. In a topical supplement to the 1988 National Health Interview

Survey, 18.6 percent of the adult, non-institutionalized population (19.6 percent of

females) reported that they lived with an alcoholic parent during their childhood

(Schoenborn 1991). In contrast, mothers report very low rates of anxiety and/or

depression among their parents, less than 4 percent, in contrast to national estimates

which are substantially higher.8 To address the potential for under-reporting of

depression and anxiety and possible over-reporting of problem drinking, where available,

we used sibling reports to increase the specificity of problem drinking questions and to

increase the sensitivity of questions regarding anxiety and depression among maternal

grandparents.

        A second factor that may seem surprising at first is the difference between sibling

rates of depression (based on the 1980 Rosenberg scale) compared to mothers, and the

differences between mothers and siblings on measures of alcohol abuse/dependence and

marijuana use. Note that mother’s siblings may include both male and female siblings.

These numbers in fact line up well with estimates of the differential prevalence of

depression and substance use disorders by sex. Women are nearly twice as likely to

report depression symptoms than men. In contrast, women are only one half to one third

as likely to report symptoms of alcohol abuse or dependence (Kessler et al. 2005).



Outcome models

8
 Given epidemiological evidence on rates of depression (over 6%) and anxiety (18%) in the adult
population, these adult children clearly are not aware of symptoms their parents may have experienced.
This is consistent with anecdotal evidence suggesting that even significant life struggles, such as those
overcome by immigrants to the U.S., are not shared with children (Kirk Semple, “Family Stories as Secret
Text for Immigrants,” The New York Times, March 16, 2009, p. A16).


                                                                                                       22
       To examine how maternal depression and substance use/abuse affect children, we

estimate models of both maternal inputs (the HOMES scales) and continuous child

outcomes. We estimate models of the following form:

(3)    Yi = α + β 1 * DEPRESSED + β 2 * ALCOHOL + β 3 * MARIJUANA + δ k + ΓX i

Where the measures of depression, symptoms of alcohol abuse or dependence, and heavy

marijuana use are the main variables of interest, and are coded as described above. The

model includes a set of age dummies to reflect the age of the child at the time the

outcome Y was measured in relation to a reference age, the modal age at which an

assessment occurred. This is important because child cognitive and behavior scores vary

widely with the age of the child. The vector X includes individual characteristics of the

child, the child’s mother, and the household at the time the outcome was measured.

These variables (defined in table 2) include: child sex, whether child is the oldest, number

of child’s siblings, whether the child was born to a teenage mother, mother’s marital

status, mother’s years of education, and a measure of permanent income (average annual

household income 1986-2004). Table 2 clearly demonstrates that the mothers in this

sample are atypical, because they are younger, on average, than all mothers (related to

our desire to follow child outcomes over a long period of time which required following a

sample of young mothers), and due to the oversampling of disadvantaged populations in

the NLSY. One third of the mothers are black, just over one fifth are white, and the

remaining mothers are Hispanic in origin (of any race). The mothers average just over 12

years of education (at the time of the child assessments), and about 60 percent of mothers

were married at the time that child assessments occurred. Finally, the mothers fall

relatively low in the distribution of AFQT scores. These characteristics may affect how



                                                                                          23
one generalizes results, but they are of interest because currently in the U.S.,

disadvantaged Hispanic and black women are disproportionately represented among

mothers due to higher fertility rates.

       In addition to the OLS models described earlier, we have one binary outcome for

children, suspension/expulsion from school at any point during the schooling years. We

estimate logit models of the same variables in (2), but the dependent variable is a

dichotomous indicator of ever being expelled or suspended. For all of the models above,

we re-estimated (2) adding in the covariates from the propensity score model in (2) to

verify that our results would be doubly robust to errors that could arise from any

misspecification in the propensity score model. Variance estimates may be reduced by

the addition of the covariates from the propensity score model to outcome models as in 2.

In our case, the estimates of parameters on maternal depression, alcohol abuse, and

marijuana use were very similar, so for parsimony, we present only estimates with the

covariates described for equation (3).

       Because we balance depressed and non-depressed mothers based on an extensive

set of early life characteristics, including behavioral health of mother and her family

members, we interpret the estimated β coefficients as the effect of proximate symptoms

of depression, alcohol abuse, and heavy marijuana use on maternal inputs and child

outcomes. By specifying the model in this way, we hope to isolate symptoms of

depression, for example, that are most amenable to treatment. We also aim to obtain

evidence on the nature of the mechanism linking depression and substance abuse to child

human capital formation by studying how these factors relate to maternal emotional and

cognitive inputs.




                                                                                          24
4. Main Results

Maternal Inputs:

       Table 3 displays results for our first set of outcome models, those estimating how

maternal emotional and cognitive stimulation varies with maternal depression and

maternal substance use or abuse. Two patterns emerge from this table. First, maternal

depression is estimated to have a significant influence on the supply of maternal

emotional stimulation measures to school aged children in both primary and middle

school years. The emotional stimulation sub-component of the HOMES falls by about 6

points (or one fifth of a standard deviation) if a mother has symptoms of depression.

Second, the magnitude of this adverse effect of depression is large, especially if one

compares it to the magnitude of other indicators that we think are likely to be important,

like household income. For example, the 6 point drop in the emotional sub-scale is larger

than the drop that occurs with an increase of one in the log of household income. Third,

the effect of maternal depression on the emotional stimulation scale does not hold for the

cognitive stimulation scale. Recall that the cognitive scale averages over 990, with a

standard deviation of nearly 150. Thus, the statistically insignificant 7 point drop in the

cognitive stimulation scale for mothers who are likely to be depressed versus those that

aren’t depressed is small. Finally, the table reveals a similar lack of influence of

symptoms of alcohol abuse or dependence among mothers on the cognitive stimulation

provided by mothers. In contrast, symptoms of alcohol abuse and/or dependence have

moderately large, and statistically significant, effects on the emotional stimulation

subscale measured when children were age 11 to 14. Together, our results imply that

behavioral health symptoms among mothers may have moderate effects on inputs that




                                                                                           25
influence a child’s emotional development and behavior, but have few measureable

effects on our measure of mother’s cognitive input.

       Table 4 shows models of child math and reading comprehension scores on the

PIAT. The main message from these models is that maternal depression (after

controlling for early life circumstances of the mother) has little or no measureable effect

on cognitive outcomes for their children. For young adolescents, age 11 to 14, having a

mother with symptoms of alcohol abuse is estimated to lower math test scores. Finally,

there is no discernable effect of contemporaneous maternal marijuana use on cognitive

outcomes among children.

       Table 5 reports the results for similar models of child behavior outcomes.

Strikingly, scores on the BPI are 7 points higher (indicating more behavior problems)

among children with mothers who are depressed. These results are consistent with the

decrement to emotional stimulation among these depressed mothers based on the

HOMES scale. As in the earlier results on emotional stimulation, these effects are

sizeable, especially in comparison to other measures such as household income.

However, it is difficult to link maternal depression to either delinquency of 10-14 year

olds, or suspension/expulsion, since these parameter estimates are small and not precisely

estimated. The estimated effects of maternal alcohol abuse on child behavior are mixed.

For younger children, alcohol abuse is associated with worse (higher) BPI measures. For

older children, this is not the case. Surprisingly, children with mothers who have

symptoms of alcohol abuse are significantly less likely to be suspended or expelled. The

mechanism for this is unclear, although the literature on children of alcoholics suggests

that some children respond to parental alcoholism by acting as parents and becoming




                                                                                            26
overachievers during school years, rather behaving less responsibly (American Academy

of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry 2002).9 Another surprising effect is that children of

mothers who are heavy marijuana users tend to engage in less delinquent behavior than

other children. In the case of marijuana, this may reflect our relatively crude measure of

use since use does not necessarily coincide with any functional impairment.

5. Factor Models

         As described earlier we examine several indicators of cognitive development

(PIAT reading and math scores) and several behavioral measures (BPI, reports of

suspension/expulsion, delinquency). Because few studies have assessed more moderate

effects of depression and substance use on cognitive and behavioral outcomes during the

school years, there is little guidance to indicate which behavioral measure or which

cognitive measure might be most important among children who have mothers with

behavioral health problems. Also, given the large number of outcomes we examine, we

want to reduce the dimensionality of our analysis to avoid problems of multiple

comparisons (the notion that with many outcomes, our variables of interest will randomly

predict our outcomes of interest with significance in at least some cases). Because these

measures seek in part to measure fundamental phenomena related to cognitive

development, learning, and social and emotional development, we develop summary

measures of cognitive development and behavior. This approach has the added advantage

of allowing us to combine very concrete measures, such as suspension/expulsion and the

delinquency scale, with more impressionistic indicators such as the BPI that might be

influenced by symptoms of depression in mothers.


9
  Such children do not escape negative consequences of growing up with alcoholics, however, as they
remain at elevated risk for alcoholism later in life, and they suffer from other behavioral health issues.


                                                                                                             27
       We create our factor measures by estimating a factor model. A factor that

combines our multiple outcome measures will increase the variation available compared

with any single measure. Also, because the factor analysis will use only information that

pertains to a single concept, the underlying factor in the analysis, to the extent that this

factor reflects cognitive or behavioral outcomes, the factor analysis will increase the

signal to noise ratio compared to the signal from any one measure alone. Thus, we

expect that the use of factors will increase our statistical power to estimate the effect of

depressive symptoms and substance abuse on child cognitive and behavioral outcomes.

Our approach follows previous work (Fryer, Heaton et al. 2006). We estimate these

models in two steps. First, we conduct the factor analysis from which we construct our

cognitive and behavior outcome measures. We follow Fryer et al. (2006) and focus on a

single factor with the greatest explanatory power if it explains more than 50% of the

variance in the proxy measures. In these data, the cognitive factor accounts for over 67%

of the variation in the proxies, while the behavioral factor accounts for 53% of the

variation in those proxies (see Table 6).

Results of Factor Analyses

       Table 6 displays results of the factor analysis. It shows that, as we suspected, the

cognitive measures capture related constructs and they contribute relatively equal weights

to the first factor. Similarly, the behavioral measures contribute comparable weight to

the underlying behavior factor. As noted earlier, the first factor accounts for more than

half the variation in both sets of proxy variables.

       Table 7 displays the results of analyses using our constructed behavior and

cognitive indices as the outcomes of interest. This table confirms the results of the earlier




                                                                                               28
analyses. Maternal depression has relatively little effect on cognitive outcomes among

children in primary and middle school years. In contrast, it has a moderately large

negative effect on child behavior (about one third of a standard deviation). Heavy

marijuana use by mothers is estimated to have a negative effect on the cognitive score

that is significantly different from zero at conventional levels. Surprisingly maternal

alcohol abuse and dependence is estimated to have a positive and significant effect on the

cognitive factor for the 7-11 year olds. This puzzling result is stable to changes in

specification.

6. Fixed Effect Models

       Our preferred models are those presented in tables 3 through 6 because they allow

us to capture the influence of contemporaneous maternal behavioral health at different

points in time for children in primary and middle school years. We deliberately chose not

to look “within child” at the effect of maternal depression because depression might

matter differently for children at different ages and we did not want to assume that the

effect of behavioral health problems should be the same at different ages. However, most

women in our sample have more than one child, allowing us to examine the impact of

maternal behavioral health for different children, measured at similar ages. Thus, for an

expanded sample of NLSY women with multiple children (not just the mothers of our

1587), we estimated age 7-10 outcomes as a function of maternal depression symptoms,

controlling for mother-specific fixed effects. With the inclusion of fixed effects, it was

no longer necessary to use the propensity score weighting. However, we did control for

the time varying covariates used in the rest of our child outcome models. The results of




                                                                                           29
these within mother models for 2653 women with 2 or more children are shown in Table

9.

         As in our previous results, maternal depression seems to be exerting the most

important effect on child behavior measures but not for child cognitive measures. The

BPI is 3.3 points higher for children who are assessed during a period shortly before,

during, or after an interview in which the mother had symptoms of depression according

to her responses on the CESD. Given that the measures of depression do not necessarily

match up to child assessments as well as in the earlier models, and considering the

variation absorbed by the maternal fixed effects, we view this result as strong

confirmation of our main finding, that maternal depression interferes with child

behavior.10 Our results from the HOMES scales suggest that this negative influence of

maternal depression operates mainly through decrements in emotional stimulation at

home, rather than through lowered opportunities for cognitive stimulation.



7. Conclusions and Implications

The analysis reported here shows that symptoms consistent with a high likelihood of

depression in mothers of young school age children interfere with measures of social and

emotional development. This result is robust to a variety of empirical specifications. We

uncover evidence suggesting that the mechanism through which depression affects the

social and emotional development of grammar school aged children is through the

disruption of parenting activity that manages anger, misbehavior and other emotions of


10
  We also estimated models of behavior using sub-scale for internalizing mental health problems (anxiety
and depression) and externalizing behavior (conduct disorder). The results indicate that a high likelihood
maternal depression affects both types of behavior problems. Detailed results are available from the authors
upon request.

young children. At the same time we do not find any evidence that maternal depression

has a meaningful effect on measures of cognitive development (reading and math).

       To put the magnitude of the effects in context we use the parameter estimates

from our models of the BPI for young children (7-11) to consider the increase in

household income that would compensate for the impact of maternal depression. We

estimate that an increase in household income of about $63,000, assessed at the sample

mean, would produce an increase in BPI sufficient of offset the impact of mother’s

depression.

       The results for indicators of maternal alcohol abuse and dependence are

somewhat mixed. We find some evidence that alcohol abuse/dependence affects both

cognitive and social and emotional development. The estimates are less consistent across

models than were those for depression. We did find evidence suggesting that alcohol

abuse/dependence indicators interfere with mother’s activities aimed at emotional

support. We are therefore more tentative in our view about the impacts of mother’s

substance abuse on human capital formation in young children. More investigation of the

mechanism and the impact on outcome of substance abuse problems in mothers is

warranted.

       Heckman and coauthors have produced evidence showing the importance of

investment in the social and emotional development of children to economic successes

later in life (Heckman, Stixrud et al. 2006). Our results highlight the role of maternal

behavioral health as an input into the social and emotional development of young

children. Specifically, we find that maternal depression can be especially disruptive of

child social and emotional development




                                                                                           31
       There are a number of effective strategies for the treatment of depression. They

can include psychotherapies, antidepressant medications and combinations of these

inputs. A number of these approaches have been tested on low income mothers of young

children and have been found to be highly effective (Miranda, Chung et al. 2003). This

means that recognizing and treating depression in mother’s of young children may

constitute an effective investment in human capital formation. Given the modest costs of

treating most cases of depression ($1200-$2000), and the potentially significant and

lasting effects that interruptions in social and emotional development can have of human

capital formation, greater attention to screening and treatment of at risk women (e.g.

Head Start mothers) with young children may be warranted.

In 1985, there were fewer questions regarding symptoms of alcohol abuse. Table A2
displays the six questions we used to construct symptoms of alcohol abuse or
dependence.

Table A2: Questions in the 1985 NLSY surveys used to construct 1985 measure of symptoms
of alcohol abuse or dependence
1. Once you started drinking, was it difficult for you to stop before you became completely
intoxicated?
2. During the past year have you often taken a drink the first thing when you got up in the morning?
3. Have you stayed away from work because of a hangover?
4. Has drinking hurt your chances for promotion or raises or a better job?
5. During the past year have you gotten into a fight while drinking?
6. Once you started drinking, was it difficult for you to stop before you became completely
intoxicated.


Delinquency scale (used for children aged 10 to 14)
Below are the nine questions asked to create the delinquency scale for children aged 10 to
14. Children aged 10 and older were asked, Have you ever:
    1. stayed out later than your parents said;
    2. hurt someone bad enough to need a doctor;
    3. lied to parents about something important;
    4. taken something without paying for it;
    5. damaged school property on purpose;
    6. gotten drunk;
    7. did wrong at school so that parent had to come pick them up;
    8. skipped a day of school without permission;
    9. stayed out one night without permission;
