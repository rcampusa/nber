Historically, investors holding corporate equities have earned a premium, or an

extra return for holding equities instead of bonds, which have more predictable

returns. Estimates of this equity premium in the United States average around 4

percentage points for the past two centuries (Siegel 1998) and around 7 percentage

points for the 1926–99 period (Center for Research in Security Prices).

       The historical size of the U.S. equity premium has puzzled economists

since the mid-1980s. Economists had assumed that the size of this premium is

primarily a measure of the compensation that investors demand for taking on the

extra risk inherent in equity investments. But the standard asset pricing model

which incorporates this assumption has not been able to account for an equity

premium as large as 4 percentage points; with reasonable levels of risk aversion

and other standard assumptions, the model predicts instead a premium around 0.25

of a percentage point (Mehra and Prescott 1985, Hansen and Jagannathan 1991).
                                           2


This discrepancy between data and theory has come to be known as the equity

premium puzzle.

       The puzzle has led to some fruitful work. (See the 1996 literature review

by Kocherlakota.) The surprising historical size of the equity premium suggests

that something else besides inherent risk is determining its size, something related,

perhaps, which the standard model is simply not capturing. One view in the fi-

nance literature is that this something is market imperfections—things like the

inability of investors to fully insure against major risks outside the organized stock

markets, such as shocks to their labor income; the significant direct and indirect

costs that investors face in order to make transactions; and incomplete knowledge

among investors about existing investment opportunities.1 These imperfections are

thought to decrease the willingness of investors to bear risks and so increase the

return they require for investing in risky assets, including stocks.

       This view about the reason for the large historical equity premium is con-

sistent with recent U.S. experience. If the view is right, and the historical premium

is primarily due to market imperfections, then the premium can reasonably be

expected to shrink when such imperfections are reduced. That seems to be what

has happened in the United States over the last three decades. Dramatic technologi-

cal improvements clearly have been made since 1970, making it increasingly easier

for investors to access information, communicate and transact with others, and

enforce contractual obligations. At the same time, the equity premium has de-

creased significantly (Blanchard 1993, Cochrane 1997, Claus and Thomas 1999,

Siegel 1999, Wadhwani 1999, and Fama and French 2001).

       Here we demonstrate that decrease in the equity premium, using the classi-

cal Gordon (1962) stock valuation model. This model gives a formula for calculat-
                                           3


ing the equity premium as a function of the bond yield, the stock dividend yield,

and the expected growth rate in dividends. The Gordon model assumes that the

expected growth rate in dividends is a constant. We show that the model can be

readily modified to accommodate a different assumption, that the expected divi-

dend growth rate changes over time. We use the Gordon formula to calculate the

equity premium for several alternative measures of the aggregate U.S. stock portfo-

lio and several alternative assumptions about stock dividends and bond yields, and

we get basically the same result: the equity premium has come down significantly

in the last three decades. In fact, some of our exercises suggest that the premium is

now about where the standard model says it should be.

       Note that in calculating the estimate of the equity premium, we do not

follow the common practice of simply calculating the historical average difference

between returns on stocks and returns on bonds. During a period when the equity

premium is declining, that simple calculation with historical averages may not

result in a good estimate of the premium that investors actually expect to earn in

the future. This is because the calculation misses the changes in prices that would

accompany an unexpected decline in the equity premium. Our more complicated

method of calculating the premium with a dynamic version of the Gordon model is

an attempt to capture all those changes.

       Our result, that the U.S. equity premium has declined over the last three

decades, confirms the results of other economists. However, we do not provide a

definitive explanation for the recent premium decline. Much more work must be

done to determine its cause and to build a full theory of asset pricing. Our work

does, however, lead to a definite warning for inexperienced investors. If the recent

decrease in the equity premium is due to the recent technological improve-
                                               4


ments—if some major market imperfections have been virtually eliminated—then

the premium can be expected to stay at its current small size for the foreseeable

future. Investors who rely on history to predict the returns they can expect from

the stock market, therefore, are likely to be disappointed.2

Formula

Here we derive a formula that we can use to calculate estimates for the size of the

equity premium at any particular point in time. To derive the formula, we rely on

the basic present value relation discussed in introductory finance textbooks: the

stock price equals the discounted present value of expected future dividends.

        We measure the equity premium at a given point in time as the difference

between the stock yield and the long-term bond yield.3 The bond yield is the dis-

count rate at which the price of the bond equals the discounted present value of the

stream of future coupon payments and the terminal principal payment. We define

the stock yield in an analogous way: It is the discount rate at which the market

value of stocks in the equity portfolio equals the discounted present value of the

stream of expected future dividends from those stocks. Therefore, the stock yield

can be thought of as the rate of return investors expect to earn over the long run

from their investment in equities.

        In particular, we define the equity premium r ep at time t as

(1)      r et p = r st − r bt.

Here r st is the stock yield and r bt is the bond yield. By definition, the yield rt of an

asset with price pt and dividend stream {dt}∞t = 0 satisfies the following equation:

                   ∞
(2)     pt =       τ=1
                         (1+rt )− τEt dt+ τ.
                                             5


The actual return on the asset is [(pt+1+dt+1)/pt] − 1, which is more volatile than

the yield. But, over long horizons, the yield and the return should have similar

means. Therefore, average yields are often used to forecast average returns.

        If we linearize equation (2) and solve for the yield, then we have


(3)     rt ≈ Et(dt+1/pt) + ω1Etgt+2 + ω2Etgt+3 + . . . + ωτEtgt+τ+1 + . . .


where ωτ = (1+g)τ−1(r−g)/(1+r)τ is the weight given to the expected dividend

growth rate in period t + τ + 1, gt = (dt /dt−1) − 1 is the growth rate of dividends, g

is the mean of the dividend growth rates, and r is the mean stock yield. (It can be

verified that the weights ωτ for τ = 1, 2, ..., ∞ sum to 1.) According to equation

(3), the stock yield is the sum of the dividend yield and a weighted average of the

expected future growth rates in stock dividends. This is the dynamic version of the

Gordon (1962) valuation model, which assumes that the expected dividend growth

rate is constant.

        Our formula is similar to one derived by Campbell and Shiller (1988).

However, Campbell and Shiller log-linearize the budget constraint for stock re-

turns, while we linearize the present value relation in equation (2). If at time t the

expected growth rate of future dividends is constant, then our formula for the yield

simplifies to the Gordon valuation model’s:


(4)     rt = Et(dt+1/pt) + g


where g is the constant dividend growth rate. This equation will hold even when

the expected dividend growth rate is not constant, but then g will be an equivalent
                                         6


constant growth rate that is some weighted average of expected future growth rates.

         We use equation (4) to construct our baseline estimates of stock yields.

Basically, our estimate for the equity premium is the stock yield thus computed

minus the yield on long-term government bonds.

Data

To estimate the equity premium for U.S. stocks at various points in time, we use

several different stock portfolios and bonds of different maturities. Our sample

period is 1926–99.4

Stocks

We use two portfolios of publicly traded stocks and one measure intended to cover

all stocks owned in the United States.

         The most commonly used benchmark portfolio in the financial press is the

Standard & Poor’s composite index (S&P stocks). Before 1957, this index covered

90 companies; since March 1957, it has covered 500. The stocks included in the

S&P index are those with the largest stock market value. With the addition of new

companies in 1957, the market value of S&P stocks more than doubled. (See Chart

1.) At the end of 1999, the market value of these stocks was roughly 1.2 times the

value of the U.S. gross national product (GNP).

         The market value of S&P stocks is now about 75 percent of the value of

all stocks traded in the major U.S. stock exchanges. To get a broader view, there-

fore, we also consider a broader stock market index: the value-weighted portfolio

of publicly traded stocks in an index constructed by the University of Chicago’s

Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP stocks). Between 1926 and 1961,

these include the stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE); be-

tween 1962 and 1972, the stocks traded there and on the American Stock Ex-
                                          7


change (AMEX); and since 1973, the stocks traded on the NYSE, AMEX, and the

Nasdaq Stock Market. The number of stocks traded on these exchanges has grown

from roughly 500 in 1926 to over 8,000 in 1999. (The market value of CRSP

stocks over this period is also displayed in Chart 1.)

       Still, many corporations issue stocks that are not publicly traded, so we

broaden our view further to attempt to include them. We consider as well data on

all stocks held by U.S. residents, data which are collected and published by the

Federal Reserve System Board of Governors (BOG stocks). These data are avail-

able only back to 1946. (Chart 1 displays the market value of these stocks too.)5

       Notice in Chart 1 that in 1946 the market value of BOG stocks is roughly

twice the value of CRSP stocks (which, again, in 1946 included only stocks traded

on the NYSE). In 1999, that gap is nearly closed, with the value of BOG stocks at

1.9 times GNP as opposed to 1.6 times GNP for CRSP stocks. Some publicly

traded stocks are held by foreigners, so the value of stocks held by U.S. residents

(BOG stocks) should not necessarily exceed the value of the stocks traded on the

major stock exchanges (CRSP stocks). In fact, according to these data, in 1981 the

value of publicly traded stocks seems to have been slightly higher than the value

of all stocks held by U.S. residents.

       In Chart 2, we plot the dividend yields for all three stock portfolios. Recall

that our formula for stock yields is the dividend yield for the stock portfolio plus a

measure of the expected growth rate in dividends. To calculate stock yields, we

use the arithmetic average growth rate in dividends during 1927–99 as the expect-

ed growth rate in dividends for the two publicly traded stock portfolios. For the

third stock portfolio—all stocks held by U.S. residents as reported by the Fed—we

construct a dividend yield by dividing the total dividends reported in the U.S.
                                          8


national income and product account (NIPA) data, which are available back to

1929 (U.S. Commerce, various dates), by the beginning-of-year total stock value,

which is available back to 1946 (FR Board, various dates).

       A comparison of Charts 1 and 2 shows clearly that most of the movements

in dividend yields are due to movements in prices. During the 1960s and the

1990s, when stock prices are relatively high, dividend yields are relatively low.

Before the 1980s, the three dividend yield series are very close. Thereafter, howev-

er, the yield for BOG stocks is higher than those for the standard stock indexes

because total NIPA dividends have grown faster than GNP.6 This growth is not

enough though to offset the rise in prices, so we do in fact see a significant decline

in the dividend yield.

       In Table 1, we compare the growth of nominal dividends for our three

portfolios to the growth of nominal output and the price level in the United States

during 1927–99. The output measure is nominal GNP, and the price level measure

is the consumer price index (CPI).

       Note that over the 1927–99 period, the average annual growth rates for the

S&P and CRSP stock portfolios are similar. The average growth rates of both

portfolios have been lower than that of nominal GNP over the sample period. The

main growth differences between these portfolios occur in the World War II years

and the high inflation years of the 1970s. In those periods, dividends of smaller

companies grew more than those of larger companies.

       In contrast, the average dividend growth for the portfolio of BOG stocks is

comparable to the growth rate in nominal GNP. However, the periods of high

growth for GNP do not coincide with the periods of high growth for BOG divi-

dends. World War II is a time of fast growth in GNP while recent decades have
                                          9


been a time of fast growth in dividends. Between 1985 and 1999, total BOG stock

dividends rose from 0.023 of GNP to 0.040 of GNP.

Bonds

For bonds, we use data on nominal yields of U.S. Treasury securities reported by

Ibbotson Associates (2000). In Chart 3, we plot yields for bonds of two maturities.

Over the 1926–99 period, the average yield on intermediate-term (5-year) bonds

was 4.8 percent while the average yield on long-term (20-year) bonds was 5.3 per-

cent. The difference in these yields is most prominent during the Great Depression

and World War II. In other periods, the term structure of interest rates is quite flat,

and the yields on intermediate- and long-term bonds are close.

        In our equity premium estimates, we concentrate on the long-term bond

yields. Table 2 lists their average values during 1926–99 as a whole and over vari-

ous subperiods. Chart 3 shows clearly that long-term bond yields peaked in 1981

and have come down significantly since then.

Estimates

Now we use our formula and the data just described to calculate estimates of the

U.S. equity premium over our sample period.

        The formula requires that, before computing the equity premium, we com-

pute the stock yield—the sum of the dividend yield and the average growth rate of

dividends. Chart 4 displays the results of that computation for our three stock

portfolios for each year during 1926–99, along with the yield on the long-term

government bond portfolio. The difference between the stock and bond yields is

our estimate of the equity premium.

        Table 2 lists the average stock yields for the entire 1926–99 period as well

as for the various subperiods. These calculations assume, remember, that the divi-
                                           10


dend growth rates are constant, the same as their average historical growth rates

during the 1926–99 period.

       From Chart 4 and Table 2, we can see that average stock yields during the

1960s and the 1990s are about the same. However, the equity premium must be

much smaller during the 1990s because the bond yields are higher then. Chart 5

and Table 3 display our estimates of the equity premium itself. For two of our

stock portfolios (the S&P and CRSP stocks), the equity premium is actually nega-

tive during the 1980s and close to zero during the 1990s.

       Recall that under the assumption of perfect capital markets, economic

theory justifies only a small equity premium (in the range of from 0 to 0.25 of a

percentage point). As can be seen from Chart 5 and Table 3, our estimated premi-

um is much larger than that for most of the 1926–99 sample period. Recently,

however, the premium has shrunk to a size closer to that which theory predicts.

       Between 1926 and 1970, for example, the average premium for the S&P

stocks relative to long-term government bonds is 6.8 percentage points. Since then,

this premium has averaged 0.7 of a percentage point. In 1999, the dividend yield is

1.36 percent, and the bond yield is 6.82 percent. If we add the average S&P divi-

dend growth rate to the S&P dividend yield and subtract the long-term bond yield,

we have


(5)    r9ep9 = (1.36 percent + 5.19 percent) − 6.82 percent

           = −0.27 of a percentage point

or an equity premium that is slightly negative.

       If we use the CRSP portfolio, then the equity premium is close to zero

(−0.05 of a percentage point) in 1999.

          For the total stocks held by U.S. residents, as measured by our BOG stock

portfolio, the decrease in the equity premium has been less dramatic because of the

recent growth in dividends. Between 1946 and 1970, these stock yields are 7.5

percentage points higher than bond yields on average. After 1970, this difference

shrinks to 3.1 percentage points. In 1999, the BOG equity premium is7


(6)       r9ep9 = (2.60 percent + 6.93 percent) − 6.82 percent

             = 2.71 percentage points.


Robustness

The assumption that dividends are expected to grow at a constant rate through time

may be too restrictive; after all, dividend growth rates have varied considerably

across decades (Table 1). Therefore, we next consider alternative assumptions on

the dividend process. We also consider the sensitivity of our results to different

measures of dividends and bonds of different maturities. We try here to determine

whether the apparent decline in the equity premium is due to mistaken assumptions

behind our calculations. It does not appear to be; these exercises do not change our

result.

Is Our Dividend Growth Too Low?

We start by adjusting the dividend growth to take account of what may be higher

productivity growth in the real U.S. economy. Some think that recent improve-

ments in information technology have led to sustainable higher productivity

growth. (See, for example, Jovanovic and Rousseau 2000.) This “new economy”

view assumes that the 1990s are much like the post–Industrial Revolution period,

which enjoyed the fruits of tremendous technological advances. Higher productivity
                                           12


translates into higher growth in output, earnings, and dividends, which our original

estimates of constant dividend growth did not capture.

       But we don’t think such growth bursts are permanent. Ultimately, real

growth increases are determined by growth in factors of production like labor and

output per worker. And recent growth in these elements has not been impressive.

In the 1990s, annual growth in the U.S. labor force has been roughly 1 per-

cent—lower than in earlier years, when more women and baby boomers were

entering the workforce. Similarly, productivity has grown only about 1 percent per

year (Krugman 1997).

       Still, suppose that the U.S. economy experienced not a permanent, but a

temporary increase in growth, with the rate eventually returning to the postwar

trend. Recall that we saw on Table 1 that the growth rate of dividends for BOG

stocks—all corporate equities held by U.S. residents—has recently accelerated

along with GNP. Other evidence for a temporary increase is the recent consensus

forecasts from the Institutional Brokers Estimates System (IBES); they predict

above-average earnings growth over the next five years. With earnings projected to

be higher, dividends should be too.

       Suppose that we assume that the growth in dividends will continue to be

high for, say, the next 5 years and then will revert back to its long-run rate. Be-

tween 1980 and 1999, the BOG stock (NIPA) dividends grew roughly 3 percentage

points per year faster than their historical annual average of 6.9 percent. If we

expect dividend growth to run at 9.9 percent for five years and then revert to the

long-run rate of 6.9 percent, the formula for the price of BOG stocks in 1998 can

be written as


(7)    ps,98 = [d99/(1+rs)] + [d00/(1+rs)2] + [d01/(1+rs)3] + . . .
                                         13


            = [d99/(1+rs)]{1 + [1.099/(1+rs)] + [1.0992/(1+rs)2]


                             + [1.0993/(1+rs)3] + [1.0994/(1+rs)4]

                             + [1.0995/(1+rs)5] + [(1.0995)(1.069)/(1+rs)6]

                             + [(1.0995)(1.0692)/(1+rs)7] + . . .   }.

       We can use the latest available dividend yields for BOG stocks to back out

a value for rs. Doing this calculation, we find that rs = 9.86 percent. If rb = 6.82

percent, then the equity premium is 3.04 percentage points. This is a bit larger than

our baseline 1999 estimate of 2.71 percentage points, but it is still much smaller

than the 1946–70 average of 7.5 percentage points.

       As another example, consider our calculations for the S&P stocks. Earlier,

we used a dividend growth rate for these stocks of 5.19 percent, which is the aver-

age growth rate in their dividends during 1927–99 (Table 1). This growth rate is

significantly lower than that of GNP, which grew 6.72 percent on average over the

same period. Suppose that we forecast future growth in S&P stock dividends to be

more in line with average GNP growth. This would increase our estimate of the

S&P-based equity premium from −0.27 percentage points to 1.26 percentage

points. (See Table 4.) But again, even adjusted for potential temporary increases in

dividend growth, the estimated equity premium is much smaller than the historical

average.

Is Our Dividend Yield Too Low?

Now we see if using different measures of dividends in our formula makes a dif-

ference to our estimates of the equity premium. In our earlier computations, we

considered cash dividends only. During the 1980s, however, corporations increased

the amount of their share repurchases, possibly as a way of providing a tax advan-
                                          14


tage for shareholders. Since share repurchases form a part of the total distributions

to shareholders, some think they should not be ignored when measuring dividends.

        Theoretically, adding share repurchases to cash dividends should not

change our calculated equity premium. When a broader measure of divi-

dends—cash dividends plus share repurchases—is used in equation (4), g should

be the growth rate in that broad measure. When a narrow measure of divi-

dends—just cash—is used, then g should be the growth rate in that narrow mea-

sure. If share repurchases are simply substitutes for cash dividends, then the level

of the stock yield, and thus the size of the equity premium, should be the same for

both measures.

        To see this, consider a simple example of Wadhwani (1999).

        As a first scenario, suppose that a firm makes a steady annual profit of

$1,000 and pays the entire profit as dividends. Suppose also that the number of

shares outstanding is 1,000 (which implies dividends per share equal to $1). If the

discount rate rs on equity is 10 percent, then the price of the stock is $10 [ps,0 =

d1/(rs−g) = 1/0.1].

        Now consider a second scenario which involves repurchasing shares. Sup-

pose that the firm instead pays half of its $1,000 profit in dividends and half to

repurchase shares. Let Nt equal the number of shares outstanding in year t. Divi-

dends per share in t are, therefore, $500/Nt, with a growth rate given by


(8)     gt = (dt/dt−1) − 1 = [(500/Nt)/(500/Nt−1)] − 1 = (Nt−1/Nt) − 1.


In words, the rate of growth of dividends per share is equal to the rate of decline

in the number of shares outstanding. Let ps,t be the share price in year t. Because

shareholders stand to get the whole profit stream regardless of the corporate divi-

dend policy, it should be true that
                                          15


(9)     Nt ps,t = $1,000/0.1.

If $500 is used to repurchase shares at price ps,t, then

(10)    ps,t(Nt−1−Nt) = 500.

Combining equations (9) and (10), we get

(11)    Nt /Nt−1 = 1/1.05.

Hence, the growth rate for dividends is 5 percent per year.

        Without share repurchases, we compute a dividend yield of 0.10 and a divi-

dend growth rate of 0 percent. With share repurchases, we compute a dividend

yield of 0.05 and a dividend growth rate of 5 percent. In both scenarios, the initial

share price is $10 and the stock yield is 10 percent. For the second scenario, we

simply treat the share repurchases as if they were a one-to-one substitute for divi-

dends. Therefore, we should get the same equity premium whether we use the

narrow or the broad measure of dividends.

        We display in Chart 6 both of these measures of dividend yields, calculated

for the BOG stock portfolio.8 The narrow series is the portfolio’s total dividends

each year divided by the stock market’s total value in the preceding year (as

shown in Chart 2). The broad series is total dividends less net new equity issues

for both domestic nonfinancial corporations and financial corporations, all divided

by the stock market value in the preceding year. Net new equity issues are equal to

new share issues less share repurchases. Chart 6 shows that the net new equity

issues can add significantly to the volatility of payouts.

        However, the levels of the narrow and broad measures of dividend yields

both average 4.4 percent over the post–World War II period. The main difference

between the two series is that broad dividend yields are more volatile. That makes
                                          16


it harder to form expectations for the broad yield and for future dividend growth

rates. We thus are better off using the narrow measure of dividends in our estimate

of the equity premium.

Is Our Bond Yield Too High?

All that we have left to tinker with is estimates of bond yields. The equity premi-

um has decreased in the 1990s primarily because bond returns and yields have

been dramatically higher than average during those years. (See Chart 3.) In our

calculations for the equity premium in 1999, we used a nominal bond yield of 6.82

percent, which is the yield of a 20-year U.S. Treasury bond. Is this yield too high?

       It is certainly higher than the yield on bonds with shorter maturities. Over

the period 1926–99, the average yield on 20-year Treasury bonds was 0.5 of a

percentage point higher than the average yield on 5-year Treasury bonds. (See

Chart 3.) In 1999, the 5-year bond yield was 6.5 percent, 0.3 of a percentage point

below the 20-year yield. However, using this adjusted 1999 value in our formula

doesn’t change the premium estimates much. The value would imply that r9ep9 is 0.1

of a percentage point for the publicly traded (S&P and CRSP) stock portfolios and

3 percentage points for the total (BOG) stock portfolio—more or less the values

we got with the longer-term bonds.

       A more reasonable argument for a higher premium is based on transaction

costs due to the illiquidity that investors face with government securities. Costs

incurred in shifting out of such securities can be as much as 0.5 of a percentage

point. If we subtract that much from our bond yield estimate of about 6.8 percent,

then our equity premium formula gives an estimate of 0.3 of a percentage point for

the publicly traded portfolios and 3.2 percentage points for the total stock portfolio.

Yet, again, these estimates are fairly close to our original estimates.
                                          17


The Bottom Line

Thus, our exercises with alternative assumptions have not shaken our result. Add-

ing net share repurchases to our calculations does not affect our equity premium

estimates. Allowing for higher dividend growth does—but extraordinary growth in

dividends is needed to get estimates close to the historical averages. Lowering

bond yields also increases our estimates a bit, but bond yields have increased dra-

matically over our sample period. Taking account of large transaction costs due to

illiquidity increases our estimates only mildly.

        Our bottom line is that the U.S. equity premium has declined significantly

during 1970–99. We see this even when we use the higher stock yields for total

stock holdings of U.S. residents (the BOG stock portfolio); reasonable assumptions

lead to a premium of about 3 percentage points. For the stock portfolios that most

people analyze—S&P stocks and CRSP stocks—the premium is between 0 and 2

percentage points. To get a value around 2, though, we need to assume much faster

dividend growth in the near-term than is observed historically as well as large

transaction costs for bonds.

Reasonableness

We have used the stock valuation model in equation (3) to calculate the equity

premium at different points in time. The sizes of premium we computed should

correspond to what investors expect to get only if their expectations about the

future dividend growth rate match ours. While some may think that this is not

likely, we argue that it is.

        At face value, some of our estimates might not seem reasonable. For sever-

al years in our sample, our calculated equity premium is quite close to zero. For

example, the premium calculated with S&P stocks is −0.26 percentage points at the
                                        18


end of 1982 and −0.27 percentage points at the end of 1999. If these estimates are

indeed correct, then between 1982 and 1999, investors must have earned the same

rate of return from stocks and bonds, aside from the differences between the actual

dividends they received and what they expected to get from stocks. That is, $100

invested in either stocks or bonds at the end of 1982 would have about the same

value at the end of 1999. Yet a look at the data seems to show something else.

During 1982–99, S&P stocks earned an annualized average return of 18.35 percent,

while an investment in 30-year government bonds, made at the end of 1982 and

held until the end of 1999, earned an annualized average return of 11.68 per-

cent—substantially less than the stock return. Does this mean our equity premium

calculations are faulty?

       No; the comparison itself is faulty. It is comparing assets which have dif-

ferent maturities. Stocks have a significantly longer life than 30-year government

bonds, so these two types of assets would not necessarily have the same return

over any particular period. A more appropriate asset to compare to stocks is bonds

that have no maturity at all: consol bonds with coupons that grow at the same rate

that stock dividends are expected to grow.

       In our equity premium calculations, we assumed that S&P stock dividends

grew at a constant rate of 5.19 percent per year (their average annual growth dur-

ing 1927–99). Hence, consider a consol bond that pays annual coupons—a first

coupon of $1, paid at the end of the first year, and after that the coupons growing

at 5.19 percent per year, forever. Then, at the end of 1982, with the long-term

bond yield at 10.95 percent, the price of this consol bond will be $17.36. At the

end of 1999, with the long-term bond yield at 6.82 percent, the bond’s price will

be $145. Thus, an investment of $100 in this consol bond at the end of 1982,
                                        19


which is sold at the end of 1999, after having paid all the coupons in between, will

earn an annualized average return of 16.88 percent—a return close to the actual

18.35 percent annualized average return on S&P stocks over the period.

       Why the 1.47 percentage point difference, if our equity premium estimates

are close to zero for the period? By the end of 1999, the expected S&P dividend

growth rate may have increased somewhat from our assumed 5.19 percent. That

would increase the yield of S&P stocks and so the equity premium. We saw that,

recall, when we changed our assumption of growth in dividends from their 5.19

percent historical average to the 6.72 percent historical average growth of GNP.

That changed assumption increased our premium estimate to 1.42 percentage

points—which is still small, but in the range of the value calculated with the sam-

ple consol bond.

Confirmation

Our bottom line is consistent with those of several other recent studies that have

compared U.S. stock and bond yields over time.

       Perhaps the earliest is the study done by Blanchard (1993). He compares

expected real yields on stocks and bonds during 1929–93. He computes expected

yields as fitted values of regressions on a list of variables assumed to be part of

investors’ information sets when expectations are made. As we do, Blanchard uses

both intermediate- and long-term bonds. However, the stock portfolio he uses in-

cludes only publicly traded stocks; he does not consider the total stock portfolio

reported by the Fed (BOG stocks).

       The results of Blanchard’s (1993) exercise are very close to ours for the

S&P and CRSP portfolios. For example, the difference between the yield on S&P

stocks and the yield on 20-year bonds that we display in Chart 4 is close to
                                         20


Blanchard’s estimates in his Figure 11. With additional data in the 1990s, we find

that little has changed. The premium for publicly traded stocks has remained

between 0 and 2 percentage points.

       More recently, Wadhwani (1999, Table 15) has compared real stock yields

with returns on U.S. Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS). Like Blanchard

(1993), Wadhwani only considers stocks that are publicly traded on the major U.S.

stock exchanges. Using data through 1997, Wadhwani estimates a real stock yield

of 4.9 percent—2.55 percent for the expected dividend yield (adjusted for

buybacks) and 2.35 percent for the expected growth in dividends. He uses a bond

yield of 3.2 percent calculated as the TIPS yield less the cost of illiquidity.

Wadhwani’s premium for 1998 is, therefore, 4.9 less 3.2, or 1.7 percentage points.

       Using data as of August 1999, Siegel (1999, p. 14) gets an even smaller

premium. He estimates a real S&P stock yield of 3.3 percent, which is the sum of

a 1.2 percent dividend yield and a real dividend growth rate of 2.1 percent. This

estimated stock yields falls below the August 1999 yield on TIPS bonds (3.3 vs.

4.0), producing a negative equity premium. Thus, Siegel looks for sources of divi-

dend growth that could potentially increase his premium. He argues that nothing in

the data can justify extrapolating the high historical stock yield forward. He also

argues that the shrinking of the equity premium may be less significant because

transaction costs have come down significantly.

       Fama and French (2001) conclude as well that the equity premium is

shrinking, but their reasoning is based on a different type of calculation than ours.

They compare stock yields (calculated as in our equation (3)) to average stock

returns (calculated as the sum of the dividend yield and the growth rate of the

stock price), and they find a discrepancy over time. These averages line up well
                                         21


for data between 1872 and 1949. From 1950 through 1999, however, the average

stock yields and returns diverge because stock prices grew much faster than divi-

dends. Fama and French show that over the post–World War II period, the growth

in stock prices has been significantly higher than the growth in dividends. Stock

returns are thus higher than the stock yields which are used to forecast returns.

        Fama and French (2001) argue that this implies that in the future both

stock returns and the equity premium will decrease. Consider a simple example

that illustrates this argument. Suppose dividends are growing at a constant rate of 4

percent per year; the risk-free rate is 4 percent; and the equity premium starts at 7

percentage points and shrinks steadily over 50 years to 1 percentage point. When

the equity premium decrease is not expected, a stock’s initial price is only 44

percent of the price that will prevail when that decrease is fully expected and taken

account of. By the end of the 50 years, the prices will converge to the same value

regardless of whether the equity premium decrease was expected. Hence, investors

would earn a higher rate of return when the decrease is not expected than when it

is (12.1 percent vs. 8.4 percent).

        Whatever their approach to the issue, all of these studies agree that the

U.S. equity premium is currently lower than it has been historically.9 These esti-

mates seem, however, to be in sharp contrast to the view of many academic econo-

mists. Welch (2000, p. 514) recently asked 226 professors of finance to forecast

the equity premium over different horizons. At the one-year horizon, their mean

forecast was 5.8 percentage points, with a standard deviation of 4.5. At the five-

year horizon, their mean forecast was 6.7 percentage points, with a standard devia-

tion of 2.6. For longer horizons, their mean forecast was roughly 7 percentage
                                           22


points, with a standard deviation of about 2. Apparently, finance professors do not

expect the equity premium to shrink.

       This view is also stated clearly in standard finance textbooks. Take, for

example, Brealey and Myers (2000, p. 158), who describe how to estimate a return

for a diversified stock market portfolio. They do this by taking the current interest

rate on U.S. Treasury bills plus the average equity premium over some historical

time period. The premium they use is 9.2 percentage points. In other words, they

simply extrapolate past returns forward.

       Brealey and Myers (2000) note that their result is consistent with security

analysts’ forecasts of earnings growth. But if dividends and earnings grow at simi-

lar rates, how can we get such different estimates for the equity premium? The

difference in estimates is due to assumptions about growth rates beyond the

analysts’ forecast horizon. To get a large equity premium, we must assume that

growth rates stay high forever. To get a premium as large as 9.2 percentage points,

we need to assume growth rates in dividends or earnings to be significantly faster

than growth rates in GNP.

       To see this, consider our calculation using NIPA dividends in equation (7).

If we had assumed there that dividends grow forever at 9.9 percent, then our esti-

mate of the equity premium would have been 5.7 percentage points. Instead, we

assumed that dividends grow at 9.9 percent for 5 years and then revert back to the

trend growth rate of GNP. Thus, our estimate of the equity premium is 3.04 per-

centage points. To get the estimate up to Brealey and Myers’ 9.2 percentage

points, we would need to assume nominal dividend growth of 13.2 percent per

year—almost twice as fast as the growth in nominal GNP. This is an unreasonable

assumption.

Concluding Remarks

Low predictions for stock returns have important implications for future invest-

ments and for new financial theories. It is hard to rationalize a shrinking equity

premium as a permanent shift in preferences. But institutional changes have oc-

curred in the United States that would result in a permanent shift in stock returns.

        One possibility not mentioned earlier is greater opportunities for portfolio

diversification. This idea was actually advanced by Merton (1987) before the 1990s

stock price boom, and more recently, the idea has been pursued by Heaton and

Lucas (2000). Merton shows that the equity premium can be substantially larger in

an economy with incomplete diversification than in one with perfect capital mar-

kets. Heaton and Lucas estimate that the recent increased participation in stock

markets can lead to as much as a 2 percentage point reduction in the equity pre-

mium and can therefore partially explain the high level of stock prices in the

1990s. This work goes only part way in accounting for the facts, but it seems to be

going in the right direction.

            If, however, the decline in the equity premium and the consequent rise in

equity prices are due to “irrational exuberance” as advocated by Shiller (2000),

then investors will be even more disappointed. When the exuberance evaporates

and the equity premium increases to a size closer to its historical average, stock

prices will fall.

We exclude the holdings of foreign residents so that we can later match up the

stock values with distributions paid on the stocks, which we do not have for for-

           According to economists at the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of

Economic Analysis, the difference between NIPA dividends and dividends reported

by the CRSP is attributable to differences in coverage. NIPA dividends are

benchmarked to corporate tax data collected by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.

The IRS’s corporate universe in 1997 covered 4.7 million tax returns. In addition

to including other public corporations which are not listed on the NYSE, AMEX,

and Nasdaq, this universe includes privately held corporations. A large subset of

the privately held sector is the category of S corporations, which grew rapidly

during the 1990s. According to the IRS, in 1997, this category accounted for 18

percent of total cash dividend distributions. Dividend distributions from S corpora-

tions would not be included in any aggregation of public corporate data.

       There is an issue about how some dividend distributions from S corpora-

tions should be categorized. If some of this income is not distributions for con-

sumption, then we would want to recategorize that income. Doing that would im-

ply a lower dividend yield (and thus a lower equity premium) than we report for

the BOG stock portfolio.
       7
           Again, if some dividend income from S corporations were excluded from

our measure of dividends, then this estimate of the equity premium would be low-

er.
       8
           We get a similar pattern when we use data from the CRSP/COMPUSTAT

Merged Database. The dividend yield increases significantly after 1985.
       9
           Bansal and Lundblad (2000) find that the equity premium has declined

around the world as well.

Appendix

Historical Returns on U.S. Financial Assets

In this appendix, we give an overview of historical U.S. financial asset returns.

These data have motivated much of the recent asset pricing literature and serve as

a useful background for those unfamiliar with the U.S. experience.

The Series

The accompanying table summarizes the average historical returns for stocks, long-

term U.S. government debt, and short-term U.S. government debt. The top panel of

data in this table lists annualized compounded nominal returns for different histori-

cal time periods.*

       Returns for the period 1802–1997 are taken from Siegel 1998. For

1871–1997, Siegel computed the stock returns from capitalization-weighted indexes

of all stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and, starting in

1962, all stocks traded on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) and in the

Nasdaq Stock Market as well. Capitalization-weighted indexes use a firm’s stock

price times shares outstanding as weights for individual firms. Before 1871, the

series are based primarily on stocks of financial institutions, like banks and insur-

ance companies.

       Siegel’s returns on debt are returns on U.S. government securities, both

short-term bills and long-term bonds, when available. When these are not available,

comparable highly rated securities with low default premiums are used.

       After 1926, the data on most stocks and on U.S. Treasury securities are

taken from Ibbotson Associates 2000. The small-firm stocks are those of firms in

the smallest quintile of firms in terms of their market value of equity, as listed in

the New York Stock Exchange. The S&P stocks are those in the Standard &
                                          27


Poor’s 500-stock price index. The Treasury bill has a 1-month maturity; the Trea-

sury bond, a 20-year maturity. The value-weighted stock returns are taken from the

data base of the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). As with Siegel’s

stock returns, these returns are a weighted index of all publicly traded firms on the

NYSE, AMEX, and Nasdaq. The weight for each firm in a particular month is its

market value (that is, its stock price times its shares outstanding) as of the previous

month divided by the total market’s value.

The Relative Values

Consider compounded annual nominal returns over the past two centuries. In the

period 1802–1997, stocks earned a premium of 4.1 percentage points over Treasury

bills. In the 20th century, the premium is even larger. Take, for example, the peri-

od 1926–99. The difference in average returns on the value-weighted portfolio over

Treasury bills is 7.1 percentage points—despite the fact that during this period the

United States experienced both the Great Depression and World War II. Small-firm

and S&P stocks both did better during 1926–99 than the value-weighted CRSP

portfolio, earning a premium of 8.8 and 7.5 percentage points, respectively. Even

during the period of the Great Depression and World War II, stocks earned a high

return—higher than bills by between 6.0 and 8.3 percentage points.

       In the middle panel of the table, we display standard deviations of the

annual nominal returns. Historically, stock returns are considerably more volatile

than Treasury securities—especially small-firm stocks. For example, the standard

deviation for small-firm stocks, which yielded the highest returns in every sub-

period, is 33.6 in 1926–99, whereas the contemporaneous standard deviations for

S&P stocks, Treasury bills, and Treasury bonds are 20.1, 3.2, and 9.3, respectively.

The variability of Treasury bond returns increased significantly after 1970 due to
                                          28


inflation uncertainty. Investors demanded a higher return on these bonds to com-

pensate for the perceived higher risk.

       In the bottom panel of the table, we report the real returns, which are the

relevant numbers for investors. (These are the nominal returns, adjusted for infla-

tion, as measured by the consumer price index.) Over the two centuries, the real

return on the value-weighted CRSP portfolio is 7 percent while that on Treasury

bills is only 2.9 percent. In the 20th century, the return to that short-term debt has

been even lower—falling below 1 percent after 1926. At the same time, real re-

turns for both small-firm and S&P stocks have been around 8 percent.

       In the accompanying chart, we show graphically how the various types of

financial assets have performed by plotting the changing value of $1 invested in

each type in 1926. The plot is intended to further illustrate the large differences in

returns across the asset types. We use a logarithmic scale for this chart because the

values of the investments are vastly different.

       The relative values are clear in the chart. A $1 investment in small-firm

stocks in 1926 could have been cashed in for more than $6,600 in December 1999.

A $1 investment in a portfolio with S&P or CRSP stocks would have turned into

around $2,000 or $3,000. While not as good as the small-firm portfolio, these

stock values dwarf those of Treasury securities of either maturity. A $1 investment

in 20-year Treasury bonds in 1926 could have been cashed in for only about $40

at the end of 1999, and the same investment in 1-month Treasury bills could have

returned only about $15.

Appendix Note

        *Given nominal returns rt , t = 1, ..., T, we calculate the compounded

average annual return as follows:


        100{[(1+r1)(1+r2) . . . (1 + rT)]12/T − 1}.


For real returns, we subtract the monthly inflation rate from rt before doing the

calculation.
