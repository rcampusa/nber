                                             ABSTRACT

The internal rate of return to schooling is a fundamental economic parameter that is often used to assess
whether expenditure on education should be increased or decreased. This paper considers alternative
approaches to estimating marginal internal rates of return for different schooling levels. We implement
a general nonparametric approach to estimate marginal internal rates of return that take into account
tuition costs, income taxes and nonlinearities in the earnings-schooling-experience relationship. The
returns obtained by the more general method differ substantially from Mincer returns in levels and
in their evolution over time. They indicate relatively larger returns to graduating from high school
than from graduating from college, although both have been increasing over time.

I        Introduction

The internal rate of return — the discount rate that equates the present value of two

potential income streams — plays a central role in the economics of human capital (Becker,

1964). Under standard conditions, it is privately profitable to take additional schooling if

the marginal internal rate of return exceeds the opportunity cost of funds.1 It is also socially

profitable if social returns and opportunity costs are captured in this calculation. Given

the centrality of the marginal internal rate of return, it is surprising that so few estimates

of this parameter are reported in the recent literature in labor economics which focuses

almost exclusively on the college – high school wage differential. Most of the literature

ignores taxes and tuition costs — two vital ingredients required to compute true economic

rates of return.

        The coefficient on schooling in a Mincer regression of log earnings on years of schooling

and years of post-school work experience is often interpreted as an estimate of the internal

rate of return. Psacharopoulos (1981), and Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2004, 2007) report

extensive tabulations of Mincer rates of return across many countries and time periods.

Recent evidence (e.g., Murphy and Welch, 1990, and Katz and Autor, 1999) shows that the

functional form of the Mincer model no longer adequately describes labor earnings for U.S.

workers.2 The received literature does not offer an alternative to the Mincer framework for

measuring the returns to schooling.

        In response to this evidence, we estimate more general models of earnings where the co-

efficient on schooling in a log earnings equation is not, in general, interpretable as an internal

rate of return. From estimated cross section earnings functions, we compute marginal inter-

nal rates of return to education separately for black and white men across different schooling

levels for different decades using data from the U.S. decennial Censuses and the Current

Population Survey (CPS). Our estimates account for nonlinearities and non-separabilities
    1
      This assumes life cycle income-education profiles cross only once for each educational level. See Hirsh-
leifer (1970) for conditions under which the internal rate of return is a valid investment evaluation criterion.
Heckman, Lochner, and Todd (2006) show how option values invalidate the internal rate of return as an
investment choice criterion. Heckman and Urzua (2008) present evidence on the empirical importance of
option values in schooling choices. The Mincer coefficient measures the marginal internal rate of return only
under special conditions which we discuss in this paper.

      Heckman, Lochner, and Todd (2003, 2006) test and reject the assumptions required to use the Mincer
model to estimate the internal rate of return.

in earnings functions, income taxes, and tuition. When contrasting these estimated returns

with the estimated schooling coefficient from a Mincer earnings function, we find that both

levels and trends in rates of return generated from the Mincer model are misleading for

many schooling levels.

    Most troubling, we find high estimated internal rates of return to high school comple-

tion in recent decades when we use more general non-Mincer models to compute rates of

return. We also estimate returns to college completion that are roughly double typical

interest rates assumed to govern schooling decisions. Our estimates call into question the

validity of empirical conventions invoked in the recent literature on schooling and earnings

functions. Conventional earnings functions estimated from Census or CPS data appear to

be severely biased due to factors such as endogeneity of schooling, censoring of wages or

both. Alternatively, the conventional income maximizing model due to Becker (1964) that

motivates the literature on returns to schooling appears to be at odds with recent data.3

    Using CPS data, we also follow cohorts of individuals over time to estimate cohort

internal rates of return to high school and college in order to compare them with cross

sectional estimates. The levels and patterns for the returns to college do not always agree.

Most notably, cohort-based returns to college increase continuously over time for white men

entering the labor market between 1960 and 1985; however, cross section estimates suggest

decreasing returns throughout most of this period. Both cross section and cohort returns

for blacks suggest generally rising returns over this period, although cohort-based estimates

are typically higher by 2 to 3 percentage points. We estimate substantial returns to high

school completion for cohorts entering the labor market in the 1970’s and early 1980’s,

regardless of whether we use cohort or cross sectional methods. In light of the recent

evidence on declining U.S. high school graduation rates (Heckman and LaFontaine, 2007),

this is paradoxical. Even though returns are increasing, the relative supply is decreasing.

    This paper proceeds as follows. Section II develops a simple schooling choice model

extending the Mincer (1958) framework along the lines suggested by Rosen (1977) and

Willis (1986). We discuss the relationship between the Mincerian rate of return and true
  3
    A large literature, using better microdata, considers the endogeneity of schooling. See the surveys in
Card, 1999, and Heckman, Lochner, and Todd, 2006.

internal rates of return to schooling for general earnings functions, accounting for income

taxes, college tuition, and length of working life that may depend on schooling attainment.

Section III uses seven decades of Census data (1940-2000) to calculate cross sectional in-

ternal rates of return from nonparametric estimates of earnings functions under various

assumptions about income taxes, college tuition, and length of working life. We also ex-

plore differences between standard cross section estimates and cohort estimates using CPS

data. Section IV concludes with a discussion of the significance of these findings.



II       Internal Rates of Return

Using an income maximizing framework under perfect certainty as developed in Mincer

(1958) and extended in Rosen (1977) and Willis (1986), this section explores the relationship

between internal rates of return to schooling, interest rates, and the earnings function

in an environment with income taxes, direct schooling costs, and length of working life

that depends on schooling levels. We assume that individuals choose education levels to

maximize the present value of their lifetime earnings, taking as given post-school earnings

profiles.

       Let w(s, x) be wage income at experience level x for schooling level s; T (s), the last age

of earnings, which may depend on the schooling level; v, private tuition and non-pecuniary

costs of schooling; τ , a proportional income tax rate; and r, the before-tax interest rate.4

Individuals are assumed to choose s to maximize the present discounted value of lifetime

earnings:5
                            TZ
                             (s)−s                                         Zs
                                             −(1−τ )r(x+s)
                  V (s) =        (1 − τ )e                   w(s, x)dx −        ve−(1−τ )rz dz.         (1)

   4
      The standard framework implicitly assumes that individuals know these functional relationships, credit
markets are perfect, education does not enter preferences, and there is no uncertainty. Under perfect credit
markets, a difference between time preferences and interest rates only affects the relative importance of
non-pecuniary costs of school; otherwise, individuals maximize the present value of lifetime income (using
market interest rates to discount future earnings) and allocate consumption over time according to their
own rate of time preference.
    5
      This expression embodies an institutional feature of the U.S. economy where income from all sources
is taxed but one cannot write off tuition and non-pecuniary costs of education. However, we assume that
agents can write off interest on their loans. This assumption is consistent with the institutional feature
that persons can deduct mortgage interest, that 70% of American families own their own homes, and that
mortgage loans can be used to finance college education.

    Term 1 represents a working-life earnings effect – the change in the present value of

earnings due to a change in working-life associated with additional schooling and expressed

as a fraction of the present value of earnings measured at age s. Term 2 is the weighted

marginal effect of schooling on log earnings averaged across all experience levels. Term 3 is

the cost of tuition expressed as a fraction of lifetime income measured at age s.

    A number of commonly invoked assumptions greatly simplify the analysis of the returns

to schooling. Mincer (1958) and many other economists assume v = 0 (i.e., no private

tuition or “psychic costs”).6 It is also commonly assumed that there is no loss of work life

associated with schooling, or T 0 (s) = 1.7 This simplifies the first order condition to

Multiplicative separability between schooling and experience components of earnings (i.e.

w(s, x) = µ(s)ϕ(x)) implies that log earnings profiles are parallel in experience across

schooling levels. In this special case, the first order condition further reduces to r̃ =

µ0 (s)/µ(s). If this condition holds for all s, then wage growth must be log linear in schooling,
   6
     In light of the substantial estimates of psychic costs presented in Carneiro, Hansen, and Heckman (2003)
and Cunha, Heckman, and Navarro (2005), the assumption that v = 0 is very strong even if tuition costs
are a small component of the present value of income. This assumption is sometimes justified by claiming
that earnings in school offset tuition costs (see Becker, 1964). See the survey in Heckman, Lochner, and
Todd (2006) on the evidence against this assumption.
   7
     One could also assume T (s) → ∞ for all s.




                                                                5
µ(s) = µ(0)eρs so ln w(s, x) = ln µ0 + ρs + ln ϕ(x), where ρ must equal r̃.8,9

       The original Mincer model (1958) provides an equilibrium-based model of earnings de-

termination and an easy way to estimate the internal rate of return to schooling. Mincer

assumes that individuals have identical abilities and opportunities, credit markets are per-

fect, there are no taxes, and that the environment is perfectly certain. Occupations differ

in the amount of training required. Individuals forego earnings while in school but incur

no direct tuition costs. Firms offer wages that depend on the level of schooling and indi-

viduals choose their schooling levels to maximize lifetime earnings. Because individuals are

assumed to be identical, a compensating wage differential is needed to induce work in occu-

pations that require a longer training period. The compensating differential is determined

by equating the present value of earnings streams net of costs associated with different

levels of investment. Assuming T (s) is large, and no effect of post-school work experience

on wages (so w(s, x) = w(s)), the present value of earnings for a person with s years of

schooling is
                                                       e−rs w(s)
                                             V (s) =             .
                                                           r

Equating V (s) across all schooling levels, assuming homogeneity across people and using

wages at s = 0 as a benchmark, we obtain


                                           ln w(s) = ln w(0) + rs                                             (3)


where the coefficient on schooling is the marginal rate of return. Equation (3) is an arbitrage

condition. The first order conditions (2) do not determine a unique schooling level under

the assumptions of Mincer (1958). Because individuals are assumed to be identical and

indifferent across schooling levels, schooling is indeterminate at the individual level.

       In later work, Mincer (1974) draws on the analysis of Becker and Chiswick (1966) to

incorporate post-school work experience as a determinant of earnings and to approximate

an optimizing model of schooling choice and work experience assuming that the proportion
   8
     Log linearity and separability are distinct. For example, the earnings function w (s, x) = eρ(x)s w (0, x) is
log linear in s given x, but earnings are not necessarily multiplicatively separable in schooling and experience.
   9
     Optimality only requires that this condition hold at the optimal schooling level. If, as Mincer (1958)
assumes, all individuals are identical and face the same schooling decision, then the condition must hold
over the range of all observed schooling choices. We discuss this point further below.


                                                        6
of earnings foregone in investment declines linearly with experience.10 This framework

allows for heterogeneity among agents. Assuming that the proportion of income foregone

in post-school investments is the same at all schooling levels, the Mincer (1974) earnings

function is

                              ln w(s, x) = α0 + ρs + β0 x + β1 x2 + ε,                               (4)

where ρ is an average return to schooling across people. While ρ may vary among people,

it is assumed to be uncorrelated with s.

       Mincer’s (1958) model and its subsequent extension to accommodate heterogeneity and

post-school work experience (Mincer, 1974) provides a basis for using estimates of ρ in

equation (4) as an estimate of the internal rate of return to schooling. In the Mincer

(1958) model, the coefficient on schooling reflects the (after-tax) market interest rate that

governs schooling choices for all individuals. It is both the marginal and average return to

schooling. In Mincer (1974), the connection between the opportunity cost of funds and the

coefficient on schooling is more obscure. Being an average return, ρ is not the marginal

return appropriate to evaluating the optimality of schooling policy. It is the internal rate

of return only if the marginal return is the average return.11

       The elegance of the (1958) model and simplicity of the (1974) estimating equation are,

no doubt, responsible for the popularity of (4) as a framework for estimating rates of return

to schooling.12 Yet, many strong assumptions are required to claim that estimates of ρ in

(4) accurately measure the internal rate of return or the interest rate faced by individuals.

Notably, the model assumes: (1) no direct or psychic costs of schooling, (2) no income

taxes, (3) no loss of working life with additional years of schooling, (4) earnings functions

are multiplicatively separable in experience and schooling, and (5) marginal returns equal

average returns, which, together with multiplicative separability, implies linearity of log

earnings in schooling over the observed range of schooling choices.

       We find that these assumptions do not represent the U.S. economy very well in recent

Lochner, and Todd (2003), reject the hypothesis of parallel experience - log earnings profiles

(i.e., separability of log w(s, x) in terms of x and s) for whites for all Census years except

1940 and 1950.14 For black males, parallelism is only rejected in later years, most likely

because the samples are much smaller in the earlier years (particularly in 1940 and 1950).

Formal tests of the hypothesis that log earnings are linear in education and quadratic in

experience, against an alternative that allows the coefficient on education to differ across

schooling levels, rejects linearity for all Census years and for both blacks and whites (p-

values < .001).15 Heckman, Layne-Farrar, and Todd (1996), Jaeger and Page (1996) and

Hungerford and Solon (1987) provide additional evidence against linearity in log wages.

Murphy and Welch (1990) argue that earnings are better represented as a quartic function

of experience rather than a quadratic function.16 In addition, college tuition costs are

nontrivial and are not offset by work in school for most college students. See Table 1

of this paper for evidence on tuition costs. Carneiro, Hansen, and Heckman (2003) and

Cunha, Heckman, and Navarro (2005) report estimates of substantial non-pecuniary costs

of schooling, far greater than tuition costs. See the survey in Heckman, Lochner, and Todd

(2006).

       Rejection of these assumptions implies that the Mincer coefficient (ρ) will not, in general,

equal the internal rate of return to schooling or real after-tax interest rates (r̃) as shown in
  13
      Earnings correspond to annual earnings, which includes both wage and salary income and business
income. Business income is not available in the 1940 Census. Appendix A provides detailed information
on the construction of our data subsamples and variables. Nonparametric local linear regression is used to
generate the estimates, with a bandwidth of 5 years and quartic kernel. Estimates are not very sensitive to
changes in the bandwidth parameter in the range of 3-10 years.

     It is also rejected for nonparametric specifications of the experience term. These results are available
on request from the authors and are reported in Heckman, Lochner, and Todd (2003, 2006).
  16
     However, Heckman, Lochner, and Todd (2003, 2006) show that allowing for quartic experience vs.
quadratic experience has negligible effects on estimated rates of return. We present additional evidence on
this question below.

equation (2). If working lives are decreasing in schooling and if tuition and psychic costs are

non-negligible, the Mincer coefficient will tend to be larger than the internal rate of return

or the real interest rate (see Terms 1 and 3 in equation 2). Term 2 shows how deviations

from log-linearity in schooling and separability between schooling and experience may also

create a wedge between estimates of ρ and r̃.

       In the general case, r̃ is the marginal internal rate of return to schooling. It is the

discount rate that, at an optimum, equates the net lifetime earnings for persons at the

margin at all schooling levels. For people at various margins, this internal rate of return

equals the after-tax interest rate in a world with perfect credit markets, once all costs and

benefits from schooling are considered. Assuming income maximizing behavior, estimates

of the true internal rate of return (not necessarily ρ in equation 4) can be used to determine

effective interest rates faced by students. Alternatively, if interest rates are known, they

may be used to judge the optimality of investment decisions.



III        Estimating Internal Rates of Return for the U.S.

We next explore how allowing for taxes, tuition, variable length of working life, and a flexible

relationship between earnings, schooling and experience affects estimated internal rates of

return. It is possible to calculate the internal rate of return more generally by solving for the

discount rate that equates lifetime earnings streams for two different schooling levels where

the earnings-schooling-experience relationships are estimated flexibly using nonparametric

methods.17 Incorporating tuition and taxes, the internal rate of return for schooling level

s1 versus s2 , rI (s1 , s2 ), solves

                        T (sZ1 )−s1                                         Zs1

                                                      −rI (x+s2 )
                          =               (1 − τ )e                 w(s2 , x)dx −          ve−rI z dz,   (5)

where we keep the (s1 , s2 ) implicit in the rI used in this expression and in our discussion.18

As with r̃ above, rI will equal the Mincer coefficient on schooling under the five assumptions

described earlier. Notice that when tuition costs are negligible, proportional taxes on labor

earnings have no effect on estimated internal rates of return, since they reduce earnings by

the same proportion regardless of educational choices.


Using Census Data to Estimate Cross Section Internal Rates of Return

Using data for U.S. born men from 1940-2000 decennial Censuses, we examine how estimates

of the internal rate of return change when different assumptions are relaxed. Tables 2a and

2b report internal rates of return to schooling for each Census year and for a variety of

pairwise schooling level comparisons separately for white and black men.19 (We only report

estimates for 1960-2000 for black men due to the smaller available sample sizes for earnings

in the public use Census data for 1940 and 1950.)20 The estimates in this table assume

that workers spend 47 years working irrespective of their educational choice (i.e. a high

school graduate works until age 65 and a college graduate until 69). We initially relax only

the assumptions about the functional form of the earnings equation and ignore taxes and

tuition. To calculate each of the IRR estimates, we first estimate a log wage equation under

the assumptions indicated in the tables. We then predict earnings under this specification

for the first 47 years of experience. The estimated IRR is the root of equation (5).21 As a

benchmark, the first row for each year reports the IRR estimate obtained from the Mincer

specification for log wages (equation (4)). The IRR could equivalently be obtained from a
  18
     We assume the absence of measured non-pecuniary costs and benefits associated with schooling. See
Carneiro, Hansen, and Heckman (2003), Cunha, Heckman, and Navarro (2005) and Heckman, Lochner, and
Todd (2006) for estimates of non-pecuniary costs.
  19
     As lower schooling levels are reported only in broader intervals in the 1990 and 2000 Censuses, we can
only compare 6 years against 10 years and cannot compare 6 years against 8 years or 8 against 10 years as
we do for the earlier Census years. We assume the private cost to elementary and high school is zero in all
the calculations.
  20
     Estimates for black men in these years are reported in Heckman, Lochner, and Todd (2003, 2006), but
they are quite noisy for most schooling comparisons. Standard errors computed by bootstrapping are often
above 4 percentage points for any IRR estimates that relax linearity in schooling prior to 1960 for blacks. In
contrast, standard errors for estimates in other years are generally less than 2 percentage points for blacks
and less than 1 percentage point for whites in all years.
  21
     Strictly speaking, we solve for the root of the discrete time analog of equation (5). Appendix B provides
a more detailed explanation of our IRR estimation procedure.




                                                     10
Mincer regression coefficient.22

       Relative to the Mincer specification, row 2 relaxes the assumption of linearity in school-

ing by including dummy variables for the categories of schooling shown in the table. This

modification leads to substantial differences in the estimated rate of return to schooling,

especially for schooling levels associated with degree completion years (12 and 16) which

now show much larger returns than for other schooling transitions. For example, the IRR

to finishing high school is 30% for white men in 1970, while the rate of return to finishing

10 rather than 8 years of school is only 3%. In general, imposing linearity in schooling leads

to upward biased estimates of the rate of return to grades that do not produce a degree,

while it leads to downward biased estimates of the degree completion years (high school

or college). Sheepskin effects, which are jumps in earnings observed upon completion of a

degree, are an important feature of the data.23 Row 3 relaxes both linearity in schooling

and the quadratic specification for experience (i.e., we include dummy variables for school-

ing categories and assume a common nonparametric experience profile), which produces

similar estimates. The assumption that earnings are quadratic in experience is empirically

innocuous for estimating returns to schooling once linearity in years of schooling is relaxed.

       Row 4 fully relaxes all three Mincer assumptions, including parallelism in experience of

log wage equations for different educational levels. Earnings functions are nonparametri-

cally estimated as a function of experience, separately within each schooling class.24 This

procedure does not impose any assumption other than continuity on the functional form

of the earnings – experience relationship. Comparing these results with those of row three

provides a measure of the bias induced by assuming separability of earnings in schooling

and experience. In many cases, especially for the estimates for recent decades, there are
  22
     They would be identical if our internal rate of return calculations were computed in continuous time.
Because we use discrete time to calculate internal rates of return, rI = eρ − 1, which is approximately equal
to ρ when it is small. Empirically, the differences between the Mincer coefficient and the Mincer return we
compute are slight.
  23
     We use the term “sheepskin effects” to refer to exceptionally large rates of return at degree certifying
years of schooling. We cannot, however, distinguish in the Census data which individuals receive a diploma
among individuals reporting 12 or 16 years of completed schooling except in a few years where 12th grade
with and without a diploma are reported as separate categories. See Heckman, Layne-Farrar, and Todd
(1996), Jaeger and Page (1996) and Hungerford and Solon (1987) for additional evidence on sheepskin effects
in log wage equations.
  24
     See footnote 13 for a description of the log earnings estimates and Figures 1a-1b for a graphical repre-
sentation.

large differences. The functional form assumptions implied by Mincer-based estimation of

the internal rate of return lead to quantitatively important biases — biases much larger

than those commonly discussed as attributable to selection or ability bias (e.g., Card, 1999).

    For most grade comparisons and years, the Mincer coefficient implies a lower return to

schooling than do the fully nonparametric estimates, with an especially large disparity for

the return to high school completion. The nonparametric estimates in Table 2a show a large

increase in the return to completing high school for whites, which grew from 24% in 1940 to

52% in 2000. Much of this increase occurred between 1970 and 1990 when the IRR for high

school completion rose 17 percentage points. Blacks experienced a comparable increase in

returns to high school (14 percentage points) over the 1970-90 period, an increase that was

already underway in the 1960s (see Table 2b). For both blacks and whites, there has been

little change in the return to high school since 1990.

    The nonparametrically estimated returns to college completion (14 vs. 16 years of school)

are also substantially higher than the returns estimated by the Mincer model. Returns to

college rose considerably in the 1980s for blacks from 23% to 31%. Returns to college

completion for white men fell slightly in the 1940s, rose in the 1950s, fell again in the 1970s,

and then rose in the 1980s and 1990s. During the period of rising wage returns to college

from 1980-2000 (see, e.g., Katz and Autor, 1999), white men experienced an 8 percentage

point rise in the internal rate of return to college completion while there was no noticeable

change in this return for black men. The Mincer coefficient more closely reflects the return

to completing college relative to high school (comparing 12 vs. 16 years of school). In most

decades, the Mincer and nonparametric estimates are within 5 percentage points of each

other. However, differences of this magnitude are considered quite large in recent debates

about “the return” to schooling. For both white and black men, the time trends for this

measure of college returns are similar to the trends in the return to college completion. It is

interesting that the recent literature has focused so heavily on documenting and explaining

the rising returns to college, when the return to high school completion appears to have

risen even more substantially.25
  25
     Of course, the full return to high school includes the option value of being able to go to college. Option
values are ignored in computing the internal rate of return. Accounting for this option only raises the return
to graduating high school. See Heckman and Urzua (2008) for estimates of the option value of schooling.


                                                      12
       Comparing the nonparametric IRR estimates for black and white males since 1960, the

return to high school completion has been 3-11 percentage points higher for black males.

The internal rate of return to completing college (14 vs. 16 years) was quite similar for black

and white men in 1960 and 1970, but then it jumped noticeably for blacks with little change

for whites. In 1980 and 1990, the return to college completion was roughly 10 percentage

points higher for blacks than whites. This gap disappeared in the 1990s. The return was

only 2 percentage points higher for blacks than whites in 2000.

       Estimated internal rates of return are sensitive to the assumptions imposed on the

earnings model. While the assumption that log earnings profiles are quadratic in experience

is fairly innocuous, the assumptions of linearity in schooling and separability in schooling

and experience are not. Comparing the unrestricted estimates in row 4 with the Mincer

estimates in row 1 reveals substantial differences for nearly all grade progressions across

most years.

       Table 3 examines how the IRR estimates for post-secondary education change when

we account for income taxes (both flat and progressive) and college tuition.26 For ease of

comparison, the first row for each year reports estimates of the IRR for the most flexible

earnings specification, not accounting for tuition and taxes. (These estimates are identical

to the fourth row in Tables 2a and 2b.) All other rows account for private tuition costs

for college (v), assumed equal to the average college tuition paid in the U.S. that year.27

The average real college tuition paid by students increased steadily since 1950 as shown in

Table 1. In 1990, it stood at roughly $3,500 (in 2000 dollars). Row three accounts for flat

wage taxes using the estimated average marginal tax rates (τ ) reported in Table 1. Average

marginal tax rates increased from a low of 5.6% in 1940 to a high of 30.4% in 1980 before

falling to 23.3% in 1990. The final row accounts for the progressive nature of our tax system

using federal income tax schedules (Form 1040) for single adults with no dependents and
  26
     Because we assume that schooling is free (direct schooling costs are zero) through high school and because
internal rates of return are independent of flat taxes when direct costs of schooling are zero, internal rates
of return to primary and secondary school are identical across the first three specifications in the table.
Empirically, taking into account progressive tax rates has little impact on the estimates for these school
completion levels. (Estimates are available upon request.) For these reasons, we only report in Table 3 the
IRR estimates for comparisons of school completion levels 12 and 14, 12 and 16, and 14 and 16.
  27
     We use contemporaneous college tuition costs, since cross section estimates are typically assumed to
reflect the rate of return governing the behavior of cohorts making their schooling decisions that year. We
discuss the comparability of cross section and cohort estimates below using CPS data.


                                                      13
no unearned income. See Appendix A for details on the sources and time series we use for

computing tuition and taxes.

       When tuition costs of schooling are taken into account (comparing row 2 with row 1),

the return to college generally falls by a few percentage points. Because the earnings of

blacks are typically lower than for whites but tuition payments are assumed to be the

same, accounting for tuition costs has a bigger effect on the IRR estimates for blacks. For

example, internal rates of return to the final two years of college decline by about one-fourth

for whites and one-third for blacks. Further accounting for effects of taxes on earnings (rows

3 and 4) has little additional impact on the estimates.

       As seen in equation (2), flat taxes simply multiply the effects of tuition on the IRR by the
           1
factor    1−τ .   Progressive taxes reduce IRR estimates, because they disproportionally offset

some of the increase in earnings associated with higher levels of schooling. Interestingly,

the progressive nature of the tax system typically reduces rates of return by less than a

percentage point compared to estimates accounting for average marginal tax rates. The U.S.

tax system is not that progressive over the relevant range of earnings determining schooling

decisions. Overall, failure to account for tuition and taxes leads to an overstatement of

the return to college, without affecting the estimated trends over time. However, even

after accounting for taxes and tuition, nonparametric estimates of the return to college

completion are generally 5-10% higher than the corresponding Mincer-based estimates.

       Using the flexible earnings specification, we also examine how estimates depend on

assumptions about the length of working life, comparing two extreme cases. The estimates

reported here assume that individuals work for 47 years regardless of their schooling (i.e.

T 0 (s) = 1). An alternative assumption posits that workers retire at age 65 regardless of

their education (i.e. T 0 (s) = 0). We find virtually identical results for all years and schooling

comparisons for both assumptions about the schooling - work-life relationship.28 Because

earnings at the end of the life cycle are heavily discounted, they have little impact on the

total value of lifetime earnings and, therefore, have little effect on estimated internal rates

of return.

Comparing Cross Section and Cohort IRR Estimates Using CPS Data

Previous studies reveal that wage patterns have changed dramatically across cohorts and

that cross sections no longer approximate cohort or life cycle change (MaCurdy and Mroz,

1995, and Card and Lemieux, 2001). As a result, the rates of return to schooling estimated

from cross sections of workers are likely to differ from the rates of return faced by cohorts

making their schooling decisions, potentially rendering invalid the synthetic cohort approach

that uses a cross section to approximate the life cycle of a representative individual.29 We

examine these differences and determine whether the differences help explain why returns

to high school completion estimated for recent years appear to be out of line with plausible

values of real interest rates.

       We use repeated cross section data from the 1964-2006 CPS March Supplements, com-

paring cross section estimates of the return to schooling with estimates that combine all

years of the CPS to follow cohorts over their life cycles. Based on our Census results, we

estimate a flexible earnings specification that does not impose assumptions of log-linearity

or parallelism and compute internal rates of return to high school completion (10 vs. 12

years of schooling) and four years of college (12 vs. 16 years of schooling). Our estimates

take into account average marginal tax rates and tuition costs using the time series data

discussed in Appendix A. Table 1 reports tuition and average marginal tax rates every

ten years from 1940-2000. Because earnings are not observed at every experience level for

any cohort in the sample, we require a method for extrapolating the earnings function to

work experience levels not observed in the data.30 We assume that log earnings profiles are

quadratic in experience for each education classification in a specification that allows the

intercept and coefficients on experience and experience-squared to vary by schooling class

and year or cohort of data. We estimate log earnings for each year or for each cohort using

regressions of the form


                               log(w(s, x)) = αs + β0s x + β1s x2 + εs ,
  29
     Mincer (1974) addressed this issue for earlier, more stable periods (1950 and 1960) and found that the
cross section and cohort rates agreed.
  30
     The earliest cohort we analyze turned age 18 in 1950 — we observe their earnings from age 32 through
retirement. The latest cohort we study turned age 18 in 1985 — we follow them from ages 18-39.



                                                    15
where the regression coefficients are allowed to vary by schooling group.31 Two sets of

estimates are generated: (i) regressions are estimated separately for each year of CPS data

to produce a set of cross section estimates, and (ii) all CPS cross sections are combined and

separate regressions are estimated for each cohort by following them over their life cycles

to produce a set of cohort-based estimates. Both sets of estimates are used to generate

predicted life cycle earnings profiles for each cohort or cross section of individuals, which

are then used to compute internal rates of return to high school and college by the method

described in the previous section.32

       Figures 2 and 3 show cohort and cross section estimates of IRR for high school and

college completion for white men. Cross section estimates are shown for each year of the

sample from 1964-2000, and cohort estimates are shown for cohorts turning age 18 in 1950

through 1985.33 Cohort and cross section estimated rates of return for high school comple-

tion (Figure 2) are fairly similar over most years of overlap, although cohort estimates are

typically a few percentage points higher. Cohort bias does not explain the high estimated

cross sectional internal rate of return to schooling. Cohort-based returns rose dramatically

from around 10% for 1950-60 cohorts to around 40% for post-1965 cohorts. A second appar-

ent jump in returns occurs near the end of our sample for cohorts entering the labor market

in the early 1980’s. Cross-section based estimates increase more slowly and consistently

over most of the 1964-1995 period, although there also appears to be a noticeable jump in

the early 1980s.

       More noticeable differences between cohort and cross section estimates are seen in the

college-going decisions of white men (Figure 3). While cross section estimates show declining

returns to college over the 1970’s (from 12% down to 8%), cohort-based estimates show

continually increasing returns from the early 1960’s to the early 1980’s. The rate of return

estimated from cross sections of individuals does not begin to increase until 1980. There is
  31
     In estimating earnings profiles for those with 10 years of education, we combine individuals with 9-11
years, with separate intercept terms for each of the education levels. This is done to increase precision in
estimation. See Appendix A for additional details on the coding of the education variables.
  32
     We also tried using a cubic and quartic function in experience to extrapolate for the missing experience
levels. For cohorts with 25 or fewer years of data, extrapolations based on higher order polynomial specifi-
cations were unreliable, so we adopted the more parsimonious quadratic specification. Recall that for the
cross section estimates, we find that both quadratics and quartics produce the same rates of return.
  33
     We do not estimate returns for cohorts beyond 1985, since there are too few years of earnings observations
for those cohorts to produce stable and reliable estimates.

severe cross section bias in estimating the internal rate of return to college for white men.34

       Figures 4 and 5 report cohort and cross section returns to high school and college for

black men. To increase sample sizes and reduce variability of our estimates, we group

cohorts and cross sections into three-year periods. However, the estimates are still fairly

noisy as can be seen in the Figures. The estimates suggest generally rising returns to high

school and college throughout most of our sample period. While cross section estimates are

typically lower than cohort estimates, the time trends are fairly similar.

       In addition to the CPS cohort and cross section estimates, Figures 2-5 plot Mincer and

nonparametric cross section estimates (accounting for tuition and average marginal tax

rates) using Census data (reported in Tables 2 and 3). The nonparametric Census and the

CPS cross section estimates are in remarkable agreement. The Mincer estimates are less

successful overall. While they do a reasonably good job of reproducing the more general

cross section estimates of the return to college compared to high school, they substantially

underestimate the cross section and cohort returns to high school completion. Furthermore,

the cross section returns to college do not accurately reflect the cohort estimates for white

men.



IV        Summary and Conclusions

The internal rate of return to schooling is an economic parameter introduced into the human

capital literature by Becker (1964). It is used to assess whether educational expenditure

should be expanded or contracted. This paper considers alternative approaches for esti-

mating the marginal internal rate of return to schooling across different schooling levels,

including the widely used Mincer model of earnings. We present conditions under which

the Mincer model produces true internal rates of return, but report substantial empirical

evidence against the validity of those conditions. Our evidence on the empirical relevance
  34
     The pattern for college vs. high school rates of return is relatively easy to rationalize given the well-
documented fall and subsequent rise in relative wages for college workers relative to high school workers (see,
e.g., Katz and Autor, 1999). The pattern for high school graduates vs. dropouts is less easily understood
given the magnitude of the recent IRR estimates. Heckman (2005) shows that this pattern does not result
from a steady state growth phenomenon. A secular growth in wages for all workers will imply slightly higher
cohort IRR estimates relative to cross section estimates (though similar time trends), since acquiring more
schooling also implies later entrance into the labor market. Cross section estimates do not capture the
growth in earnings associated with later market entry.

of sheepskin effects and on nonlinearities and nonseparabilities in the earnings-education-

experience relationship is generally consistent with findings reported in the empirical liter-

ature.

       We use nonparametrically estimated earnings functions to generate marginal internal

rates of return and examine the importance of accounting for taxes and tuition. The levels

and time series patterns of marginal internal rates of return differ dramatically from those

produced by a Mincer model. Deviations from parallelism and linearity in log earnings

— key assumptions of the Mincer approach — are quantitatively important for estimating

internal rates of return, as are the effects of taxes and tuition. Economists cannot continue

to pretend that violations of the required assumptions are innocuous when using Mincer

regressions to estimate ‘returns to schooling’.

dation for most analyses of returns to schooling suggests that marginal internal rates of

return should be the same across observed schooling choices and should equal the common

real interest rate faced by students. Yet, our estimates of the return to high school and

college completion for recent years are substantially larger than real interest rates typically

observed. One possible explanation of this evidence is the failure of the income maximizing

concept as it applies to schooling decisions. Psychic costs or distaste for schooling may

explain why more than fifteen percent of new cohorts of American youth do not receive

a high school degree despite its high estimated monetary return. Estimates reported in

Carneiro, Hansen, and Heckman (2003), Cunha, Heckman, and Navarro (2005) and Heck-

man, Lochner, and Todd (2006) show high psychic cost components. Some have argued that

credit constraints may be important for college-going decisions. However, recent research

suggests that this is not the case for most students.35

       In a dynamic setting, uncertainty about future earnings and schooling outcomes may

create a wedge between ex post average rates of return and real interest rates due to

the option value of continuing on in school and updating of information.36 For example,
  35
     See Carneiro and Heckman (2002), and the evidence in Heckman, Lochner, and Todd (2006). Belley
and Lochner (2007) suggest that credit constraints may have become more important recently.
  36
     See the examples in Heckman, Lochner, and Todd (2006) and the empirical estimates in Heckman and
Urzua (2008).

some individuals may attend college, knowing that the expected return to attending only

a few years are low but that the expected return from finishing is quite high. Even if

college graduation is not certain, many individuals may be willing to take the gamble of

attending with the hope that they will finish successfully. Our estimated low returns to

college attendance and high returns to completion are consistent with this story.37 The

distinction between ex ante and ex post returns to schooling is ignored in most of the

empirical literature on returns to schooling. Ex ante marginal returns govern schooling

choices but ex post returns are typically estimated. Cunha, Heckman, and Navarro (2005)

and Cunha and Heckman (2007) show the empirical importance of distinguishing ex ante

from ex post returns to schooling.38 If agents are risk averse, this helps to explain high

estimated returns to schooling. In addition, time inconsistent preferences and/or heavy

discounting of future utility in combination with credit market constraints at the time of

making schooling decisions offer possible alternative explanations for why individuals may

drop out before completing a high school degree despite a high internal rate of return.39

       A common criticism directed against the Mincer approach that also applies to the

analysis in this paper is that schooling is endogenous.40 Unfortunately, the current empirical

debate on the importance of accounting for the endogeneity of schooling is far from settled.

The validity of the instruments used in this literature have been challenged (see Carneiro

and Heckman, 2002, and the review in Heckman, Lochner, and Todd, 2006), and many

estimates make assumptions about the earnings function (e.g., log-linearity in schooling

and parallelism in experience) that are invalid. It remains to be established whether the

substantial increase in the returns to high school in recent decades estimated using the

standard approach can be explained by changes in ability differences between high school

dropouts and graduates. The evidence on the increasing schooling attainment levels of

high school dropouts presented in Heckman and LaFontaine (2006) suggests otherwise.41
  37
     Heckman and Urzua (2008) report substantial estimates of option values.
  38
     See surveys of the evidence in Heckman, Lochner, and Todd (2006) and Abbring and Heckman (2007).
  39
     See, e.g., Oreopoulos (2007).
  40
     See, e.g., Card (1995, 1999); Carneiro, Hansen, and Heckman (2001); Carneiro, Heckman, and Vytlacil
(2006); Griliches (1977); Heckman and Vytlacil (1998); Willis (1986); Willis and Rosen (1979); and Heckman,
Lochner, and Todd (2006).
  41
     This assumes that schooling attainment at the time of dropout is a measure of ability which may not
be true if social promotion has been increasing.



                                                    19
In addition, the growth in high school dropout rates since 1970, documented in Heckman

and LaFontaine (2007), and the continued increase in rates of return to high school (as

measured by cross section or cohort estimates) since that time poses a serious challenge to

explanations based on this premise.

      The Census and CPS data are the foundation for the widely publicized evidence on

the changing structure of wages and returns to schooling (see e.g., Katz and Murphy, 1992;

Murphy and Welch, 1990, 1992; and Katz and Autor, 1999). Our estimated ex post internal

rates of return are implicit in the earnings regression coefficient estimates reported in an

entire recent literature. We take the earnings patterns analyzed in this literature and show

the implied internal rates of return after accounting for taxes and tuition. To the extent

that some of our estimates raise suspicion, they should also raise questions about a large

literature on the changing wage structure. While widely used Census and CPS data have

large samples, they lack good instruments. Following the tradition of the entire influential

CPS-Census based literature on returns to schooling that defines the “facts” about rising

returns to schooling, we have ignored censoring, ability bias and endogeneity of schooling.

Determining the contribution of these factors to estimated rates of return is an important

task requiring richer data than are available in the Census or CPS.

      Most of the recent literature has focused on the rising returns to college. Our estimates

suggest an even greater increase in the returns to high school, raising the obvious question:

why do so many individuals continue to drop out of high school? The answer may rely

on high ‘psychic’ costs of school, credit constraints, or unobserved differences in ability

between dropouts and graduates, but the literature has yet to convincingly sort out these

competing explanations. This is an important task which can only be done using richer

microdata.42

Appendix A: Data description

Census Data

The Census samples used in this paper are taken from the 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980,

1990, and 2000 Public-Use Census Samples. The 1940 sample consists of the self-weighting

subsample which represents 1% of the population. The 1950 sample consists of sample-line

persons (for whom questions regarding earnings were asked) which represent about 0.303%

of the population. The 1960 sample is a self-weighting 1% sample. The 1970 sample is

taken from two Public-Use A samples: the 1% State sample (5% form) and the 1% State

sample (15% form). It is a self-weighting sample of 2% of the population. The 1980 and

1990 Census samples are both 5% Public Use A samples. The 1980 sample is self-weighting

but the 1990 and 2000 samples are not. For 1990 and 2000, we use person weights to

re-weight the samples back to random proportions.

   The following sample restrictions are imposed for each Census year:

age: Sample includes individuals age 16-75. For Census years when a quarter-of-birth

variable is available, we take into account the quarter of birth in calculating the age of each

individual from the year of birth variable provided in the data set.

race: Only individuals reported as black or white are included in the analysis.

country of birth/residence: Only individuals born and residing in the U.S. are included in

the analysis.

earnings: The earnings measure used is annual earnings, which includes both wage and

salary and business income for the Census years when business income is available. For

Census years when earnings are reported in intervals, we use the midpoint of the interval.

Because we estimate models of log earnings, all men with zero earnings are dropped.

imputations: Individuals with imputed information on age, race, sex, education, weeks

worked or income are excluded. For years when all the imputation flags are not provided,

we omit individuals on the basis of the available imputation flags.

   The following variables are constructed:


                                              21
experience: Potential experience is measured by Age - Years of Education - 6.

years of education: For the 1940-1980 Censuses, years of education is reported as the

highest grade completed. For the 1990 and 2000 Censuses, years of education is reported

by categories for first through fourth grade and for fifth through eighth grade, by year for

ninth through 12th grade, and then by degree attained. We impute the number of years of

school associated with each category or degree. For those with some college but no degree or

for those with an associate degree, we assign 14 years of school. For those with a bachelor’s

degree, we assign 16 years of school. For professional degrees we assign 17 years and for

masters degrees and beyond, including doctoral degrees, we assign 18 years of school.


Current Population Survey (CPS) Data

The CPS samples used in this paper are taken from the 1964-2006 CPS March Supplements.

   The following sample restrictions are used for each year:

age: Sample includes individuals age 18-65.

race: Sample separated into whites and all non-whites.

earnings: Annual wage and salary income (deflated using the CPI-U) is used as the earnings

measure in each year.

   The following variables are constructed for our analysis:

experience: Potential experience is measured by Age - Years of Education - 6.

years of education: For 1964-1991, years of education is reported as the highest grade

completed. Categories of schooling include 9-11 years, 12 years, and 16 years. From 1992-

2006, years of education is reported differently. Those completing 12 years of schooling but

who do not receive a high school diploma are assigned 11 years. Only those with 12 years

of schooling and a diploma are assigned 12 years of schooling. For those with a bachelor’s

degree, we assign 16 years of school.




                                              22
Tuition Time Series

For all higher education institutions in the U.S., we divide total revenue from tuition and

fees by total enrollment to obtain estimates of the private tuition cost of college from 1940-

2000. Total enrollment is taken from Snyder (1993, Table 24) and Table 171 of the Digest

of Education Statistics 2005. Tuition and fees up to 1995 are taken from Snyder (1993,

Table 33) and Table 328 in the Digest of Education Statistics 2005. Tuition and fees from

1996-2000 sum tuition and fees across institution types (public, private non-profit, private

for-profit) from various tables and years of the Digest of Education Statistics. (Tuition and

fees for private for-profit institutions in 1996-97 is not reported, so we use the average of

1995-96 and 1996-97 values.)


Tax Rate Time Series

We obtain the average marginal federal tax rate time series for 1940-1995 from Barro and

Sahasakul (1983) and Mulligan and Marion (2001, Table 1, column 1). Average marginal

federal tax rates for 1996-2005 are from calculations by Feenberg using TAXSIM and are

reported at http://www.nber.org/taxsim; tax rates beyond 2005 are assumed to equal

that of 2005.

   The tax rates used in our progressive tax analysis are obtained from the federal schedule

for a single adult with no dependents. All income is assumed to be earned income, and

standard deductions are assumed. To obtain after-tax income for 1960-2000, we use the

TAXSIM program available at http://www.nber.org/taxsim. (See Feenberg and Coutts,

1993, for details of the TAXSIM model.) For 1940 and 1950, we use the actual federal tax

schedules (Form 1040) as reported in the Statistics of Income.



Appendix B: Information on Method for Calculating IRR

This appendix outlines the procedure used to estimate IRRs in this paper.


Step 1: Estimate log earnings functions using local linear regression

   In estimating the nonparametric matching regressions, we use local linear regression


                                             23
methods. Let yi = ln w(si , xi ) denote log earnings, which depends on schooling level si

and experience xi . As discussed in Fan and Gijbels (1996), the local linear estimator for

the conditional expectation E [ yi | si = s0 , xi = x0 ] can be computed from the minimization

problem
                              n
                              X                                  µ             ¶
                                                             2       xi − x0
                        min         (yi − a − b1 (xi − x0 )) K                     1(si = s0 )
                        a,b                                             hn
                              i=1

where K(·) is a kernel function and hn > 0 is a bandwidth which converges to zero

as n → ∞.43 The indicator 1(si = s0 ) denotes that only observations with schooling

level equal to s0 are used in the computation. The estimator of the conditional mean

E [ yi | si = s0 , xi = x0 ] is b
                                a.
                              The local linear estimator can be expressed as a weighted
                                                        Pns
average of the yi observations with schooling level s0 , i=10 yi Wi (x0 ), where the weights

are                                                 Pns0              Pns0
                                               Ki        2
                                                   j=1 Kj − Ki         k=1 Kk
                               Wi (x0 ) =   Pns0    Pns0 2             Pns0
                                             k=1 Kk    j=1 Kj −       ( k=1 Kk )2

and ns0 are the number of observations with schooling level s0 .

       Nonparametric regression can be computationally burdensome when there are large

numbers of observations. To facilitate the computation, we take advantage of the fact that

we have many earnings observations at each value of experience, xi . Our local regression

estimator for E [ yi | si = s0 , xi = x0 ] is given by

                                         PNx
                                           i=1 nxi ȳi Wi (x0 )1(si = s0 )
                                          P Nx
                                                                           ,
                                            i nxi Wi (x0 )1(si = s0 )


where ȳ represents average earnings at experience level xi , nxi represents the number of

observations at that experience level, and NX represents the number of distinct values of

potential experience.44 Note that this expression is equivalent to estimating the nonparam-
  43
       The kernel function we use in the empirical work is the quartic kernel, given by
                                           ½
                                              (15/16)(s2 − 1)2 if |s| < 1
                                   K(s) =
                                              0                  otherwise.

The bandwidth used is equal to 5.
  44
     For some of the Census years, there is an additional problem of non-random sampling with sampling
weights provided in the data. The sampling weights are taken into account when calculating the mean
log earnings at each experience level by introducing additional weights. That is, the effective number of
observations at each experience level depend on the sampling weights, normalized so that the weights sum
to the total number of observations in the sample.

eteric earnings-experience relationship separately for each education level. The bandwidth

choice was set equal to 5 years of experience for all census years.

Step 2: Generate predicted earnings profiles

   In this step, we compute ŵ(s, x) = exp ln[w(s,

rience levels, where ln[w(s,

earnings are obtained directly from the earnings regression coefficients.

Step 3: Solve for IRR accounting for taxes and tuition

       We use the predicted earnings profiles for two potential schooling levels s1 and s2 > s1

computed in Step 2 along with estimated college tuition, v, and taxes, τ (w(s, x)), to solve

for the internal rate of return, rI (s1 , s2 ), in the following equation:

       47
       X                                                             sX
                                                                      1 −12
                   −(x+s1 )
          (1 + rI )         [w(s1 , x) − τ (w(s1 , x))] − 1(s1 > 12)       (1 + rI )−(z+12) v
       x=1                                                             z=1
             47
             X                                                                  sX
                                                                                 2 −12

         =         (1 + rI )−(x+s2 ) [w(s2 , x) − τ (w(s2 , x))] − 1(s2 > 12)            (1 + rI )−(z+12) v.
             x=1                                                                 z=1


The indicator function, 1(·), equals one if the argument is true and zero otherwise. This

equation assumes earnings (and taxes) are zero while in school and discounts earnings net

of taxes and college tuition back to the age of school entry. Taxes either equal the average

marginal tax rate times earnings that period or are derived from actual tax schedules based

on earnings that period. Schooling costs are assumed to equal zero for grades 1-12 and to

equal the average college tuition level that year for all grades higher than 12. See Appendix

A for further details on the data we use on tuition costs and taxes.
  45
     See Heckman, Lochner, and Todd (2003, 2006) for additional adjustments used to account for differences
in residual variance across schooling groups.
