                    Stock: An Asset Price pproach



                               ABSTRACT




       This   paper develops an asset price approach to the analysis
of capital taxation. The costs of adjusting capital stocks cause
tax changes to have important impacts on the valuation of existing

capital. The recapitalizations associated with tax reforms
represent an important aspect of their incidence. These effects
are studied within the context of an empirically calibrated

general equilibrium model. The model extends previous work by

explicitly treating the process of adjustment following tax re-
forms, treating in detail the relationship between tax rules and
interest rates and examining the differential incidence effects
of corporate tax reductions and investment incentives.

        The importance of taxation in determining the size and corn-

position of the nation's capital stock is by now widely recog-

nized. Taxes affect both individuals' incentivto save, and
the    allocation of savings among alternative forms of investment.
These effects have been extensively studied within the context

of general equilibrium models of the type developed by Harberger
(1962), and elaborated in the work of Shoven and others.'
       These models have been used to estimate the welfare loss
which arises from tax wedges which causes the pre-tax marginal

product of capital in different sectors to diverge, and to analyze
the    long run effects   of tax reforms on real wages and rates of
return.     However, general equilibrium models are not well suited
to    analyzing the short and intermediate run response of the econ—
ouiy to changes in tax policy. They assume that there are no
costs of adjustment impeding the accumulation or reallocation of
capital. As a consequence, sectoral marginal products of capital
are always equated. This means that there is essentially rio
scope for variation in the asset price of existing capital goods.
Studies of tax incidence within this framework focus on the

effects of tax changes on the after tax rate of return, because

the constancy of the relative price of capital goods precludes

any wealth   effects.
       The implausibility of these assumptions may be seen by noting



1) These studies include Shoven (1976), Fullerton, King, Shoven
    and Whalley (1980), and Fullerton and Gordon (1981).    For a
    summary of the now large literature on general equilibrium modelling,

that they imply that corporate shareowners would not gain
relative to homeowners from increases in the tax burdens on resi-

dential capital and reductions in the tax burdens on corporate

capital. More generally, standard general equilibrium models
have the counterfactual implication that all owners of capital
should have the same preferences about tax policy, since all capi-

tal will be equally affected. Capitalists would. have no reason
to systematically oppose taxes on their own industry. This is

because the standard approach to tax incidence ignores an important
aspect of the actual economy's response to such a tax change.
Return to the example of a reduction in corporate taxes. In the

short run, the price of existing corporate capital would rise, and
of existing homes would fall, as investors reallocated their port-

folios. The price changes would capitalize the expected present
value of the effects of the tax reform on future returns, confer-
ritg windfall gains on the owners of corporate capital, and losses
on homeowners. These price changes would act as signals to the
suppliers of new capital, calling forth more plant and equipment
and fewer homes, until their relative prices were again equated

to their relative long run marginal costs of production.
     The extreme volatility of asset prices in the American economy

suggests that these "capitalization" effects are of substantial

importance. The ratio of the market value of corporate capital
to its replacement cost has varied by a factor of more than two
over the last 15 years. The relative price of the stock of owner

occupied housing has increased very substantially. Bulow and
Summers (1984) point to evidence of substantial volatility in the
                               —3-.




prices of specific used capital goods. Even more extreme vola—
tility has been observed in the relative price of non-reproducible
assets such as land, gold, and Rembrandts. Such relative price

changes represent important transfers of wealth, and must be
considered if the incidence of tax changes is to be accurately
assessed.

     A second type of example suggests the importance of focusing
on asset prices in examining tax incidence. Investment can be
stimulated by reducing the corporate tax rate or by the use of
incentives for new investment such as the investment tax credit

or accelerated depreciation. In the long run, these two types
may be designed to have very similar effects. But their incidence
will differ dramatically. Because the former policy benefits old
as well as new capital, it will confer a windfall gain on the owners

of capital at the time that reform is announced. On the other
hand, investment incentives may actually confer a windfall loss

on the holders of existing capital. This di-stinction cannot be
captured within the standard general equilibrium model, but re-
quires a framework in which the distinction between new and old
capital is a meaningful one.

    This paper develops a general equilibrium model in which
costs of adjustment are incorporated, so that it is possible to
examine jointly the short run effects of tax policy on asset prices

and the long run effect on patterns of capital accumulation.
The model is intended to provide a realistic guide to the likely
responses of the American economy to tax reforms and so it is
calibrated to econometric estimates of the relevant parameters
                             —4—



and to data from the National Income Accounts. The model is

solved using the method of multiple shooting developed in Lipton,
Poterba, Sachs and Summers (1982)

     While the model is somewhat stylized in that it incorporates

only three types of capital: corporate plant and equipment, owner—
occupied housing and land, it is capable of examining the wealth
effects of tax reforms on economic behavior. Consider for exam-
ple, the effects of compensated reductions in the corporate tax
rate. This reform is normally analyzed in terms of its effects
on firms' investment incentives. But it has another potentially
large effect. Such a tax reform will raise stock market values

instantaneously as investors capitalize subsequent tax savings.
The resulting increase in wealth will increase consumption tending
to increase required rates of return on all assets.

     The advantages of the asset price approach to the evaluation
of tax reforms taken here are discussed in detail in Summers (1984)
The only parameters in the model that are estimated statistically

pertain to tastes or technology and so can be assumed to be in-
variant to the choice of policy rule. Thus the estimates present-
ed here are from the Lucas critique of econometric policy evalua-
tion exercises. Because of its forward looking character, the
model developed here can easily be used to examine the effects

of policy announcements and the differential impacts of temporary
and permanent tax reforms.
     The model developed in the paper is used to examine the
effects of indexing the tax system and of various types of tax
reform. The effects of inflation working through the tax system
                             —5—



have been extensively studied. Typically, researchers have closed
their models by making an arbitrary assumption about the response
of interest rates to inflation. The general equilibrium charac-
ter of the model developed here makes it possible to endogenously

derive the response of inflation to interest rates. Changes in
depreciation provisions continue to be a major issue in U.S.
tax reform debates. The model presented here can be used to trace
the effects of policies which benefit new but riot old capital
investments.

     The paper is organized as follows. The next section describes

a simple model illustrating the asset price approach to the analysis
of investment incentives and lays out the general structure of
the model used in this paper. In the second section, the corporate
sector of the model is described. The markets for housing and

land, along with the consumption function are discussed in the
third section. The fourth section considers the long run steady
state effects of changes in inflation and in tax policy. The
effects of inflation and tax reforms on asset prices and on short
run economic performance are taken up in the fifth section. A
final section concludes the paper by discussing the implications
of the analysis for current tax policy debates.

i.   Asset Prices       and Investxnent

     An    Illustrative       Model

     This section begins by presenting a very simple partial
equilibrium model in which the effects of tax policy on asset

prices and investment may be analyzed graphically. The model
is a simplified  version of the framework used in Summers' (1981)
analysis of the tax returns and corporate investment, and Poterba's
(1991) analysis of the effect of inflation i the pri of ner o.pied
housing. Assume that there is one type of capital which is sup-
plied elastically because of either internal or external adjust-
ment costs.    That     is:

     (1)         *    = I(P)              IO, 1(1) =   0


where
        P is the price of capital goods relative to consumption
goods. Note that K         can be negative because of depreciation.
Assume further that the capital good K is used in some production
process    where it earns a total            return F'(K)K and that F"(K) is
                                                  a
negative.     Finally assume that all returns are paid out and that
investors require some fixed rate of return p, to induce them
to ho'd the capital assets. The returns to holding a unit of
capital come in the form of rents F'(K) and capital gains so that
     (2)         p =    F'(X)   +   —
                          K           K

     Equations       (1) arid   (2) describe the      dynamics of the adjust-
ment of the quantity and            price   of capital. The phase diagram
is depicted in Figure 1. Equilibrium occurs at the intersection
of the two schedules at the point where F'(K) = p.

Note that the system displays saddle point stability. Except
along a unique path marked by the dark arrows, the system
will not converge. Only along this path does the supply of in-
vestment exactly validate the future returns capitalized into
the market price of capital goods. Such saddle point stability

is characteristic of asset price models. It implies that at
any point in time, the stock of capital and assumption of saddle
point stabiliy uniquely determine the              asset   price of capital.
      The phase diagram in Figure 1 can be used to examine                  the
effects   of various types of tax changes. In Figure 2 the effect
of a tax on the     asset's       marginal product is considered. Such             a
tax   does not affect its supply curve so that the K=O locus does
not shift. The reduction in after tax returns leads to a left-
ward shift in        = 0    locus.      Since an increase in the      tax   rate

has no immediate effect on the              capital stock the market price of
capital   drops from E1 to B. As capital is decumuiated, the mar-
ginal product of capital rises and the system converges from B
to E2 where K again         equals its equlibriuin value. Note that
after the first instant investors always receive a fixed return

p as reduced rents are made up for by capital gains as equili-
brium is restored.      The position of the adjustment path depends
on the elasticity of supply of the             capital   good. If the elasticity
is substantial, adjustment is rapid so that the               tax change    has
little effect on the asset price of capital. If the supply of capital

is relatively inelastic, there is a larger movement in the price of

capital. In   the   limiting case, where the supply of capital is
completely inelastic, the relative price of capital declines to

point A along the       =     0    locus.

        The effect of a subsidy to new capital investment which

does not apply to existing capital, such as accelerated deprecia-
tion or the investment tax credit is depicted in Figure 3. This

shifts the — 0 schedule but has no effect on the return from ing
capital and   so   does not affect the       0 locus. Such a subsidy leads

to an increase in long run capital intensity but reduces the mar-
ket value of   existing capital goods. This illustrates that tax

measures which encourage investment may        hurt   existing asset holders.

The magnitude of the loss will depend upon the elasticity of the
supply of capital. If it is high owners of existing capital will
suffer a loss close to the subsidy rate. If not, they will con-

tinue   to earn rents   during the period of transition so the loss

will   be smaller.
     This result may at first seem counter—intuitive. It occurs
because the subsidy reduces the price of new capital which is a
substitute for existing capital. The adverse effect of a reduc-
tion    in new car prices on used car prices illustrates the effect

considered here.

        Note that effects of tax policy in this model depends only
on the production function and the supply curve for capital goods.
These parameters are technological, and so their estimation is not

dependent on the assumption of a stable policy regime. This is
not the case for standard approaches based on estimated investment
equations. The asset—price approach can also be used to examine
the effects of policy announcements, and the differential effects

of permanent and temporary policies.

       The General Equilibrium Model

       This paper constructs a general equilibrium perfect fore-
sight growth model in which asset market prices and investment
decisions are determined in a manner parallel to that illustrated

here. There are two important advantages of this approach over
standard general equilibrium models which assume perfect capital

mobility.
       First, models which recognize that stocks of capital adjust

slowly are likely to provide much more realistic estimates of the
consequences of tax measures over the policy relevant horizon.

A second virtue of this approach is that it provides a more satis-

factory approach to the analysis of tax incidence. Without intro-
ducing adjustment costs of some type it is not possible to account
for the variations in the price of existing assets relative to

replacement costs, which account for most of variation in the re-
turn received by asset holders.

       Note also that because it provides a basis for evaluating the

windfall gains and losses from tax return, the model here can be
used to address questions of horizontal equity. The importance
of the announcement effects of tax policies on asset values from

the perspective of equity is stressed in Féldstein (1976)             ,   who
stresses the desirability of reforms which do not confer windfalls.

The present model provides a basis for considering policies
directed at this objective.

      Taking account of adjustment costs entails other sacrifices.
It is not computationally feasible to solve multi—sector models
with more than a very small number of capital goods. This means
that the model must be much more aggregative than many of those
                                 —13—



surveyed in Shoven and Whalley (1984) .     As in general equilibrium models,
there is no explicit treatment of uncertainty, or effort to model
the effects of taxation on corporate financial policy. Considerable

attention is however devoted to modelling the effects of the non-
indexation of the tax system.

    The modelling of each sector is treated in subsequent sections.

Here the general structure of the model is described. It is

'assumed that physical output is homogenous and is produced according
to an aggregate production function F(K,L) + FTT where T is the
economy's land endowment, and FT are the rents generated on land.
The assumption that land enters th' prcducticn function in an
additively separable way is maintained only for convenience and
does not affect the qualitative results. Output takes two forms:
the basic good Y. which is consumed and used as physical capital

and H, housing capital which produces housing services. The

composition of output depends on the relative price B of housing
in terms of X. The production function may ttius be written:



     (3)       G(X,IH) =    F(K,L) +FTT =    Y


where IH represents the production of housing capital. Producers

maximize profits by setting:


      (4,      GIH —
                        H
                Gx

This generates an upward sloping supply schedule of housing capital.
S
                                   —14—



       There are three physical assets in the model: capital K,
    houses H, and land T. The last is inelastically supplied. The
    supply of the housing depends on its relative price as shown in
    (4). Investment in plant and equipment K is assumed to incur
    adjustment costs, so that it depends on Tobin's q ratio of the
    market value of capital to its replacement cost. This ratio is
    adjusted for the effects of taxes on the cost of acquiring new
    capital goods. This is described in more detail in the next

    section.

        The simplest possible model of portfolio equilibrium is assumed.
    The three forrris of physical capital are treated as perfect

    substitutes up to risk premiums which cause their after tax returns
    to differ by fixed amounts. However, the value of the rental
    services provided by tho housing stock is assumed to be a
    decreasing function of the quantity of housing capital. Bonds
    are also treated as perfect substitutes for capital. Money does
    not explicitly enter the model. Implicitly, it is assumed to be
    demanded inelastically. Exogenous changes in the rate of inflation

    should be thought of as coming from movements in the rate of money

    growth.

  II.     The Corporate Sector

          In   the model   all physical output is assumed to be pro-
 duced   in the corporate sector. As already noted, it is assumed
 that   investment in the corporate sector involves internal adjust-
ment costs. The determinants of corporate investment and the
market valuation of the corporate sector are modelled using the
 approach developed in Summers (1981).
       The model is based on q theory of investment linking the
level of investment to the q ratio of the market value of the
corporate capital stock to its replacement cost. The essential
insight underlying Tobin's theory is that in a taxless world

firms invest as long as each dollar spent purchasing capital
raises the market value of the firm by more than one dollar.
Tobin assumes that to a good approximation, the market value
of an additional unit of capital equals the average market value

of the existing capital stock-—that is, average q, measured
as the ratio of the market value of the capital stock to its

replacement cost, is a good proxy for the valne of the marginal
q as an additional dollar of investment. It is natural then
to assume that the rate of investment is an increasing function
of q.
         I draw on earlier work by others, especially Hayashi (1982)
to show that under certain       circumstances there is an exact corres-
pondence between average g as measured in the conventional way,
and the shadow price of capital, or "marginal q" associated
with dynamic optimization of a firm's       value   in the presence of
                              — 16 —



 adjustment costs. This correspondence can be used as a basis
 for econometric estimation of the adjustment cost function.

           I begin by examining how individuals value corporate stock
 and then turn to the decision problem facing a firm. Throughout

 it is assumed that firms neither issue new equity nor repurchase

 existing shares.2 Hence share prices are proportional to the
 outstanding value of a firm's equity. The required return, p,
 is the sum of capital gains and dividends net of tax. It follows
 that




     (3)
                  (P+1I)vt =(l_c)'r+ (l_e)Divt       i(l—8) +

where c is the capital gains tax rate on an accrual basis and 0
is the personal tax rate on interest and dividend income, ir is
the rate of inflation and        is the equity risk premium. All
investors are assumed to have the same tax rates.4

           The second equality is an arbitrage condition linking the
return on stocks and bonds. Imposing a transversality condition
ruling out external speculative bubbles and integrating this



2) The formulation employed here is based on the uq<l model of
    the effects of dividend taxation developed by Auerbach (1979).
    It is adopted for the sake of comparability with my earlier
    work. Poterba and Summers (1984) provide some evidence in
    favor of the alternative "q=l" model of the effects of dividend
    taxation.

3) Feldatein (1980) considers a model in which tax rates vary among
    shareholders.

     differential equation yields an expression for

      Each firm is assumed   to produce with constant returns to
 scale and to be perfectly   competitive in all markets, taking as
 given   the price of its output, the wage, and the rate of return
required by investors. These competitive assumptions, together
with the requirement that capital is hozxx)geneous, are essential
to the derivation of the linkage between market valuation and
investment incentives that is discussed below.
      The typical firm seeks to choose an investment and financial
>olicy to maximize equation (4) subject to the constraints given by
its initial capital stock, by a requirement that the sources of funds
equal the uses, and the requirement that the firm maintain debt
equal to a fixed fraction, b, of the capital stock.4

       A crucial feature cf the model     is that there is a cost to
changing the capital stock. Without this cost, the size of the
firm would be indeterminate because of the constant returns to
scale and the assumption of perfect competition. The cost of
installing additional capital rises with the rate of capital accumu-
lation, thereby preventing jumps in the demand for capital. The
cost function is taken to be convex and linearly homogeneous in
investment and capital. Under these conditions, dividends can

      financial policy will not introduce error in estimation of the

5) The assumption here is that all marginal equity finance comes
   from retained earnings. This follows from the assumption of a
   constant number of shares made earlier. It accounts for some
   of the apparently paradoxical results described below. The
   last term reflects the net receipts from issnance of new debt
   (withdrawAls) necessary to maintain the ratio of debt to capital
  as    the capital stock depreciates and the price level rises.

   The calculation of      assumes that the rate of depreciation
used for tax purposes reflects accelerated depreciation .nd that

tax depreciation is based on historical cost. Adjustment costs
are considered expensed and ineligible for the investment tax
credit. If these costs are taken to represent managerial effort,

or interference with concurrent production, the assumption made
here is appropriate. Treatitig adjustment expenses as investment
under    the   tax law would not importantly alter the results.

  Combining  equations (4) and (5) and separating the terms reflect-
ing the value of depreciation allowances on existing capital, B,
and future acquisitions, Z, yields an expression for the market
value    of a firm's equity at time t:

       The variable represents the present value of depreciation
allowances on existing capital, and    is the present value,
evaluated at time s of the depreciation allowances on a dollar
of new investment.
       In maximizing equation (6), the       firm   can ignore Bt because
it is independent of any current or future decisions. The con-
straint that capital accumulation equals net investment faced by
the firm in maximizing (6) is

This dynamic optimization problem can be solved using the             Poritryagin
maximum principle. A shadow price, ACt), is introduced for the
constraint    given by (8). It can be interpreted as marginal q,
the change in       a firm's   value resulting from a   unit   increment   to
the   capital stock. The        first-order conditions for optimality are8

          The first-order condition, equation (9a), implies that labor
    is hired until its marginal product and wage are equal. Equation
     (9b) characterizes the investment function; it implictly defines
    a function linking investment to the real shadow price of capital,
    A/p, the tax parameters, and the costs of adjustment. This equa-
    tion has an intuitive explanation. The right-hand side is the
    shadow price of additional capital goods, which is equal to their
    marginal cost in after—tax corporate dollars on the left—hand side.
         The third first-order condition, (9c) describes the volution
    of the shadow price, A. It guarantees that the shadow price equals
    the present value of the future marginal produjcts of a unit of
    capital. In this model, capital investment is productive in terms
    of output and, because of the form of the adjustment—cost function,
    in reducing the cost of subsequent investment.
         Equation (7b) is of no operational significance as a theory
    of investment unless an observable counterpart to the shadow price,
    Alp, can be obtained. HayashJ. has shown in a similar model with
    a less elaborate tax system how the shadow price is linked to the
    market valuation of existing capital.
         This link can be demonstrated as follows. Note that VtBt
    given by equation (6) is homogeneous in Kb__that is, a doubling.
    of K together with the optimal doubling of investment and labor
                                      —22—




in every subsequent period will double Vt —    This is a con-
sequence of the constant-returns—to-scale production function
and the homogeneity of the adjustment—cost function. It follows
directly that
        (10)         V_Bt YK
where V is the stock market's value at time t when the optimal
path is followed. In other words, the maximized value Of the firm
at time t minus the value of depreciation allowances on existing
capital is proportional to the value of its initial capital stock.
The maximum principle implies that

This is what is meant by the assertion that A is the          shadow
price of new investment, or marginal q. Combining equations (10)
and (11) demonstrates that
                     At =
                             VT—B t

This   expression provides an observable counterpart for the shadow
price of new investment if it is assumed that the firm maximizes
value so that   V = V.       It implies that the   investment function
can be written
                         =                                     =   h(Q).

where Q is     the     tax—adjusted q and h()         (.+


        various adjustments in Q for the effects of taxes may
       The

be understood quite easily. The terms b+ITC+Z reflects the re-
duction in the effective purchase price of new capital goods caused
by debt finance, the investment tax credit and the presence of depre-.
ciation allowances. Since depreciation allowances of new capital
purchases are reflected in Z, it is necessary to subtract out the
present value B, of remaining depreciation allowances of existing
capital goods. The term (l—c)/(l—6) results from the assumption
that marginal equity investments are financed out of retentions
rather than new share issues. Firms should retain earnings until
the point where the marginal dollar of retentions raises market
value by only               dollar since dividends are taxed more heavily
than   capital   gains. Finally, the.     term   (1_i) in the denominator
of (11) arises from the        assumption   that adjustment costs are ex-

pensed, so that adjustment is less expensive as the corporate tax
rises. These adjustments are discussed more extensively in
Suimners (1981a).

       It is not difficult to verify that if the adjustment cost
function takes the form


                            I _•BI I
                                            2

                                     K


       The relationship between investmnt         and tax adjusted Q   will
take   the   particularly   simple form
                                 —24—

      (15)      —h (Q) —

     The  empirical estimates of Q investment equations in my
earlier paper are used as a basis for estimating the parameters
of the adjustment cost function. The estimated Q investment
relation for the 1931—78 period using instrumental variables was:8

      (16)          = .076 + .051Q
                K
                     (.012) (.013)

This implies that the adjustment cost function is given by:

      (17)     A = 19.61(— .076)2 K for       .076
               A=     0
                                          .   .088

In all the          here firms will be operating in the range
             analysis
where adjustment costs are positive.
     The remaining assumptions about the corporate sector are
drawn from Summers (1981). It is assumed that production of
gross output is given by a Cobb-Douglas production function. The
assumption is quite common in literature on investment and is
consistent with the constancy of factor shares despite the
changing ratio of capital to output. The share of capital in
the production function is taken to be 0.25. This is quite close
to the observed value in the nonfinancial corporate sector.

Effective labor supply, which is taken to be exogenously determined,

is assumed to grow at 3 percent a year. Because of the focus on

8) I use the instrumental variables estimate rather than the
   OLS estimate as in the simulations in my earlier paper. The
   equation reported here is equation 4—8 on page 92 of Summers
   (1981a). It implies a somewhat lower and more plausible value
   for adjustment costs than do the estimates in my earlier paper.
                                -25—




long-run issues, full employment is assumed. It is assumed that
b, the fraction of new investment financed with debt, is .25.
I assumed that the risk premium on equity is 8 percent. This is
the difference between the after tax required return on equity
and debt. It is consistent with the average real pre-tax return
•of 8.7 percent for stocks and 0.0 percent for treasury bills

reported by Ibbotsen and Singuefield (1984)

      The tax parameters are chosen to mirror closely the current
U.S. tax system. The initial values are r= 0.46, 8 = 0.35,
c =   0.05, ITC = 0.056 and     =   0.l7?   where   is the rate of
depreciation for tax purposes on the capital stock. One additional
complication is introduced in the simulations: firms are assumed
to pay corporate income taxes on FIFO inventory profits. The
magnitude of this tax as a fraction of output is estimated as
the product of thecorporate tax rate and the ratio of the

inventory valuation adjustment of the nonfinancial corporate sector
to its gross output. From this procedure one can conclude that
each point of inflation raises corporate taxes by 0.17 percent

of output.

    III.       Land, Housing and Consumption

                section describes the general equilibrium structure
               This

    of   the model, considering the other asset markets, and then the
    remaining         components of aggregate demand, consumption and govern-
    ment spending. The benchmark steady state used in the simulations
    of tax      return effects is then presented. The risk adjusted re-
    turns      on all assets are assumed to be equal. Nominal bonds in
    the model are a purely inside asset. Their real after tax return

    is given by i(l—O) —it.          All     the risk premiums here refer to after
    tax spreads between the return on other assets and on nominal bonds.

    The tax rate on         interest income is taken to be equal to the dividend
    tax rate      of .35.    This   assumption is defended in Feldstein and

    Summers (1979) and Summers (1981a)

    Land

               In order that the model can       have   a steady state it is assumed

    that effective land grows at the same rate as the              labor   force.

    The asset land is assumed to represent all inelastically supplied
    assets such as exhaustible resources, antiques and gold as well
    as actual land. Land is assumed to yield per-capita rents equal

    to FT each year. In the benchmark steady state of the model
    these rents represent three percent of GNP. The risk premium on
    land is somewhat arbitrarily taken to equal .06. For simplicity
    it    is   assumed that the rental income and capital gains from land
    are untaxed.         This gives rise to the portfolio equilibrium equation
    for land.

               (20)        P = FT
                               —T

                                   —27—




    This equation characterizes the evolution of the price of
land. It demonstrates that in general tax measures which affect
the required after tax rate of return will affect prices of land.
Note that it implies that if     = 1 the steady state value of
land prices will rise with inflation. This is the essential
point   of Peldstein's (1981c,d) analysis. This conclusion depends
critically on the assuxnption made about the response of interest
rates to inflation. The sa tax effects which affect the pric-
ing of land should also affect the pricing of bonds. If inter-
est rates rise so that         =          there   will be no effect of

inflation   on the   price of land.

Housing

        I begin by considering housing as a portfolio asset and
then consider the production of housing capital. In the model
all housing is owner occupied. The return in owning           houses   comes
in   the form untaxed iiilicit rents and capital gains. Capital
      ta a rr ooied housing axe rg1eced because the rollor pro-
visions,   the exemption for aged sellers, and the        absence   of con-
structive realization at death render them negligible.

        The implicit rental on a unit of housing capital is assumed
to be a decreasing function of the total supply of housing capital.
                                    —28—



In particular it takes the form:
                                    1
        (21)          RCa)       Kfl



where  n is the price elasticity of the demand for housing ser-
vices. In order to induce investors to hold the existing stock
of housing, it is necessary that the portfolio equilibrium con-.
dition:
                      R1H'' +
        (22)                            P(l—e) —,r+B
                       H        P

be satisfied, where          reflectz      daprociation, property taxes,
and any risk premium associated with home ownership. This equation
holds that the rental return on housing plus the real capital

gain must equal the cost of housing capital. Following the micro-
econometric evidence of Rosen (1979), the value of         is taken to
equal -1. The value of          is set at .06 in the simulations reported
below. Individuals' consumption of housing services i-s treated as

P(H)H is calculating total consumption.

    Note that in this model the deductibility of nominal interest

payments is not the source of the tax advantage enjoyed by owner

occupied housing. Individuals can borrow to finance purchases
of any asset so interest deductibility does not uniquely bene-
fit housing. Rather the source of the tax advantage to housing
in this model is the fact that imputed rents escape taxation.
This distinction is stressed in Summers (1981).
                                     —29—




       The supply of housing is determined by profit maximization
as in Equation (4). Increases in its relative price P increase
supply. Poterba (1984) estimates that price elasticity of the
production      of new owner occupied housing is 2.0. This estimate
is used here as a basis for calibrating the function G in uatiai
(3).     I assume this function takes the form.


       (23)       G(X,IR) =     X+h0IH'l

where both forms of output are measured per unit         of   labor inputs.
This implies that the supply for new housing is given by:

                  Iii =
       (24)               h1P   (h1— 1)


The value of h1 is          set equal to 1.5 so   that the supply elasticity
of housing equals 2.0. The remaining constant h0 is set so
that in the benchmark steady state, housing accounts           for   40 per—

cent of the capital stock. This comports          approximately   with
information in the Federal Reserve Board's National Balance

Sheets. Finally it         is assumed that housing depreciates at 4
percent       a year. This estimate reflects the inclusion of mainte-
nance costs.

Cons uxnp ti on


       The remaining part of the model which must be described is
the determination of aggregate consumption. In Summers (1981c)

and (1982),        I emphasize the importance of "human wealth effects".
                                      —30—



Increases  in the rate of return may tend to increase saving
because they reduce the present value of future labor earnings.
These effects play an important role in the consumption function
postulated here. It is assumed that consumption C is propor-
tional to full wealth, which equals the sum of the present value
of future labor incomes and the market value of existing corp-
orate capital, housing and land. That is:

       (25)        C =
                         C0. (HW+bK+PHH+PTT)

where HW represents           human wealth and all variables are expressed

in per—capita terms. This expression can be derived rigorously

if   an infinite     horizon logarithmic utility function is assumed.

In general the marginal propensity to consume out of wealth
will   depend on the        rate   of return as discussed in Summers (1982)

Limited sensitivity analysis suggested that allowing for these
effects would not significantly alter the simulation results.

       Human wealth 11W represents the present value of future
labor income after taxes. A 20.5 percent tax rate on labor in-
come is assumed. The discount rate is taken to include a risk

premium t5          reflecting uncertainty about      future labor income.

Blanchard (1984) presents an elegant derivation of a consumption
function of the type used here. It follows that HW evolves according

to the pseudo-arbitrage equation:
It follows that 11W          evolves    according to the pseudo-arbitrage

equation:
        (26)                       i(1—e) _lt+6HW

Human wealth       like the other assets in the model will jump     in

response       to changes   in future tax policy.
                                    —31—




         The marginal prosperity to consume C0 is chosen so that
 the    average propensity to save out of disposable income in the
 nxdel's benchmark steady state is .05. This corresponds closely
 with actual economic experience.
         The model is closed with an income—expenditure identity.
 It takes the form:


         (27)      C+IR+IH+Gov+A = F(K,L) +FT+R(H) H

The level of government spending, Gov, is set equal to
25   percent of GNP      in the benchmark steady state.     The term    A
reflects adjustment costs.
     The characteristics of the model's benchmark steady state
are displayed in Table 1. The model was calibrated so that its
steady state characteristics would be similar to those of the
American economy) if inflation continues. An 8 percent infla-
tion rate is assumed. The shares of consumption, investment and
government spending corresond almost       exactly to the average
actual shares      in   the economy over the 1970's. In the benchmark

steady   state, corporate capital accounts for two-fifths of
total wealth    housing comprises two—fifths, and     the   remaining
fifth   is land.    In the    actual economy, at the end of 1979, the

replacement     value    of the corporate capital stock was $1,852.8

billion, owner occupied housing totaled $1,690 billion and

non-corporate      land was   $890 billion. The last figure does
not include the value of exhaustible resources, Rernbrandts and

other irielastically       supplied assets. The major     omission here

             equilibrium, the ndel is calibrated so that the divide
            In

     price ratio is .062. This earnings—price ratio is .098
     In line with recent, but not very recent, experience, the real
     pre-tax interest rate is two percent. Given the 35 percent tax
     rate on interest income discussed above, this implies a real after

     tax return on bonds of —1.5 percent. The equilibrium value of
    Tobin's q measure is 1.02. This is a             coincidence    reflecting
    the    offsetting      effects of tax parameters and the   need for     the

    market      to be   above its no invesinent eguilibrium' value by
    enough to induce replacement investment and normal growth of the
    capital       stock.

            The    parameters have been chosen so that the government's
    budget      is balanced assuming   that   no debt is outstanding.       The
    tax    reforms considered     below will in general cause changes in
    government revenue. In the simulations it is assumed that the
    tax rate on labor income is varied to offset these revenue effects
    so    that the government's budget constraint is always satisfied.
           The model may be solved by recognizing that it contains
    three-state variables, the stock of corporate capital ,                 of
    housing H, and the value of deprec.ation allowances on remain—
    ing   capital B. The model has five forward-looking prices or
    costate variables. These are V, the           value   of the   stock   market;

          the   housing price, P, the    relative price of land;     H., human
    wealth; and Z, the precent value of depreciation allowances.
    The income-expenditure identity, Equation (26) holds as a con-
    straint     across the five—asset prices.

      In formal terms systems of this type are two-point boundary
value problems.    In order to solve them uniquely,   it is   necessary
tospecify initial conditions for the state variable and terminal
conditions for the asset price variables. The latter simply in-
volve specifying transversality conditions ensuring the model's
convergence. Solution of models of this type which need to inte-
grate both forwards and backwards is numerically difficult.        It
can be accomplished using the method of Multiple Shooting as
described in Lipton, Poterba, Sachs and Suiners (1982). The
program described there is used in the calculations reported in
in   this paper.

IV. Steady State Effects of Tax Reforms

          section uses the model described in the preceding
       This

sections to examine the long run steady state effects of various

tax reforms. A discussion of transition paths and the effects
of tax reforms on asset prices is provided in the next section.
     Table 2 considers the long run effects of changes in the rath
of inflation. The results show clearly that inflation has a
large negative effect on corporate capital accumulation. An
increase in the rate of inflation from S to 12 percent would,
for example, reduce the        steady state capital stock by 9.2 per-
cent. The     level   of the   itock market    in   the long   run steady state
is about 9    percent lower than in the presence of 8 percent inflation.
The results of the calculation of the effects of zero percent
inflation and    four   percent inflation suggest comparable effects
of inflation on corporate capital accumulation. Since                the model
is structured so that inflation is neutral apart from tax effects,
the zero inflation steady state also indicates the effect of

indexing the tax system.
       A striking feature of the results is the insensitivity of
the required rate of return on        bonds,    ii—e —ii with respect
to    the rate of inflation. This implies that to a very good

approximation            1.5. The demand for output in this model
is very elastic with respect to the real interst rate so that

shocks   to the inflation rate are accommodated with only negli-
gible variations in real interest rates. This finding suggests
that contrary to the implications of the discussion of Feldstein
and   Summers (1978), the key determinant of the sensitivity of

of   interest rates to inflation is the marginal tax rate on
individual interest income, rather than            the   marginal    tax   rate
on corporations. In terms of the analysis presented there,
the long run supply of funds to the corporate sector appears
to be very elastic relative to the MPIR schedule so that its
movement with inflation determines the equilibrium relation
between interest rates and inflation.
     An important implication of this analysis is that analyses
of the effects of inflation and taxes which assume       1 are
likely to be misleading. The standard argument that corporations
benefit from the deductibility of nominal rather than real
interest payments depends on the ad—hoc assumption that nominal
interest rates only adjust to inflation to               a   limited extent.
The conclusion here should not be surprising. The gain corpora-
tions   realize from the deductibility of nominal interest payments
is largely offset by the loss their debtho].ders incur. Infla-
tion subsidizes corporate investment only to the extent that t>e
      Increases in inflation reduce slightly the equilibrium real
after tax interest rate because of the reduced demand for invest-

ment. This raises the equilibrium price of land and                  housing,
and    raises     by a small amount the steady state level of housing
consumption. In the model, these effects are very small. Index—
ation of the tax systemreduces land prices by only about 2.0 per-
cent. The absence of a strong positive relation between inflation
and    the   prices of land and housing is a consequence of the fact
that          >   1   which in   turn results from the high elasticity of savings.
                               —38—




with respect to the real rate of return in the model. This high
elasticity causes the ratio of wealth—to—labor income to decline
with increases in the rate of inflation, if real after tax interest
rates decline at all. If a savings function were postulated that
did not have this property, it would be necessary for the change
in the market value of stocks of housing and land to equal the
change in the stock market. In this greater changes in the rate
of return on housing and land prices would be observed. A savings
function with a lower interest elasticity could be introduced

into the model by assuming that some consumers were liquidity

constrained, or by assuming a lower elasticity of substitution
between present and future consumption.
    The steady state effects of various statutory tax reforms are
considered in Table 3. The first column considers an accelera-
tion of tax depreciation roughly comparable to the American ACRS
program as enacted in 1981. The rate of tax depreciation is
assumed to rise from 17 percent a year to 33 percent a year.
This probably understates the actual acceleration of depreciation
because most investment may be treated as equipment for tax

purposes, and because double declining balance depreciation is

permitted.

  raising the exponential rate of tax depreciation from .17 to .33.

                                  —40—




      As one would expect the results suggest that accelerating
depreciation allowances would significantly increase long run
capitalintensity. The predicted increase of 12.4 percent is
sufficient to raise steady state GNP by 3.1 percent and real
wages by 2.5 percent. The fact that the real after tax rate of

return rises by only 10 basis points in equilibrium means that
a substantial fraction of the long run benefit from accelerated

depreciation falls on workers rather than the owners of capital.
Because the increased demand for business investment bids up
interest rates, there is again some crowding out     of housing

investment and land. This effect is small. The       total   reduction
in   the value of land and the housing stocks is only about one-
eighth of the increase in the capital stock.

       The   second column considers the effects of eliminating
the   corporate income tax. This is predicted to have only a

slightly greater impact on long run capital intensity than
the acceleration of depreciation. However its other effects
are quite different. Where accelerating depreciation reduces
the effective purchase price of new capital goods, elimination
of corporate iricon taxes raises the effective purchase price
because of the expensing of adjustment costs and the presence
of accelerated depreciation. For this reason, the ratio of the
                                —41—




value   of the stock market to the   stock   or corporate   capital
rises   a great deal when the corporate income tax is removed.
This increase also reflects the fact that the elimination of
the corporate tax applies to the return on old as well as new
capital.
     The substantial increase in wealth caused by the change in
the value of the market relative to the corporate capital stock
raises consumption,    thus bidding up interest rates. While elim-
ination of the corporate income tax spurs only slightly more
corporate investment than acceleration of depreciation, it crowds
out almost six times as much housing investment. It also          reduces
land    prices by 7.4 percent. The effects on market value shown

here reveal that the long run   incidence     of eliminating the corp-
orate income tax is very different than that of accelerating

depreciation allowances.
        The third column of the table examines the effects of elim-

inating capital gains taxation. Recall that in the model only

corporate capital is subject to capital gains taxation. This
reform has a significant effect on capital formation despite its
xelatjvely small impact on the   stock market.      The reason for
this involves the assumption that all equity investment is
financed from retentions rather than new equity issues. Reduc-
tions in the capital gains tax raise the effective price of new

capital   goods, because they increase the tax     penalty   to paying
dividends. Because this type of return has only small wealth
effects, it has only a negligible impact on the prices of hous-

ing and   land.
                                   —42—




     The dividend tax reduction      considered   in the fourth Section

has what may seem to be a paradoxical effect. It actually re-
duces the long run capital stock by about 1.5 percent. This
result arises because of the assumption that equity investment
is financed out of retained earnings. Reductions in dividend

taxes raise the cost of capital by an amount just sufficient to
offset the increased return to shareholders. Thus they are
peutral with respect to new investment. The reduction in divi-
dend taxes does however have a wealth effect, as it raises the
equilibrium value of stock market. This increases consumption
raising demand and the interst rate, in turn reducing capital
intensity. The increased interest rate slightly reduces the
price of land and houses.
     There is obviously an important moral for policy here.
Insofar as marginal investment is financed out of retentions,
reductions    in tax rates on high bracket   individuals are likely

to confer windfalls without spurring significant amounts of new
investment. This conclusion is supported by the simulation in

the fifth    column of   the effects of eliminating the interest
income tax. This encourages corporate investments slightly
and discourages investment in housing and land. The result
occurs because corporations deduct interest payments at the
46 percent rate while households deduct them at a lesser rate.
If interest rates adjusted to the change in 8 by only enough
                                —43—



to keep the real after tax individual return on bonds constant,
corporations would gain because of their reduced borrowing
costs, and no one else would lose——so the income expenditure iden-
tity would not be satisfied. Hence the real return rises slightly
but not enough to offset all the stimulus to corporate investment.
     Steady state calculations of the type reported here are only
approximate guides in analyzing tax policy. The next section
considers the transition path of the economy following several

alternative   tax reforms.. Particular attention is devoted to the
windfall   effects arising from asset revaluations following tax
changes.
                                —44—


V.   The Transition Path Following Tax Reforms

     In Table 4, the transition path of the economy following
full indexatiori of tax system is considered. The windfall
effect conferred on existing shareholders from idexation is
about 10 percent. Capital losses of about 5       percent would be
suffered   by the owners of land and   capital.   A notable feature
of the    results is the large capital gain which long term bond-
owners    would realize. While r lg +rm bcr    are eçlic.tly inc13-
ed in. the zicdel, a yield can be calculated by applying a term

structure relation to the sequence of short term interest rates.
The yield on a 20 year bond would fall by about 3.5 points if
the tax system were indexed, implying a capital gain of over 30

perôent.      Of course a similar loss is realized by the   bond issuer.
      Thesewindfall gains and losses occur because the adju.stment
path of the economy following this type of tax change is quite
slow. The impact effect of indexing the tax system is estimated
to be an 11.1. percent increase in the rate of investment in plant
and equipment     an an 8.34 percent decline in the rate of housing

investment. Only half of the adjustment in the corporate capital
stock is completed within 2 years. The adjustment in the housing
stock is somewhat more rapid.
     An interesting feature of the results is the behavior of
interest rates. Following the indexation of the tax system, the
real after tax short term interest rate rises. This occurs be-
cause the     demand for goods and services arise immediately as con-
sumers and investors take account      of reductions in future tax

liabilities. In the short run, output is fixed and so real
interest rates are bid up. In the longer run, capital is
accumulated and the rate of interest declines until the real
after tax rate of return returns to its original level. This
path of interest rates implies that there is significant short
run crowding out following indexation, but much less in the
long run.
      In Tables 5 and 6, the incidence of eliminating the coin-
parable tax system and using accelerated depreciation are exam-
ined. Both have quite similar long run effects on capital inten-
sity in the corporate sector. However, their incidence effects are
very different. The elimination of the corporate income tax
causes corporate shareholders to receive a windfall excess return
of 76.2 percent when the tax reform is announced. Significant
capital losses are suffered by the owners of houses and land.
On the other hand, the windfall from accelerating depreciation
is a less than 1 percent increase in the value of the stock
market and much smaller reductions in the value of-housing and
land.
     The differences point up the importance of taking an
asset price approach to the analysis of tax incidence. Tradi-
tional approaches would convert an acceleration of depreciation
allowances into a reduction in the effective tax rate, and then
focus on differences in the steady state rate of return to cap-

ital. They would reveal only very       sinll   differences between

the effects of the two   types   of tax reform considered here, and

miss entirely the windfall effect of reducing the corporate
income tax. The source of the difference between the two polici
is their differential effect on the value of used capital as
explained in the preceding section. !Jote that the analysis
here suggests that there is nothing paradoxical thout the failure
of the ,tock market to respond strongly to the recently enacted
tax package. It may also help to explain the tendency for bus-
iness to support statutory rate reduction as a preferred form
of tax    relief.
       These results show that corporate tax changes have important
effects   on interest rates. The pattern of response is similar
in both simulations. Following expansionary policy, the interest
rate rises and then returns toward its equilibrium level as cap-
ital is accumulated. In the case of corporate tax        elimination,
the   effect is very substantial s long turn bond holders would
suffer losses of over 10 percent.

       The implications of the results for tax     incidence are very
different   in the long and short run. The short run incidence
is reflected in the windfall gains and losses discussed in the
preceding section. The long run effect of tax reforms appears
•to be primarily on the real wage.

       A surprising   feature   of all the simulations is the relative
unimportance of induced changes in land and housing prices,
arising from inflation or changes in tax policy. The cause is
the insencitivity of interest rate to tax changes. This in turn
is a consequence of the form of the consumption function which
makes savings highly interest elastic. If savings were more
inelastic, taxes would have a greater impact on interest rates
                              —50—



andlarger spillover effects on other asset prices. Another
way of generating larger effects on other asset prices would
be to postulate lower risk premiunis. This would cause changes
in   interest to have larger effects on asset prices. Absent
data on the dividend yields of houses and land? it is diffi-
cult to see how to check the validity of the assumptions made
here.

VI. Conclusions
     The simulations of the model may shed some light on recent
economic experience. The model predicts the observed negative
relationship between changes in stock market values and the rate
of inflation, as well as the positive relationship between infla-
tion and housing and land prices. These predictions based on tax
effects, first made in the late 1970's, have stood up very well
during the disinflation of early 1980's. Real stock prices have
risen .dramatically whereas real housing prices have actually declined.
The composition of capital investment between residential and non-
residential investment has also fluctuated as predicted by the
model presented here.

     In no sense can this model be   interpreted as a descriptive
theory of stock market prices, other asset prices or investment.
It is clear that forces other than changes in the tax law account
for most of the variations in these variables. Tax factors may
help to explain their movements, but they are only a small part
of the story. In analogy to a regression equation, their coef-
ficients are   large and significant but the R2 is very low. The
model does reveal one very striking anomaly——the behavior of
interest rates in the face of rising inflation. The model yields
the conclusion that inflation should raise interest rates by far

more than point for point. The calculations indicate that each
extra percentage point of inflation should raise nominal interest
rates by close to 150 basis points. This is a prediction about
                             —52--




the effects of long run changes in the underlying inflation
rate, caused by changes in the rate of money growth, not high
frequency movements in inflation. In Summers (1983), I show
that this prediction is not borne out.
      This anomaly raises important doubts about analysis of the
effects of inflation and its interactions with the tax system.
In what sense can this model be interpreted as demonstrating
that the interaction of inflation and taxes partially explains
the downturn in the stock market and the level of investment
during the 1970's. The negative relationship between inflation
and these variables in the model is predicated on an assumed
increase in interest rates. If behavior more like the actual
reality is inserted into the model, and interest rates are assumed
to rise point for point with inflation, the implication would
be   an increase in the stock market and investment. This is the
essential point, of the analyses     of Gordon (1980) and Bendershott
(1980).

      There iS clearly more than one way to look at the question.
I believe that a general equilibrium model of the type used here
is the "right" way to examine inflation—taxation interactions.
It provides a way of examining the "pure" effects of changes in
the rate of inflation unaccompanied by other real shocks.
The failure of interest rates to rise more fully with inflation
presumably reflects either some form of inflation illusion or
a historical correlation between rates of inflation and      real
shocks. In neither case would it be appropriate to ignore the.
                               —53—



forces affecting interest rates in considering the behavior
of asset prices or investment. The usual procedure of estiinat-

ing or postulating an inflation-interest rate relationship and
then using it as a basis for analyzing tax effects involves an
odd    hybrid of theory and evidence. If the goal is to examine
tax    effects only, a general equilibrium model of the type used
here is appropriate. If the objective is describing the actual
behavior of the economy, it is necessary to model the full effects
of whatever accounts for the absence of a stronger relation9hip
between inflation and    nominal   interest rates.
         results here have implications for the analysis of stat—
       The

ury tax reform. Perhaps most importantly, they illustrate the
importance   of   recognizing adjustment costs. The half—life of
the    adjustment  the capital stock following shocks is over a
                    of

decade in the simulations reported here. Because of these sub-
stantial lags in the adjustment of the capital stock, tax reforms
have important wealth effects. They confer large windfalls on
the owners of different types of capital assets. For example,
the simulations suggest that eliminating the corporate income
tax would confer a windfall excess return of over 70 percent on
the owners of corporate stock. Measures which benefit only new
capital such as the investment tax credit are likely to involve
much smaller windfalls.
     The finding that adjustment costs are large enough to
lead   to such sluggish behavior of investment may at first seem

very surprising. Without such sluggishness, it is impossible
to explain the observed volatility in asset prices. Regardless
                                —54—


of the sources of the extremely volatile valuation of existing capital,
there would only be small effects on stock market prices as long as ne•:

capital was very elasticially supplied. The puzzle of market volatili-
ty that has followed in the wake of Shiller (1981) has an extra piece--
explaining why q is not maintained at a more constant level by the
elastici supply of new capital goods. An Lmportant priority for future
research must be determining the nature of the adjustment costs which

lead to the sluggish response of investment to tax changes.
         A second major conclusion which comes from the analysis is

the sensitivity of the supply of funds     to   the corporate sector

to the rate of return. Because of the high elasticity of over-
afl savings with respect to the rate of return, and the reallo-

cation of investors' portfolios, changes in business taxation
have only very small effects on interest rates. Eliminating the
corporate income tax for example, which would raise the after

tax marginal product of corporate capital by about 5 percent in
the short run, is estimated to increase interest rates by 1.1

points in the short run and only .5 points in the long run. This
finding is consistent with the empirical evidence in Feldstein
arid Summers (1978) suggesting that changes in tax      policy have
only     very small effects on long term bond rates.    It implies

that     analyses of the effects of business tax incentives can

to   first approximation omit the crowding out effect of rising
     a

interest rates.
     The model in this paper should be regarded as a prelimin-
ary empirical application of an asset price approach to invest
ment. The model presented here can and will be refined much
                                   —55—


further along a variety of dimensions. These include increas-
ing the number of sectors so that the capital assets in the
model exhaust those in the economy. In addition more exact
calibration of the model to National Income Accounts data wjfl
be attempted. Perhaps more important, it is necessary to ex-
plore the effects of alternative consumption functions. The
introduction of liquidity constraints which would sharply re-
duce the importance of "human wealth" effects might well in-
crease the sensitivity of interest rates to changes in tax policy.
       At    somewhat greater remove models of this type could be

used to examine       the   welfare consequences of alternative tax
policies. If we were able to assume that all assets were

perfect substitutes, and         had   the   same required rate of return,
it would     not   be difficult to use an intertempora]. utility func-

tion to compute the effects of tax reform on lifetime utility,

and   then to   compute compensating or equivalent variations. The
difficulty comes when risk is introduced. Welfare analysis be-
comes impossible when ad—hoc line risk premiums enter the model.

A more adequate treatment of uncertainty does not appear to be
feasible at this point. Additional valuable              extensions might
include      a more satisfactory treatment of corporate financial

policy,      and recognition of heterogeneity among consumers.
        It would clearly also be possible to use the model developed
in    this   paper to examine the effects of changes in the level
of government spending, or the introduction of public debt.
The effects of anticipated changes in monetary             policy   might also

be considered.

         The analysis   here does demonstrate the importanceof incor-
    porating adjustment costs and the resulting variations in asset
    prices into models of the effects of taxation. It also Suggests
    that in the presence of a tax systezr anything like that of the
    United States, inflation is likely to be far from neutral.
