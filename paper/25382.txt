                                           ABSTRACT

The US economy has undergone a number of puzzling changes in recent decades. Large firms now
account for a greater share of economic activity, new firms are being created at a slower rate, and
workers are getting paid a smaller share of GDP. This paper shows that changes in population
growth provide a unified quantitative explanation for these long-term changes. The mechanism
goes through firm entry rates. A decrease in population growth lowers firm entry rates, shifting the
firm-age distribution towards older firms. Heterogeneity across firm age groups combined with an
aging firm distribution replicates the observed trends. Micro data show that an aging firm
distribution fully explains i) the concentration of employment in large firms, ii) and trends in
average firm size and exit rates, key determinants of the firm entry rate. An aging firm distribution
also explains the decline in labor’s share of GDP. In our model, older firms have lower labor shares
because of lower overhead labor to employment ratios. Consistent with our mechanism, we find
that the ratio of nonproduction workers to total employment has declined in the US.

1      Introduction
Three long-term changes in the US economy have attracted a great deal of attention. First,
economic activity is being concentrated in fewer firms. For example, the fraction of work-
ers employed by large firms increased by 6 percentage points since 1978. Second, the
entrepreneurship rate — the ratio of new firms to total firms — has nearly halved since the
1970s. Third, the share of GDP going to labor, once thought to be stable, has declined since
1975. What explains these changes?
    Our analysis begins by highlighting the importance of firm demographics in driving
these aggregate trends. We first document that the increase in employment concentration
is entirely due to changes in firm demographics: an aging firm distribution combined with
heterogeneity in employment concentration by firm age. The data shows that there has
been no change in employment concentration within firm-age categories. However, across
age-categories, older firms have higher employment concentration. Therefore a shift in the
age distribution towards older firms drives the increase in concentration. Next, we show
that changes in firm demographics can also completely account for changes in two related
variables: average firm size and the aggregate firm exit rate. Conditional on age, these
variables have not changed much over time. Nevertheless, because older firms are larger
and exit at lower rates, an aging firm distribution leads to an increase in average firm size
and a decline in the aggregate exit rate.
    Next, we turn to the entrepreneurship rate. A simple accounting identity shows that
the firm entry rate is equal to the aggregate exit rate minus the growth in average firm size,
plus labor force growth,1

The exit rate and average firm size are constant in stationary equilibria of standard firm
dynamics models. Therefore, changes in labor force growth are a natural candidate to
explain changes in the firm entry rate. Can a change in labor force growth, by itself,
explain the drop in firm entry rates observed in the data? Qualitatively, yes. Quantitatively,
no. US labor force growth has declined, but not by enough. Figure 1 shows US civilian
labor force growth rates by decade. Since the 1970s, labor force growth has declined by
2pp, whereas the entry rate has declined by 6pp. The remaining 4pp decline in the entry
    1 Thisidentity comes from the definition of average firm size, e ≡ N/M, where N is the number of workers
and M is the number of firms. It follows that the growth rate in the number of firms equals the growth rate
of the labor force minus the growth rate of average firm size, M b =N b −b
                                                                         e. The growth in the number of firms
also depends on firm entry and exit, M = λ − ξ. Combining these two equations leads to accounting identity

rate is accounted for by changes in the aggregate exit rate and changes in the growth rate
of average firm size. A decline in labor force growth by itself can only account for a third
of the decline in the firm entry rate. However, if the decline in labor force growth leads to
changes in firm demographics, and therefore to changes in average firm size and aggregate
exit rates, labor force growth can account for a larger extent of the decline in firm entry
rates.
    We show that changes in labor force growth lead to changes in firm demographics
in a standard general equilibrium firm dynamics model. Consider an increase in labor
force growth. To satisfy labor market clearing, the increase in labor supply must be met
by a corresponding increase in labor demand. Incumbent firms are limited by scale, so
they cannot absorb the entire increase in labor supply. The residual labor demand must
therefore be satisfied by firm entry. Because total labor demand by incumbents depends on
past entry, the history of past entry matters for current entry. As the entry rate changes,
the age distribution of firms in the current, and therefore in future periods, is affected.
However, a shift in the age distribution affects average firm size and aggregate exit only
if there is heterogeneity in average firm size and exit by firm age. The standard model
generates heterogeneity by firm age because it features selection and firm growth.
    The calibrated model fed with the US labor force growth since the 1940s replicates the
6pp. fall in firm entry rates starting in 1978. The rapid rise in labor force growth from the
1940s to the 1970s, seen in Figure 1, amplifies the effects of the subsequent decline in labor
force growth. The rapid increase in labor force growth generates a rapid increase in the
entry rate and in the number of firms. As these entrants age, they grow in size and absorb


                                                3
more labor, leaving less room for potential startups to fill when labor force growth declines.
Because the history of past entry matters, both the rise and fall of labor force growth are
important to generate the 6pp. decline in firm entry rates.
    The calibrated model generates an increase of concentration similar to the data. Specif-
ically, the share of employment of firms with 250 employees or more increases by 7pp. vs
6pp. in the data. As in the data, the increase in concentration is entirely due to an ag-
ing firm distribution: conditional on age, there is no change in the share of employment
of firms with 250+ employees. The role of age vs. size in firm concentration can be seen
in the evolution of the share of employment within age-size categories. If the increase in
concentration was because of size, the share of employment in large firms should increase,
regardless of age. That is not the case in the data. The share of employment of young-large
firms declined by 3 percentage points whereas the share employment of mature-small firms
increased by 4.5 percentage points. The increase in concentration is driven by age, not size.
Our model generates these changes in the share of employment by age-size categories.
    Finally, we turn to the labor share. An aging firm distribution combined with a role
for overhead labor generates a decline in the aggregate labor share. A firm’s labor share
can be broken down into the share of revenue paid to production labor and the share of
revenue paid to overhead labor. With identical Cobb-Douglas production functions, profit
maximization implies that the share paid to production labor is identical across firms. If the
share paid to overhead labor is decreasing in firm size, then larger firms have lower labor
shares. Because older firms are larger, an aging firm distribution shifts weight to firms
with lower labor shares, leading to a decline in the aggregate labor share.2 Our mechanism
suggests the decline in the labor share should be accompanied by a corresponding decline
in the importance of nonproduction workers in total employment. Consistent with our
mechanism, we find that the ratio of nonproduction workers to total employment in the US
has declined, and by a similar amount as in the model.
    We close by discussing the sources of labor force growth. We decompose labor force
growth into three components: birth rates sixteen years prior, the growth in participation
rate, and a residual term that captures rates of migration, death and institutionalization.
We find that birth rates sixteen years prior account for the bulk of changes in labor force
growth. We conclude that the rise and fall of labor force growth is primarily due to the
baby boom.
   2 Our  mechanism is consistent with evidence by Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson and Van Reenen (2017), who
document a negative relationship between firm size and firm labor share, and find that almost all of the
decline of the labor share is due to between-firm reallocation rather than within-firm changes. These authors
illustrate how a model with overhead labor can generate the observed negative relationship between firm size
and firm labor shares.

Related Literature. Our paper builds on a wealth of recent empirical evidence from seem-
ingly disconnected strands of the literature. One strand of the literature has documented
changes in entry rates and the age distribution of firms. Reedy and Strom (2012) documents
declining firm entry, while Pugsley and Şahin (2018), Decker, Haltiwanger, Jarmin and Mi-
randa (2014), Hathaway and Litan (2014a), Gourio, Messer and Siemer (2015) and Davis
and Haltiwanger (2014) document the pervasiveness of this decline across geographic ar-
eas and industries. Decker, Haltiwanger, Jarmin and Miranda (2014), Hathaway and Litan
(2014b) and Pugsley and Şahin (2018) document the aging of the firm distribution and
link it to declining firm entry. A different strand of the literature has documented trends
in the aggregate labor share and the rise in concentration. Karabarbounis and Neiman
(2014) find that the decline in the labor share is primarily a within-industry rather than
a cross-industry phenomenon. Grullon, Larkin and Michaely (2017) document increased
concentration across most U.S. industries, whereas Barkai (2017) and Autor, Dorn, Katz,
Patterson and Van Reenen (2017) both document a positive correlation between industry
concentration and the decline in the labor share. Our paper incorporates all of these em-
pirical findings into one unified explanation.
    We are not the first paper to propose the decline in labor force growth as an expla-
nation for the decline in firm entry rates. Using lagged fertility rates as an instrument,
Karahan, Pugsley and Şahin (2018) find that the entry rate is highly elastic to changes in
labor supply.3 The authors then explore the role of labor force growth in the steady state
of a Hopenhayn (1992a)-style model. There are two main differences between our papers.
First, we aim to explain a broader set of facts, such as the increase in concentration and the
decline of the labor share. Second our study focuses on transitional dynamics, allowing us
to uncover how the history of past entry matters for current entry and firm demographics.
    To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper that aims to jointly explain trends of
entrepreneurship, concentration, and the labor share. Alternative explanations have been
proposed for a subset of these trends.4 One related, but distinct, explanation is that of
the aging of the workforce (Liang, Wang and Lazear, 2018; Kopecky, 2017; Engbom, 2017).
We note that a decline in labor force growth is a different phenomenon than an aging
workforce. Another explanation that has gained considerable attention is that of the rise
in market power, as measured by increasing markups (Loecker and Eeckhout, 2017). Our
   3 Hathaway   and Litan (2014c) also note a correlation between declining firm entry rates and population
growth across geographic regions. Other explanations for the decline in entrepreneurship include the de-
cline in corporate taxes (Neira and Singhania, 2017), the decline in interest rates, (Liu, Mian and Sufi, 2018;
Chatterjee and Eyigungor, 2018), and skill-biased technical change (Salgado, 2018; Jiang and Sohail, 2017).
    4 Explanations specific to the labor share decline include an increase in firm-level volatility (Hartman-

Glaser, Lustig and Xiaolan, 2016), the treatment of intangible capital (Koh, Santaeulalia-Llopis and Zheng,
2015), the decline in the relative price of capital (Karabarbounis and Neiman, 2014), capital accumulation
(Piketty and Zucman, 2014), and import competition and globalization (Elsby, Hobijn and Sahin, 2013).

framework features a competitive setting, and thus generates an increasing concentration
without decreasing competition.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the data exploration,
where we conclude that firm aging is primarily responsible for the change in average firm
size, exit, and concentration. Section 3 develops the model and presents our theoretical
results. Section 4 reports the calibration and the fit along non-targeted moments. Section 5
discusses the sources of labor force growth and the decline of manufacturing employment.
Section 6 concludes.


2   Data
We obtain data on firms from the Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) produced by the US
Census Bureau. The BDS dataset has near universal coverage of private sector firms with
paid employees in the US from 1977-2014.
    We start by looking at the time series evolution of concentration, average firm size and
the aggregate exit rate in US data; see top panel of Figure 2. We measure concentration as
the share of employment by firms with 250+ employees. Figure 2 shows that concentration
in the US has increased from about 51% to 57%. Average firm size in the US has increased
steadily from about 20 employees to about 24 employees. The aggregate exit rate has
declined steadily from about 9.5 percentage points to about 7.5 percentage points.
    What is driving the aggregate trends? The bottom panel of Figure 2 shows concentra-
tion, average firm size and exit rates broken down by firm age over time. The figure shows
that, conditional on age, these variables have changed little. For example, a typical five
year old firm has the same size in 1980 and 2014, with no discernible trend. The same
pattern holds for concentration and exit rates: conditional on age, concentration and exit
rates do not exhibit a trend over the 1977-2014 time period. It follows that the aggregate
trends in concentration, average firm size and exit rates are not being driven by changes in
the corresponding variables within firm-age categories.
    The bottom panel of Figure 2 also shows how each variable evolves with firm age.
Concentration and average firm size increase with firm age. Firm exit rates decrease with
firm age. These patterns suggest that changes in the age composition of firms drive the
aggregate trend in each variable. In order to investigate this formally, we regress

size or firm exit rates. We start with a specification that features year with an intercept term.
The coefficient on year captures the aggregate trend in dependent variable. We then add
age controls and see how the year coefficient changes. For the average firm size and firm
exit rate regressions, we add further controls for sector and age-sector interaction effects in
successive specifications.5
   5 To protect the identity of firms, the Business Dynamics Statistics do not report data on share of employ-
ment by firm size, age and sector. Therefore, we cannot include controls for sector and age-sector interactions
in the concentration regression.

    We summarize our regression results here. (The regression tables are presented in Tables
4-6 in Appendix B.) When we regress the share of employment of firms size 250+ on year,
with no controls, we find that the trend coefficient is 0.3% per year. This coefficient captures
the average trend in share of employment across age groups and sectors. It is statistically
significant. Once we control for firm age, however, the trend disappears. The coefficients
on firm-age dummies indicate that the share of employment at 250+ firms is increasing
with firm age. The R2 of the concentration regression jumps from 0.08 in the no-controls
specification to 0.976 in the specification with age controls.
    The results for log average firm size are stronger. In the no-controls specification, we
find that the coefficient on year is positive, 0.6%, and statistically significant. Once we con-
trol for firm age, however, the year coefficient becomes negative, −0.5%, while remaining
statistically significant at the 1% level. The negative trend in average firm size remains
unchanged when we include controls for sector and age-sector interactions. The coefficient
on each age category is positive and statistically significant at the 1% level. As suggested
by the bottom panel of Figure 2, the coefficients increase with firm age. This is exactly the
pattern one would expect if firm aging was driving the increase in average firm size over
time. As firms age, they get larger. Therefore an increase in the share of older firms shifts
the composition towards larger firms, leading to an increase in average firm size in the
aggregate.
    The results for firm exit rate are similar to average firm size. The no-controls specifica-
tion indicates that firm exit rates decline by 0.15 percentage points every year. The addition
of firm-age controls brings the year-coefficient close to zero. The inclusion of sector and
age-sector controls leaves the coefficient unchanged. The age regressions confirm that older
firms exit at lower rates. It follows that an increase in the share of older firms will lead to
a decline in the aggregate exit rate.

    The regression results indicate that firm aging is the primary driver of the trends in
concentration, average firm size and exit rate. Figure 3 presents direct evidence that US
firms are aging. The figure shows that the share of firms aged 11+ has risen steadily from
32 percent in 1986 to 48 percent in 2014. Why are US firms aging? The next section presents
a firm dynamics model that shows how changes in population growth can generate firm
aging.


3    The Model
There is a single homogenous good and a fixed endowment of a resource (labor) Nt in-
elastically supplied that is also the numeraire. A production unit has production function
sit f (nit ) where sit corresponds to a productivity shock, that follows a Markov process with
conditional distribution F (st+1 |st ), independent across firms. In addition, production units
have a fixed cost c f denominated in units of labor. which can include an entrepreneur and
other labor overhead. If a production unit is shut down, its residual value is normalized to
zero. All agents in the economy have common discount factor β.
Assumption 1. The conditional distribution F is continuous and strictly decreasing in st .
   Let c (s, q) and π (s, p) denote cost and profit functions derived from the above technol-
ogy, where q is output and p the price of the good in terms of labor and let n (s, p) denote
labor demand. Assume the last two functions are continuous and strictly increasing in s
and p. The value of a production unit is given by the Bellman equation:

                        v (s, pt ) = max 0, π (s, pt ) + βEv s0 , pt+1 |s
                                                                         

    when confronted with a deterministic path of prices pt = { pτ }τ ≥t Here zero is the value
of exit while the right hand side under the maximization is the continuation value of this
productive unit. As shown in Hopenhayn (1992b), the value function is strictly increasing
in s and pt when nonzero. Letting

                         s∗t = inf s|π (s, pt ) + βEv s0 , pt+1 |s > 0 ,
                                                                 
                                                                                             (2)

a production unit is shut down iff s ≤ s∗t .
    The technology for entry of a new productive unit is as follows. Upon paying a cost
of entry of ce units of labor, the initial productivity is drawn from distribution G, indepen-
dently across entrants and time. Prior to entry, the expected value of an entrant net of the
entry cost                                  Z
                                ve (pt ) =    v (s, pt ) dG (s) − ce .                       (3)

                                                 9
Let µt denote the measure of productive units operating at time t, where for a fixed set A
of firm types, µt ( A) measures the magnitude of firms that at time t have sit ∈ A. Given an
initial measure µ0 , the exit thresholds s∗t together with entry flows mt determine uniquely
the sequence of measures {µt } as follows. For any set of productivities A, define recursively

                                      Z
                                                                 !       Z Z
            µ t +1 ( A ) = m t +1                       dG (s)       +                       dF (s| x ) dµ ( x )   (4)
                                          seA,s≥s∗t+1                          seA,s≥s∗t+1


The first term in the right hand side corresponds to entrants, excluding those that exit
immediately while the second term includes incumbents after the realization of new pro-
ductivities, excluding those that exit.


3.1   Equilibrium
           R
Let Mt = dµt (s) denote the total mass of firms. Denote by mt the mass of entrants at
time t. Labor market clearing requires that:
                              Z
                                    n (s, pt ) dµt (s) + Mt c f + mt ce = Nt .                                     (5)

The first term is productive labor demand, the second term overhead and the third labor
utilized for entry, e.g. entrepreneurs in startups. The right hand side represents total labor
inelastically supplied.
    An equilibrium for a given sequence { Nt } and given initial measure µ0 is given by
shutdown thresholds {s∗t } , mass of entrants {mt } , measures of production units {µt } and
prices pt = { pt } such that:

  1. Shutdown thresholds are given by equation (2);

  2. No rents for entrants: ve (pt ) ≤ 0 and ve (pt ) mt = 0;

  3. Market clearing condition (5) holds.

  4. The sequence µt is generated recursively by equation (4) given the initial measure µ0 .

Following Hopenhayn (1992b), there exists a unique equilibrium. It can be easily charac-
terized when entry is strictly positive in every period, that is in reality the relevant case.
Let p∗ be a constant price such that ve ( p∗ ) = 0 for all t. Under the above assumptions this
price is unique, corresponding to the stationary equilibrium price in Hopenhayn (1992b).
Let s∗t = s∗ be the corresponding shutdown threshold. Given the initial distribution µ0 we
derive recursively a sequence m∗t so that the market clearing condition is satisfied in every
period as follows.

                                                           10
    Let Sn denote the probability that an entrant survives at least n periods, i.e. that the state
siτ ≥ s∗ for ages τ from 0 to n. Let µ̃n denote the cross-sectional probability distribution of
productivities for production units in the age n cohort. These can be obtained recursively
as follows:

  1. Let S0 = (1 − G (s∗ )) and µ̃0 (ds) = G (ds) /S0 , that is the distribution for entrants
     draws G conditional on s0 ≥ s∗ .

   2. Let Sn = Sn−1 P (sn ≥ s∗ |sn−1 ) dµ̃n−1 (sn−1 ), where the term under the integral is the
                     R

       probability that a productive unit in cohort n − 1 is not shutdown in the next period,
       and let                               R
                                               P (dsn |sn−1 ) dµ̃n−1 (sn−1 )
                                  µ̃n (ds) =                                 .
                                                       Sn /Sn−1

Let ẽn = (n (s, p∗ ) + c f )dµ̃n , the average employment of a productive unit in the cohort
           R

of age n. Total employment of that cohort at time t depends on the original number of
entrants in that cohort and the survival rate, namely

                                         Etn = mt−n Sn ẽn

Thus at time t employment from incumbents (i.e. excluding new entrants) is given by
EtI = ∑1t Etn . Adding the employment of entrants mt (S0 ẽ0 + ce ) we get the market clearing
condition:
                                 Nt = mt (S0 ẽ0 + ce ) + EtI .                             (6)

   This determines implicitly mt , the only unknown in the above equation at time t. Pro-
vided that EtI < Nt , entry will be strictly positive in every period and all equilibrium
conditions are satisfied. Assuming Nt is an increasing sequence, a sufficient condition for
positive entry every period is that Nt − EtI+1 > 0. Note that

                        Nt = mt ce + mt S0 ẽ0 + mt−1 S1 ẽ1 + ... + m0 St ẽt
                      EtI+1 = mt S1 ẽ1 + mt−1 S2 ẽ2 + ... + m0 St+1 ẽt+1 ,

so EtI+1 is the inner product of the same vector of the mass of entrants with a forward shift
in the corresponding terms Sn ẽn and excluding entry costs. Thus a sufficient condition for
entry to be positive every period is that the term Sn ẽn decreases with n. This condition says
that, adjusting for differences in entry rates, the total employment of a cohort is decreasing
in age. Survival rates are decreasing in n by definition but average size of a cohort, if
properly calibrated to the data, is increasing. Thus shutdown rates must be sufficiently
high to offset the latter growth. In the model, this is a property that depends on the

                                                 11
stochastic process for the shocks sit and the threshold s∗ . But given these parameters its
easy to verify.6
Proposition 1. Suppose that Nt is a nondecreasing sequence and Sn ẽn is non-increasing. Then the
unique equilibrium has constant price pt = p∗ and exit thresholds s∗t = s∗ .
Corollary 1. Under the Assumptions of Proposition 1, exit rates and average firm size, by cohorts
are time invariant.
    This Corollary implies that changes in aggregate entry and exit rates as well as average
firm size will be driven only by changes in firm demographics, the age distribution of firms
and the rate of increase in population.


3.2    The Turnover of Production Units
In this section we examine the determinants of aggregate rates of entry and exit and in
particular the role of firm demographics, i.e. the age distribution of production units.
    Total exit ξ t at time t is the sum of exit masses of different age cohorts. Exit of productive
units of age n equals the difference in survival rates between Sn−1 − Sn multiplied by the
size of that cohort, that is the entry mass at the time that cohort entered, mt−n . We follow
here the convention that the age at which a unit is shut down corresponds to the age
at which this unit was last productive. As for the new entrants, while the model allows
for immediate exit we will consider that mt S0 is in practice the measure of entry in this
economy and thus exclude mt (1 − S0 ) from total exits. It follows that

                                               t
                                       ξt =   ∑ m t − n ( S n −1 − S n )
                                              n =1

The number of firms at t − 1 is given by:

                                                      t
                                         Mt − 1 =    ∑ m t − n S n −1
                                                     n =1

Letting αtn denote the share of units of age n in the total population of productive units
at time t and hn−1 = (Sn−1 − Sn )/Sn−1 the hazard rate of exit of units of age n − 1, the
aggregate exit rate ξ t /Mt−1 can be expressed as the weighted average of different cohort
hazard rates of exit
                                                      t
                                     ξ t /Mt−1 =     ∑ αt−1,n−1 hn−1.
                                                     n =1
   6 Models  that assume permanent productivity shocks and exogenous exit trivially satisfy this condition as
well as the technology in Mortensen and Pissarides (1994) where productivity shocks are redrawn with some
probability from the same distribution as entrants.

                                                      12
Taking these hazard rates as fixed, this is only a function of the age distribution of produc-
tive units, which in turn is determined by past entry rates. The exception of course is when
exit rates are the same for all cohorts in which case firm demographics plays no role.
    Consider now entry rates.7 Let et = Nt /Mt . It follows that the rate of growth in the
number of firms
                                        Mt      Nt et−1
                                             =           .                                 (7)
                                      Mt − 1   Nt−1 et
Now the mass of productive units can be decomposed in incumbents that survived plus
entrants. Letting St denote the average survival rate from t − 1 to t, it follows that

                                         M t = S t M t − 1 + m t S0

Substituting from Mt in (7) gives the following expression for the entry rate:

                                            m t S0    Nt et−1
                                     λt =          =          − St                                      (8)
                                            Mt − 1   Nt−1 et

In the special case where average employment is constant, this equation reduces to

                                              Nt − Nt−1    ξt
                                       λt =             +
                                                 Nt−1     Mt − 1
   so the entry rate equals the sum of the population growth rate and the exit rate; as
average firm size is constant, the total mass of firms needs to grow at the rate of population
growth to clear the market. Entry rate must be enough to replace the exiting units and in
addition create this extra employment. This justifies the above formula.
   In a balanced growth path where population grows at a constant rate, cohort entry
weights decay as a function of age at this rate and average firm size is constant. More
precisely, if Nt+1 /Nt = γ, then

                                                ∞
                                     Nt = mt    ∑ γ−n Sn ẽn + mt ce

   7 We are defining as mt S0 as “measured entry”. Had we assumed that all entrants must remain at least one
period in the market, then S0 = 1 so mt would then be measured entry.

    Which is independent of t and so is the entry rate. The same holds in a model where
productivity shocks are fully persistent or randomly redrawn from the same distribution as
the one faced by entrants (as in Mortensen and Pissarides), average firm size is constant so
the above formula applies. In particular this means that the rate of entry is independent of
history and only depends on current population growth. If exit rates are not age dependent,
the same will also be true for exit.
    More generally, exit rates will depend on the age distribution of firms and thus the
history of past entry. As conditional exit rates are decreasing in age, a larger share of
young firms will be associated with higher exit rates and consequently higher entry. In
addition, changes in average firm size will impact entry rates. A rise in entry rates will
increase the share of younger productive units which tend to be smaller. This should lower
average firm size, and from equation (8) increase the rate of entry. Thus a rise in population
growth will lead to increased entry rates over and above those needed to accommodate the
increase in the labor force. This multiplier effect will operate similarly in the opposite
direction when facing a decrease in the rate of growth in the labor force. Our main result
is stated below.

Theorem 1. Assume conditional exit rates (Sn−1 − Sn )/Sn−1 are decreasing in age, and average
firm size ẽn is increasing in age. An increase (decrease) in the rate of growth of the labor force will
result in an increase (decrease) of entry rates over and beyond the rate of increase (decrease) in the
labor force.


3.3   Temporary Increase in Population Growth
The results described in the previous section can be illustrated in the face of a temporary
increase in the growth rate of the labor force. Suppose initially the labor force is stationary.
It then grows at a constant rate γ for T periods to then return indefinitely to its initial zero
level. The rate of exit is exogenous, so Sn = (1 − δ)n and average firm size ẽn increases with
the age of the cohort at rate g, so ẽn = (1 + g)n where 0 < g < δ. At the original steady
state there is a mass M0 if firms, so m = δM0 and average firm size is e0 = δẽ0 / (δ − g). For

4    Quantitative Analysis
The quantitative exercise is as follows. We assume the US economy was in a stationary
equilibrium before the 1940s. We then feed the time series of the civilian labor force growth
rate in the data, starting in 1940, through the model economy. We calibrate the model such
that the model-implied time series match the data in 1978. This calibration strategy allows
us to capture the effects of the rise and the fall in the labor force on firm demographics,
without requiring firm-level data from the 1940s.


Functional forms. The production function of a firm is f (s, n) = snα , where 0 < α < 1
captures decreasing returns to scale at the firm level. Firm productivity follows an AR(1)
process:
                  log(st+1 ) = µs + ρ log(st ) + ε t+1 ;  ε t+1 ∼ N (0, σε2 )          (9)

with ρ as the persistence, µs as the drift and σε2 as the variance of shocks. The distribution
of startup productivities G is lognormal with mean s0 and variance σε2 /(1 − ρ2 ). We allow
overhead labor to increase linearly with firm size, c f (n) = c f a + c f b n. This specification
captures the intuitive idea that overhead labor increases with the number of production
workers in the firm.


Calibration. The model period is set to one year. The time discount factor is β = 0.96,
which implies an annual interest rate of 4%. The worker’s share of output, α, is set to the
standard value of 0.64. The steady-state labor force growth rate g is set to the standard
value of one percent.
    The parameters ce , c f a , c f b , µs , ρ, σε and s0 need to be calibrated. The entry cost pa-
rameter ce is set such that p∗ = 1. As discusssed in Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993),
normalizing the equilibrium price gets around the identification problem that arises be-
cause price and the idiosyncratic shock enter the firm’s objective function multiplicatively.
The remaining parameters are calibrated to match the startup rate in 1978, average startup
size in the sample, average firm size in 1978, unconditional 5-year firm exit rates and con-
ditional 5-year firm growth rates.



                                                            15
    We target the startup rate in 1978 in order to have a common starting point for the time
series of the startup rate in the model and the data. We can then evaluate model perfor-
mance by comparing how the two series evolve over the subsequent years. Average startup
size in the data has changed little over time, so we target its sample average. Average
startup size in the model is constant over time. It is determined primarily by the mean of
the startup distribution, s0 . The dispersion of the productivity process affects the weight
on productivity gridpoints where firms exit, so it primarily targets the 5-year exit rate. As
with the startup rate, the average firm size in 1978 is targeted because we use 1978 as the
common starting point for the model. The persistence parameter ρ determines how quickly
firms grow, so we use it to target the 5-year growth rate of firms. The operating cost in-
tercept parameter c f a enters into the firm size calculation and plays an important role in
determining average firm size. The operating cost slope parameter c f b plays an important
role in matching labor productivity dispersion, and so we set it to match the Olley Pakes
labor productivity covariance reported in Bartelsman, Haltiwanger and Scarpetta (2013).

Results. Table 1 shows how well the model matches the calibration targets. The parsimo-
nious model does a good job of matching the targets.
    Figure 4 shows how the model generated time series for the startup rate compares to
the startup rate in the data. The figure includes the growth rate of the civilian labor force
in the data that is fed through the model. The rise and fall of labor force growth is evident

                                               16
in the inverse U-shape observed in the data, with the peak around 1978. The startup rate
follows the same inverse-U pattern. We are calibrating the model to 1978 only, so there is
no apriori reason why the startup rate in the data for other years should match the model-
implied series. As the figure shows, the model does an excellent job of matching key
features of the data. The model generates the steady decline in the startup rate observed
since the 1980s. The startup rate in the data declined from 14.52% to 7.67%, whereas the
startup rate in the model declined from 14.73% to 7.97%. Therefore the model generates
almost all of the decline observed in the data.
    The recent literature on the business startup rate focuses on the steady decline observed
in the data since 1978. As Figure 4 shows, the decline was preceded by an increase in the
startup rate. The data exhibit a steady increase in the startup rate from 1950 to 1978.8 The
model generates the increase in the startup rate observed in the data. The civilian labor
force growth rate spiked during World War II. Figure 4 shows that there was a correspond-
ing spike in startup rate in both the model and the data. The ability of the calibrated model
to match both the long term trends and short term fluctuations indicates that the central
role of changes in the labor force growth rate in the evolution of the startup rate.

   The startup rate declined by roughly 6 percentage points from its peak in 1978 to the
2010s. However, the labor force growth rate in the data declined by roughly 2 percentage
points over the same time period. By the accounting identity (1), the remaining 4 percentage

Figures 5a and 5b compare the model generated time series to the data. Figure 5a shows
that the model does an excellent job of matching the decline in exit rates observed in the
data since 1978. Figure 5b shows that average firm size increases in the model similar to
the amount in the data, though with a bit of overshooting.

   Table 2 presents exit rate and average firm size by firm age. Overall the model does
an excellent job matching average exit rate by firm age. This is perhaps not very surpris-
ing, given that we are calibrating to the 5-year unconditional exit rate. The model slightly
undershoots average firm size for younger firms and overshoots for older firms. The un-
dershooting and overshooting is coming from a higher growth rate in the model than in


                                                                     18
the data. In the data, firm growth exhibits a discontinuity: the growth rate of 0-year old
firms is almost twice that of 1-year olds, but the growth rate of 1-year olds is only slightly
higher than 2-year olds. This discontinuity is absent in the model, so the model overshoots
firm growth rates.
    Given that the model does a good job of matching firm exit rates and average firm size
by age, the ability of the model to match the change in the aggregate time series of these
variables depends on how well it matches firm aging. Figure 6 shows the model generates
similar aging as that observed in the data. The share of 11+ firms in the data increased by
17 percentage points in the data and by 13 percentage points in the model. The aging of
the firms in the model is driven by the change in labor force growth: as the rate of labor
force growth declines, the startup rate declines and the firm-age distribution shifts towards
older firms.

Concentration. We documented in Section 2 that firm aging is an important driver of
the recent increase in firm concentration observed in the US. Because the calibrated model
replicates the pattern of firm aging in the data, we ask whether the model can also gener-
ate an increase in firm concentration. We use two different measures of firm concentration.
Concentration by size is the share of employment in firms with 250+ employees. Concen-
tration by age is the share of employment in firms aged 11+. Because age and size are
correlated, we expect the two measures to exhibit similar patterns. Figures 7a and 7b show

the cumulative change in concentration by size and age in the model and the data. The
data on concentration by age starts in 1987 because we cannot identify firms aged 11+ in
the data before that year. As the figures show, the model does an excellent job of matching
the increase in concentration by both size and age.
   We decompose the cumulative change in concentration in the model into age-size cat-
egories. Table 3 compares the model to the data. The model matches a key feature of the
data: concentration is primarily about firm age. Young firms have a lower employment
share in both the model and the data, regardless of size. Similarly, mature firms have a
higher employment share regardless of size. The model does an excellent job of matching
the magnitudes of the decline in the employment share by age-size categories.

Aggregate labor share. A recent literature documents that the aggregate labor in the US
has declined since the 1980s; see e.g. Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014). Autor, Dorn, Katz,
Patterson and Van Reenen (2017) use Census data to document that firm-level labor shares
are negatively related to firm size. Our model generates this negative relationship because
of overhead labor.
    A firm’s labor share can be broken down into the share of value added paid to produc-
tion workers and to overhead labor. In equilibrium, the share paid to production workers
is equal to α for all firms. Therefore, all differences in firm level labor shares are due to
the share paid to overhead labor. If we multiply and divide the share of overhead labor by
the wage bill of production workers, wni , the firm-level labor share depends on the ratio of
overhead labor to production employment. We have

                                                  wc f i        cfi

                       Firm i’s labor share = α +        = α 1+                           (10)

The ratio of overhead labor to production employment declines with firm size in the cali-
brated model. By (10), it follows that firm-level labor shares decline with firm size. Firm
age and firm size are positively correlated in the model. Therefore, an aging firm distribu-
tion increases the weight of larger firms, those with lower labor shares, leading to a decline
in the aggregate labor share.
    Figure 8a plots the cumulative change in the aggregate labor share in the model and the
data. The aggregate labor share in the model is measured as the sum of firm-level labor
shares, weighted by the value-added weight of the firm. Quantitatively, the model does
an excellent job of matching the decline in the aggregate labor share. The labor share in
the data declines by 6 percentage points, while that in the model declines by 5 percentage
points.
    The aggregate labor share satisfies a relationship similar to (10). We can rewrite that
relationship to express the aggregate labor share as a function of the ratio of overhead to
total employment. We have
                                                                           !

                                                   1−   Total employment


Because α does not change over time, the decline in the aggregate labor share in the model
is entirely due to a decline in the overhead to total employment ratio. To the extent that
our mechanism is driving the labor share decline observed in the data, we should observe
a similar decline in the overhead to employment ratio in the data. Consistent with our
mechanism, Figure 8b shows that the ratio of nonproduction workers to total employment

in the data has declined by about 6 pp. The labor share in the data also declined by 6 pp,
indicating that the majority of the labor share decline is because of a decline in the ratio of
nonproduction workers to total employment.


4.2        Exploring the Mechanism: Counterfactuals
Firm demographics and the initial rise of labor force growth each have important quanti-
tative roles in producing the benchmark results. Firm demographics generates a feedback
effect. If older firms are larger and exit at a lower rate, the aging generated by an initial
drop in the startup rate will lead to lower exit and higher average firm size, which de-
creases the startup rate further. The initial rise in labor force growth generates an increase
in entry, which is followed by an expansion of the pool of incumbents. As labor force
growth slows down, incumbent growth exceeds labor force growth, leaving less room for
new firms. We explore the quantitative effect of each of these amplifying forces by shutting
each individually and recalibrating the model.
    In the first counterfactual, we shut down firm demographics by shutting down the i.i.d.
shock process. This is done by setting µs = 0, ρ = 1 and σε = 0. The resulting transition
matrix is the identity matrix, F = I, implying that the productivity of a firm equals its
productivity drawn at birth. Firms do not grow or shrink in this economy, and therefore
do not exhibit differences in average firm size or exit rates across age groups.9 In the second
   9 We generate exit in this economy by assuming that all firms exit at a constant rate δ. We calibrate δ and
mean of startup productivity distribution s0 to match the startup rate and the average firm size in 1978. All
other parameters, except ce , equal their benchmark values. As in the benchmark, the entry cost ce is set such
that p∗ = 1. The calibrated parameter values are δ = 12.02%, s0 = −3.63 and ce = 0.


                                                                       22
counterfactual, we shut down the rise in labor force growth that preceded the decline. We
do this by assuming the economy is at a stationary equilibrium in 1977, effectively assuming
a constant labor force growth and startup rate pre-1978.

                           Figure 9: Entry Rate Counterfactuals

   Figure 9 plots the startup rate counterfactuals along the benchmark and data. Shutting
down the pre-1978 rise in labor force growth reduces the 6 percent entry rate decline to a 4
percent decline. Therefore the pre-1978 rise of labor force growth amplifies the decline of
the entry rate by about 50 percent. Shutting down firm demographics reduces the entry rate
decline to only 2 percentage points. Therefore, firm demographics triples the magnitude of
the decline of the entry rate.


5     Discussion
In this section we discuss the sources of labor force growth and the decline of manufactur-
ing employment.


5.1   Sources of Labor Force Growth
What explains the rise and fall of labor force growth? To answer this question, we decom-
pose labor force growth into each of its components. We start from the BLS’ definition of
labor force,

Labor Forcet = Civilian Noninstitutional Population Age 16 And Overt × Participation Ratet .


                                                23
                     Figure 10: Decomposition of Labor Force Growth


   It follows that labor force growth rate is the sum of the growth rate of each component,

               LF Growth Ratet = CNP16 Growth Ratet + PR Growth Ratet .

   We can further decompose CNP16 growth rate at time t into the birth rate at time t − 16
and a residual term Othert

                      CNP16 Growth Ratet = Birth Ratet−16 + Othert ,

where the Other term includes death rates, net migration rates, and rates of entry and exit
into institutional status. Figure 10 plots labor force growth rate for each decade, dividing
the bars into the percentage contribution of birth rates, growth rate of participation rates,
and other. The decomposition shows that birth rates sixteen years prior account for the
bulk of changes in labor force growth, accounting for an average of 64 percent of the labor
force growth rate across decades.
    The actual contribution of the birth rate to labor force growth is likely higher than
64 percent because the birth rate also has an effect on participation rates. For example, an
important fraction of the decline of participation rates since the year 2000 is due to the baby
boomer generation reaching the age of 55 and over, whose age group has low participation
rates.

5.2    Manufacturing
Manufacturing has experienced overall negative employment growth since the 1980s (Fort,
Pierce and Schott, 2018). This raises the possibility that an exodus of workers from man-
ufacturing into non-manufacturing reverses the trend of declining employment growth of
non-manufacturing sectors. Figure 11 shows that this is not the case. Non-manufacturing
employment growth follows a similar rise and fall pattern as total employment growth.




                                       Figure 11: Growth Rates
Sources. Current Population Survey and Current Employment Statistics.
Notes. Manufacturing employment data starts in 1947. Decade cutoffs are chosen so that full business cycles
fall within the decade bin, effectively capturing the trend component in employment growth.


   The decline of manufacturing employment does not have a large effect on non-manufacturing
employment growth partly because the flow of workers out of manufacturing is small com-
pared to the flows of workers entering the labor force. From 1977 to 2014, manufacturing
employment shrank by 7.12 million workers while the labor force grew by 56.91 million
and total employment grew by 54.29 million workers.


6     Conclusion
Recent decades have witnessed an increase of concentration, a decline in firm entry rates,
and a decline of the aggregate labor share. We show that the interplay of population and
firm demographics can account for much of these trends. We study the transitional dy-
namics generated by feeding observed labor force growth rates through a standard general
equilibrium firm dynamics model. We emphasize the role of firm demographics as well as


                                                    25
the role of the rise of labor force from the 1940s to 1970s in amplifying susbsequent changes
in aggregate trends. Overall, our paper provides a unified quantitative explanation for a
set of apparently disparate trends.

Civilian Labor Force Growth Rate 1940-2014. We obtain civilian labor force data from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Current Population Survey for the years 1947 to 2014, and
from Lebergott (1964) from 1940 to 1946. The civilian labor force definition in BLS includes
population 16 years of age and over while in Lebergott the definition includes population
14 years of age and over. We can use Lebergott’s series from 1947 to 1960 to compare the
difference in growth rates using either definition. Figure 12 shows that the labor force
growth rates of ages 14+ and 16+ are nearly identical.

Firm-level data 1978-2014. Data to calculate firm-level data comes from the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS). The BDS dataset has near universal coverage
of private sector firms with paid employees. BDS data starts in 1977, but best practice
suggests dropping 1977 and 1978 due to suspected measurement error (e.g. Moscarini and
Postel-Vinay, 2012). We drop 1977, but keep 1978, as calibrating to 1978 or 1979 does not
affect our quantitative results (the model matches the startup rate in both 1978 and 1979
almost exactly).

Firm Entry Rates 1940-1962. The firm entry rate from 1940 to 1962 is obtained from the
now-discountinued U.S. Department of Commerce’s Survey of Current Business. The entry
rate is ’New Businesses’ divided by ’Operating Businesses’. The 1963 edition was the
last one to report a ’Business Population and Turnover’ section. From 1963, the Survey
of Current Business reported instead ’Business Incorporations’, which only include stock
corporations. All nonfarm businesses are included, regardless of size.
