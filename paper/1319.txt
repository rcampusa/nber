     Optimal Price Adjustment with Time—Dependent Costs


                              ABSTRACT




    The purpose of this paper is to analyze an optimal pricing rule for the

case in which the costs of price adjustment are time dependent, and where

those costs depend positively on the magnitude of the percentage price

change. By means of discrete time model, it is shown that the optimal

response to the problem under consideration is to pre—set prices for each

period at the end of the previous period. Within the period prices will

adjust if the unexpected shock exceeds a threshold level. En such a case the

new price is established at a level that is a weighted average of the pre—set

level and of the equilibrium level that would have obtained in the absence of

costs of contemporaneous price adjustment. Under certain conditions, which

are derived in the paper, higher volatility of unexpected inflation might

reduce relative price volatility.

1.   Introduction and Summary



     In a recent paper Sheshinski and Weiss (1983) have analyzed the optimal

price adjustment rule for a producer having market power and facing a fixed

cost of price adjustment. Their contribution has demonstrated that the

adjustment rule is of the (S, s) type, and that higher volatility of inflation

would accompany a higher volatility of relative prices. The purpose of the

present paper is to analyze optimal pricing rules for the case where the costs

of price adjustment are time dependent, and where those costs depend

positively on the magnitude of the percentage price change. Two economic

considerations motivate these modifications. First, we expect that the cost

of an unexpected price adjustment would exceed that of a price adjustment that

is anticipated well ahead of time, because in the latter case more time is

available to adjust plans. Next, as Rotemberg (1982) has argued '...under

imperfect information consumers will tend to cater to firms with relatively

stable price paths and avoid those firms which change their prices often and

by large amounts...". Thus, the presumption is that consumers benefit from a

more stable price structure. We capture this notion by imposing costs of

price adjustment that depend on the magnitude of the price change.

     Rotemberg (1982) and Sheshinski and Weiss (1983) postulate costs of price

adjustment that are time independent. This paper modifies their analysis by

assessing how time—dependent costs of price adjustment modify the pricing

behavior of a producer. By means of a discrete time model, is shown that for

the case analyzed in the paper optimal behavior requires pre—setting prices

for each period at their certainty—equivalence level. Within the period,



                                     —1—
prices will adjust if the unexpected price—level change exceeds a threshold

value. When this happens, the price moves to a level that corresponds to a

weighted average of the pre—set prices and the price that would have obtained

in the absence of costs of contemporaneous price adjustment. The weights and

the threshold value justifying price adjustment have a simple representation

as functions of the underlying parameters. Unlike the case analyzed by

Sheshinski and Weiss (1983), under certain conditions higher volatility of

unexpected inflation might reduce relative price volatility.1 Necessary

conditions are high volatility of inflation and small marginal costs of price

adjustment.

      The analysis also demonstrates that the elasticity of price volatility

with respect to inflation volatility exceeds one. The reason for both results

is that higher inflation volatility leads to more frequent contemporaneous

price adjustment.

      The paper is organized in the following manner. Section 2 describes the

model, Section 3 derives the optimal pricing rule. Section 4 offers

concluding remarks. The Appendix summarizes the notation used in the paper.



2. The Model

      Starting with the case in which prices are fully flexible provides us

with a benchmark for subsequent discussion. Flexible prices occur if the cost

of contemporaneous price changes is nil, and if consumers attach no value to

price stability. Consider in such an economy a producer of good x facing a

demand for his product given by


                    P
(1)
                    Pt

                                      —2—
where         and       correspond to the price level and the price of good x in

period t. The producer is facing a given price level. To simplify

exposition, the analysis is conducted for the case where marginal costs of

production are zero. The approach described In the paper can be applied also

for the case where labor Is a variable input.

      Direct optimization reveals that the equilibrium price is given by:


              *     -            A
(2)
             p=p+in
where lower case letters (p, ) denote the logarithms of P, P                   ,   and

stands for the equilibrium price. Let                     denote real profits that correspond

to the optimal price p •             If   the producer charges price P instead of

p ,   profits     can be approximated by


                         *
                                     —    *2
(3)          ir(p) =    111 — r2(t        p)

where it2   corresponds to the absolute value of the second term of the Taylor
expansion of real profits around p             •      From eq. 1 we obtain that:


                             2
()


      We   would like to introduce price rigidity by using a modified version of

Rotetnberg's (1982) framework. Like Rotemberg, we assume two types of costs.

One is a fixed cost per price change, denoted by c. The other is a cost that

relates to the reputation of the seller. The presumption is that consumers



                                                   —3--
benefit from a more stable price structure. We capture this notion by

Imposing a cost that is quadratic in the percentage change of prices. Unlike

Rotemberg (1982) and SheshInski and Weiss (1983), we assume that costs of

price adjustment are time dependent. The presumption is that changes in

prices that are known well ahead of time would impose lesser adjustment costs

than unexpected, last minute changes because in the former case there is more

time to adjust plans. This assumption is a natural extension of the notion

that unexpected inflation imposes higher adjustment costs and welfare loss

than anticipated inflation.

    A simple way of introducing these considerations               iS to    assume that price

changes for period t are costless if they are made ahead of time (i.e., before

period t). Price changes impose costs if they are made within the period (at

time t), because they can not be foreseen (at time t1).

     In such an environment the producer pre—sets prices for period t at the

end of period t-1, at a (logarithmic) level p .                Under certain conditions he

would change prices within the period to p .                 Deriving optimal p and
Is the topic of Section 3.         Let Pt denote the actual price of x in period t,

and R(p) the real profits that correspond to price Pt .                     We    assume that



                    =
                         *

     The specification of R(p) is a key step in our discussion. If the price

of x does not adjust within the period, it will deviate by                         —     from    the

price that maximizes real profits in a flexible equilibrium case. Thus, we



                                               —4—
can use equation 3 to find that profits are given by ir(p°). Had the price

adjusted within the period to p , under a flexible equilibrium profits would

be rr(p').      Because within—the—period price adjustment imposes costs, we

should adjust profits rr(p) by the costs of price adjustment. Those costs

are the fixed cost, c, and depend also on the magnitude of the percentage

change. This is captured by the quadratic term (p0 —       p')2   where

 I p —   p    corresponds to the percentage change of the price of x relative to

its pre—set level. In the next Section we derive the properties of

3. Optimal Pricing Policy



      Optimal pricing policy should provide us with three rules: the optimal

price to change if we decide to make a price adjustment within the period

 (p); the switching conditions under which we would update prices within the

period; and the optimal pre—set price (p). We derive the policy in three

corresponding steps. First, for a given p we derive optimal p .            Next,
for a given p and the corresponding optimal value of p we find the

conditions under which we would decide to update the price of x within the

period (optimal switching rule). Lastly, subject to optimal p and the

optimal switching rule, we find the optimal value of p° •     We   then use the

optimal pricing rule to study the properties of the resulting variances of the
         4i
absolutYEi relative prices of x.

      Consider first the case in which for a given p° we decide to change the

price of x within the period to p .      We   would set p so as to maximize the

resulting profits, R(p).       This is achieved if (see equation 5)

      The new price corresponds to a weighted average of the pre—set and the

flexible prices. Higher costs of marginal price adjustment Cd c > 0) would

shift the resulting price closer to the pre—set level, whereas greater profits

loss due to divergence form the flexible equilibrium would shift prices closer

to the equilibrium.

      Next, notice that we would adjust prices contemporaneously if

obtained in equation 8 and the value of p9 in equation 69 we get from

equation 5 that expected profits are:

We pre—set the price (p°) so as to maximize expected profits. Notice that

optimization of equation 12 reveals that whenever c follows a symmetrical



                                                        —7—
distribution, the optimal choice of p° is at its "certainty equivalent"

value, such that          =   0,   i.e.




(13)
             p Eti

        Optimal choice of the pre—set price implies that the switching rule

(equation 8) is given by




(8')
                                      > k.




        The price of x for period t is pre—set at the end of the previous period

at its certainty—equivalence level (i.e., at the level that would maximize

profits if the value of c is zero). If the unexpected price level change

exceeds a threshold value,2 the price of x adjusts within the period to level

 p' .     The threshold value depends positively on the cost of within—the—period

price adjustment (both the fixed and the marginal cost). It depends

negatively on a measure of the cost of price divergence from its optimal value



        We can now derive a measure of unexpected relative price adjustment.

From equations 6, 8' we obtain that:




                                                  —             IcI < k

                                                       to   if k t I >k.


                                                 —8—
        If the price of x is pre—set, the shock to the relative price Is equal to

the aggregate price level shock. Allowing the price of x to adjust within the

period cushions the shock to relative prices by



(15)          1 —w =w


The greater is the cost of price divergence (112)                         and the lower the marginal

cost of price adjustment, the greater the cushioning effect. To assess how

higher unexpected inflation volatility affects relatIve prIce volatIlIty let

us impose further structure on the model by assuming that c follows a normal

distribution. Let          4(c)    and c) denote the standard normal density

                                                                         y ay
function and cumulative distribution of c, and V                          ,       denote the variance

and standard deviation of y. From equation 14 we obtain that the volatility

of relative prices is:



(16) V        =
                  E1[{p—      i - Et_i(p                      = V•      [H(z) +   {i   -



where       z =   k/cy,   11(z) = 1—2   •
                                            't'(—z) — 2   •   z   •




       A higher volatility of unexpected inflation (dV > 0) has two opposite

effects. The direct effect increases relative price volatility at the rate of

the increase in inflation volatility. At the same time, however, higher

inflation volatility implies that the price of x would adjust more frequently

within the period (i.e., more frequently                              > k).   Because such an

adjustment cushions the shock to relative prices, higher inflation volatility

would indirectly work to reduce volatility. In terms of equatIon 16,



                                                  —9—
                                                                    dH(z)
dV > 0 would reduce the expression in the brackets [notice that       dz
                                                                            > ,
  c
and that 0 < 11(z) < 1J. From equation 16 we obtain that



           ____   =        + jH(z) -    z2.(41z}{1     -
                                                           2}
It can be shown that3



(18)        z2.(—4'(z) ) < H(z)        if   z > 1.36




             z .(—4,'(z)) > 11(z)   if z < 1,36.



       Thus, for stable economies the effect of higher inflation volatility on

relative price volatility is unambiguously positive, (i.e., If a < k/1e36).

This Is because the direct volatility effect dominates the cushioning effect

of more frequent price adjustment. In terms of equation 17, both terms are

positives For economies where the volatility of inflation is high enough,

however, the second term in equation 17 is negative (i.e., If a > k/1,36).

Under certain conditions it might even dominate the first term, resulting In a

region where a higher inflation volatility accompanies a lower relative price

volatility. To obtain this result the cushioning effect w of price

adjustment should be adequately powerful. Inspection of equation 17 reveals

that higher unexpected inflation volatility would reduce relative price

volatility if and only if both the marginal cost of price adjustment are small

enough, and the inflation rate is sufficiently volatile.4

       Using equations 6, 8' we can obtain also that price volatility Is given

by:5

higher rate because higher inflation volatility justifies more frequent price

                                  4.   Concluding Remarks



       Our discussion demonstrates that considering the possibility of time

dependent costs of price adjustment allows us to focus on the cushioning

effect of within—the period price adjustment. This effect reduces the

magnitude of relative price volatility. Under certain conditions it might

result in a drop in relative price volatility as a result of higher inflation

volatility. These conditions seem restrictive enough to prevent aggregate

analysis from revealing the importance of the cushioning effect. Our analysis

suggests that the price behavior will vary across economies and sectors

according to the degree of competition, the costs of price adjustment, the

volatility of the inflationary process.

     inflation see Cukierman (1983). For an analysis of sticky prices due to

     time—independent fixed costs of adjustment see also Mussa (1981).



2. Such a pricing rule is similar to the ad hoc pricing rules applied

     previously in a macro context by Alzenman (1984) and McCallum (1977).

     Unlike those previous papers, In the present context the pricing rule is

     derived explicitly using an optimizing procedure.



3. Let us denote by a, b the points on the real plain defined by

      (-z, 4,(z)), (z, z)). Direct inspection reveals that H(z) is the area

     bounded below the standard normal density function and above the line that

     passes points a and b. z2'(—z) is the area of a triangle defined by the

     two tangents to 4(z) at points a and b, and by the line that passes

     points a, b. Due to the shape of the normal density function,

      H >      q'(—z) for large z, and H <          •
                                                         4'(—z) for small z.   It turns

     out that H = z2   •
                           4'(—z)      for z     1.36.
