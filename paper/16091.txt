Overborrowing, Financial Crises and 'Macro-prudential' Taxes

                                              ABSTRACT

An equilibrium model of financial crises driven by Irving Fisher’s financial amplification mechanism
features a pecuniary externality, because private agents do not internalize how the price of assets used
for collateral respond to collective borrowing decisions, particularly when binding collateral constraints
cause asset fire-sales and lead to a financial crisis. As a result, agents in the competitive equilibrium
borrow “too much” ex ante, compared with a financial regulator who internalizes the externality. Quantitative
analysis calibrated to U.S. data shows that average debt and leverage are only slightly larger in the
competitive equilibrium, but the incidence and magnitude of financial crises are much larger. Excess
asset returns, Sharpe ratios and the price of risk are also much larger, and the distribution of returns
displays endogenous fat tails. State-contingent taxes on debt and dividends of about 1 and -0.5 percent
on average respectively support the regulator’s allocations as a competitive equilibrium.

1     Introduction

    A common argument in narratives of the causes of the 2008 global financial crisis is
that economic agents “borrowed too much.” The notion of “overborrowing,” however, is
often vaguely defined or presented as a value judgment, in light of the obvious fact that a
prolonged credit boom ended in collapse. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to answer
two key questions: First, is overborrowing a significant macroeconomic problem, in terms of
causing financial crises and driving macro dynamics during both ordinary business cycles and
crises episodes? Second, are the so-called “macro-prudential” policies that are being widely
adopted in response to the crisis effective to contain overborrowing and reduce financial
fragility, and if so what ought to be their main quantitative characteristics?
    In this paper, we propose answers to these questions based on the quantitative predic-
tions of a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of asset prices and business cycles
with credit frictions. We adopt an explicit definition of overborrowing and use quantitative
methods to determine how much overborrowing the model predicts and how it affects busi-
ness cycles, financial crises, and social welfare. We also show that there are state-contingent
schedules of taxes on debt and dividends that can eliminate the overborrowing problem, and
provide an analysis of their quantitative features.
    Our definition of overborrowing is in line with the one used elsewhere in the literature
(e.g. Lorenzoni, 2008, Korinek, 2009, Bianchi, 2011): The difference between the amount of
credit that an agent obtains acting atomistically in an environment with a given set of credit
frictions, and the amount obtained by a social planner, or financial regulator, who faces
similar frictions but internalizes the general-equilibrium effects of its borrowing decisions. In
the model, the credit friction is in the form of a collateral constraint on debt and working
capital financing that has two important features. First, it introduces an externality that
drives a wedge between the marginal costs and benefits of borrowing considered by individual
agents and those faced by the regulator. Second, when the constraint binds, it triggers Irving
Fisher’s classic debt-deflation financial amplification mechanism, which causes a financial
crisis via a nonlinear feedback loop between asset fire sales and borrowing ability.
    The model’s collateral constraint limits private agents not to borrow more than a fraction
of the market value of assets they can offer as collateral, which take the form of an asset
in fixed aggregate supply. Private agents take the price of this asset as given, and hence a
“systemic credit externality” arises, because they do not internalize that, when the collateral
constraint binds, fire sales of assets cause a Fisherian debt-deflation spiral that causes asset
prices to decline and the economy’s borrowing ability to shrink. Moreover, when the con-
straint binds, production plans are also affected, because working capital financing is needed
in order to pay for a fraction of labor costs, and working capital loans are also subject to the
collateral constraint. As a result, output falls when the credit constraint binds, because of
a sudden increase in the effective cost of labor. This affects dividend streams and therefore
equilibrium asset prices, and introduces an additional vehicle for the credit externality to
operate, because private agents do not internalize the supply-side effects of their borrowing
decisions.
    The model is similar to the DSGE models with occassionally binding collateral constraints
examined by Mendoza and Smith (2006) and Mendoza (2010). These studies showed that
the cyclical dynamics of a competitive equilibrium with those constraints lead to periods
of expansion in which leverage ratios raise enough so that the constraint becomes binding
in response to shocks of standard magnitudes, triggering a Fisherian deflation that causes
sharp declines in credit, asset prices, and macroeconomic aggregates. In this paper, we
conduct instead a normative study that focuses on comparing the competitive equilibrium
with the allocations attained by a financial regulator subject to the same collateral constraint
but internalizing the credit externality, and on how the regulator’s optimal plans can be
implemented as a competitive equilibrium using policy tools.
    We conduct a quantitative analysis in a version of the model calibrated to U.S. data.
The results show that financial crises in the competitive equilibrium are significantly more
frequent and more severe than in the equilibrium attained by the regulator. The incidence
of financial crises is about three times larger. Asset prices drop about 25 percent in a typical
crisis in the decentralized equilibrium, versus 5 percent in the regulator’s equilibrium. Output
drops about 50 percent more, because the fall in asset prices reduces access to working capital
financing. The more severe asset price collapses also generate an endogenous “fat tail” in the
distribution of asset returns in the decentralized equilibrium, which causes the price of risk


                                               2
to rise 1.5 times and excess returns to rise by 5 times, in both tranquil times and crisis times.
The regulator can replicate exactly its equilibrium allocations as a decentralized equilibrium,
and thus neutralize the credit externality, by imposing state-contingent taxes on debt and
dividends of about 1 and -0.5 percent on average respectively.
   This paper contributes to the recent literature in the intersection of Macroeconomics
and Finance by developing a quantitative framework suitable for the normative analysis of
overborrowing and macro-prudential policy. This task is challenging, because an accurate
characterization of the macro implications of financial frictions requires using non-linear
global methods to evaluate correctly the short- and long-run effects of these frictions in mod-
els with incomplete asset markets and subject to aggregate shocks. Studying the short-run
effects is important for determining whether the model provides a reasonable approximation
to the non-linear macroeconomic features of actual financial crises, and thus whether it is
a useful laboratory for policy analysis. Studying the long-run mechanisms is equally impor-
tant, because the prudential aspect of macro-prudential policy works by introducing policy
changes that seek to alter the incentives for precautionary behavior in “good times,” when
credit and leverage are building up.
   The recent Macro/Finance literature, including this article, follows in the vein of the
classic studies on fire sales and financial accelerators (e.g. Bernanke and Gertler (1989),
Kiyotaki and Moore (1997), Shleifer and Vishny (2011), Jermann and Quadrini (2012)).
In particular, we study a pecuniary externality similar to those examined in the work of
Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2001), Lorenzoni (2008), Stein (2012), and Korinek (2009),
which arises because private agents do not internalize the amplification effects caused by
financial constraints that depend on market prices.
   This externality was introduced into quantitative studies of macro-prudential policy by
Bianchi (2011) and Benigno, Chen, Otrok, Rebucci, and Young (2011) using a model of
emerging markets crises proposed by Mendoza (2002). In this model, private agents do not
internalize the effect of their individual debt plans on the market price of nontradable goods
relative to tradables, which influences their ability to borrow because debt is limited to a
fraction of income valued in units of tradables. Bianchi examined how this externality leads
to excessive debt accumulation and showed that a debt tax can restore constrained efficiency


                                               3
and reduce the vulnerability to financial crises. Benigno et al. studied how the effects of the
externality are reduced when the planner has access to instruments that can affect directly
labor allocations during crises.1
    Our analysis differs from the above studies in that we focus on asset prices as a key factor
driving debt dynamics and the credit externality, instead of the relative price of nontradables.
This is important because private debt contracts, particularly mortgage loans like those that
drove the high household leverage ratios of many industrial countries in the years leading to
the 2008 crisis, use assets as collateral. Moreover, from a theoretical standpoint, a collateral
constraint linked to asset prices introduces forward-looking effects that are absent when using
a credit constraint linked to goods prices. In particular, expectations of a future financial
crisis affect the discount rates applied to future dividends and distort asset prices even in
periods of financial tranquility. In addition, our model differs because it introduces working
capital financing subject to the collateral constraint, which allows the credit externality to
distort production and dividend rates, and thus again asset prices.
    More recently, the quantitative studies by Nikolov (2009) and Jeanne and Korinek (2010)
examine models of macro-prudential policy in which assets serve as collateral.2 Nikolov found
that simple rules that impose tighter collateral requirements may not be welfare-improving
in a setup in which consumption is a linear function unaffected by precautionary savings. In
contrast, in our model precautionary savings are critical determinants of optimal consump-
tion and borrowing decisions, because of the strong non-linear amplification effects caused by
the Fisherian debt-deflation dynamics, and for the same reason we find that macro-prudential
taxes are welfare improving. Jeanne and Korinek construct estimates of a Pigouvian debt
tax in a model in which output follows an exogenous Markov-switching process and indi-
vidual credit is limited to the sum of a fraction of aggregate, rather than individual, asset
holdings plus a constant term. In their calibration, this second term dominates and the
probability of crises matches the exogenous probability of a low-output regime, and as result
the tax cannot alter the frequency of crises and has small effects on their magnitude.3 In
   1
      In a related paper Benigno et al. (2012) found that intervening during financial crisis by subsidizing
nontradable goods leads to large welfare gains.

      Hanson, Kashyap, and Stein (2011) and Galati and Moessner (2010) review the growing literature on
the macroprudential approach to financial regulation.

      They also examined the existence of deterministic cycles in a non-stochastic version of the model.

                                                     4
contrast, in our model the probability of crises and their output dynamics are endogenous,
and macro-prudential policy reduces sharply the incidence and magnitude of crises.
    Our analysis is also related to other recent studies exploring alternative theories of in-
efficient borrowing and their policy implications. For instance, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe
(2012) and Farhi and Werning (2012) examine the use of prudential capital controls as a tool
for smoothing aggregate demand in the presence of nominal rigidities and a fixed exchange
rate regime. In earlier work, Uribe (2006) examined an environment in which agents do not
internalize an aggregate borrowing limit and yet borrowing decisions are the same as in an
environment in which the borrowing limit is internalized.4 Our analysis differs in that the
regulator internalizes not only the borrowing limit but also the price effects that arise from
borrowing decisions. Still, our results showing small differences in average debt ratios across
competitive and regulated equilibria are in line with his findings.
    The literature on participation constraints in credit markets initiated by Kehoe and
Levine (1993) is also related to our work, because it examines the role of inefficiencies
that result from endogenous borrowing limits. In particular, Jeske (2006) showed that if
there is discrimination against foreign creditors, private agents have a stronger incentive to
default than a planner who internalizes the effects of borrowing decisions on the domestic
interest rate, which affects the tightness of the participation constraint. Wright (2006) then
showed that as a consequence of this externality, subsidies on capital flows restore constrained
efficiency.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the analytical framework.
Section 3 analyzes the financial regulator’s problem. Section 4 presents the quantitative
analysis. Section 5 provides conclusions.


2     Competitive Equilibrium

    We follow Mendoza (2010) in specifying the economic environment in terms of firm-
household units who make production and consumption decisions. Preferences are given

    4
      He provided analytical results for a canonical endowment economy model with a credit constraint where
there is an exact equivalence between the two sets of allocations. In addition, he examined a model in which
this exact equivalence does not hold, but still overborrowing is negligible.

In this expression, E(·) is the expectations operator, β is the subjective discount factor, nt is
labor supply and ct is consumption. The period utility function u(·) is assumed to have the
constant-relative-risk-aversion (CRRA) form. The argument of u(·) is the composite com-
modity ct − G(nt ) defined by Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Huffman (1988). G(n) is a convex,
strictly increasing and continuously differentiable function that measures the disutility of
labor supply. This formulation of preferences removes the wealth effect on labor supply by
making the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and labor depend on labor
only.
      Each household can combine physical assets and labor services purchased from other
households to produce final goods using a production technology such that y = εt F (kt , ht ),
where F is a decreasing-returns-to-scale production function, kt represents individual asset
holdings, ht represents labor demand and εt is a productivity shock, which has compact
support and follows a finite-state, stationary Markov process. Individual profits from are
therefore given by εt F (kt , ht ) − wt ht .
      The budget constraint faced by the representative firm-household is:

                                     bt+1
                    qt kt+1 + ct +        = qt kt + bt + wt nt + [εt F (kt , ht ) − wt ht ]   (2)
                                      Rt

where bt denotes holdings of one-period, non-state-contingent discount bonds at the begin-
ning of date t, qt is the market price of capital, Rt is the real interest rate, and wt is the
wage rate.
      The interest rate is assumed to be exogenous. This is equivalent to assuming that the
economy is a price-taker in world credit markets, as in other studies of the U.S. financial
crisis like those of Boz and Mendoza (2010), Corbae and Quintin (2009) and Howitt (2011),
or alternatively it implies that the model can be interpreted as a partial-equilibrium model
of the household sector. This assumption is adopted for simplicity, but is also in line with
evidence indicating that the observed decline in the U.S. risk-free rate in the era of finan-



                                                         6
cial globalization has been driven largely by outside factors, such as the surge in reserves
in emerging economies and the persistent collapse of investment rates in South East Asia
after 1998. Warnock and Warnock (2009) provide econometric evidence of the significant
downward pressure exerted by foreign capital inflows on U.S. T-bill rates since the mid 1980s.
Mendoza and Quadrini (2010) document that about 1/2 of the surge in net credit in the
U.S. economy since then was financed by foreign capital inflows, and more than half of the
stock of U.S. treasury bills is now owned by foreign agents. From this perspective, assuming
a constant R is conservative, as in reality the pre-crisis boom years were characterized by
a falling real interest rate, which would strengthen our results.5 Still, we study later how
our quantitative results vary if we relax this assumption and consider instead an exogenous
inverse supply-of-funds curve, which allows the real interest rate to increase as debt rises.
    Household-firms are subject to a working capital constraint. In particular, they are
required to borrow a fraction θ of the wages bill wt ht at the beginning of the period and
repay it at the end of the period. In the conventional working capital setup, a cash-in-
advance-like motive for holding funds to pay for inputs implies that the wages bill carries a
financing cost determined by R. In contrast, here we simply assume that working capital
funds are within-period loans. Hence, the interest rate on working capital is zero, as in some
recent studies on the business cycle implications of working capital and credit frictions (e.g.
Chen and Song (2009)). We follow this approach so as to show that the effects of working
capital in our analysis hinge only on the need to provide collateral for working capital loans,
as explained below, and not on the effect of interest rate fluctuations on effective labor costs
as in typical business cycle models with working capital (e.g. Uribe and Yue, 2006).6
    As in Mendoza (2010), agents face a collateral constraint that limits total debt, including
both intertemporal debt and atemporal working capital loans, not to exceed a fraction κ of




   5
      This suggests that a complete model of the pre-crisis U.S. credit boom is not a closed-economy model,
but an open-economy model with mechanisms leading the rest of the world to run a large current account
surplus vis-a-vis the United States (see, for example, Mendoza and Quadrini (2010)).
    6
      We could also change to the standard setup, but in our calibration, θ = 0.14 and R = 1.028, and hence
working capital loans would add 0.4 percent to the cost of labor implying that our findings would remain
largely unchanged.

                                                    7
the market value of asset holdings (i.e. κ imposes a ceiling on the leverage ratio):

                                           bt+1
                                       −        + θwt ht ≤ κqt kt+1                           (3)
                                            Rt

Following Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) and Aiyagari and Gertler (1999), we interpret this
constraint as resulting from an environment where limited enforcement prevents lenders to
collect more than a fraction κ of the value of a defaulting debtor’s assets, but we abstract
from modeling the contractual relationship explicitly.


2.1      Private Optimality Conditions

      In the competitive equilibrium, agents maximize (1) subject to (2) and (3) taking as-
set prices and wages as given. This maximization problem yields the following optimality
conditions for each date t:


                                 wt = G′ (nt )                                                (4)

                       εt Fh (kt , ht ) = wt [1 + θµt /u′ (t)]                                (5)

                               u′ (t) = βREt [u′ (t + 1)] + µt                                (6)

                   qt (u′ (t) − µt κ) = βEt [u′(t + 1) (εt+1 Fk (kt+1 , ht+1 ) + qt+1 )]      (7)


where µt ≥ 0 is the Lagrange multiplier on the collateral constraint.
      Condition (4) is the individual’s labor supply condition, which equates the marginal disu-
tility of labor with the wage rate. Condition (5) is the labor demand condition, which equates
the marginal productivity of labor with the effective marginal cost of hiring labor. The latter
includes the extra financing cost θµt /u′ (t) in the states of nature in which the collateral con-
straint on working capital binds. The last two conditions are the Euler equations for bonds
and physical assets respectively. When the collateral constraint binds, condition (6) implies
that the marginal utility of reallocating consumption to the present exceeds the expected
marginal utility cost of borrowing in the bond market by an amount equal to the shadow
price of relaxing the credit constraint. Condition (7) equates the marginal cost of an extra
unit of investment with its marginal gain. The marginal cost nets out from the marginal util-


                                                      8
ity of foregone current consumption a fraction κ of the shadow value of the credit constraint,
because the additional unit of asset holdings contributes to relax the borrowing limit.
    Condition (7) yields the following forward solution for asset prices:

               j
            "∞                    !        #
             X Y                                             βu′(t + 1 + i)
  qt = Et                mt+1+i       dt+j+1 ,   mt+1+i ≡                       , dt ≡ εt Fk (kt , ht ) (8)
             j=0   i=0
                                                            u′ (t + i) − µt+i κ

Thus, we obtain what seems a standard asset pricing condition stating that, at equilibrium,
the date-t price is equal to the expected present value of the future stream of dividends
discounted using the stochastic discount factors mt+1+i , for i = 0, ..., ∞. The key difference
with the standard asset pricing condition, however, is that the discount factors are adjusted
to account for the shadow value of relaxing the credit constraint by purchasing an extra unit
of assets whenever the collateral constraint binds (at any date t + i for i = 0, ..., ∞ ).
                                                             q                         dt+1 +qt+1
    Combining (6), (7) and the definition of asset returns (Rt+1 ≡                         qt
                                                                                                  ),   it follows
that the expected excess return assets relative to bonds (i.e. the equity premium), Rtep ≡
     q
Et (Rt+1 − R), satisfies the following condition:

                                                                            q

where covt (mt+1 , Rt+1 ) is the date-t conditional covariance between mt+1 and Rt+1 .
    Following Mendoza (2010), we characterize the first term in the right-hand-side of (9) as
the direct (first-order) effect of the collateral constraint on the equity premium, which reflects
the fact that a binding collateral constraint exerts pressure to fire-sell assets, depressing
the current price.7 There is also an indirect (second-order) effect given by the fact that
              q
covt (mt+1 , Rt+1 ) is likely to become more negative when there is a possibility of a binding
credit constraint, because the collateral constraint makes it harder for agents to smooth
consumption.
                                                                   Rep

      Notice that this effect vanishes when κ = 1, because when 100 percent of the value of asset holdings
can be collateralized, the shadow value of relaxing the constraint by acquiring an extra unit of assets equals
the shadow value of relaxing it by reducing the debt by one unit.

where σt (Rt+1 ) is the date-t conditional standard deviation of asset returns and ρt (Rt+1 , mt+1 )
                                        q
is the conditional correlation between Rt+1 and mt+1 . Thus, the collateral constraint has
direct and indirect effects on the Sharpe ratio analogous to those it has on the equity premium.
The indirect effect reduces to the usual expression in terms of the product of the price of
risk and the correlation between asset returns and the stochastic discount factor. The direct
effect is normalized by the variance of returns. These relationships will be useful later to
study the quantitative effects of the credit externality on asset pricing.
                    q
      Since qt Et [Rt+1 ] ≡ Et [dt+1 + qt+1 ], we can rewrite the asset pricing condition in this way:

                                         ∞ j
                                                                    !−1
                                         X Y                q
                               qt = Et                Et+i Rt+1+i         dt+j+1,                     (11)
                                         j=0    i=0


Notice that (9) and (11) imply that a binding collateral constraint at date t implies an
increase in expected excess returns and a drop in asset prices at t. Moreover, since expected
returns exceed the risk free rate whenever the collateral constraint is expected to bind at
any future date, asset prices at t are affected by collateral constraint not just when the
constraints binds at t, but whenever it is expected to bind at any future date.


2.2      Recursive Competitive Equilibrium

      The competitive equilibrium is defined by stochastic sequences of allocations
{ct , kt+1 , bt+1 , ht , nt }∞                        ∞
                             t=0 and prices {qt , wt }t=0 such that: (A) agents maximize utility (1)

subject to the sequence of budget and credit constraints given by (2) and (3) for t = 0, ..., ∞,
taking as given {qt , wt }t=∞
                          t=0 ; (B) the markets of goods, labor and assets clear at each date

t. We assume that assets are in fixed supply K̄, hence the market-clearing condition for




                                                        10

assets is kt = K̄.             The market clearing condition in the goods and labor markets are
       bt+1
ct +    R
              = εt F (K̄, nt ) + bt and ht = nt respectively.
    We now characterize the competitive equilibrium in recursive form. The state variables
for a particular individual’s optimization problem at time t are the individual bond holdings
(b), aggregate bond holdings (B), individual asset holdings (k), and the TFP realization (ε
). Aggregate capital is not carried as a state variable because it is in fixed supply. Denoting
by Γ(B, ε) the agents’ perceived law of motion of aggregate bonds and q(B, ε) and w(B, ε)
the pricing functions for assets and labor respectively, the agents’ recursive optimization
problem is:


                           V (b, k, B, ε) = ′ max
                                               ′

                               ′   b′
              s.t.   q(B, ε)k + c + = q(B, ε)k + b + w(B, ε)n + [εF (k, h) − w(B, ε)h]
                                   R
                                      B ′ = Γ(B, ε)
                         b′
                     −      + θw(B, ε)h ≤ κq(B, ε)k ′
                         R

The solution to this problem is characterized by the decision rules b̂′ (b, k, B, ε), k̂ ′ (b, k, B, ε),
ĉ(b, k, B, ε), n̂(b, k, B, ε) and ĥ(b, k, B, ε). The decision rule for bond holdings induces an
actual law of motion for aggregate bonds, which is given by b̂′ (B, K̄, B, ε). In a recursive
rational expectations equilibrium, as defined below, the actual and perceived laws of motion
must coincide.

Definition 1 (Recursive Competitive Equilibrium)
A recursive competitive equilibrium is defined by an asset pricing function q(B, ε), a pricing
function for labor w(B, ε), a perceived law of motion for aggregate bond holdings Γ(B, ε), and

     This assumption is to preserve tractability in the quantitative comparison between the competitive
equilibrium and the equilibrium with financial regulation. The credit externality would still be present if
we allowed for capital accumulation, as long as the price of capital fluctuates. Mendoza (2010) conducts
a positive analysis of the competitive equilibrium of a similar model with capital accumulation and capital
adjustment costs.

3        Financial Regulator’s Equilibrium

3.1       Equilibrium without collateral constraint

      We start the normative analysis by briefly comparing the competitive equilibrium with
an efficient equilibrium in the absence of the collateral constraint (3). The allocations of this
equilibrium can be represented as the solution to the following standard planning problem:


                                     H(B, ε) = max
                                               ′
                                                   u(c − G(n)) + βEε′ |ε [H(B ′ , ε′)]                          (13)
                                                b ,c,n
                                           B′
                              s.t.    c+      = εF (K̄, n) + B
                                           R

and subject also to either this problem’s natural debt limit, which is defined by B ′ >
εmin F (K̄,n∗ (εmin ))
        R−1
                       ,   where εmin is the lowest possible realization of TFP and n∗ (εmin) is the
optimal labor allocation that solves εmin Fn (K̄, n) = G′ (n), or to a tighter ad-hoc time- and
state-invariant borrowing limit.
      The common strategy followed in quantitative studies of the macro effects of collateral
constraints (see, for example, Mendoza and Smith, 2006 and Mendoza, 2010) is to com-
pare the allocations of the competitive equilibrium with the collateral constraint with those
arising from the above benchmark case. The competitive equilibria with and without the col-
lateral constraint differ in that in the former private agents borrow less (since the collateral


                                                           12
constraint limits the amount they can borrow, and also because they build precautionary
savings to self-insure against the risk of the occasionally binding credit constraint), and there
is financial amplification of the effects of the underlying exogenous shocks (since binding col-
lateral constraints produce large recessions and drops in asset prices). Compared with the
financial regulator’s equilibrium we define next, however, we will show that the competitive
equilibrium with collateral constraints displays overborrowing (i.e. agents borrow more than
in the regulator’s equilibrium ).


3.2      Recursive Financial Regulator’s Equilibrium

      Consider a benevolent regulator who maximizes the agents’ utility subject to the resource
constraint, the collateral constraint and the same menu of assets and credit allocations that
the competitive equilibrium supports. In particular, the regulator is constrained to face the
same “borrowing ability” at every given state as agents in the decentralized equilibrium (i.e.
the same set of values of κq(B, ε)K̄ determined by the competitive market price of collateral
assets ), but with the key difference that the regulator internalizes the effects of its borrowing
decisions on the market prices of assets and labor.9
      The assumption that the regulator values collateral using the pricing function of the com-
petitive equilibrium is related to the concept of conditional or financial efficiency proposed
by Kehoe and Levine (1993) and Lustig (2000). They define conditional efficiency in terms
of Pareto efficient allocations that satisfy credit market participation constraints conditional
on a given set of market prices of either Arrow-Debreu state-contingent claims (Kehoe and
Levine, 1993) or Arrow securities traded sequentially (Lustig, 2000). In our setup, there
are no allocations other than the regulator’s which can both satisfy the collateral constraint,
for a given competitive equilibrium pricing function, and produce higher welfare. In con-
trast with Kehoe and Levine (1993) and Lustig (2000), however, our regulator’s allocations


   9
     We could also allow the regulator to manipulate the borrowing ability state by state (i.e., by allowing
it to alter κq(B, ε)K̄). Allowing for this possibility can potentially increase the welfare gains of macro-
prudential policy but the macroeconomic effects of the externality are similar. In addition, since asset
prices are forward-looking, this would make the regulator’s problem time-inconsistent, because allowing the
regulator to commit to future actions would lead it to internalize not only how today’s choice of debt affects
tomorrow’s asset prices but also how it affects asset prices and the tightness of collateral constraints in
previous periods.

                                                     13
are not guaranteed to satisfy participation constraints, and hence these allocations are not
conditionally efficient in the terms they defined.
    Formulating the regulator’s problem in this way has three advantages. First, despite
the forward-looking nature of asset prices, it renders the regulator’s optimization problem
time-consistent, which guarantees that macro-prudential policy, if effective, improves welfare
across all states and dates in a time-consistent fashion. Second, it allows for a simple
decentralization of the regulator’s allocations based on the use of Pigouvian taxes on debt
and dividends, as we show later. Third, even though we do not solve for an optimal policy
that implements conditionally-efficient allocations or a Ramsey plan in which the pricing
function can be altered, our setup yields a policy that neutralizes fully the credit externality
and leads to a sharp reduction in the probability and severity of financial crises. In fact,
the regulator’s allocations are close to those of an equilibrium in which assets are valued
at a constant price for collateral, and thus there is no Fisherian deflation and no credit
externality.
    The recursive problem of the financial regulator is defined as follows:

                           W (B, ε) = max
                                       ′
                                          u(c − G(n)) + βEε′ |ε W (B ′ , ε′)                            (14)
                                        B ,c,n

                                                      B′
                                       s.t.      c+      = εF (K̄, n) + B
                                                      R
                                   B′
                                  − + θw(B, ε)n ≤ κq(B, ε)K̄
                                   R

where q(B, ε) is the equilibrium pricing function obtained in the competitive equilibrium.
Wages can be treated in a similar fashion, but it is easier to decentralize the regulator’s
allocations as competitive equilibrium if we assume that the it takes wages as given and
wages need to satisfy w(B, ε) = G′ (n).10 Under this assumption, we impose the optimality
condition of labor supply as a condition that the regulator’s equilibrium must satisfy, in
addition to solving problem (14) for given wages.
    Applying the envelope theorem to the first-order conditions of problem (14) and imposing

  10
     This implies that the financial regulator does not internalize the direct effects of choosing the contem-
poraneous labor allocation on contemporaneous wages–only the effect of debt choices on future wages. We
have also investigated the possibility of having the regulator internalize these effects but results are very
similar. This occurs because our calibrated interest rate and working capital requirement are very small.

                                                       14
the labor supply optimality condition, we obtain the following optimality conditions for the
regulator’s problem:

                                                                              ∂qt+1         ∂wt+1
        u′ (t) = βREt [u′(t + 1) + µt+1 ψt+1 ] + µt ,            ψt+1 ≡ κK̄         − θnt+1                   (15)
                                                                              ∂bt+1         ∂bt+1

                                    εt Fn (K̄, nt ) = G′ (nt ) [1 + θµt /u′(t)]                               (16)

The key difference between the competitive equilibrium and the regulator’s equilibrium fol-
lows from examining the Euler equations for bond holdings in both problems. In particular,
the term µt+1 ψt+1 in condition (15) represents the additional marginal benefit of savings
considered by the regulator at date t, because it takes into account how an extra unit of
bond holdings alters the tightness of the credit constraint through its effects on the prices
                                                         ∂qt+1             ∂wt+1
of assets and labor at t + 1. Note that, since           ∂bt+1

of two opposing effects and hence its sign is in principle ambiguous. The term                      ∂bt+1
                                                                                                            is pos-
itive, because an increase in net worth increases demand for assets and assets are in fixed

                                is positive, because the effective cost of hiring labor increases when
the collateral constraint binds, reducing labor demand and pushing wages down. We found,
however, that the value of ψt+1 is positive in all our quantitative experiments with baseline
                                                                                   ∂qt+1

when the credit constraint binds due the effects of the Fisherian debt-deflation mechanism.

Definition 2 (Recursive Financial Regulator’s Equilibrium)
The recursive equilibrium of the financial regulator is given by a set of decision rules
n                               o
 B̂ ′ (B, ε), ĉ(B, ε), n̂(B, ε) with associated value function W (B, ε), and wages w(B, ε) such
that:
        n                               o
  1.     B̂ ′ (B, ε), ĉ(B, ε), n̂(B, ε) and W (B, ε) solve the regulator’s recursive optimization
        problem, taking as given w(B, ε) and the competitive equilibrium’s asset pricing func-
        tion q(B, ε).

  2. Wages satisfy w(B, ε) = G′ (n̂(B, ε)).

3.3      Comparison of Equilibria & ‘Macro-prudential’ Policy

      Using a simple variational argument, we can show that the allocations of the competitive
equilibrium are suboptimal, in the sense that they violate the conditions that support the
regulator’s equilibrium. In particular, private agents undervalue net worth in periods during
which the collateral constraint binds. To see this, consider first the marginal utility of an in-
crease in individual bond holdings. By the envelope theorem, in the competitive equilibrium
                            ∂V
this can be written as      ∂b
                                 = u′ (t). For the regulator, however, the marginal benefit of an
increase in bond holdings takes into account the fact that prices are affected by the increase
                                                      ∂W
in bond holdings, and is therefore given by            ∂b
                                                            = u′ (t) + ψt µt . If the collateral constraint
does not bind, µt = 0 and the two expressions coincide. If the collateral constraint binds,
the social benefits of a higher level of bonds assessed by the regulator include the extra term
given by ψt µt , because one more unit of aggregate bonds increases the inter-period ability
to borrow by ψt which has a marginal value of µt .
      The above argument explains why bond holdings are valued differently by the regulator
and the private agents “ex post,” when the collateral constraint binds. Since both the
regulator and the agents are forward looking, however, it follows that those differences in
valuation lead to differences in the private and social benefits of debt accumulation “ex
ante,” when the constraint is not binding. Consider the marginal cost of increasing the level
of debt at date t evaluated at the competitive equilibrium in a state in which the constraint is
not binding. This cost is given by the discounted expected marginal utility from the implied
reduction in consumption next period βRE [u′ (t + 1)] . In contrast, the regulator internalizes
the effect by which the larger debt reduces tomorrow’s borrowing ability by ψt+1 , and hence
the marginal cost of borrowing at period t that is not internalized by private agents is given
        h                            i
                    ∂qt+1       ∂wt+1
by βREt µt+1 κK̄ ∂bt+1 − θnt+1 ∂bt+1 .
      We now show that the regulator’s equilibrium allocations can be implemented as a com-
petitive equilibrium in the decentralized economy by introducing a macro-prudential policy
that taxes debt and dividends (the latter can turn into a subsidy too, as we show in the next
Section, but we refer to it generically as a tax).11 In particular, the regulator can do this

  11
     See Bianchi (2011) for other decentralizations using capital and liquidity requirements, or loan-to-value
ratios.

                                                     16
by constructing state-contingent schedules of taxes on bond purchases (τt ) and on dividends
(δt ). The tax on bonds ensures that the regulator’s optimal plans for consumption and bond
holdings are consistent with the Euler equation for bonds in the competitive equilibrium.
This requires setting τt = Et µt+1 ψt+1 /Et u′ (t + 1). The tax on dividends ensures that these
optimal plans and the pricing function q(B, ε) are consistent with the private agents’ Euler
equation for asset holdings.
   With the taxes in place, the budget constraint of private agents becomes:

                          bt+1
     qt kt+1 + ct +                = qt kt + bt + wt nt + [εt F (kt , ht )(1 − δt ) − wt ht ] + Tt .   (17)
                      Rt (1 + τt )

Here, Tt represents lump-sum transfers by which the government rebates all its tax revenue
(or a lump-sum tax in case the tax rates are negative, which is not ruled out).
   The Euler equations of the competitive equilibrium become:


                          u′ (t) = βR(1 + τt )Et [u′(t + 1)] + µt                                      (18)

               qt (u′ (t) − µt κ) = βEt [u′ (t + 1) (εt+1 Fk (kt+1 , nt+1 )(1 + δt+1 ) + qt+1 )]       (19)


By combining these two Euler equations we can derive the expected excess return on assets
under the macro-prudential policy. In this case, after-tax returns on assets and bonds are
             q          dt+1 (1+δt+1 )+qt+1
defined as R̃t+1 ≡               qt
                                              and R̃t+1 ≡ R(1 + τt ) respectively, and the after-tax
expected equity premium reduces to an expression analogous to that of the decentralized
equilibrium:
                                                                              q
                                            µt (1 − κ)         Covt (mt+1 , R̃t+1 )
                          R̃tep   =       ′
                                                             −                                         (20)
                                    Et [(u (t) − µt κ)mt+1 ]      Et [mt+1 ]
This excess return also has a corresponding interpretation in terms of the Sharpe ratio, the
price of risk, and the correlation between asset returns and the pricing kernel as in the case
of the competitive equilibrium without macro-prudential policy.
   It follows from comparing the expressions for Rtep and R̃tep that differences in the after-
tax expected equity premia of the competitive equilibria with and without macro-prudential
policy are determined by differences in the direct and indirect effects of the credit constraint
in the two environments. As shown in the next Section, these effects are stronger in the


                                                       17
decentralized equilibrium without policy intervention, in which the inefficiencies of the credit
externality are not addressed. Intuitively, higher leverage and debt in this environment imply
that the constraint binds more often, which strengthens the direct effect. In addition, lower
net worth implies that the stochastic discount factor covaries more strongly with the excess
return on assets, which strengthens the indirect effect. Notice also that dividends in the
regulator’s allocations are discounted at a rate which depends positively on the tax on debt.
This premium is required by the regulator so that the excess returns reflect the social costs
of borrowing.


4       Quantitative Analysis

4.1      Calibration

      We calibrate the model to annual frequency using data from the U.S. economy. The
functional forms for preferences and technology are the following:
                                    h          i1−σ
                                          n1+ω
                                     c − κ 1+ω      −1
                   u(c − G(n)) =                             ω > 0, σ > 1
                                           1−σ
                        F (k, h) = εk αK hαh ,        αK , αh ≥ 0 αK + αh < 1


The real interest rate is set to R − 1 = 0.028 per year, which is the ex-post average real
interest rate on U.S. three-month T-bills during the period 1980-2005. We set σ = 2, which
is a standard value in quantitative DSGE models. The parameter κ is inessential and is set
so that mean hours are equal to 1, which requires κ = 0.64. Aggregate capital is normalized
to K̄ = 1 without loss of generality and the share of labor in output αh is equal to 0.64,
the standard value. The Frisch elasticity of labor supply (1/ω) is set equal to 1, in line with
evidence by Kimball and Shapiro (2008).
      We follow Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2007) in taking M1 money balances in possession
of firms as a proxy for working capital. Based on the observations that about two-thirds
of M1 are held by firms (Mulligan, 1997) and that M1 was on average about 14 percent of
annual GDP over the period 1980 to 2009, we calibrate the working capital-GDP ratio to

match (2/3)0.14 = 0.093. Given the 64 percent labor share in production, and assuming the
collateral constraint does not bind, we obtain θ = 0.093/0.64 = 0.146.
   The value of β is set to 0.96, which is also a standard value, but in addition it supports an
average household debt-income ratio in a range that is in line with U.S. data from the Federal
Reserve’s Flow of Funds database. Before the mid-1990s this ratio was stable at about 30
percent. Since then and until just before the 2008 crisis, it rose steadily to a peak of almost
70 percent. By comparison, the average debt-income ratio in the stochastic steady-state of
the model with the baseline calibration is 38 percent. A mean debt ratio of 38 percent is
sensible because 70 percent was an extreme at the peak of a credit boom and 30 percent is
an average from a period before the substantial financial innovation of recent years.
   TFP shocks follow a log-normal AR(1) process log(εt) = ρ log(εt−1 ) + ηt . We construct a
discrete approximation to this process using the quadrature procedure of Tauchen and Hussey
(1991) using 15 nodes. The values of σε and ρ are set so that the standard deviation and first-
order autocorrelation of the output series produced by the model match the corresponding
moments for the cyclical component of U.S. GDP in the sample period 1947-2007 (which are
2.1 percent and 0.5 respectively). This procedure yields σε = 0.014 and ρ = 0.53.
   Since capital in the model is in fixed supply, we do not set the capital share to the standard
1/3rd, which is based on capital income accrued to the entire capital stock. Instead, we set
αK so that the model matches an estimate of the ratio of capital in fixed supply to GDP

                                                 19
based on the value of the housing stock. Using data from the Flow of Funds database, we
estimate this ratio at about 1.35. The model matches it, given the other parameter values,
if we set αK = 0.05.12
    The parameter κ is difficult to calibrate with actual data because of the model’s high level
of aggregation and the wide dispersion in loan-to-value restrictions and ability to leverage
across households and firms of various characteristics. Hence, following Mendoza (2010), we
chose to set κ so as to match the frequency of financial crises in U.S. data. To be consistent
with the empirical literature, we define a financial crisis as an event in which both the
credit constraint binds and there is a decrease in credit of more than one standard deviation.
Then, we set κ so that financial crises in the stochastic steady state of the baseline model
simulation occur about 3 percent of the time, which is consistent with the fact that the U.S.
has experienced three major financial crises in the last hundred years.13 This procedure
yields κ = 0.36. This value of κ is also consistent with measures of household and corporate
leverage, which were respectively 0.2 and 0.45 at the onset of the 2007 financial crisis.14
    We recognize that several of the parameter values are subject of debate (e.g. the Frisch
elasticity of labor supply), or relate to variables that do not have a clear analog in the data
(e.g. κ or θ). Hence, we will perform extensive sensitivity analysis to examine the effects of
changes in the model’s key parameters.
    The model is solved using a global, nonlinear solution method that solves the recursive
competitive equilibrium by iterating on the equilibrium asset pricing function and the opti-
mality conditions. The algorithm is described in detail in the Appendix. Since mean output
   12
      Estimates of the value of capital in fixed supply vary depending on whether they include land used for
residential or commercial purposes, or owned by government at different levels. We used an estimate based
on residential property because it is a closer match to the structure of the model (for example, the discount
factor was set to match the household debt ratio). This is also a conservative assumption, because a lower
αK weakens the Fisherian deflation mechanism, and hence if anything our findings would be strengthened
with a broader definition of capital in fixed supply, which would imply a higher αK .
   13
       The three crises correspond to the Great Depression, the Savings and Loans Crisis and the Great
Recession (see Reinhart and Rogoff (2008)). While a century may be a short sample for estimating accurately
the probability of a rare event in one country, Mendoza (2010) estimates a probability of about 3.6 percent
for financial crises using a similar definition but applied to all emerging economies using data since 1980.
   14
      These leverage ratios were computed using asset and liabilities data from the Flow of Funds (total
assets and credit market debt outstanding of households and nonprofit organizations, and total assets and
debt outstanding of the domestic nonfinancial business sector). The resulting leverage ratios are lower than
maximum loan-to-value ratios in home mortgages, which peaked above 95 percent in the sub-prime market
at the peak of the housing boom, but the lower ratio in the Flow of Funds data suggests that this is not a
representative figure for the broader housing sector.

                                                     20
is normalized to 1, all quantities can be interpreted as fractions of mean output.


4.2      Borrowing decisions

      We start the quantitative analysis by exploring the effects of the externality on optimal
borrowing plans and the financial amplification mechanism. The two panels of Figure 1 show
the bond decision rules (b′ ) of private agents and the regulator as a function of b (left panel)
as well as the asset pricing function (right panel), both for a negative two-standard-deviations
TFP shock.
      The first important result illustrated in these plots is that the Fisherian deflation mecha-
nism generates V-shaped bond decision rules, instead of the typical monotonically increasing
decision rules, and a concave pricing function with a very steep slope at high debt levels (i.e.
low values of b). The point at which bond decision rules switch slope corresponds to the
value of b at which the collateral constraint holds with equality but does not bind. To the
right of this point, the collateral constraint does not bind and the bond decision rules are
upward sloping. To the left of this point, the bond decision rules are decreasing in b, because
a reduction in current bond holdings results in a sharp reduction in the price of assets, as
can be seen in the right panel, and tightens the borrowing constraint, thus increasing b′ .
      As in Bianchi (2011), we can separate the bond decision rules in the left panel of Figure 1
into three regions: a “constrained region,” a “high-externality region” and a “low-externality
region.” The “constrained region” is defined by the range of b in the horizontal axis with
sufficiently high initial debt such that the collateral constraint binds for the regulator. This
is the range with b ≤ −0.385. In this region, the collateral constraint binds for both the
regulator and private agents in the competitive equilibrium, because the credit externality
implies that the constraint starts binding at higher values of b in the latter than in the
former, as we show below.
      By construction, the total amount of debt (i.e. the sum of bond holdings and working
capital) in the constrained region is the same under the regulator’s allocations and the
competitive equilibrium. If working capital were not subject to the collateral constraint, the
two bond decision rules would also be identical. But with working capital in the constraint
the two can differ. This is because the effective cost of labor differs between the two equilibria,

since the increase in the marginal financing cost of labor when the constraint binds, θµt /u′ (t),
is different. These differences, however, are very small in the numerical experiments, and
thus the bond decision rules are approximately the same in the constrained region.15
                              The high-externality region is located to the right of the constrained region, and it in-
cludes the interval −0.385 < b < −0.363. Here, the regulator chooses uniformly higher bond
positions (lower debt) than private agents, because of the effect of the externality on the reg-
ulator’s decisions when the constrained region is near. In fact, private agents hit the credit
constraint at b = −0.383, while at this initial b the regulator still retains some borrowing
capacity. Moreover, this region is characterized by “financial instability,” in the sense that

                        15
     The choice of b′ becomes slightly higher for the regulator as b gets closer to the upper bound of the
constrained region, because the deleveraging that occurs around this point is small enough for the probability
of a binding credit constraint next period to be strictly positive. As a result, for given allocations, conditions
(15) and (6) imply that µ is lower for the regulator.

                                                                                                                  22
the levels of debt chosen for t + 1 are high enough so that a negative TFP shock of standard
magnitude in that period can lead to a binding credit constraint that leads to large falls in
consumption, output, asset prices and credit. We will show later that this is also the region
of the state space in which the regulator uses actively its macro-prudential policy.
   The low-externality region is the interval for which b ≥ −0.363. In this region, the prob-
ability of a binding constraint next period is zero for both the regulator and the competitive
equilibrium. The bond decision rules still differ, however, because expected marginal utilities
differ for the two equilibria. But the regulator does not set a tax on debt, because negative
shocks cannot lead to a binding credit constraint in the following period.
   The long-run probabilities with which the regulator’s (competitive) equilibrium visit the
three regions of the bond decision rules are 2 (4) percent for the constrained region, 69 (70)
percent for the high-externality region, and 29 (27) percent for the low-externality region.
Both economies spend more than 2/3rds of the time in the high-externality region, but
the prudential actions of the regulator reduce the probability of entering in the constrained
region by a half. Later we will show that this is reflected also in financial crises that are
much less frequent and less severe than in the competitive equilibrium.
   The larger debt (i.e. lower b′ ) choices of private agents relative to the regulator, particu-
larly in the high-externality region, constitute our first measure of the overborrowing effect at
work in the competitive equilibrium. The regulator accumulates extra precautionary savings
above and beyond what private individuals consider optimal in order to self-insure against
the risk of financial crises. This effect is quantitatively small in terms of the difference be-
tween the two decision rules, but this does not mean that its macroeconomic effects are
negligible. Later in this Section we illustrate this point by comparing financial crises events
in the two economies. In addition, we use Figure 2 to study further the dynamics implicit
in the bond decision rules so as to show that small differences in borrowing decisions lead to
major differences in financial amplification when a crisis hits.

deviations below the mean. The ray from the origin is the stationary choice line, where

the differences in decision rules.
   Assume both economies start at a value of b such that at average TFP the debt of
agents in the competitive equilibrium remains unchanged. This is point A, where the agents’
decision rule cuts the stationary choice line, so that b′ = b = −0.389. If the TFP realization
is indeed the average, private agents in the decentralized equilibrium keep that level of debt.
On the other hand, starting from that same b = −0.389, the regulator builds precautionary
savings and reduces its debt to point B with b = −0.386. Hence, the next period the
two economies start at the debt levels in A and B respectively. Assume now that at this
time TFP falls by two standard deviations. Now we can see the large dynamic implications
of the small differences in the bond decision rules of the two economies: The competitive
equilibrium suffers a major correction caused by the Fisherian deflation mechanism. The
collateral constraint becomes binding and the economy is forced to a large deleveraging that
results in a sharp reduction in debt (an increase in b to -0.347 at point A′ ). Consumption
falls leading to a drop in the stochastic discount factor and a drop in asset prices. In contrast,
the regulator, while also facing a binding credit constraint, adjusts its debt marginally to

just about b = −0.379 at point B ′ . This was possible for the regulator because, taking into
account the risk of a Fisherian deflation and internalizing its price dynamics, the regulator
chose to borrow less than agents in the decentralized equilibrium a period earlier.
    Overborrowing can also be assessed by comparing the long-run distributions of debt
and leverage of private agents and the regulator. The fact that the regulator accumulates
more precautionary savings implies that its ergodic distribution concentrates less proba-
bility at higher leverage ratios than in the competitive equilibrium. Figure 3 shows the
                                                                             −bt+1 +θwt nt

maximum leverage ratio in both economies is given by κ but notice that the decentralized
equilibrium concentrates higher probabilities in higher levels of leverage. Comparing aver-
ages across these ergodic distributions, however, mean leverage ratios differ by less than 1
percent. Hence, overborrowing seems a relatively minor problem if measured by comparing
unconditional long-run averages of leverage ratios.16

              Figure 4: Ergodic Cumulative Distribution of Realized Asset Returns

4.3     Asset Pricing

      Overborrowing has important quantitative implications for asset returns and their de-
terminants. Figure 4 shows the long-run distributions of realized equity returns for the
competitive equilibrium and the regulator.
      A key result from our analysis is that the distribution of equity returns for the compet-
itive equilibrium displays fatter tails. In fact, the 99th percentile of returns is about -17.5
percent, v. -1.6 percent for the regulator. The fatter left tail in the competitive equilibrium
corresponds to states in which a negative TFP shock hits when agents have a relatively high
level of debt. Intuitively, as a negative TFP shock hits, expected dividends decrease and this
puts downward pressure on asset returns. In addition, if the collateral constraint becomes
binding, asset fire-sales lead to a further drop in asset prices. Following a similar logic, the
fatter right-tail in the distribution of returns of the competitive equilibrium corresponds to
periods with positive TFP shocks, which were preceded by unusually low asset prices due to
fire sales.


                                                                             26
    We show below that the fatter tails of the distribution of asset returns, and the associ-
ated time-varying risk of financial crises, have substantial effects on the risk premium. These
features of our model are similar to those examined in the literature on asset pricing and
“disasters” (see Barro, 2009). Note, however, that this literature generally treats financial
disasters as resulting from exogenous stochastic processes with fat tails and time-varying
volatility, whereas in our setup financial crises and their time-varying risk are both endoge-
nous.17 The underlying shocks driving the model are standard TFP shocks, even in periods
of financial crises. In our model, as in Mendoza (2010), financial crises are endogenous out-
comes that occur when shocks of standard magnitudes trigger financial amplification via a
Fisherian deflation.
    Table 2 reports statistics that characterize the main properties of asset returns for the
regulator and the competitive equilibrium. We also report statistics for a competitive equi-
librium in which assets in the collateral constraint are valued at a fixed price set equal
to the average price across the ergodic distribution q̄ (i.e. the credit constraint becomes
− bR
   t+1
     t
       + θwt nt ≤ κq̄kt+1 ).18 This fixed-valuation scenario allows us to compare the proper-
ties of asset returns in the competitive and regulator’s equilibria with a setup in which a
collateral constraint exists but the Fisherian deflation channel and the credit externality are
removed.
    Table 2 lists expected excess returns, the direct and indirect (or covariance) effects of
the credit constraint on excess returns, the log standard deviation of returns, the price of
risk, and the Sharpe ratio. These moments are reported for the unconditional long-run
distributions of each model economy, as well as for distributions conditional on the collateral
constraint being binding and not binding. In addition, Figure 5 plots Sharpe ratios and
excess returns as a function of the bond position. These plots provide further evidence of
important non-linearities present in the model, now for the compensation for risk taking
and the excess returns, both of which rise very sharply as debt enters the region where the
   17
      The literature on disasters typically uses Epstein-Zin preferences so as to be able to match the large
observed equity premia (Gourio, 2011). Here we use standard CRRA preferences with a risk aversion
coefficient of 2, and as we show later, we can obtain larger risk premia than in the typical CRRA setup
without credit frictions. Moreover, we obtain realistically large risk premia when the credit constraint binds.
   18
       Because the asset is in fixed supply, these allocations would be the same if we use instead an ad-hoc
borrowing limit such that − bR  t+1
                                  t
                                    + θwt nt ≤ κq̄ K̄. The price of assets, however, would be lower since with
the ad-hoc borrowing constraint assets do not have collateral value.

    The mean unconditional excess return is 1.09 percent in the competitive equilibrium v.
only 0.17 percent for the regulator and 0.86 percent in the fixed-valuation economy.19 The
risk premium in the competitive equilibrium is large, about half as large as the risk-free rate.
The fact that the other two economies produce lower premia indicates that the high premium
of the competitive equilibrium is the combined result of the Fisherian deflation mechanism
and the credit externality. Note also that the high premium produced by our model contrasts
sharply with the findings of Heaton and Lucas (1996) and Gomes, Yaron, and Zhang (2003),
who found that credit frictions without the Fisherian deflation mechanism do not produce

     Note that the asset in our model is a claim to a unit of output payable at t + 1, which is akin to an
unlevered claim on equity. We can also compute the returns of what would be a levered claim on equity,
by calculating the returns of an asset that promises to pay ct+1 units of consumption. The returns on the
levered and unlevered claims are highly correlated, but the excess returns of the former are larger (1.7 v.
1.09 percent in terms of unconditional averages in the competitive equilibrium). Computing the returns of a
levered claim with the standard formula, assuming a leverage ratio of 2/3rds, yields a premium of 4 percent,
but this estimate is problematic because, since the Modigliani-Miller theorem does not apply, a claim with
this return is actually not traded.

    The excess returns for the regulated and fixed-valuation economies in the region where
the collateral constraint does not bind are in line with those obtained in classic asset pricing
models that display the “equity premium puzzle.” The equity premia we obtained in these
two scenarios are driven only by the covariance effect, as in the classic models, and they are
negligible: 0.03 percent in the fixed-valuation economy and 0.06 percent for the regulator.
This is natural because, without the constraint binding and with the effects of the credit
externality and the Fisherian deflation removed or weakened, the model is in the same class
as those that display the equity premium puzzle. In contrast, our baseline competitive
economy yields a 0.23 percent premium conditional on the constraint not binding, which is
small relative to data estimates that range from 6 to 18 percent, but 4 to 8 times larger than
in the other two economies.
    Conditional on the collateral constraint being binding, mean excess returns are quite
large: Nearly 14 percent in the competitive equilibrium, 4.86 percent for the regulator, and
1.29 percent in the fixed-valuation economy. Interestingly, the lowest unconditional premium
is the one for the regulated economy (0.17 percent), but conditional on the constraint bind-
ing, the lowest premium is the one for the fixed-valuation economy (1.29 percent).This is
because on one hand the Fisherian deflation effect is still at work when the collateral con-
straint binds for the regulated, but not in the fixed-valuation economy, while on the other
hand the regulator has a lower probability of hitting the collateral constraint (so that the
higher premium when the constraint binds does not weigh heavily when computing the un-
conditional average). In turn, the probability of hitting the collateral constraint is higher for
the fixed-valuation economy, because the incentive to build precautionary savings is weaker
when there is no Fisherian amplification.
    The unconditional direct and covariance effects of the collateral constraint on excess re-
turns are significantly stronger in the competitive equilibrium than for the regulated and
fixed-valuation economies, and even more so if we compare them conditional on the con-

   20
     The unconditional premium in the fixed valuation economy, at 0.86 percent, is not trivial, but note
that it results from the fact that the constraint binds with very high probability, given the smaller incentives
to accumulate precautionary savings. The risk premium in the unconstrained region of the fixed-valuation
model is only 0.03 percent, v. 0.23 in our baseline model.

straint being binding. Again, the direct and covariance effects are larger in the competitive
equilibrium because of the effects of the overborrowing externality and the Fisherian deflation
mechanism.
   In terms of the decomposition of excess returns based on condition (10), Table 2 shows
that the unconditional average of the price of risk is about twice as large in the decentralized
equilibrium than for the regulated and fixed-valuation economies. This reflects the fact that
consumption, and therefore the pricing kernel, fluctuate significantly more in the decentral-
ized equilibrium. The Sharpe ratio and the variability of asset returns are also much larger
in the competitive equilibrium across the two regions. The increase in the former indicates,
however, that the mean excess return rises significantly more than the variability of returns,
which indicates that risk-taking is “overcompensated” in the competitive equilibrium (rela-
tive to the compensation it receives when the regulator internalizes the credit externality).
Interestingly, the unconditional Sharpe ratio in the competitive equilibrium is similar to U.S.
data estimates of around 0.3 (Campbell (2003)). Note also that the correlations between
asset returns and the stochastic discount factor, not shown in the Table, are very similar
under the three equilibria and very close to 1. This is important because it implies that the
differences in excess returns and Sharpe ratios cannot be attributed to differences in this
correlation.

4.4     Incidence and Magnitude of Financial Crises

      We show now that overborrowing in the competitive equilibrium increases the incidence
and severity of financial crises. To demonstrate this result we construct an event analysis of
financial crises with simulated data obtained by performing long (100,000-period) stochastic
time-series simulations of the competitive equilibrium, the regulator’s equilibrium and the
fixed-valuation economy, removing the first 1,000 periods. A financial crisis episode is defined
as a situation in which the credit constraint binds and this causes a decrease in credit larger
than a crisis threshold, which is set at one standard deviation of the first difference of credit
in the ergodic distribution corresponding to each economy.
      The event analysis is important not only for studying the effects of overborrowing on the
incidence and magnitude of financial crises, but also to shed light on whether the model can
produce financial crises with realistic features. This is an important first step in making the
case for treating the normative implications of the model as relevant. In this regard, the
results show that, while we did build a rich equilibrium business cycle model so we could keep
the analysis of the externality tractable, and hence our match to the data is not perfect, the
model does produce financial crises with realistic features in terms of abrupt, large declines
in allocations, credit, and asset prices, and it supports non-crisis output fluctuations roughly
in line with observed U.S. business cycles. Other studies have also shown that the Fisherian
deflation mechanism can do well at explaining observed financial crisis dynamics nested
within realistic long-run business cycle co-movements in full blown business cycle models
(see Mendoza (2010)).
      The first important result of the event analysis is that the incidence of financial crises is
significantly higher in the competitive equilibrium. As explained earlier, we calibrated κ so
that the competitive economy experiences financial crises with a long-run probability of 3.0
percent. With this same value of κ, the regulator experiences financial crises only with 0.9
percent probability in the long run. Thus, the credit externality increases the frequency of
financial crises by a factor of 3.33.21
   21
     If we define financial crises for the regulator by using the crisis threshold of the competitive equilibrium,
instead of the threshold based on the regulator’s own credit fluctuations, the probability of crises for the
regulator is even lower. In fact, credit declines equal to at least one standard deviation of the first-difference
of credit in the competitive equilibrium are zero-probability events for the financial regulator.

                                                       31
    The second important result is that financial crises are more severe in the competitive
equilibrium. This is illustrated in the event windows shown in Figure 6. The event windows
are for total credit (bonds plus working capital), consumption, labor, output,TFP and asset
prices, all expressed as deviations from long-run averages.
    We construct comparable event windows for the competitive equilibrium, the regulator
and the fixed-valuation economy by following this procedure: First we identify financial
crisis events in the competitive equilibrium, and isolate five-year event windows centered in
the period in which the crisis takes place. That is, each event window includes five years,
the two years before the crisis, the year of the crisis, and the two years after. Second, we
calculate the median TFP shock across all of these event windows in each year t − 2 to
t + 2, and the median initial debt at t − 2. This determines an initial value for bonds and
a five-year sequence of TFP realizations. Third, we feed this sequence of shocks and initial
value of bonds to the decisions rules of each model economy and compute the corresponding
endogenous variables plotted in Figure 6. By proceeding in this way, the event dynamics
for the three equilibria are simulated using the same initial state and the same sequence of
shocks.22
    The features of financial crises at date t in the competitive economy are in line with the
results in Mendoza (2010): The debt-deflation mechanism produces financial crises charac-
terized by sharp declines in credit, consumption, asset prices and output.
    The five macro variables illustrated in the event windows show similar dynamics across
the three economies in the two years before the financial crisis. When the crisis hits, however,
the collapses observed in the competitive equilibrium are much larger. Credit falls about 20
percentage points more, and two years after the crisis the credit stock of the competitive
equilibrium remains 10 percentage points below that of the regulated economy.23 Consump-
tion, asset prices, and output also fall much more sharply in the competitive equilibrium
than in the regulated economy. The declines in consumption and asset prices are particu-
   22
      The sequence of TFP shocks is 0.9960, 0.9881, 0.9724, 0.9841, 0.9920 and the initial level of debt is 1.6
percent above the average.
   23
      The model overestimates the drop in credit relative to what we have observed so far in the U.S. crisis
(which as of the third quarter of 2010 reached about 7 percent of GDP) . One reason for this is that in the
model, credit is in the form of one-period bonds, whereas in the data, loans have on average a much larger
maturity. In addition, our model does not take into account the strong policy intervention that took place
with the aim to prevent what would have been a larger credit crunch.

                                                      32
larly larger (-16 percent v. -5 percent for consumption and -24 percent v. -7 percent for
asset prices). The asset price collapse also plays an important role in explaining the more
pronounced decline in credit in the competitive equilibrium, because it reflects the outcome
of the Fisherian deflation mechanism.
   Output falls by 2 percentage points more and labor almost 3 percentage points more in
the competitive equilibrium than in the regulated economy, because of the higher shadow
cost of hiring labor due to the effect of the tighter binding credit constraint on access to
working capital. Moreover, by comparing the output and labor drops at date t in the
competitive equilibrium with the drops experienced in the fixed-valuation economy, and since
both economies experience identical TFP shocks, we can infer that the model’s Fisherian
deflation mechanism amplifies the decline in output by 50 percent (6 percent v. 4 percent
drop) and in labor by 300 percent (6 percent drop v. 2 percent drop).
   The event analysis results can also be used to illustrate the relative significance of the
wage and asset price components in the externality term ψt ≡ κK̄ ∂q
                                                                 ∂bt

                                                                      − θnt ∂w
                                                                            ∂bt
                                                                               t
                                                                                 identified in
condition (15). Given the unitary Frisch elasticity of labor supply, wages decrease one-to-
one with labor (and hence the event plot for wages would be identical to the one shown for
employment in Figure 6). As a result, the extent to which the drop in wages can help relax
the collateral constraint is very limited. Wages and employment fall about 6 percent at date
t , and with a working capital coefficient of θ = 0.14, this means that the effect of the drop
in wages on the borrowing capacity is 0.14(1 − 0.06)0.06 = 0.79 percent. On the other hand,
given that K̄ = 1 and that asset prices fall about 25 percent below trend at date t, and since
κ = 0.36, the effect of asset fire sales on the collateral constraint is 0.36(0.25) = 9 percent.
Thus, the asset price effect of the externality is about 10 times bigger than the wage effect.
This finding will play an important role in our quantitative analysis of macro-prudential
policy later in this section.
   The fixed-valuation economy displays very little amplification given that the economy is
free from the Fisherian deflation mechanism. Credit increases slightly at date t in order to
smooth consumption and remains steady in the following periods. The fact that assets are
valued at the average price, and not the market price, contributes to mitigate the drop in
the asset price, since it remains relatively more attractive as a source of collateral.

    Figure 6: Event Analysis: percentage differences relative to unconditional averages

    To gain more intuition on why asset prices drop more because of the credit externality, we
plot in Figure 7 the projected conditional sequences of future dividends and asset returns up
to 30 periods ahead of a financial crisis that occurs at date t = 0 (conditional on information
available on that date). These are the sequences of dividends and returns used to compute
the present values of dividends that determine the equilibrium asset price at t in the event
analysis of Figure 6. The expected asset returns start very high when the crisis hits in both
the competitive equilibrium and the regulator’s equilibrium, but significantly more for the
former (at about 40 percent) than the latter (at 10 percent). On the other hand, expected
dividends do not differ significantly, and therefore we conclude that the sharp change in the

pricing kernel reflected in the surge in projected asset returns when the crisis hits is what
drives the large differences in the drop of asset prices.
   The large deleveraging that takes places when a financial crisis occurs in the competitive
equilibrium implies that projected asset returns for the immediate future (i.e. the first 6
periods after the crisis) drop significantly. Returns are also projected to fall for the regulator,
but at a lower pace, so that in fact the regulator projects higher asset returns than agents in
the competitive equilibrium for a few periods. Projected dividends for the same immediate
future after the crisis are slightly smaller than the long-run average of 0.05 in both economies
because of the persistence of the TFP shock. In the long-run, expected dividends are slightly
higher for the regulator, because the marginal productivity of capital drops less during the
financial crisis as a result of the lower amount of debt. Notice also that the regulator projects
to discount dividends with slightly higher asset returns in the long run, because the tax on
debt more than offsets the fact that the risk premium of the regulator is lower (recall that we
are comparing after-tax returns as defined in Section 2). This arises because the tax on debt
makes bonds relatively more attractive and this leads in equilibrium to a higher required
return on assets.

4.5      Long-Run Business Cycles

      Table 3 reports the long-run business cycle moments of the competitive equilibrium, the
regulator’s equilibrium, and the fixed-valuation economy, which are computed using each
economy’s ergodic distribution. The business cycle moments are roughly consistent with
U.S. data. One aspect to notice is that consumption variability is slightly higher than output
variability in the competitive equilibrium, which is not the case in U.S. data. However, if we
exclude the crisis periods, the ratio of the variability of consumption to that of GDP would
be 0.87 (compared with 0.88 in annual U.S. data from 1960 to 2007).24
      The strong financial amplification mechanism at work in the competitive equilibrium
produces higher business cycle variability in output and labor, and especially in consump-
tion, compared with the regulated and fixed-valuation economies. The high variability of
consumption and credit are consistent with the results in Bianchi (2011), but we find in addi-
tion that the credit externality produces a moderate increase in the variability of labor and
a substantial increase in the variability of asset prices and leverage. It may seem puzzling
that we can obtain non-trivial differences in long-run business cycle moments even though
financial crises are low probability events. To explain this result, it is useful to go back to
Figure 1. This plot shows that even during normal business cycles the optimal plans of the
competitive equilibrium and the regulator differ, particularly in the high-externality region.
Because the economy spends about 70 percent of the time in this region, where private agents
borrow more and are more exposed to the risk of financial crises, long-run business cycle
moments differ. In addition, the larger effects that occur during crises have a non-trivial
effect on long-run moments. This is particularly noticeable in the case of consumption where
the variability drops from 2.7 to 1.7 in the decentralized equilibrium when we exclude the
crises episodes.
      The business cycle moments of consumption, output and labor for the regulated economy
are about the same as those of the fixed-valuation economy. This occurs even though the
regulator is subject to the Fisherian deflation mechanism and the fixed-valuation economy

   24
      In fact, the variability of consumption over output fluctuates significantly depending on the sample
period, reaching 1.0 in the period 1945-2010, using annual data and detrending the data with a standard
HP filter and detrending parameters equal to 100.

                                                   36
is not. The reason for this is because the regulator accumulates extra precautionary savings,
which compensate for the sudden change in the borrowing ability when the credit constraint
binds. The constraint binds less often and when it does it has weak effects on macro variables.
On the other hand, the regulator does display lower variability in leverage and asset prices
than the fixed-valuation economy, and this occurs because the regulator internalizes how a
drop in the price tightens the collateral constraint.
    The correlations of output with leverage, credit, and asset prices also differ significantly
across the model economies. The GDP correlations of leverage and credit are significantly
higher in the competitive equilibrium, while the correlation between asset prices and GDP is
lower. The model without credit frictions would have a natural tendency to produce counter-
cyclical credit because consumption-smoothing agents want to save in good times and borrow
in bad times. This effect still dominates for the regulated and fixed-valuation economies, but
in the competitive equilibrium the collateral constraint and the Fisherian deflation hamper
consumption smoothing enough to produce procyclical credit and a higher GDP-leverage
correlation. Similarly, the GDP-asset price correlation is nearly perfect when the Fisherian
deflation mechanism is weakened (regulator’s case) or removed (fixed-valuation case), but
falls to about 0.8 in the competitive equilibrium. Because of the strong procyclicality of
asset prices, leverage is countercyclical with a GDP correlation of -0.57. This is in line with
the observed countercyclicality of household and corporate leverage in U.S. data, although
the correlation is lower than in the data. Using data asset and liabilities data from the Flow
of Funds between 1950-2010, we find that the correlation between the ratio of net household
                                                                                                25
(corporate) leverage and GDP is -0.25 (-0.34) at the business cycle frequency.
    In terms of the first-order autocorrelations, the competitive equilibrium displays lower
autocorrelations in all its variables compared to the other two economies. This occurs be-
cause crises in the competitive equilibrium are characterized by deep but not very prolonged
recessions.


   25
     Two important observations on this point. First, at lower frequencies the correlation is positive. As
Boz and Mendoza (2010) report, the household leverage ratio rose together with GDP, land prices and
debt between 1997 and 2007. Second, the countercyclicality of leverage for the household and non-financial
corporate sectors differs sharply from the strong procyclicality of leverage in the financial sector (see Adrian
and Shin (2010)).

         competitive equilibrium.


4.6     Properties of Macro-prudential Policies

      Table 4 shows the statistical moments that characterize the macro-prudential taxes on
debt and dividends. To make the two comparable, we express the dividend tax as a percent
of the price of assets.
      The unconditional average of the debt tax is 1.07 percent, v. 0.09 when the constraint
binds and 1.09 when it does not. The tax remains positive, albeit small, on average when the
collateral constraint binds, because in some of these states the regulator wants to allocate
borrowing ability across bonds and working capital in a way that differs from the competitive
equilibrium. If there is a positive probability that the credit constraint will bind again next
period, the regulator allocates less debt capacity to bonds and more to working capital.
As a result, a tax on debt remains necessary in a subset of the constrained region. Note,
however, that these states are not associated with financial crisis events in our simulations.
They correspond to events in which the collateral constraint binds but the deleveraging that
occurs is not strong enough for a crisis to occur.
      The debt tax fluctuates about 2/3rds as much as GDP and is positively correlated with
                 −bt+1 +θwt nt
leverage, i.e.       qt K̄
                               .   This is consistent with the macro-prudential rationale behind the
tax: The tax is high when leverage is building up and low when the economy is deleveraging.

Note, however, that since leverage itself is negatively correlated with GDP, the tax also has
a negative GDP correlation. When the constraint binds, the correlation between the tax and
leverage is zero by construction, because leverage remains constant at the value of κ.
   The unconditional average of the dividend tax is negative (i.e. it is a subsidy), and it is
small at about -0.46 percent. When the constraint binds, dividends are taxed at an average
rate of about 0.52 percent, compared with an average subsidy of 0.49 percent when the
constraint does not bind. The fact that on average the regulator requires a subsidy on divi-
dends may seem puzzling, given that assets are less risky in the regulated economy. There
is another effect at work, however, because the debt tax exerts downward pressure on assets
prices by making bonds relatively more attractive, and this effect turns out to be quantita-
tively larger. Thus, since by definition the regulator’s allocations are required to support
the same asset pricing function of the competitive economy without policy intervention, the
regulator calls for a dividend subsidy on average in order to offset the effect of the debt tax
on asset prices. The variability of the tax on dividends is 0.62 percentage points, less than
1/3rds the variability of GDP. The correlation between this tax on dividends and leverage is
negative in the unconstrained region, reflecting the negative correlation between the tax on
debt and the tax on dividends explained above.
   The dynamics of the debt and dividend taxes around crisis events are shown in Figure
8. The debt tax is high relative to its average, at about 2.7 percent, at t − 2 and t − 1,
and this again reflects the macro-prudential nature of these taxes: Their goal is to reduce
borrowing so as to mitigate the magnitude of the financial crisis if bad shocks occur. At


                                              39
date t the debt tax falls to zero, and it rises again at t + 1 and t + 2 to about 2 percent. The
latter occurs because this close to the crisis the economy still remains financially fragile (i.e.
there is still a non-zero probability of agents becoming credit constrained next period). The
tax on dividends follows a similar pattern. Dividends are subsidized at a similar rate before
and after financial crises events, but they are actually taxed when crises occur. The reason
is again that the regulator needs to support the same pricing function of the competitive
equilibrium that would arise without policy intervention. Hence, with the tax on debt falling
to almost zero, there is pressure for asset prices to be higher than what that pricing function
calls for, and hence dividends need to be taxed to offset this effect.
   The macro-prudential behavior of the debt tax is intuitive and follows easily from the
precautionary behavior of the regulator we described. To complement this result, we analyze
the relationship between the conditional probability of a financial crisis and the optimal tax
on debt in our time-series simulation. Figure 9 presents a scatter diagram of the one-step
ahead probability of a crisis at time t + 1 conditional on time t against the debt tax at t
across the simulated time series. This Figure shows that there is a clear positive relationship
between the tax on debt and the one-step-ahead probability of a financial crisis. That
is, periods in which leverage is building up are associated with increasing probability of a
financial crisis, which causes the financial regulator to react introducing higher taxes on
debt. Notice also that financial crises are forecastable in the model, in the sense that the
conditional probability assigned to a financial crisis occurring within a year is 18 percent.
In the long run, however, the unconditional probability of a crisis is about 1 percent for the
financial regulator.
   On the other hand, the tax on dividends and its dynamic behavior seem less intuitive
and harder to justify as a policy instrument (i.e. proposing a tax on dividends at the
through of a financial crisis is bound to be unpopular). The two policy instruments are
required, however, in order to implement exactly the financial regulator’s allocations as a
decentralized competitive equilibrium. Moreover, the regulator’s allocations are guaranteed
to attain a level of welfare at least as high as that of the competitive equilibrium without
macro-prudential policy, since this equilibrium remains feasible to the regulator. If one takes
the debt tax and not the tax on dividends, this Pareto improvement cannot be guaranteed.

Indeed, we solved a variant of the model in which we introduced the optimal debt taxes but
left the taxes on dividends out, and found that average welfare is actually lower than without
policy intervention by -0.02 percent. This occurs because welfare in the states of nature in
which the constraint is already binding is lower than without policy intervention.26
    The state-contingent nature of the macro-prudential taxes raises a familiar criticism posed
in the context of Ramsey optimal taxation analysis: State-contingent policy schedules are
impractical because of the limited flexibility of policy-making institutions to adhere to com-
plex, pre-determined, time-varying rules for adjusting policy instruments.27 For this reason,
we studied the performance of an alternative regulated decentralized equilibrium in which
the policy rules are simple time and state-invariant taxes on debt and dividends, with tax
rates set equal to their long-run averages under the optimal macro-prudential policy.
    This simple macro-prudential framework with fixed taxes achieves smaller welfare gains
that are about 1/3rd of the welfare gains attained by the regulator’s problem (as discussed
below). But since the welfare gains of the regulator itself are small, it is more interesting to
examine the implications of this policy on economic performance. In this regard the results
are quite positive: The probability and severity of financial crises still fall sharply relative to


  26
      If we reduce the debt tax we can obtain again average welfare gains, which again illustrates the inter-
dependence of macro-prudential policies.
   27
      A related criticism is that Ramsey optimal policies are time-inconsistent, but as we explained earlier,
the financial regulator problem here is time-consistent by construction.

the competitive equilibrium, although relatively less than with the fully optimal policy (e.g.
asset prices fall 7 percent for the optimal regulator v. 12 percent with fixed taxes, and 24
percent in the decentralized equilibrium). Partial use of this simple policy, by implementing
only the fixed tax on debt, is again welfare reducing, and again the intuition is due to the
fact that debt taxes have a depressing effect on asset prices, which tightens the collateral
constraint in states where the collateral constraint already binds.
   The results for the regulator’s optimal policy and the fixed-taxes policy show that, while
our results may provide a justification for the use of macro-prudential policies, they also
provide a warning: Selective use of macro-prudential policies (i.e. partial implementation of
the policy instruments) can reduce welfare in some states of nature. In this experiment, this
happens because the selective use of the debt tax without the tax on dividends lowers asset
prices in some states of nature, and reduces welfare in those states by reducing the value of
collateral.
   Jeanne and Korinek (2010) also computed a schedule of macro-prudential taxes on debt
to correct a similar externality that arises because of a collateral constraint that depends
on asset prices. Their findings, however, are quite different, because their results show that



                                                                            42
macro-prudential taxes lessen the effects of financial crises much less than in our setup and
have no effect on the probability of crises. These different results are due to differences in
the structure of the borrowing constraints, the behavior of output, and the design of the
quantitative experiments.
      Their credit constraint is determined by the aggregate level of assets K̄ and by a linear
                                                                                bt+1

fact that this constraint depends on aggregate rather than individual asset holdings, as in
our model, matters because it implies that agents do not value additional asset holdings as a
mechanism to manage their borrowing ability.28 But more importantly, in their quantitative
analysis they set parameter values to κ = 0.046, ψ = 3.07 and qt K̄ = 4.8, which imply
that the effects of the credit constraint are driven mainly by ψ, and only 7 percent of the
borrowing ability depends on the value of assets (0.07=0.046*4.8/(0.046*4.8+3.07)). As a
result, the Fisherian deflation effect and the credit externality are weak, and thus macro-
prudential policy is not very effective at containing financial crises. The asset price drop
is reduced from 12.3 to 10.3 percent, and the consumption drop is reduced from 6.2 to 5.2
percent (compared with declines from 24 to 7 and 16 to 5 percent respectively in our model).
Moreover, since they model output (or dividends) as an exogenous, regime-switching Markov
process such that the probability of a crisis (i.e. binding credit constraint) coincides with the
probability of a bad output realization, macro-prudential policy cannot affect the probability
of crises.


4.7      Welfare Effects

      We move next to explore the welfare implications of the credit externality. To this end,
we calculate welfare costs as compensating consumption variations for each state of nature
that make agents indifferent between the allocations of the competitive equilibrium and those
attained by the financial regulator. Formally, for a given initial state (B, ε) at date 0, the

     If we adopt the same assumption in our model, and maintain the same baseline calibration, the fact
that individual agents do not value assets as collateral causes even larger asset price drops during financial
crises, and this leads agents to accumulate more precautionary savings, which results in crises having zero
probability in the long-run for both the competitive equilibrium and the financial regulator.

where the superscript DE denotes allocations in the decentralized competitive equilibrium
and the superscript SP denotes the regulator’s allocations. Note that these welfare costs
measure also the (negative of) the welfare gains that would be obtained by introducing the
regulator’s optimal debt and dividend tax policies.
   The welfare losses of the DE arise from two sources. The first source is the higher
variability of consumption, due to the fact that the credit constraint binds more often in
the DE, and when it binds it induces a larger adjustment in asset prices and consumption.
The second is the efficiency loss in production that occurs due to the effect of the credit
friction on working capital. Without the working capital constraint, the marginal disutility
of labor equals the marginal product of labor. With the working capital constraint, however,
the shadow cost of employing labor rises when the constraint binds, and this drives a wedge
between the marginal product of labor and its marginal disutility. Again, since the collateral
constraint binds more often in the DE than in the SP, this implies a larger efficiency loss.
   Figure 6 plots the welfare costs of the credit externality as a function of b for a negative,
two-standard-deviations TFP shock. These welfare costs are sharply increasing in b at the
high debt levels of the constrained region and some of the high externality region, and af-
ter that become decreasing in b and with a much flatter slope. This pattern is due to the
differences in the optimal plans of the regulator vis-a-vis private agents in the decentralized
equilibrium. Recall than in the constrained region, the current allocations of the DE es-
sentially coincide with those of the SP, as described in Figure 1. Therefore, in this region
the welfare gains from implementing the regulator’s allocations only arise from how future
allocations will differ. On the other hand, in the high-externality region, the regulator’s
allocations differ sharply from those of the DE, and this generally enlarges the welfare losses
caused by the credit externality. Notice that, since the regulator’s allocations involve more
savings and less current consumption, there are welfare losses in terms of current utility for
the regulator, but these are far outweighed by less vulnerability to sharp decreases in future

consumption during financial crises. Finally, as the level of debt is decreased further and the
economy enters the low-externality region, financial crises are unlikely and the welfare costs
of the inefficiency decrease.
   The unconditional average welfare cost computed using the DE’s ergodic distribution of
bonds and TFP is 0.046 percentage points of permanent consumption. This cost is only about
1/3rd the cost found by Bianchi (2011). Note, however, that our results are in line with his if
we express the welfare costs as a fraction of the variability of consumption. Consumption was
more volatile in his setup because he examined a calibration to data for emerging economies,
which are more volatile than the United States. Still, the welfare costs of the externality are
small in both our analysis and Bianchi’s.
   The fact that welfare losses from the externality are small although the differences in
consumption variability are large is related to the well-known Lucas result that models with
CRRA utility, trend-stationary income, and no idiosyncratic uncertainty produce low welfare
costs from consumption fluctuations. Moreover, the efficiency loss in the supply-side when
the constraint binds produces low welfare costs on average because those losses have a low

4.8      Sensitivity Analysis

      We examine now how sensitive are the effects of the credit externality to changes in the
values of the model’s key parameters. Table 5 shows the main model statistics for different
values of σ, κ, ω, θ, σε and ρε , as well as experiments in which we make κ or R stochastic and
an experiment in which we allow R to increase with aggregate bond holdings B ′ according to
an exogenous function. The Table shows the unconditional averages of the tax on debt and
the welfare loss, the covariance effect on excess returns, the probability of financial crises,
and the impact effects of a financial crisis on key macroeconomic variables for both the DE
and SP. In all of these experiments, only the parameter listed in the first column changes
and the rest of the parameters remain at their baseline calibration values. Keep in mind that
in reading this Table, differences between the DE and SP columns reflect how the parameter
changes affect the effects of the externality, while differences across rows, for a given DE or
SP column, reflect how the parameter changes affect each equilibria.
      The results of the sensitivity analysis reported in Table 5 can be understood more easily
by referring to the externality term derived in Section 2: The wedge between the social and
private marginal costs of debt that separate the optimal plans of the competitive equilibrium

                                     ∂qt+1        ∂wt+1
and the regulator, βREt µt+1 κK̄ ∂bt+1 − θnt+1 ∂bt+1 . For given β and R, the magnitude
of the externality is given by the expected product of two terms: the shadow value of
relaxing the credit constraint, µt+1 , and the associated price effects κK̄ ∂q t+1
                                                                            ∂bt+1
                                                                                   − θnt+1 ∂w t+1
                                                                                           ∂bt+1
                                                                                                  ,
which determine the effects of the externality on the ability to borrow when the constraint
                                                                               ∂qt+1
binds. As explained earlier, the price effects are driven mostly by            ∂bt+1
                                                                                     ,   because of the
documented large asset price declines when the collateral constraint binds (see Figure 1). It
follows, therefore, that the quantitative implications of the credit externality depend mainly
                                            ∂qt+1
on the parameters that affect µt+1 and      ∂bt+1
                                                  ,   as well as those that affect the probability of
hitting the constraint.
      Changes in Structural Parameters—The coefficient of relative risk aversion σ plays a key
                                        ∂qt+1
role because it affects both µt+1 and   ∂bt+1
                                              .   A high σ implies a low intertemporal elasticity of
substitution in consumption, and therefore a high value from relaxing the constraint since

                                                    46
a binding constraint hinders the ability to smooth consumption across time. A high σ
also makes the stochastic discount factors more sensitive to changes in consumption, and
therefore makes asset prices react more to changes in bond holdings. Accordingly, rising σ
from 2 to 2.5 rises the welfare cost of the credit externality by a factor of 5, and widens the
differences in the covariance effects across the DE and SP. In fact, the covariance effect in
the decentralized equilibrium increases from 0.22 to 0.37 whereas for the SP the increase is
from 0.06 to 0.08. Stronger precautionary savings reduce the probability of crises in the DE,
and financial crises become a zero-probability event in the SP. Conversely, reducing σ to 1
makes the externality small, which results in much smaller gaps in the crisis probability and
crisis impact effects across DE and SP, and negligible welfare cost of the externality.29
   The collateral coefficient κ also plays an important role because it alters the effect of asset
price changes on the borrowing ability. A higher κ implies that, for a given price response,
the change in the collateral value becomes larger. Thus, this effect makes the externality
stronger. On the other hand, a higher κ has two additional effects that go in the opposite
direction. First, a higher κ implies that the direct effect of the collateral constraint on the
asset price is weaker (recall eq. (9)), leading to a lower fall in the price of assets during crises.
Second, a higher κ makes the constraint less likely to bind, reducing the externality. The
effects of changes in κ are clearly non-monotonic. If κ is equal to zero, there is no effect of
prices on the borrowing ability. At the same time, for high enough values of κ, the constraint
never binds. In both cases, the externality does not play any role. Quantitatively, Table 5
shows that small changes in κ around the baseline value are positively associated with the
size of the externality. In particular, an increase in κ from the baseline value of 0.36 to 0.40
increases the welfare cost of the externality by a factor of 6 and financial crises again become
a zero-probability event for the regulator.
   The above results have interesting policy implications. In particular, they suggest that
while increasing credit access by rising κ may increase welfare relative to a more financially
constrained environment, rising κ can also strengthen the effects of credit externalities and
hence make macro-prudential policies more desirable (since the welfare cost of the externality
   29
      Notice that the probability of a crisis in the DE increases to almost 10 percent, more than three
times larger than the U.S. data target employed in the baseline calibration, because of the reduction in
precautionary savings (albeit at the same time the impact effects of crises are significantly more tepid).

                                                   47
also rises).
    Consider next the effects of changing the Frisch elasticity of labor supply. An elasticity
higher than the baseline (1.2 v. 1) implies that output drops more when a negative TFP shock
hits. If the credit constraint binds, this implies that consumption falls more, which increases
the marginal utility of consumption and raises the return rate at which future dividends
are discounted.30 Moreover, everything else constant, a higher labor elasticity makes the
externality term higher by weakening the effects of wages on the borrowing capacity. Hence,
a higher elasticity of labor supply is associated with higher effects from the credit externality,
captured especially by larger differences in the severity of financial crises, a higher probability
of crises, and a larger welfare cost of the credit externality.
    The fraction of wages that have to be paid in advance θ plays a subtle role. On one hand,
a larger θ increases the shadow value of relaxing the credit constraint, since this implies a
larger rise in the effective cost of hiring labor when the constraint binds. On the other hand,
a larger θ implies, ceteris paribus, a weaker effect on borrowing ability, since the reduction of
wages that occurs when the collateral constraint binds has a positive effect on the ability to
borrow. Quantitatively, increasing (decreasing) θ by 5 percent increases (decreases) slightly
the effects that reflect the size of the externality.
    Changes in the volatility and autocorrelation of TFP do not have significant effects.
Increasing the variability of TFP implies that financial crises are more likely to be triggered
by a large shock. This results in larger amplification and a higher benefit from internalizing
price effects. In general equilibrium, however, precautionary savings increase too, resulting
in a lower probability of financial crises for both DE and SP. Therefore, the overall effects
on the externality of a change in the variability of TFP depend on the relative change in
the probability of financial crisis in both equilibria and the change in the severity of these
episodes. An increase in the autocorrelation of TFP leads to more frequent financial crises
for given bond decision rules. Again, in general equilibrium, precautionary savings increase
making ambiguous the effect on the externality.

     Note: ’DE’ represents the decentralized equilibrium,‘SP’ represents the social planner/financial regulator. The average tax on debt corresponds to the
     average value of the state contingent tax on debt to decentralize the financial regulator allocations. The covariance effect represents the unconditional
     average of the covariance effect. Consumption, credit, asset prices and output are responses of these variables on impact during a financial crisis (see
     section 4.4 for a definition of the event analysis). The baseline parameter values are: R − 1 = 0.028, β = 0.96, σ = 2, αh = 0.64, χ = 0.64, ω = 1, K̄ =
     1, θ = 0.14, κ = 0.36, αK = 0.05, σε = 0.014, ρε = 0.53.
   Collateral Shocks and Interest Rate Shocks — We consider now additional sources of
uncertainty. First, we consider shocks that affect directly the collateral constraint by intro-
ducing a stochastic process for κ that follows a symmetric two-state Markov chain indepen-
dent from TFP shocks. In line with evidence from Mendoza and Terrones (2008) on the
mean duration of credit booms in industrial countries, we calibrate the probabilities of the
Markov chain so that the average duration of each state is 7 years. We keep the average
value of κ as in our benchmark model and consider fluctuations of κ of 10 percent. Under
these assumptions, the collateral constraint only binds when κ takes the smallest value in
the vector of Markov realizations. As shown in Table 5, the effects of the externality do not
change significantly. Intuitively, this occurs again because shocks to κ strengthen incentives
for precautionary savings for both DE and SP, and thus the effects of the externality are
negligible.
   Next we consider shocks to the real interest rate. We calibrate interest rate shocks using
the ex-post real return of 3-month U.S. Treasury Bills , as a proxy for risk-free assets. This
yields an interest rate process at the business cycle frequency with a standard deviation of 2
percent and an insignificant correlation with GDP. Thus, we assume the interest rate process
is independent of TFP (in the model the correlation between output and R is -0.03 v. 0.005
in the data). As row (15) of Table 5 shows, this stochastic interest rate increases significantly
the effects of the externality. Intuitively, periods of low interest rates, such as those observed
in the United States before the 2008 crash, encourage a credit boom and a larger build-up
of leverage in good times, which result in more severe effects on the economy when it enters
a financial crises.
   Endogenous Interest Rate — In this last sensitivity experiment, we consider a real inter-
est rate that varies with aggregate bond holdings following an exogenous function. In our
baseline model, there is a perfectly elastic supply of funds at a constant rate R. Consider
instead a scenario in which households collectively affect the world interest rate, so that R
depends on the aggregate bond holdings B ′ . In particular, we consider an interest rate such




                                               50
                               ′
that r(B ′ ) = r + ̺(e(B−B ) − 1).       31
                                              With ̺ > 0, the interest rate increases as B ′ increases.
We set the value of B equal to the mean value of bonds in the decentralized equilibrium
with constant interest rate, and set ̺ to match the standard deviation of the interest rate
in the data. In principle, this could work to attenuate the Fisherian deflation and the fire-
sale externality, because of the endogenous self-correcting mechanism increasing the cost of
borrowing as debt increases, but we found that the quantitative effects produced by our
baseline remain largely unchanged. As Table 5 shows, except for a modest decline in the
gap in the probability of a financial crisis and risk premium across DE and SP, the effects
of the externality remain about the same.
    Summary —Overall, the results of this sensitivity analysis show that parameter changes
that weaken the model’s financial amplification mechanism also weaken the magnitude of
the externality. This results in smaller average taxes, smaller welfare costs and smaller
differences in the incidence and severity of financial crises. The coefficient of risk aversion is
particularly important also because it influences directly the price elasticity of asset demand,
and hence it determines how much asset prices can be affected by the credit externality.
This parameter plays a role akin to that of to the elasticity of substitution in consumption
of tradables and non-tradables in Bianchi (2011), because in his model this elasticity drives
the response of the price at which the collateral is valued. Accordingly, he found that the
credit externality has significant effects only if the elasticity is sufficiently low.
    The results of the sensitivity analysis also produce an important additional finding: The
average debt tax of about 1.1 percent is largely robust to the parameter variations we con-
sidered. Except for the scenario that approximates logarithmic utility (σ = 1), in all other
scenarios included in Table 5 the mean tax ranges between 1.01 and 1.2 percent.

     Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2003) make this assumption to avoid the problem of the unit root that arises
when small open economy models are linearized around the steady state. Its purpose here is to allow us to
approximate what would happen if we were to allow for the interest rate to respond to debt choices in a
richer general equilibrium model. To make the analysis more comparable with our baseline, and in order to
focus on the fire-sale externality, we do not allow the regulator to internalize its effects on the interest rate.
Doing so, would only strengthen our results about the role of macro-prudential policy.

5     Conclusion

    This paper examined the positive and normative effects of a credit externality in a dy-
namic stochastic general equilibrium model in which a collateral constraint limits access to
debt and working capital to a fraction of the market value of an asset in fixed supply. We
compared the allocations and welfare attained by private agents in a competitive equilibrium,
in which agents face this constraint taking prices as given, with those attained by a financial
regulator who faces the same borrowing limits but takes into account how current borrowing
choices affect future asset prices and wages. This regulator internalizes the debt-deflation
process that drives macroeconomic dynamics during financial crises, and hence borrows less
in periods in which the collateral constraint does not bind, so as to weaken the debt-deflation
process in the states in which the constraint becomes binding. Conversely, private agents
overborrow in periods in which the constraint does not bind, and hence are exposed to the
stronger adverse effects of the debt-deflation mechanism when a financial crisis occurs.
    Our analysis quantifies the effects of the credit externality in a setup in which the credit
friction has effects on both aggregate demand and supply. On the demand side, consumption
drops as access to debt becomes constrained, and this induces an endogenous increase in
excess returns that leads to a decline in asset prices. Because collateral is valued at market
prices, the drop in asset prices tightens the collateral constraint further and leads to fire-
sales of assets and a spiraling decline in asset prices, consumption and debt. On the supply
side, production and labor demand are affected by the collateral constraint because firms
buy labor using working capital loans that are limited by the collateral constraint, and hence
when the constraint binds the effective cost of labor rises, so the demand for labor and output
drops. This affects dividend rates and hence feeds back into asset prices. Previous studies
in the Macro/Finance literature have shown how these mechanisms can produce financial
crises with features similar to actual financial crises, but the literature had not conducted a
quantitative analysis comparing regulated v. competitive equilibria in an equilibrium model
of business cycles and asset prices.
    We conducted a quantitative analysis in a version of the model calibrated to U.S. data.
This analysis showed that, even though the credit externality results in only slightly larger


                                              52
average ratios of debt and leverage to output compared with the regulator’s allocations, the
credit externality does produce financial crises that are significantly more severe and more
frequent than in the regulated equilibrium, and produces higher long-run business cycle
variability. There are also important asset pricing implications. In particular, the credit
externality and its associated higher macroeconomic volatility in the competitive equilibrium
produce equity premia, Sharpe ratios, and market price of risk that are much larger than
in the regulated economy. We also found that the degree of risk aversion plays a key role
in our results, because it is a key determinant of the response of asset prices to volatility
in dividends and stochastic discount factors. For the credit externality to be important,
these price responses need to be nontrivial, and we found that they are nontrivial already at
commonly used risk aversion parameters, and larger at larger risk aversion coefficients that
are still in the range of existing estimates.
   This analysis has important policy implications. In particular, the financial regulator
can decentralize its optimal allocations as a competitive equilibrium by introducing state-
contingent schedules of taxes on debt and dividends. By doing so, it can neutralize the credit
externality and produce an increase in social welfare. In our calibrated model, the tax on
debt necessary to attain this outcome is about 1 percent on average. The tax is higher when
the economy is building up leverage and becoming vulnerable to a financial crisis, but before
a crisis actually occurs, so as to induce private agents to value more the accumulation of
precautionary savings than they do in the competitive equilibrium without taxes.
   These findings are relevant for the ongoing debate on the design of new financial regulation
to prevent financial crises, which emphasizes the need for “macro-prudential” regulation. Our
results lend support to this approach by showing how to construct policy rules that can tackle
credit externalities associated with fire-sales of assets with large adverse macroeconomic
effects. At the same time, however, we acknowledge that actual implementation of macro-
prudential policies remains a challenging task. In particular, the optimal design of these
policies requires detailed information on a variety of credit constraints that private agents
and the financial sector face, real-time data on their leverage positions, and access to a rich set
of state-contingent policy instruments. Moreover, as we showed in this paper, implementing
only a subset of the optimal policies because of these limitations (or limitations of the political


                                                53
process) can reduce welfare in some states. On the other hand, we did find that rules simpler
than the optimal state-contingent taxes, such as time-invariant taxes on debt and dividends,
can still reduce noticeable the incidence and magnitude of financial crises.

    We solve the model using a time iteration algorithm developed by Coleman (1990) modi-
fied to address the occasionally binding endogenous constraint. The algorithm follows these
steps:32

   1. Generate a discrete grid for the economy’s bond position Gb = {b1, b2 , ...bM } and the
       shock state space Gε = {ε1, ε2 , ...εN } and choose an interpolation scheme for evaluating
       the functions outside the grid of bonds. We use 300 points in the grid for bonds and
       interpolate the functions using a piecewise linear approximation.

   2. Conjecture BK (b, ε), qK (b, ε), CK (b, ε), NK (b, ε), µK (b, ε) at time K ∀ b ∈ Gb and ∀ ε ∈
       Gε .

   3. Set j = 1

   4. Solve for the values of BK−j (b, ε), qK−j (b, ε), CK−j (b, ε), NK−j (b, ε), µK−j (b, ε) at time
       K − j using (22),(23),(24),(25), (26) and BK−j+1(b, ε), qK−j+1(b, ε), CK−j+1(b, ε),
       NK−j+1(b, ε), µK−j+1(b, ε)∀ b ∈ Gb and ∀ Y ∈ GY :

     For the financial regulator’s allocations, we use the same algorithm operating on the regulator’s opti-
mality conditions.

   (a) Assume collateral constraint (23) is not binding. Set µK−j (b, ε) = 0 and solve for
       NK−j (b, ε) using (25). Solve for BK−j (b, ε) and CK−j (b, ε) using (22) and(24) and
       a root finding algorithm.

   (c) If constraint is satisfied, move to next grid point.

   (d) Otherwise, solve for µ(b, ε), NK−J (b, ε), BK−j (b, ε) using (23), (24) and(25) with
       equality.

5. Evaluate convergence. If supB,ε kxK−j (B, ε) − xK−j+1(B, ε)k < ǫ for x =B, C, q, µ, N
  we have found the competitive equilibrium. Otherwise, set xK−j (B, ε) = xK−j+1(B, ε)
  and j     j + 1 and go to step 4.
