Does Market Experience Eliminate Market Anomalies? The Case of Exogenous Market Experience

JEL No. C93,D01,Q5

                                           ABSTRACT

A vibrant literature has emerged that suggests willingness to pay and willingness to accept measures
of value are quite different for inexperienced consumers but that value differences erode with market
experience. One potential shortcoming of this literature is that market experience is endogenous.
This study presents a framed field experiment that exogenously induces market experience. Empirical
findings support the premise that market experience, alone, can eliminate an important market anomaly.

   Nearly three decades ago, a substantial body of empirical evidence began to develop that

provided evidence that willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA) measures of

value were quite different. Typically, these studies found that WTA measures were substantially

greater than WTP measures for the same commodity (see, e.g., Judd Hammack and Gardner M.

Brown, 1974). The initial reaction of many economists was to argue that the results were a

survey artifact and that WTA estimates were unreliable and should not be treated seriously.

       The difference between WTP and WTA value measures, however, has proven to be

robust across a wide variety of experimental protocols and goods – from neoteric goods, such as

irradiated sandwiches, to common goods, such as chocolate bars and coffee mugs. Whether

preferences are defined over consumption levels or changes in consumption has serious

implications for the discipline of economics. In a normative sense, the basic independence

assumption (that preferences are orthogonal to current entitlements), which is used in most

theoretical and applied economic models to assess the operation of markets, is directly refuted. In

a positive sense, the disparity has considerable relevance. For example, these findings call into

question commonly held interpretations of indifference curves, make cost-benefit analysis

illegitimate, and change the procedure necessary to resolve damage disputes.

       While the major theory to explain such differences in measures of value is prospect

theory, where gains are more heavily weighted than losses, one can potentially reconcile the

value disparity with neoclassical theory. Consider Alan Randall and John R. Stoll’s (1980)

‘‘price flexibility of income,’’ which is analytically equivalent to the ratio of the ordinary income

elasticity of demand for the good to the Allen-Uzawa elasticity of substitution between the good

and the numeraire. Thus, for low elasticity of substitution values, which may adequately describe

many non-marketed goods and services, the ‘‘price flexibility of income’’ is large, suggesting
that the WTA/WTP ratio is also large. Many commentators concur with this point, but have

argued that the observed disparities are too large to be explained by standard neoclassical

arguments.

       This uncertainty about the applicability of Hicksian theory has motivated the

experimental work of, for example, Jack L. Knetsch (1989), Ian Bateman et al. (1997), and John

A. List (2003, 2004a), who ask subjects to (implicitly) rank two goods. The ranking, by

definition, controls for all Hicksian income and substitution effects. For my purposes, the results

in List (2003, 2004a) are the most relevant, since they show that market experience has an

important influence on the shape and magnitude of the disparity. In particular, in his pair of

studies List (2003, 2004a) reports that market experience measured by activity in naturally-

occurring trading markets for pins, sports card, and sports memorabilia leads to behavior that is

not significantly different from neoclassical expectations.

       Even though the thrust of List’s experience results have been broadly replicated in both

the lab and the field (see, e.g., Lei Feng and Mark S. Seasholes (2005); Deborah A. Kermer et al.

(2006); Ravi Dhar and Ning Zhu (2006); Alistair Munro and Yannick Ferreira De Sousa (2008);

Robin Greenwood and Stefan Nagel (2009); Simon Gächter et al. (2009); Hyuk Choe and

Yunsong Eom (2009); Dirk Engelmann and Guillaume Hollard (2010); Amit Seru, Tyler

Shumway, and Noah Stoffman (2010)), one nagging issue is that individual market experience is

endogenous; that is, while List attempts to econometrically parse treatment (market experience)

from selection, his results rely on his modeling assumptions. This paper attempts to rectify this

issue by making market experience exogenous. I do so by returning to the sportscard market and

exogenously inducing a random sample of subjects to enter the sportscard market and make
trades (i.e., gain experience). I then follow the subjects over a six month period and at the end of

this period test for market experience effects via a field experiment.

       The data for this study are gathered in three distinct experiments within a six month

period—September of 2007 and February of 2008. By using several measures to ensure that

subjects will return for the follow-up experiments, I am able to avoid the attrition problems

present in other longitudinal studies. In this way, I am able to induce experience in a natural way

in a natural environment.

       My results can be simply stated: there is evidence that market experience eliminates the

value disparity. For example, subjects who were induced to enter the market after the September

experiment were significantly more willing to trade their wares in the second and third

experiments than those who were not induced into the market. This result suggests that market

experience alone can attenuate an important market anomaly. Interestingly, although the results

are broadly consistent, I find that more market experience is needed to overcome the market

anomaly than, for example, the lab results in Engelmann and Hollard (2010) suggest. This is an

important area for future research, as it might be the case that when one focuses on a specific

task or treatment in the lab the attention paid to that one dimension takes on a greater meaning

and import than if one does the same in environments with multiple stimuli.

                                     II. Experimental Design

       The initial experiment was run at a sportscard show in a suburb of Chicago, Illinois in

September 2007. The design of the actual experiment followed List (2003) closely. In one

treatment the subject is endowed with good A and has the option to trade it for good B. In a

second treatment, a different subject is endowed with good B and has the option to trade it for

good A. Since subjects are allocated to one of the two treatments randomly, if p percent trade
good A for good B, then (1-p) percent should trade good B for good A. That is, for equal valued

goods, approximately 50 percent of the subjects should trade their good. Alternatively, if an

endowment effect exists, considerably fewer than 50 percent of the subjects should trade their

good. In Knetsch (1989), the evidence in favor of the endowment effect is sharp: 89 percent of

those originally endowed with a mug chose to keep the mug, and 90 percent of those endowed

with a chocolate bar decided to keep the chocolate bar. List (2003) found similar results for his

highly inexperienced subjects.

       What differed from List (2003) in the September experiment is the recruiting process. In

Step 1, I approached potential subjects entering the sportscard show and inquired about their

interest in filling out a survey that would take about five minutes (the survey was similar to List

(2003), and obtained information on market experience). If the individual agreed, I briefly

explained that in return for completing the survey the subject would receive good A (or good B),

where the goods were sports memorabilia. After physically giving the subject either good A or

B, the subject proceeded to fill out the survey (in this way, in the parlance of Glenn Harrison and

List, 2004, I am executing a framed field experiment).

       In Step 2, I first ascertained whether the subject could be considered very inexperienced;

that is, had zero executed trades in a typical month. If the subject fell into this category, I asked

the subject if he would be available for at most three follow-up experiments between September

and February. If the individual agreed, then I asked him to sign an affidavit in which he promised

to participate again in future experiments. If the individual had executed previous trades in the

market, disagreed with being available for a follow-up experiment, or would not sign the

affidavit, then he was placed in an unrelated experiment.
       For those who signed the affidavit to participate in a future experiment, I retrieved the

other good from under the table and informed the subject that he had the opportunity to trade

good A for good B, or vice versa. I allowed the subject to inspect both goods; after which the

subject either consummated a trade or kept the original good. In Step 3 I randomly allocated

subjects into one of two treatment cells: experience and noexperience. The delineation was

changed at the top of each hour, so subjects’ treatment type was determined exogenously based

on the time they visited my dealer’s table. For the experience subjects, I provided a “parting gift”

of approximately $25 worth of sportscards and memorabilia in Step 4 of the experiment.

       In each subject’s gift bundle, I included several items designed to engage the subject in

the marketplace; in theory, the items could yield several dozen trades. The monitor informed

subjects in this treatment group that the gifts were theirs to keep, and they could sell or trade the

gifts in the marketplace or take them home. The monitor stressed that dealers at the show were

interested in the goods and that the goods had a book value of approximately $25. Furthermore,

in an effort to ensure that the local dealers would have an interest in buying and trading with

these subjects, prior to the show the monitor discussed various items with the dealers attending

the show to determine the appropriate composition of the gift packages. In practice, to motivate

these agents to engage in buying, selling, and trading in the live marketplace, I gave them a

lottery ticket for every trade that they executed (local dealers gave receipts for verification). The

lottery took place after the final experiment in February, and the winner received $500.

       Treatment noexperience was identical to the experience treatment except that in Step 4

the monitor closed the experiment by thanking the subject for his or her participation, and no

“parting gift” was provided.
        To gather the experimental evidence necessary to analyze the learning issue, I returned to

the same sportscard show in early December and ran an identical experiment using the same

subject pool, identical experimental procedures, but different goods. To recruit the same subjects,

I telephoned and/or e-mailed all of the subjects who participated in the first September sportscard

show experiment. Again, to close the experiment I gave the experience subjects a parting gift of

approximately $25 worth of sportscards and memorabilia and they were incented to trade via

lottery tickets. In total, all 29 people earned at least one lottery ticket.

        To complete the experimental design, I returned to the same sportscard show in February

and ran an identical experiment using the same subject pool, identical experimental procedures,

but different goods. To recruit the same subjects, I again telephoned and/or e-mailed all of the

subjects who participated in the first September sportscard show experiment.

        A few noteworthy aspects of the design should be mentioned before I move to the results

summary. First, the type of good (A or B) was changed at the top of each hour, so subjects’

treatment type was determined based on the time they visited the table at the card show. Second,

since I ask subjects to (implicitly) rank the two goods, by definition I am controlling for all

Hicksian income and substitution effects. Third, I was careful in choosing goods the individual

would actually consume, rather than put up for trade or sale immediately after the transaction.

        Fourth, note that I use a selection rule to attenuate attrition: I only choose people who

agreed to come back again and again to be part of this experiment. This design choice does not

present a problem provided such people are not more likely to show experience affects: that is,

provided the people who signed the affidavit are not more or less likely to learn to overcome the

endowment effect this approach is fine. Finally, I still worried about attrition given the problems

List and Millimet (2008) faced using a similar recruiting procedure. I therefore informed
participants that I would draw 20 names in February. All 20 people who were drawn, and

showed up for all experiments, were paid $500. This lottery was in addition to the lottery that I

ran for those incentivized to trade in the 6 months.

                                     III. Experimental Results

        Table 1 provides an overview of the results. The Table places the 60 subjects in their

bins: 30 subjects in the noexperience treatment and 30 in the experience treatment. A first

consideration is that the experimental design was able to balance subjects across treatment and

control: 13.3 percent of subjects in the noexperience treatment traded in the September

experiment, whereas 10 percent in the experience treatment traded. These trading rates are not

different at conventional levels using a test of proportions.

        Equally as important, these trading rates suggest that under-trading occurred. Given that

subjects were randomly allocated either good A or good B, equivalence of WTA and WTP

would imply that approximately half of the goods were improperly allocated and should be

traded. The actual percentages of subjects who chose to trade was roughly 10-13 percent,

suggesting that WTA > WTP. These figures suggest that once endowed with one of the goods

the subjects were roughly 10 times more likely to select that good (computed as ½((PA|A/PA|B) +

(PB|B/PB|A)).

        Second, the experimental design was able to attenuate attrition: overall, only 2 people

dropped out completely after the September experiment and only one other person missed the

December experiment. The results summarized in Table 1 are robust to allowing these subjects

to behave in a manner that refutes the learning hypothesis (i.e., those agents in the noexperience

treatment traded in the latter experiments and those in the experience treatment did not).
        Third, there is considerable evidence in favor of market experience influencing the

trading rate. When comparing the trading rates across the noexperience and experience

treatments, there is a clear departure in trading patterns: whereas the September rates are not

significantly different, differences in the February rates are statistically significant at

conventional levels (z=-2.71). In addition, when I examine within person trading rates I find that

significantly more people who did not trade in the September experiment opted to trade in the

February experiment in the experience treatment.

        My finding that individual under-trading can dissipate after six months of trading

experience strikes me as a large treatment effect, though it is smaller than the recent laboratory

results of Engelmann and Hollard (2010). Combining this large effect with the fact that subjects

over-traded in the February experiment deserves further explanation. At least three factors might

be driving my results: i) market experience is indeed strong enough to lead to considerably

higher trading rates, ii) the manner in which the design was executed lead to an experimenter-

demand effect that yielded higher trading rates over time (subjects in the experience treatment,

who were incented to trade over the six month period felt it apropos to trade in the experiment),

and iii) the sample sizes are small, which can yield such results simply due to chance.

Notes:
a. Percent traded provides the percentage of subjects who traded their endowed good for the alternative in the
    experiment.
b. Test of proportions has a null hypothesis of no treatment effect. For example, the first test measures the
    noexperience September trading rate against the experience September trading rate. A z-value of 0.40 suggests
    that the trading rates are not different at conventional levels.



                                               IV. Conclusions

        Previous field experiments show that market experience and the endowment effect are

negatively associated. Their designs typically capture the distinction between consumers who

had previous market experience and those who have had little rigorous market experience. While

performance differentials across these groups lend insights into the rational choice behavior of

individuals in and out of the sportscard market, self-selection of individuals into trading in the

sportscard trading market prohibits one from drawing strong conclusions concerning the causal

effect of market experience on rational behavior.

        This study amends this potential shortcoming by making market experience exogenous.

In doing so, I find that the major result of previous work is confirmed: as market experience

intensifies, behavior approaches neoclassical expectations. Beyond its deep implications for

economic theory, the lessening of the value disparity has important implications for damage

assessment and benefit cost analysis. For example, how might one wish to think about using such

findings to assess the value of ecosystem damages, such as oil spills?

        Using experiments that measure statements of value rather than trading rates, John A.

List (2004b) finds that less experienced subjects state much higher WTA figures than more

experienced subjects, which induces the value divergence to lessen for experienced subjects:

WTA is approximately $17 less, while their WTP is generally only $2-$4 greater. This is
consonant with the notion that people overestimate the pain of giving something up because of

an affective forecasting error (see Kermer et al., 2006, for similar results in the lab).

       Such results give one hope that it is possible to calibrate the results of contingent

valuation survey data. Using the List (2004b) results as an example, true valuation would be a

weighted average of WTP and WTA, with the weights being derived from the experiment: true

valuation = (17*WTP + 3*WTA)/20 in this case. This approach highlights that by using a real-

market methodology for private goods, one can discover general principles (e.g., for

inexperienced agents, stated WTP is a more reliable guide to “true” preferences than stated

WTA) that can be applied to stated-preference methods for public goods. Much more research is

necessary, clearly, before adopting such an approach.
