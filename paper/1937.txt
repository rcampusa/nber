             Marginal Costs of Income Redistribution at the State Level




                                      ABSTRACT



     Previous analyses of the cost of redistribution by a unitary government

have focussed on the welfare losses of distorted labor supply choices. On the

other hand, the analysis of redistribution b,y local qovernments in a federal

system has emphasized the effect of the migration of taxpayers and transfer

recipients in raising the cost (faced by state residents) of engaging in more

redistribution. This paper combines both migration and labor supply effects

to compute marginal redistribution costs at the state and federal level.

Surprisingly, for a wide range of parameter values, states face lower

redistribution costs than the national government because they are able to

"export" some of the cost through lower federal tax revenue. The normative

implication of the analysis is that any case for national redistribution

policies must be based on benefit spillovers across state lines rather than on

tax competition among state governments.

I.   Introduction



     The question of the appropriate level of government to undertake income

redistribution is receiving renewed attention from economists in the light of

President Reagan's desire to devolve some income redistribution

responsibilities from the federal government to the states. In a recent

paper, Brown and Oates (1984) show, using a formal public choice model, that

the possibility of migration between states leads to suboptimal transfer

levels even when taxpayers care only about transfer recipients within their

own states. With benefit spillovers across states, the argument for federal

responsibility for redistribution is, presumably, even stronger.

     Gramlich (1985) also argues that migration is strong enough to lead to

suboptirnal levels of transfers at the state level because states with low

benefit   levels will be able to "export" their poor, increasing the cost of
redistribution   to high—benefit states. Gramlich's conclusion is based on the

empirical work in Gramlich and Laren (1984) which finds that the migration

effect is "very strong".... "though only in the very long run." (1984, p.

510). The implicit argument is that migration raises the cost of

redistribution at the state level compared to the federal level.1

     Another line of inquiry has sought to uncover empirically the effect of

state tax and expenditure policies on state income levels. Helms (1985), uses

time series - cross section data on state expenditure and tax policies, and

finds that, while spending on public services (schools, highways, etc.)

increases personal income, increased state transfer payments financed by state

taxes significantly reduce personal income. The cause of the reduction is

presumably a combination of migration and incentive effects. Indeed, Helms'

estimates indicate a very large response to transfer spending; one more dollar
                                        2



of   transfers reduces state personal income in the long run by $14.83. Helms

concludes,

               "States which seek to devote substantial tax revenues to transfer

          payments will experience significantly reduced growth prospects,

          which limits the scope for redistribution at the state and local

           levels."

      The purpose of this paper is to estimate the cost of a marginal increase

in income redistribution for a state under various assumptions about migration

and labor supply elasticities and to compare these costs to the marginal cost

of redistribution at the federal level. The somewhat surprising result of the

analysis is that states face lower costs of redistribution than the federal

government in many plausible cases. The intuition behind this result is that

part of the cost of redistribution can be "exported" to other states because

federal tax revenues fall as the state's income falls. However, no conclusion

can be made about the appropriate level of government to undertake income

redistribution since that question depends also on the extent of benefit

spillovers (how much are the residents of one state better off when the

incomes of the poor in another state are raised?).

      Section II of the paper introduces the model used to estimate marginal

redistribution   costs in the context of a single jurisduction. Section III
extends the model to a federal system and estimates costs of state
redistribution. Section IV concludes.

II. A Simple Model With One Jurisdiction



      Before introducing the complication of a federal system of taxes and

expenditures, it is useful to present the basic model used to compute the

marginal cost of income redistribution. The model necessarily abstracts from

many features of reality in order to be easily understood and manipulated.

Thus, the results of the model should be considered more suggestive than

conclusi ye.

      Current net income of household i, including the effects of existing

taxes and transfers, is denoted by Y., i = 1, n. Since we restrict our

attention to incremental changes in redistribution financed by taxes on labor

income alone, gross taxable income should be interpreted as labor earnings,

WL1, where W. is the gross return to each unit of labor, L1, supplied to the

market. Although the global budget constraint facing the household is highly

non—linear, due to the complex system of taxes and transfers now in place, it

can be approximated locally by the linear constraint V1 =   B1
                                                                 +
                                                                     (l-t1)   W1L1.
Hence B1 is the "virtual income" of household i and t1 is its marginal tax

rate. Small changes in the tax-transfer system can be represented by changes

in the parameters of this linear budget constraint, which is the local

approximation to the global non—linear budget constraint.

      The response of labor supply, Li, to small changes in t and B1 is

pararneterized as follows:


                     W. L.
(1)       W1dL1 =   — it     dt1 —   C
                                         dB1.



      Equation (1) can be easily interpreted. The left hand side is the change

in gross labor income induced by tax and transfer changes which, in this
                                                 4



partial equilibrium analysis, are assumed not to affect the gross return,

W1. The first term on the right is the response to changes in the marginal

tax rate, t1, as parameterized by            ,   the   uncompensated elasticity of supply

of L with respect to net wages, W1(1_t). Note that for a given value of c

the effect of dt is greater the larger is t. because a given change in the
tax rate implies a greater percentage change in net factor returns. The

second term on the right hand side of (1) is the pure income effect of changes

in B1; the parameter C is the marginal propensity to consume leisure out of

unearned income.

      Suppose the government attempts to increase marginally the current amount

of redistribution by imposing a uniform additional tax, dt, on labor incomes

of all households to finance a uniform addition, dB, to every household's

virtual income.2 In other words, redistribution at the margin is undertaken

by a dernogrant financed by proportional taxes on labor income. Of course, the

amount of the demogrant dB depends on additional tax revenue, by the marginal

government budget constraint:


                    n
(2)        ndB =         [(WL.)dt
                            1 1
                                    +
                                        t.W.dL1].
                   1=1


The left—hand side of (2) is total demogrants paid, or ndB. The right-hand

side of (2) expresses the change in tax revenue as the sum of the additional

tax rate, dt, applied to current taxable income, and the current marginal tax

rate, t., applied to the change in factor income induced by the new policy.

Second-order terms are omitted.

      Substituting (2) into (1) and rearranging yields:
                                                    5




                       [W.L.
                        .11     (1 —   ct./1-t.)]
                                        1      1
 (3)
             dt        En   C Et1)j


Equation (3) is related to the slope of the Laffer curve; it gives the

additional per capita transfer (dB) produced by an incremental tax (dt). When

factor supplies are completely unresponsive to any economic variable

 (c =     = 0),   then dB is just average taxable income (the revenue produced by a
                       dt
100% tax).

        The marqinal cost of redistribution can be thought of as the cost induced

by these marginal policies per unit of benefit. One measure of the cost is

the change in the total income of society,                     dY1, with the corresponding
                                                           1

measure of the benefit being the income gained by the low income households.

These are measures of market income gains and losses and do not include the

welfare effects of changes in leisure. A better measure, therefore, compares

the social cost (welfare loss) of redistribution to the welfare gained by

households at the bottom. Both measures are presented below.

        The change in the net income of any one household induced by the marginal

policy changes is:



            dY. = [Q(1 —         (1—t.) C) —
(4)
                                               WL       (1÷c)] dt



where       dB/dt, as given by (3). Equation (4) states that income of

household i rises by the amount of the additional demogrant (Qdt) but falls by

the    amount of additional taxes on the original income (W1Ldt) plus the change
in after—tax income induced by the behavioral response to the policy change
[— (1—t. ) C       —
                        6W L1   ]dt.
                                                         6



      The change in the welfare of any one household, dZ1, induced by the

marginal policy changes is' just the change in net transfers less the

additional welfare cost (excess burden) of the marginal redistribution. Since

this last term is the tax revenue lost by the compensated change in labor

supply, we have



           dZ. = dB.         W.L.dt.            t.W.dL.
(5)          1       1
                         -
                              11 1
                                           -
                                                 11 1
                                               ct W L.
                 + [-CW1L1t1dt1        —
                                                          dt]

In (5), the first three terms are the change in net transfers while the terms

in square brackets are the excess burden of the tax increase.3

      The change in welfare for any household subject to the marginal

redistribution policy of a demogrant financed by a proportional tax can be

found by substituting dB           dB =         Qdt,     dt1 =   dt,   and equation (1) into (5):



(6)        dZ1 = (Q — W L )(1-i-Ct )dt



The effect of a marginal redistribution on the income and welfare is computed

in two steps. First, the demogrant that can be financed by a marginal increse

in taxation, dt, is calculated using (3). Then, that value of Q is used to

compute the impact on income and welfare of each household, according to (4)

and (6). The information needed for these calculations is labor income, W1L,

and marginal tax rates, t, for each household as well as values of C and c.

The data set used is the March, 1976 Current Population Survey with

imputations of transfers and taxes as described in Browning and Johnson

(1984). Labor income is given directly for each household; marginal tax rates
                                       7




have been computed by relating changes in after—tax, after-transfer income to

changes in before-tax, before—transfer income by $1000 income brackets.

Different marginal tax rates are computed for households with aged heads and

for different household sizes. Thus, marginal tax rates include the effect of

benefit reductions in transfer programs.

      Reasonable values for   and C must also be established. The

uncompensated elasticity of labor supply, c,   is   assumed to fall between —.2

and .4 with the negative elasticity sometimes estimated for men more than

offset by the substantial positive wage elasticities estimated for women.4

The marginal propensity to consume leisure, C, is a less familiar concept but

can be related to the income elasticity of labor supply by



(7)         C =   — (1—8)


where y is the pure income elasticity of labor supply and 8 is the share of

leisure in full income. If e is roughly .5 then C is roughly half the income

elasticity of labor supply. A range of C between 0 and .4 is chosen.5 Recall

that C is the fraction of an additional dollar of pure income spent on

lei sure.

      To distill the changes in income and welfare of many thousands of

households into an easily comprehensible form, the total welfare (or income)

change for all households is divided by the welfare (or income) change for

those households in the bottom quintile of the income    distribution.   This

ratio assumes the value of zero when redistribution is a zero—sum game (that

is, socially costless) and can be interpreted as the social cost of increasing

the bottom quintile's welfare (or income) by one dollar.
                                       8




    Table 1 displays the two measures of the cost of redistribution faced by

a single jurisdiction for a range of values of C and c.    Obviously the cost

is zero when labor supply does not respond to changes in t or B (that is, the

loss in income to the top four quintiles equals the gain to the lowest

quintile.). As expected, the cost is quite sensitive to the labor supply

parameters C and c. Table 1 also shows that the marginal cost of

redistribution can be substantial even when labor supply is fairly

inelastic. To put the marginal costs of redistribution into perspective,

consider Okun's (1975) vivid "leaky bucket" image. The cost of redistribution

is the amount of water (welfare) which leaks from the bucket as it is carried

from rich to poor. For labor supply parameters C = .1 and c =   .1,   43% of the

(marginal) welfare disappears before it reaches the poor (.76/1.76 = 43%).

The corresponding leakage in income terms is 65%.




III. Redistribution In A Federal System



     We turn now to consider the costs of redistribution for both local and

national governments in a federal system. For simplicity, state and local

governments -are not distinguished in the model ; all local taxes and

redistributive expenditures are attributed to the state. Another crucial

assumption is that each state is "small" relative to the entire country in the

sense that one state's taxing and spending policies have a negligable effect

on the tax and spending policies of the national government.    In other words,

a change in federal revenue caused by one state's policies does not affect the

well-being of the residents of that state. Finally, each state is assumed to

take other states' behavior as given in making its choices; the Nash
                                          9



equilbrium concept might be invoked to justify this assumption.6

     The most important difference between state and federal taxation is that

factors of production are more mobile between states than between countries.

In fact, no international mobility is assumed. This is clearly reasonable for

labor resources but less so for capital, since U.S. residents can invest their

capital outside the country and avoid some taxes that fall on capital where it

is used rather than where the recipient of its income lives (e.g., property

taxes). Still, some taxes on capital income cannot be fully avoided by moving

capital abroad (e.g., individual income tax). Given the complexity of the

taxation of capital and ignorance about the elasticity of capital flows among

taxing jurisdictions, it is probably best to focus on the taxation of labor

income for the time being.

     The mobility of labor between states is assumed to be a function of

changes in after—tax (and transfer) incomes. Specifically, if a change in a

state's tax or transfer policies, evaluated at the current level of labor

supply, changes net income by X %,   it   will induce a change of   X % in the

number of residents. Hence, r is the migration elasticity, which is assumed

to characterize residents at all income levels. An increase in state taxes

used to finance more redistribution will reduce the net income of high-income

citizens (X < 0) and induce out-migration. The same policy enhances the

incomes of low-income residents (X > 0) and so induces in—migration.

     Most   of the recent research on migration responses to redistribution
focusses on the behavior of transfer recipients. Gramlich and Laren (1984)
estimate the elasticity of transfer recipient populations with respect to

benefits levels, with results for various models and data sets ranging from

.11 to 1.7. Blank (1984) has also estimated the migratory response of

transfer recipients to changes in benefit levels. For example, she estimates
                                                       10




that, for New York, a 20—25% reduction in benefits implies an increase in the

out—migration rate which would yield a 16% lower recipient population after 20

years. Since she does not consider in—migration, her estimates put an upper

bound on the migration elasticity of about .75.

       To incorporate migration responses into the analysis of redistribution

costs at the state level, we must adjust the number of persons at each income

level by the migratory response to marginal tax and transfer changes. The

change in net incomes for household i at the previous level of labor supply,

induced by changes in marginal tax rates, dt. and virtual income, dB1, is:



              X =    -(W.L.)   dt. +      dB..
                        11        1         1




The change in the number of people with income Y, dN1, (normalizing

N1 =   1),   is given by



              11
                   - -(dN1)(Y1)
                       W.L.dt.    + dB.       ,   or
                         •11 1            1




                                          dB/Y1 ), where b1 = W1L1/Y1.
(8)           dN1 =    1 (-b1dt1      +



       Without deductibility of state taxes from federal taxes (which will be

introduced later on), the overall marginal tax rate, t, is just the sum of

nominal federal and state rates, t. =
                                                       tfj   +
                                                                 t1.   Under the "small state"

assumption, federal taxes and benefits do not respond to changes in one

state's taxes or transfers, so



             dt = dt51         and        dB1 =   dB1.
                                             11




Restricting states to imposing, on the margin, proportional taxes to finance

demogrants, we have



          dt5 = dt5         = 1, n




          dB51=dBs        i =1,n.


       Now consider the marginal budget constraint faced by the state. The

change in expenditures is the sum of additional benefits paid to existing

residents, of whom there are n5, plus (minus) the state's share of full

benefits paid to new in—migrants (out—migrants), or:




(9)              +
                      BdN

Again, second—order terms are neglected and summations are taken over all

households in the state. The change in tax revenue is the sum of the changes

due to the new tax rate, to labor supply responses of existing residents, and

to migratory responses:


                                      c   W.L.
(10)       dt (WL1 )
                       +E        [-
                                          i11     dt - CdB5]   + E
                                                                     t51W1L1dN



       Equating (9) and (10), and substituting (8) yields the Laffer slope

relation for a state government:

       The only additional data needed to calculate (11), beyond that used to

compute redistribution costs in the single—government case in the previous

section, is information on B51 and                             that portion of total taxes and

benefits attributable to state (and local) qovernnients. For purposes of these

calculations it is assumed that state taxes and benefits are the same

proportion, ô, of overall taxes and benefits, where ô is the share of state

and local government spending in total government spending. Thus,

       Table 2 presents marginal redistribution costs for state governments

computed using (11), (6) and (7) for a range of values of ,,                           the   migration

elasticity, and some of the same labor supply parameters shown in Table i.8

To avoid confusing the issues of redistribution across states with the issue

of redistribution within a state, the state's income distribution is assumed

to be identical to that of the entire country. Hence, the data used are the

national data used to construct Table 1.
                                                    13




            Table 2 shows that marginal redistribution costs depend in the expected

 way on labor supply responses and migration elasticities. The welfare

 tradeoff is less sensitive to labor supply parameters than the market income

 tradeoff, as it was in the unitary government case of Table 1. The major

 surprise in Table 2 comes from comparing the cost to a state of redistributing

 income with the cost to a unitary government of doing the same (as in Table

 1). When             =    0, one might think the costs should be the same since a state

 government appears to face the same constraints when migration is inelastic as

 the unitary government in Table 1.               However, this is not the case. When labor

 earnings within the state fall as the state increases redistribution, federal

 revenue is reduced. Hence some of the costs of statewide redistribution can

be "exported" outside the state by reducing tax revenues available to the

federal government. According to the "small state" assumption, this reduction

is federal tax revenue has a negligible effect on economic well—being within

the state.

           The national government's redistribution costs in a federal system should

be equivalent to the unitary government's costs explored in the previous

section. This is because, although redistribution by the federal government

reduces labor incomes and hence state government revenues, that cost is

internalized because citizens cannot move to avoid the costs of

redistribution. When comparing Tables 1 and 2 to get an idea of the relative

cost to the taxpayers of redistributing income at the state or federal level,

it    is   clear that migration elasticities must be substantial for the migration

effect         to outweigh the tax-exporting effect and make redistribution            more
costly to the voters at the state level than at the federal level.
For        =   .1,   C =   .1,   the migration elasticity must exceed .5 to raise the

state's welfare cost above the federal government's. At                =   .2,   C =   .2,    the
                                            14




threshold migration elasticity at which state and federal costs are equal

rises to above 1.0. ThLis, this indirect tax-exporting effect, which will

naturally be greater the more responsive is labor supply, can easily outweigh

the migration effect to keep marginal state redistribution costs below federal

costs.




Deducti bill ty




        As we have seen, a significant amount of the excess burden of local taxes

can be exported to other taxpayers. Not surprisingly, this result is

strengthened when the deductibility of state and local taxes from the federal

income tax is considered. To get a crude measure of the impact of

deductibility, it was assumed that only the top two income quintiles could

itemize on their federal tax returns. For them, an increase in the state tax

rate by dt reduces their federal liability by tf          dt5, where tf is the

overall federal tax rate.9 The change in the overall tax rate is: dt =

dt5 (1_tf). Computing marginal redistribution costs for a state allowing for
deductibility yields the estimates shown in Table 3. Clearly, deductibility

dramatically reduces redistribution costs. With no labor supply responses

 (C =    0,   =
                  0),   redistribution becomes a positive—sum game whose costs are

borne to a considerable extent by taxpayers outside the state. The key is, of

course, that redistribution converts taxable income into tax-exempt income in

the form of transfers. If state transfers were taxable at the federal level,

then states could not directly export the costs of redistribution.

        The numbers in Table 3 indicate a sizeable effect of deductibility in

reducing state redistribution costs below the federal costs for the same labor
                                          15



 supply responses. The threshold migration elasticity at which state marginal

 costs equal federal marginal costs becomes very large (close to or greater

than 2.5 for each parameter set listed). Therefore, with deductibility, it

becomes extremely unlikely that states face higher marginal costs of

redistribution than the federal government.

     Another feature of the current federal system in the U.S. which affects

the marginal cost of state redistribution is the availability of federal

matching grants for redistributional expenditures. A large empirical

literature exists which shows that these matching formulae do increase state

expenditures on redistribution (see Moffitt (1984), for example). Hence,

consideration of matching grants would reduce even further the state costs of

redistribution found in Tables 2 and 3.

     It is important to realize exactly what this result means.      If there were

no cross—state benefit externalities involved with income redistribution, then

the lower cost faced by state voters would argue for the positive proposition

that redistribution in a federal system (for example, in a Nash equilibrium

among identical states) would exceed that in a comparable centralized fiscal

system.   However, since these cross-state spillovers almost certainly exist,
the cost advantage of state redistribution may not     be enough to offset the

spillovers   and redistribution at the   sub—national level may still be

suboptimal. The case for a national redistribution policy, however, must rest

on the benefit spillovers and not on the migration of either recipients or

taxpayers.

IV. Conclusion



     This paper has examined the effect of additional income redistribution at

the state and national level when both labor supply and location respond to

economic incentives. Marginal redistribution is accomplished by a

proportional tax on labor income which finances a per person demogrant, a

policy which, in effect, rotates each individual 's budget constraint through

some breakeven point. Although it is possible that other redistributive

policies might be more efficient than this one, it is unlikely that the

paper's conclusions concerning the relative costs of state and national

redistributive policies would be radically different. Another point that

bears repeating is that the costs of redistribution computed here are the

costs borne only by the residents of the redistributing jurisdiction, not true

social costs.

     To summarize, the purpose of this paper has been to compute the marginal

costs of income redistribution by states in a federal system as a function of

labor supply and migration responses. The major conclusions are that:     (1)

marginal costs for states are sensitive to labor supply elasticities as well

as migration elasticities and (2) marginal state costs are likely to be less

than federal costs, especially with deductibility and matching grants.

Therefore, the case for a national redistributive policy must be based on

benefit spillovers rather than on tax competition among localities.

 1.    However, Gramlich (1985) acknowledges that benefits would remain low in

       low-benefit states even if costs were reduced, since federal matching

      grants now in place effectively reduce the cost to states.

 2.   A proportional tax—cum-demogrant policy is studied both because of

      computational ease and because it approximates an expansion of the

      current U.S. redistributional system (see Browning and Johnson (1984, p.

      180)). At first glance, it would appear that a more efficient policy

      would restrict the dernogrant to the lowest income quintile. This,

      however, would require very high marginal tax rates, or a notch, on low

      income households. Also, note that the restriction that it be equal for

      all households preserves the kink—points of the piecewise linear budget

      constraint.

3.    The compensated change in labor supply due to a tax change dt is the

      total effect less the income effect. The total effect is given by (1)

      as (—     dt).   The income effect is the additional tax revenue at the

      original labor supply (W L dt) times the pure income effect on labor

      supply (C/W) from equation (1).

4.    Killingsworth's (1983) survey indicates roughly inelastic male

      elasticities but substantially positive female elasticities.

5.    Hausinan's (1981) very large estimates of income effects imply a value of

      C of about .8.

6.    This assumption is common in this context; see Bergstrom, Blume and

      Varjan (1986).

7.   Gramlich and Larn argue that taxpayer migration is much less important

     since a change in redistribution has a much smaller impact on their

     incomes than on the incomes of the poor. While this is true, since the

     number of taxpayers is large relative to transfer recipients, the effect

     of taxpayer migration on   may be significant.

8.   The measurement of costs and benefits is ambiguous when the population

     changes due to migration. The benefits here are the gain in welfare or

     income to the average person in the lowest quintile. The cost is the

     lost welfare or income to a resident who does not migrate, summed over

     all income classes.

9.   This crude procedure overstates the effect of deductibility because even

     for itemizers state and local taxes are not deductable from some federal

     taxes (such as payroll taxes).
