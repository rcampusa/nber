                                            ABSTRACT

Drinkers earn more than non-drinkers, even after controlling for human capital and local labor
market conditions. Several mechanisms by which drinking could increase productivity have been
proposed but are unconfirmed; the more obvious mechanisms predict the opposite, that drinking can
impair productivity. In this paper we reproduce the positive association between drinking and
earnings, using data for adults age 27-34 from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1979).
Since drinking is endogenous in this relationship, we then estimate a reduced-form equation, with
alcohol prices (proxied by a new index of excise taxes) replacing the drinking variables. We find
strong evidence that the prevalence of full-time work increases with alcohol prices – suggesting that
a reduction in drinking increases the labor supply. We also demonstrate some evidence of a positive
association between alcohol prices and the earnings of full-time workers. We conclude that most
likely the positive association between drinking and earnings is the result of the fact that ethanol is
a normal commodity, the consumption of which increases with income, rather than an elixer that
enhances productivity.

1. Introduction

       Common sense, backed by a good deal of evidence, suggests that drinking could impair

productivity. In fact, estimates of alcohol-related social costs are typically dominated by the

value of lost productivity (Harwood, Fountain & Livermore 1998). Historically the concern with

the quality and quantity of work provided by the labor force was a major factor in Nineteenth

Century temperance movements in the United States and Europe (Roberts 1984; Rumbarger

1989). Clark Warburton (1932) stated the argument concisely:

       Prohibition, if it actually resulted in the cessation of use of alcoholic beverages, might be
       expected to affect the efficiency of industry in several ways. The principal effect of
       alcohol is on the central nervous system, and experiments show that a decrease in the
       consumption of alcohol during, or immediately preceding, working hours is accompanied
       by greater skill at work. The finer co-ordination made possible by the absence of alcohol
       tends to reduce the accident rate. The elimination of drinking bouts should tend to
       eliminate absenteeism, especially on Monday, and irregularity in reporting at work. The
       impossibility of drinking to excess should result in less sickness and absence on account
       thereof, and in a longer average working life (195-196).

In recent times a majority of large corporations in the United States have established

occupational alcoholism programs or employee-assistance programs to improve productivity

(Walsh 1982).

       Curiously, however, the link between drinking and reduced productivity (as measured by

earnings) does not receive unambiguous support from the econometric work on this subject. In

fact, drinkers as a group earn more than those who abstain, and that “drinker’s bonus” is not

necessarily limited to the moderate drinkers (Berger & Leigh 1988; Cook 1991; French & Zarkin

                                                                                                       4
1995; Heien 1996; Hamilton & Hamilton 1997; Zarkin, et al. 1998; MacDonald & Shields 2001;

van Ours 2004). These findings are intriguing, and have generated speculation about possible

mechanisms. Perhaps drinking confers health benefits, or enhances “networking.” But such

speculations presume that the statistical association is the result, at least in part, of a causal

process flowing from drinking to earnings. A more obvious interpretation is just the reverse –

that earnings influence whether and how much someone drinks. Indeed, there is good evidence

that ethanol is a normal commodity, with consumption increasing with income (Ruhm 1995;

Cook & Tauchen 1982).

        A number of analysts have considered the possibility of two-way causation, typically

using instrumental variables (IV) methods to remove any influence of earnings on drinking and

isolate the putative effect of drinking on earnings. Those studies, reviewed below, have had

mixed results, in part because of the questionable specifications used in some of them.

        In this paper we estimate a series of earnings equations for youthful (age 21-35) workers

based on data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1979 cohort). As have other

analysts, we are able to document the existence of the drinker’s bonus in these data, both with

and without a long list of controls for personal and labor-market characteristics. We then report

the results of a reduced-form analysis using a new index of alcohol-excise taxes, demonstrating

that the prevalence of full-time work increases with the state tax level. We conclude that at least

for this population (adults prior to middle age) drinking does not improve the quality of labor

supply, and may well reduce the quantity. The drinker’s bonus is most likely an artifact resulting

from the reverse causal process; quite simply, drinking is a normal activity, the likelihood of

                                                                                                      5
which increases with earnings.

       Also of possible interest are our ancillary findings concerning individual characteristics --

personality, body mass, and height – and local labor market conditions, as measured by our local

wage index.

       Here is a brief roadmap of the paper. The next section reviews the literature, with special

attention to analyses that attempted to correct for the endogeneity of drinking in the earnings

equation. Section 3 then describes the data set and develops our estimation strategy. Here we

introduce a new index of local (MSA level) wages, and a new index of alcohol excise taxes.

Section 4 documents the drinker’s bonus using the NLSY data, finding that it is quite robust to

alternative specifications. The following section reports the results of reduced-form estimates.

The final section concludes.



2. Evidence that drinking affects productivity

       An early effort to estimate the productivity costs of drinking is due to Yale economist

Irving Fisher (1926). His view was that drinking slowed down the "human machine" (p. 118),

and he noted that "All of us know that industrial efficiency was one of the chief reasons for

Prohibition (p. 158)." He supported his claim of impaired productivity by citing experiments

which showed that drinking reduces proficiency or speed at some task. In particular, he noted an

experiment in which four typesetters were studied over a four-day period; two of them were

given drinks, and the other two were used as a control group. The conclusion was that drinking

three glasses of beer in a day reduced typesetting output by about 10 percent. Fisher made a

                                                                                                   6
heroic extrapolation from this result, projecting a 5 percent increase in national productivity as a

result of reduced drinking caused by Prohibition.

       There have been surprisingly few modern-day experiments on how drinking affects work,

perhaps because it seems obvious. Several laboratory studies have been conducted on the effects

of hangovers on job performance in industrial settings (Mangione, et al. 1999). Subjects drank

till intoxicated, slept it off, and then the next morning performed tasks in simulated work

situations (Wolkenberg, Gold & Tichauer 1975). Even as much as 18 hours after the drinking

bout, experimenters observed residual effects of the drinking bout on reaction time, motor skills,

perception, and other performance attributes.

       One of the largest observational studies, the Worksite Alcohol Project, found that

problematic drinking (but not drinking per se) was associated with work-related problems.

(Mangione, et al. 1999). Sixteen work sites belonging to seven different corporations, spanning

the gamut from professional office to factory, were included, with over 9,000 individual survey

respondents interviewed in the early 1990s. The respondents were asked about job-related

problems during the previous year, including having missed work; done poor quality work;

arrived late or left early; done less work than expected; had an argument with a co-worker; or

been hurt on the job. The combined frequency of these work performance problems was

regressed on self-reported measures of drinking and alcohol-related problems, controlling for

demographic characteristics, life circumstances and job characteristics. Three drinking measures

had a significantly positive effect: drinking on the job, sometimes drinking to get drunk, and



                                                                                                       7
dependence on alcohol. Given these other measures the weekly quantity of alcohol consumed

had no discernible effect on problem frequency.1

         Finally, several surveys have asked respondents whether their drinking has caused them

any problems (Room, Bondy & Ferris 1995). For example, in a national survey conducted in the

United States in 1984, 2.9 percent of men stated that their drinking had harmed their employment

opportunities, and 0.8 percent reported they had lost or nearly lost a job as a result of their

drinking (Hilton & Clark 1987). The corresponding percentages for women were about half

those of the men. These percentages seem remarkably small relative to the prevalence of alcohol

abuse.

         The possibility that drinking is actually rewarded in the labor market was first suggested

by economists Mark Berger and Paul Leigh (1988). They compared the hourly wages of drinkers

and nondrinkers,2 finding that for males the drinkers earned 10% more, while for females the

drinkers earned 35% more. After controlling for experience, education, occupation, race and

marital status, the differences shrank somewhat but remained large.

         This finding that abstainers earn less than drinkers, or at least moderate drinkers, has been

replicated using a variety of data sets for the United States (Kenkel & Ribar 1994; Heien 1996;


1
  Several other studies have analyzed the effect of drinking on absenteeism. Manning et al.
(1991) report results from two data sets, the Rand Health Insurance Experiment (HIE) and the
National Health Interview Study for 1983. In neither do they find a relationship between quantity
consumed by current drinkers and absenteeism. (Using the HIE they find that "former drinkers"
have 38 percent higher absentee rates than others.) On the other hand, French and Zarkin (1995),
using survey data for workers at four large work sites, find that both overall drinking and
frequency of drunkenness are positively related to absenteeism.
2
    They defined “drinker” as someone who reported drinking at least once or twice per week.
                                                                                                      8
Zarkin, et al. 1998; French & Zarkin 1995), Canada (Hamilton & Hamilton 1997), England

(MacDonald & Shields 2001), and the Netherlands (van Ours 2004).

       How should these results be interpreted? Economists equate earnings (hourly or annual)

with productivity, albeit with a number of qualifications (Bowles, Gintis & Osborne 2001;

Kenkel & Wang 1999; Mullahy 1993). Accepting that view, the question becomes “why should

workers who drink be more productive on average than those who don’t?” One answer, of

course, is that drinking itself actually enhances productivity; that some people tend to perform

better on the job if they are drinkers than abstainers. Several authors have suggested that the

beneficial mechanism may be via the health benefits of moderate drinking (Heien 1996;

Hamilton & Hamilton 1997). But since those benefits are primarily through heart-disease

prevention in middle age, the “health” mechanism does not account for the drinker’s bonus

among workers in their 20s and 30s. Another possibility is that drinking facilitates social

networking, which in turn generates improved job options; most people find their jobs through

word-of-mouth, and having a wide network of friends and acquaintances is an important aspect

of ones “social capital.”3 In an environment where drinking is a routine aspect of socializing,

drinkers may be more productive because they find better jobs on average.

       But the “drinker’s bonus” may not be “real,” in the sense of reflecting the causal effect of

drinking on earnings and productivity. The usual problems in analyzing non-experimental data



Those who drank less often were lumped in with the abstainers.
3
 This interpretation is developed by MacDonald and Shields (2001) and others. The importance
of a social network in job finding is documented by Granovetter (1975 (2nd ed., 1995)). The
economic interpretation of social capital is developed by Glaeser, Laibson, and Sacerdote (2002)
and by Durlauf and Fafchamps (2004).
                                                                                                   9
arise, including omitted-variables bias. Drinkers and abstainers may differ in hard-to-measure

ways that are relevant to labor-market success, such as the ability to get along well with other

people, or personal priorities between home life and career. The literature includes heroic efforts

to deal with this omitted-variables problem, but the possibility of bias remains (Kenkel & Ribar

1994). In addition to genuine confounders are problems that may arise as artifacts of the

measurement process. For example, self-reported drinking may be affected by how trusting the

respondent is of the survey interview process. A spurious correlation between drinking and

earnings will arise if more trusting respondents are more likely to admit their drinking in the

NLSY interviews and also tend to earn more (or be willing to report a higher percentage of their

income).

       Alcohol dependence and abuse. In addition to the effect of current drinking on

productivity, if any, there may also be an effect of past drinking as mediated by the acquisition of

human capital and by health status (mental and physical) (Bray 2003; Grossman 1972; Grossman

2000). Several studies have explored this linkage using data on two alcohol-related conditions

termed "alcohol dependence" and "alcohol abuse" in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of

Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association. "Alcohol dependence" is defined by

symptoms indicating psychological and physical dependence on alcohol and neglect of

responsibilities at work or home. "Alcohol abuse" is defined by continued drinking despite

alcohol-related problems and risky behavior associated with bouts of heavy drinking.

       John Mullahy and Jody Sindelar (1993) utilize data from the Epidemiological Catchment

Area survey of the New Haven area, which includes diagnostic questions on mental illness.

                                                                                                   10
Twenty percent of their primary sample (males age 30-59) had at some point in their lives

experienced the symptoms defining alcohol dependence or abuse. This group of problem

drinkers had a substantially lower employment rate and lower earnings -- results that held up

after controlling for other characteristics. (Strangely, alcoholic males in their 20s and 60s

actually had higher earnings than non-alcoholics.) In another analysis, Mullahy and Sindelar

used Epidemiological Catchment Area survey data for four cities, finding that for both genders,

nonalcoholics had higher educational attainment, and were more likely to be working, more

likely to have white-collar jobs, and had higher incomes. Alcoholic women were more likely

than alcoholic men to never marry, have fewer children, and have more psychiatric disorders

(Mullahy & Sindelar 1991).

       The problems of causal inference are the same with alcohol dependence as with

determining the influence of current drinking status on productivity. While problematic drinking

probably affects labor force participation, productivity, and earnings (Mangione, et al. 1999)

isolating this effect is not easy from non-experimental data. Mullahy and Sindelar note that

“Other factors may cause both employment and alcohol problems; such factors could include

psychiatric problems, congenital or chronic health problems, injuries, physical pain, lack of

ability to cope, problems with friends or family, frustration of various forms, or an unstable

upbringing (Mullahy & Sindelar 1996, p. 413}.”

       Depending on the data source, it may be possible to use multivariate methods to control

for aspects of nature and nurture that lead to drinking problems and have an influence on

schooling, acquisition of other forms of human capital, and work. But usually the available

                                                                                                  11
measures in population surveys are inadequate or unreliable.

       The statistical challenge is further compounded by the fact that alcohol problems develop

over a number of years, influencing life-course outcomes in a variety of ways. There is strong

evidence that problem drinking in youth affects school completion (Mullahy & Sindelar 1989;

Mullahy & Sindelar 1991; Cook & Moore 1993b; Koch & Kerry Anne McGeary forthcoming)

and family formation (Kenkel & Ribar 1994). Hence the contemporaneous effect of problematic

drinking on work – controlling for education and family circumstances – may miss much of the

long-term effects. Kenkel and Ribar report a series of multivariate-regression results that help

make the point: they find that alcohol-dependent women (age 24-34) earned 11percent more than

those who were not dependent while alcohol-dependent men earned 10 percent less. But when

they add controls for marital status and children, earnings for both males and females are

unaffected by alcohol dependence. The apparent reason: alcohol dependence reduces the

likelihood of getting married, and marriage has opposite effects on work outcomes for men and

women – men work and earn more, women less.

       Reverse causation. The drinker’s bonus may be in whole or part an artifact of the reverse

causal process. When their earnings increase, some drinkers increase their alcohol consumption,

and some people who usually abstain become regular drinkers.4 That possibility is supported by

other evidence – we know, for example, that aggregate alcohol sales increase with per capita

income.


4
  An alternative possibility for reverse causation is that higher earnings cause drinking initiation
because more lucrative jobs tend to have greater stress associated with them, or have other
attributes that induce drinking (Trice & Sonnenstuhl 1988).
                                                                                                   12
       Summary. Figure 1 provides a schematic diagram that summarizes the causal pathways

under discussion (Cook & Moore 2000). In this diagram, "Current drinking" patterns (both on

and off the job) affect productivity, which in turn determines individual earnings. The diagram

also depicts an indirect effect via the influence of drinking history on the accumulation of human

and health capital (Grossman 1972; Grossman 2000). The final link represents "reverse

causation," in which current consumption is affected by earnings.

       Fig. 1 here

Figure 1 identifies several mechanisms by which current drinking and earnings could be

correlated. To isolate the effect of drinking on earnings, a number of analysts have used

instrumental-variable estimation techniques, which also may reduce bias due to errors in the

measurement of drinking (Kenkel & Ribar 1994). The challenge is to find good instruments,

which is to say, variables that satisfy two conditions: (1) they have a strong statistical association

with individual drinking; and (2) they are orthogonal to the error process in the earnings

equation. A long list of instruments have been utilized by economists working on this problem,

as summarized in Table 1. State-level measures of alcohol availability and use, such as excise

taxes or per capita sales, are plausible candidates to satisfy the requirements of a good

instrument, although in some data sets they may not have enough variation to generate the

needed statistical power. Some analysts have used certain individual characteristics as

instruments, including whether the individual suffers from any of several chronic diseases,

characterizations of religious practice, attitudes toward the risk of alcohol and drugs, parents’




                                                                                                    13
smoking, and whether the respondent reports having close relatives who are alcoholic. While all

of these variables are correlated with drinking, it is quite likely in each case that they also have a

direct effect on work and earnings. For example, people who attend church frequently drink less

than others, but their religion may also influence their career choices and performance on the job,

and hence earnings. Therefore using some quantitative characterization of religious practice as

an instrument does not identify the effect of drinking per se on earnings.



3. Data and Estimation Strategy

       The primary data source for this study is the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth

(NLSY). The NLSY is managed by the Human Resource Research Center at Ohio State

University, with sponsorship from the US Department of Labor and other federal agencies. The

initial sample included 12,686 youths between the ages of 14 and 21 in 1979, the first year of the

survey. The sampling procedure was designed to include a disproportionate number of racial

minorities and youths in poor households. Sample members were interviewed annually until

1994, and bi-annually since then.

       The NLSY includes extensive information on work and earnings, together with data on

family background, schooling, family formation, and a variety of other matters. We utilize the

geocoded version of NLSY data set, which allows us to merge additional variables characterizing

the respondent’s state, metropolitan area, and county of residence. Questions on drinking were

included in 1982-1985 and again in 1988, 1989, 1992 and 1994. Data on work hours and

earnings were obtained by questions concerning the previous calendar year that are included in

                                                                                                     14
every wave of the survey; therefore hours and earnings information are available for every year

through 1993, and every other year thereafter. As a result, the 1994 wave could not be used – we

have drinking items that apply to that year, but not earnings and hours.

       There are several items that characterize current drinking. In what follows we use a

binary indicator of whether the individual reports having at least one drink in the preceding

month, and the number of times the individual reports having 6 or more drinks on a single

occasion in the preceding month (available in every wave that includes drinking items except

1992). The key employment-related outcome variables are whether the individual reported

working full time in the preceding calendar year, and if so, his or her earnings. We defined “full

time” as at least 1,500 hours with earnings of at least $1,000 (1983 dollars). Full-time work and

earnings are modeled as outcomes of drinking, personal characteristics, and conditions in the

local labor market. Both “short form” and “long form” specifications are used, the difference

being which personal characteristics are included. The short form includes only characteristics

that are exogenous to drinking decisions by the individual, such as demographics, characteristics

of the birth family, aptitude, and so forth. The long form specification expands on this list to

include variables that reflect choices made over the life course which may well be influenced by

prior drinking, including years of schooling, marital status, health, and work experience.

Thus we have

(1)    p(FTitc) = F (Dit, Xit, wtc, utc, eitc)

(2)    Eitc = E(Dit, Xit, wtc, utc, eitc)

where for an individual i in year t and jurisdiction c, the variables are

                                                                                                   15
       D = a vector of variables describing whether and how much the individual drinks

       X = a vector of personal characteristics (either short or long)

       w = local wage level

       u = local unemployment rate

       e = a scalar capturing unmeasured characteristics of individual i



The first pass at estimating these equations treats all right-hand-side variables, including the

drinking variables, as exogenous. In a subsequent section we treat drinking as endogenous and

develop reduced-form estimates. Details of the estimation procedure are given in subsequent

sections.

       Table 2 lists the key variables used in these estimates together with mean values for male

and female respondents over all of the years of interest in which they respond. Of particular note

are the two variables that we developed and merged with the NLSY data: the local wage index

and the alcohol-tax index.

       We computed the wage index for each Metropolitan Statistical Area from 1990 Census

data from the one-percent sample IPUMS data. A simple earnings equation was estimated for all

respondents age 25-59 who reported full time work in 1989 (and at least $1,000 in earnings): we

regressed the natural log of earnings on indicators of age, race, and education, for males and

females separately. We then computed the difference between the actual annual earnings

number, and the fitted value (both logged), for each of the full-time workers in the sample. The

index for an MSA is simply the average of these differences for respondents from that MSA.

                                                                                                   16
This index was merged with NLSY respondents for all years in the working sample, on the

assumption that the geographic structure of wages persists over time. NLSY respondents whose

residence was not in an MSA were assigned to the nearest MSA.

       We also constructed an alcohol-tax index to use as an instrument. It is the average excise

tax per ounce of ethanol sold in the respondent’s state, adjusted for inflation. One complication

is that 18 states monopolize the wholesale distribution of liquor rather than simply impose an

excise tax on it; for those states, we imputed the effective tax based on price comparisons with

4. The drinker’s bonus confirmed: regression estimates

       Table 3 compares drinkers and non-drinkers for a number of demographic groups with

respect to the fraction who are working full time. In every group, defined here by sex and either

age, race, or AFQT score, the drinkers are more likely to work full time than the abstainers.

       Table 4 presents the OLS regression results, short and long form, for males and females,

with and without binge variables. Note that the regressions are computed on the basis of up to

seven years of data on each respondent. The standard errors are robust, corrected for clusters.

       The results confirm the existence of the drinker’s bonus. For females it amounts to about

6 percent in the short form and 4 % in the long form (which controls for the respondent’s

education, health, weight, and family circumstances). Females who not only drink but also

binge occasionally still have higher earnings unless they binge 4 or more times per month. For

males the bonus is positive but somewhat smaller than for females, and declines if the individual

                                                                                                   17
binge drinks. For males who binge 6 or more times per month, the net effect of drinking is

significantly negative in the short form.

       The other results in the earnings equation are also of interest. Not surprisingly, earnings

increase strongly with aptitude (measured by the Air Force Qualification Test), an effect that is

somewhat diminished when we control for acquired human and health capital in the long form.

Perhaps more surprising, earnings increase strongly with height, about 1.0% per inch for females

and 1.8 % per inch for males in the short form. Personality, as represented by self-reported

shyness, has little effect. The local labor market, measured by the county unemployment rate and

the wage index for the local MSA, has a powerful effect on earnings in the expected direction.5

       In the long form we confirm the expected patterns with respect to education, marriage

(positive for males), and children at home (negative for females, positive for males). We find a

strong positive effect of accumulated experience since age 21 and experience in the preceding

year. The pattern with respect to the body mass index is surprising. Female earnings are highest

for those who are underweight by the normal standard (less than 18.5). Women of normal weight

earn 5% less, those who are overweight or obese earn 10% less, and those who are highly obese

still less. For males, on the other hand, those in the normal range are paid more than those who

are underweight, and earnings actually peak in the overweight range. Only for those who are in

the highest obesity category is there some decline.

       Table 5 presents the logit regression results for full-time work using the same


5
  If the wage structure were uniform across geographic markets up to a proportional inflation
factor, and the wage index were successful in measuring that factor without error, then the
estimated coefficient on the wage index should be 1.0. In fact it is about .68 for females and .66
                                                                                                    18
specifications as for earnings. For this outcome the estimated effect of being a drinker are large

indeed. In the short form, the odds of a female working full time are about 60 percent higher if

she drinks than abstains, and still higher if she binges occasionally.6 That effect is cut in half in

the long form, but is still large. For males, the odds are about 40 percent higher for drinkers than

nondrinkers in the short form, and about half that in the long form. Bingeing has little effect.

       The other results in the full-time logit regressions are generally similar to the patterns

observed for the earnings equations. Aptitude has a particularly strong effect on the odds of a

woman working full time, as does height. The county unemployment rate tends to depress the

odds of full time work, while there are mixed results with respect to the wage index for the local

MSA.

       In the long form we confirm the expected patterns with respect to education, marriage

(negative for females, positive for males), and children at home (negative for females, positive

for males). We find a strong positive effect of accumulated experience since age 21 and

experience in the preceding year. But the pattern with respect to the body mass index is quite

different for the odds of full time work than it is for earnings. Respondents who are underweight

are the least likely to work full time, perhaps because this group includes some who are anorexic

or otherwise unwell. Otherwise there is little relationship between weight and working for

females except for those who are severely obese (who are most likely to work). For males there

is a monotonic relationship between BMI and the odds of working.

5. The drinker’s bonus denied: IV and reduced-form estimates

       The estimated effects of drinking on both earnings and full time work are positive, strong

in a statistical sense, consistent with the literature, and entirely implausible given all the evidence

that among the drinkers are a large subgroup who are drinking in ways that are likely to reduce

productivity (due to hangover or impairment on the job). The estimated coefficients could be

biased for several reasons discussed above, including errors in the measurement of the key

variable (drinking status), omitted variables, and reverse causation. Of those three, reverse

causation strikes us as the most plausible explanation. To remedy this possibility, we re-

estimated the earnings and full-time equations using instrumental-variables (IV) regression. As

instruments we use an index of alcohol-excise taxes (defined in detail in the appendix), the

excise tax on cigarettes, and the per capita sales of alcoholic beverages measured in terms of

ethanol content per capita. All three of these measures vary at the level of the state and year. In

this choice of instruments we follow Mullahy and Sindelar (Mullahy & Sindelar 1996), with two

exceptions. First, they used the beer tax instead of our more comprehensive index of excise taxes

for beer, wine, and liquor. And second, they included an indicator of whether the respondent

reported growing up with alcoholic relatives, a variable that we believe cannot be plausibly

omitted from the earnings equation given the evidence that parents’ alcoholism may have a

variety of negative effects on the children (and not just cause them to drink).7


7
  It is also true that the measure of parental alcoholism may be endogenous. In the NLSY, the
youthful respondents were asked in the 1988 wave whether each of a list of relatives were
alcoholics. Arkes and Cook (2005) reports that in households with more than one NLSY
                                                                                                     20
        We estimated both short- and long-form 2SLS models, for both the likelihood of full-

time work and for earnings of those who do work full time. Furthermore, we experimented with

either the inclusion of two endogenous variables – both a drinking indicator and an indicator of

abuse. However, regression diagnostics indicate that the results are not to be trusted. The F-

statistic for significance of the excluded instrumental variables is less than 10 in all cases except

the female binary drink variable, indicating that our instruments are rather weak. The second-

stage results provide some evidence that drinking and bingeing have a negative effect on labor-

market outcomes, but the results are often implausible.

        Hence we follow the lead of Dave and Kaestner (2002) and others (Cook & Moore

1993b)in adopting a reduced-form estimation strategy. Our tax index, described in the appendix,

is the key variable in these estimates. The great advantage in the reduced form approach is that

there is no need to characterize drinking patterns directly, thus bypassing the problems of

measurement error and of finding an adequate one- or two-variable description of how much and

in what pattern an individual drinks. Further, the tax variable is of interest because it is under

direct control of policymakers.

        Table 6 reports the results of the reduced-form estimates. The estimated coefficients are

positive in all eight cases: male and female, earnings and full time, short form and long form.

All coefficients in the logit equations (full time work) are statistically significant at the usual

level. We take these results as evidence that reduced alcohol consumption, as engendered by


respondent where one reports that their father is an alcoholic a sibling disagrees. Furthermore, in
cases of disagreement there is a strong pattern to the responses, with respondents who report
either abstaining or having problems with alcohol themselves being substantially more likely
                                                                                                      21
higher taxes, increases the quantity and perhaps also the quality of work effort.

        The magnitude of the estimated effect on the odds of full time work is not small. The

coefficient estimates are around .03, which implies that each additional penny tax (1983 prices)

per ounce of ethanol results in a 3 percent increase in the odds of someone working full time. A

sample calculation is useful. Suppose that 60 percent of some identified population group works

full time, which is then exposed to an alcohol tax increase of 1 cent (1983 prices). Translating

this to current (2006) prices and assuming a 50% markup on the beer excise tax, that would

imply something on the order of a 2% increase in the price of a cheap 6-pack of beer (containing

3 ounces of ethanol). The 3% increase in the odds of full-time work means for this group an

increase in the odds from 1.50 (60/40) to 1.545, which is equivalent to a full-time participation

rate of 60.71%. The price elasticity of full-time participation is thus something less than 1.0 in

this example.

6. Discussion

        There is no question that drinkers earn more than non-drinkers and are more likely to

work full time, even after controlling for human capital and local labor market conditions. The

proper interpretation of this finding has been contested in the literature. While some have argued

in favor of a direct causal interpretation, the mechanism is far from obvious. Further, there is

every reason to believe that drinking impairs the productivity of some workers. In this paper we

find evidence in support of the “impairment” hypothesis, namely that higher alcohol prices are

associated with increased participation in full-time work among those in our sample (young



than their siblings to report that their father is an alcoholic.
                                                                                                     22
adults in their 20s or early 30s); there is some evidence of increased earnings for full-time

workers as well. A natural reconciliation between these results and the positive association

between drinking and earnings is through the reverse causal process: most income for this age

group is in the form of earnings, and ethanol is a normal commodity in consumption, so that the

main causal mechanism here could be that increased income (in the form of earnings) causes

higher alcohol consumption. Of course we cannot claim that that is the only relevant

mechanism; for example, it is plausible that work away from home provides opportunities to

drink socially that are not so common otherwise, or that work creates stress that is conducive to

drinking. In any event, the notion that alcohol is an elixer that enhances productivity seems very

unlikely.

Appendix


   Calculation of Tax Rates and Prices per Oz. of Ethanol

   Tax Rates

      The original data set had tax rates in $/gallon in real $ (the year’s tax rates divided by the

   year’s CPI/100 (1982-84=1)). The tax rates were in every case the sum of state and federal

   excises. The real tax rates were then changed to per oz. of ethanol first by multiplying the

   gallon figure by 100 (to change the rate to cents per gallon) and then dividing by the number

   of ounces of ethanol in each gallon of beer, wine, or liquor. The number of ounces of ethanol

   in turn was derived from taking the proportion of ethanol in each gallon of beer, wine, or

   liquor and multiplying it by 128. Thus for beer, the percentage of ethanol is 4.5% or, for a

   128 oz. gallon, 5.76 oz. of ethanol, therefore the tax rate per gallon of beer was divided by

   5.76. For wine the alcohol percentage was 8.34, or 15.35 oz. of ethanol, so the per gallon tax

   rate was divided by 15.35. For liquor, a 100-proof gallon was assumed which is 50% ethanol

   by content, therefore each gallon tax rate was divided by 64.

   Prices

      A similar calculation was made for determining the price of each beverage per oz. of

   ethanol. The ACCRA price figures were first sorted by state and the mean value for all cities

   in each state for each year (1982-2000) was derived. (The number of cities varied per state

   from 1 to 32.) The prices were then put in real dollars by dividing each price by the year’s

   CPI/100 (1982-84=1). All prices were then multiplied by 100 to derive prices in cents



                                                                                                   26
   instead of dollars.

       The price per ounce of ethanol in liquor was computed by dividing the price per .75 liter

   bottle of 86-proof scotch by 10.7 (the number of ounces of ethanol given ethanol content of

   43%).


   Calculating the Tax Index

       For tax rates a weighted average index measure was calculated from the separate beer,

   wine and liquor tax rates. Each state tax rate was multiplied by its percentage of ethanol

   consumed for that product by each state averaged of the period consumption data was

   available (1970-2000). The three rates were then summed to produce the index. An example

   of a tax index calculation for one state (Massachusetts) for the year 2000 is below.


                    Tax rate (cents     Average % ethanol      Weighted rate      Index
                    per oz. ethanol)    consumed
   Beer             6.93                 44.9                  3.11
   Wine             6.12                 16.1                  0.99
   Liquor           15.92                38.9                  6.19
   Sum                                  100.0                  10.29              10.29


           The tax index variable could only be calculated where there were beer, wine and liquor

tax rates available, namely the 32 license states and the District of Columbia. To create an index

value for the control states an imputed liquor tax rate was needed. First the net price, price minus

tax, was calculated for 1988 for each license state except Alaska and Hawaii. These net prices

were averaged and the average subtracted from the ACCRA price for each of the monopoly states

for each year. The result was then adjusted to ounce of alcohol to produce an imputed liquor tax

                                                                                                  27
for each state for every year.

          This imputed tax was then placed in the previously missing liquor tax observations for

all the control states in the regression data set. The weighted tax index variable was then

calculated as before and described in detail above. The imputed spirits tax, the actual beer tax,

and the actual wine tax, weighted by the state-specific fraction of ethanol, were summed to

produce a tax index figure. The only states now missing an alcohol tax index number were New

Hampshire and Utah that also control wine sales and have no wine tax rates available.

Notes: Observations for the years 1982-85, 1988-89, and 1992. “Full time workers” defined as respondents who
reported working at least 1,500 hours in the previous year and had earnings of at least $1000. Standard errors are
Huber-White cluster-corrected for repeated observations on the same individual. All regressions include the
following covariates in addition to those shown: Individual-year indicators for age, from age 22 to age 37; indicators
for each of the 8 years; indicators for father’s and mother’s education; indicators for number of siblings (one, 2-3,
4+); indicators for religious faith in which respondent was raised; indicators of whether the respondent lives in
central city, other SMSA, or outside SMSA; and missing-data indicators for father’s and mother’s education, AFQT,
religious faith, number of siblings, height, personality indicators, unemployment rate, and SMSA region. In the long
form, missing-data indicators are also included for marital status, children at home, experience, hours worked,
schooling, and BMI info. The long form also contains information on whether or not the respondent had an
alcoholic relative. All observations weighted by NLSY sampling weights.

Notes: Observations for the years 1982-85, 1988-89, and 1992. “Full time workers” defined as respondents who
reported working at least 1,500 hours in the previous year and had earnings of at least $1000. Standard errors are
Huber-White cluster-corrected for repeated observations on the same individual. All regressions include the
following covariates in addition to those shown: Individual-year indicators for age, from age 22 to age 37; indicators
for each of the 8 years; indicators for father’s and mother’s education; indicators for number of siblings (one, 2-3,
4+); indicators for religious faith in which respondent was raised; indicators of whether the respondent lives in
central city, other SMSA, or outside SMSA; and missing-data indicators for father’s and mother’s education, AFQT,
religious faith, number of siblings, height, personality indicators, unemployment rate, and SMSA region. In the long
form, missing-data indicators are also included for marital status, children at home, experiences, hours worked,
schooling, and BMI info. The long form also contains information on whether or not the respondent had an
alcoholic relative. All observations weighted by NLSY sampling weights.
