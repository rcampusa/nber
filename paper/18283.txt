Over-optimistic Official Forecasts in the Eurozone and Fiscal Rules

NBER Working Paper No. 18283
August 2012
JEL No. F3

                                            ABSTRACT
Why do countries find it so hard to get their budget deficits under control? Systematic patterns in
the errors that official budget agencies make in their forecasts may play an important role. Although
many observers have suggested that fiscal discipline can be restored via fiscal rules such as a legal
cap on the budget deficit, forecasting bias can defeat such rules. The members of the eurozone are
supposedly constrained by the fiscal caps of the Stability and Growth Pact. Yet ever since the birth
of the euro in 1999, members have postponed painful adjustment by making overly optimistic forecasts
of future growth and budget positions and arguing that the deficits will fall below the cap within a
year or two. The new fiscal compact among the euro countries is supposed to make budget rules more
binding by putting them into laws and constitutions at the national level. But what is the record with
such national rules?
Our econometric findings are summarized as follows:
• Governments’ budget forecasts are biased in the optimistic direction, especially among the Eurozone
countries, especially when they have large contemporaneous budget deficits, and especially during
booms.
• Governments’ real GDP forecasts are similarly over-optimistic during booms.
• Despite the well-known tendency of eurozone members to exceed the 3% cap on budget deficits,
often in consecutive years, they almost never forecast that they will violate the cap in the coming years.
 This is the source of the extra bias among eurozone forecasts. If euro area governments are not in
violation of the 3% cap at the time forecasts are made, forecasts are no more biased than other countries.
• Although euro members without national budget balance rules have a larger over-optimism bias than
non-member countries, national fiscal rules help counteract the wishful thinking that seems to come
with euro membership. The reason is that when governments are in violation of the 3% cap the national
rules apparently constrain them from making such unrealistic forecasts.
• Similarly, the existence of an independent fiscal institution producing budget forecasts at the national
level reduces the over-optimism bias of forecasts made when the countries are in violation of the 3%
cap.

1. Introduction
       Fiscal rules are increasingly proposed as a means of reining in excessive budget deficits.

By now it is clear to all that the Stability and Growth Pact has failed to keep budget deficits and

debt levels of eurozone members within the limits specified: originally 3 per cent of GDP and 60

per cent of GDP, respectively. In response to the euro crisis that began in 2010, German

Chancellor Angela Merkel has proposed and won acceptance for a new Fiscal Compact among

the euro states. The goal of the compact is to strengthen fiscal rules among euro members, in

particular by writing them into laws and constitutions at the national level.

       In any effort to revise or strengthen fiscal rules, it would help to know why some rules

have failed in the past, such as the SGP itself, and what the record with national rules of various

sorts is: limits on spending vs. deficits, conditional or unconditional, with or without

independent fiscal agencies, and so forth.

       One factor behind excessive budget deficits worldwide is a tendency for official forecasts

of growth rates, tax receipts, and budget balances to be overly optimistic.     It stands to reason

that a government that foresees, or claims to foresee, healthy surpluses in coming years is less

likely today to take the difficult steps that might be necessary to strengthen the budget, such as

cutting spending and raising tax rates.

       The bias toward optimism in fiscal forecasts among the 24 countries included in this

study is .28% of GDP at the one year horizon, .93% of GDP at the two year horizon, and 1.90%

at the three-year horizon. For the 17 European countries, the bias is even higher, despite the rules

of the SGP (or perhaps because of them): .52% at the one year horizon, 1.29% at the two year

horizon and 2.4% at the three year horizon.1 An important component of the over-optimism in

official forecasts of the budget deficit is over-optimism in official forecasts of GDP.2




1.1 Literature Review

        Fiscal rules

        Many experts and some elected officials have suggested that annual deficits and long-

term debt can best be held in check through fiscal policy rules or mechanisms such as deficit or

debt caps.3 Some countries have already enacted laws along these lines. The most important and

most well-known example is the fiscal rules of the euro zone, which supposedly limit budget

deficits to 3 per cent of GDP and debts to 60% of GDP. 4              (The Maastricht Treaty specified

these fiscal rules as criteria for determining what countries are admitted to the eurozone. The

Stability and Growth Pact supposedly dictated that member countries must continue to meet the

criteria.) Some euro countries have enacted budget rules at the national level.

        Other countries have also adopted fiscal rules and other similar institutions.5 In a recent

IMF Working Paper, Schaechter, et. al. (2012) create a new database of national and

supranational fiscal rules across 81 countries from 1985 to 2012. The authors report that while

only five countries had fiscal rules in place in 1990, 76 countries had them in place by the end of

March 2012. The success of these measures, however, depends on making accurate forecasts of

to put limits on the deficit or debt !

government spending and revenues. Getting those forecasts right has proven to be difficult for

most governments.



Research on Official Fiscal Forecasting
   Econometric studies have already shown that government budget forecasts in many countries

are overly optimistic on average, often because official estimates of economic growth are overly

optimistic.

   Auerbach (1994) finds overly optimistic official U.S. forecasts in the decade up to 1993.

McNees (1995) finds an optimistic bias in official forecasts of long-term American growth

through 1994. Auerbach (1999) again finds a tendency for US Office of Management and

Budget (OMB) forecasts to overestimate revenues during the period 1986-93, but found a

tendency to underestimate revenues during the subsequent period, 1993-99.      McNab, Rider, and

Wall (2007) find that OMB’s one-year ahead forecasts of US tax receipts were biased over the

period 1963-2003 and suggest that the bias may have been strategic on the part of various

administrations seeking to achieve particular goals, such as overstating budget balance when the

administration is seeking to increase spending or cut taxes. Frendreis and Tatalovich (2000)

show that US administrations (OMB) are less accurate in estimating growth, inflation and

unemployment than is the independent Congressional Budget Office or the Federal Reserve

Board. They find partisan bias, interpreted as Republican administrations over-forecasting

inflation and Democratic administrations over-forecasting unemployment.

   Forni and Momigliano (2004) find optimism bias among OECD countries in general. Ashiya

(2005, 2007) shows that official Japanese growth forecasts are biased upwards and are

significantly less accurate than private sector forecasts. According to O’Neill (2005) and

Mühleisen, et al, (2005), Canada underestimated its budget deficits in the late 1980s and early


                                                4
1990s, but subsequently overestimated them (1994-2004), perhaps to reduce the risk of missing

its target of a balanced budget under its strengthened institutional framework.

    Jonung and Larch (2006) find that budget agencies in the EU systematically overestimate the

economic growth rate. The tendency toward overly optimistic forecasts is especially strong in

Italy and Germany. The UK is an exception. Strauch, et al (2009) find a statistically significant

optimism bias for some euro members: Germany, Italy, Greece, Luxembourg, and Portugal for

the period 1991-2004. The UK, Finland and Sweden, on the other hand, tend to overestimate

their deficits. In light of this difference, it is suggestive that the UK and Sweden were not trying

to get into the euro, which would have required meeting the fiscal criteria of the 1992 Maastricht

Treaty, while the others were trying to get in, and are now there and thus subject to the Stability

and Growth Pact (SGP).6         Brück and Stephan (2006) explicitly conclude that Eurozone

governments have manipulated deficit forecasts before elections since the introduction of the

SGP. Most of these authors argue that the systematic over-optimism in ex ante forecasts

translates directly into larger ex post deficits, and particularly to deficits larger than targeted

under the SGP.

    Similarly, Beetsma et al (2009) find that realized budget balances among SGP countries on

average fall short of official ex ante plans. Marinheiro (2010) adds another complete business

cycle to the data under the SGP, and again finds that the forecasts of European fiscal authorities

are systematically too optimistic. This evidence is not consistently strong across the set of 15

EU countries, but the bias is high for France, Italy and Portugal at all forecast horizons.7

Beetsma et al (2011) decompose the overall optimism bias in the budget forecasts of EU

governments into the component that arises between initial plans and the first release of actual

budget numbers and the component that arises between the first release and the final revised

budget numbers.

       One of the present authors (Frankel, 2011, 2112) recently studied forecasts of real growth

rates and budget balances made by official government agencies in 33 countries. A number of

striking findings emerge. (i) The official forecasts have an upward bias, which is stronger at

longer horizons. On average the gap between the forecast of the budget balance and the realized

balance is 0.2 percent of GDP at the one-year horizon, 0.8 percent at the two-year horizon, and

1.5 percent at the three-year horizon. (ii) One reason for the optimism bias in official budget

forecasts is an optimism bias in forecasts of economic growth. The country's growth rate is an

important determinant of the budget balance at all three time horizons, so over-optimism in

predicting growth is linked to over-optimism in predicting budget balances. On average, the

upward bias in growth forecasts is 0.4 percent when looking one year ahead, 1.1 percent at the

two-year horizon, and 1.8 percent at three years. (iii) The bias is stronger in booms than in

normal times. These findings can help to explain excessive budget deficits, and especially the

failure to run surpluses during periods of high output: if a boom is expected to last indefinitely,

then saving for a rainy day is unnecessary.

       Many believe that better fiscal policy can be obtained by means of rules such as ceilings

for the deficit. But Frankel (2011) also finds: (iv) countries subject to a budget rule, in the form

of euroland’s Stability and Growth Path, make official forecasts of growth and budget deficits

that are even more biased and more correlated with booms than do other countries. This effect

may help explain frequent violations of the SGP.

2. Data on Official Budget Forecasts
        The primary data for this paper come from an expanded version of the dataset used in

Frankel (2011). The dataset is composed of the official government forecasts in documents for

34 countries.8 Of these we have at least one full decade of budget data for 24 countries. The

countries with less than a decade of fiscal forecasting data are primarily Central and Eastern

European countries that only began publicly providing forecasts when they began submitting

Stability and Convergence Programs to the European Commission in 2005. These short time

series are almost entirely concentrated around the period of the global financial crisis, 2008-

2012; we exclude them from the analysis to avoid results that might be driven solely by this

single unusual historical episode.

        Of the remaining 24 countries, the 17 European countries9 are the main focus of our

analysis. The 7 non-European countries10 will be used occasionally, as a standard of

comparison. Beginning in 1999, the data for all European Union countries come from the

Stability and Convergence Programs that EU members are required to submit annually to the

European Commission as part of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). Prior to that, forecasts

were taken directly from national budgets. The dataset contains not only forecasts of the overall

budget balance, but also forecasts of real GDP growth, revenues as a percentage of GDP,

expenditures as a percentage of GDP, and the inflation rate. In the Stability and Convergence

Programs, EU countries are required to provide forecasts at least three years ahead, but the

forecasting horizon is often shorter in other countries’ budget processes. For instance, Norway

only forecasts its budget balance one year ahead. More information on the official budget

forecast as well as the data on the realizations of these macroeconomic variables can be found in

the appendix.

         The budget balance forecast data used in the analysis are summarized in Table A1 of the

appendix. In the table, it can be seen that budget forecast errors exhibit heterogeneous patterns

across countries. Figures 1 and 2 plot the mean one and two year horizon forecast error for each

of the countries in sample. The forecast error is defined as forecast budget balance minus actual

budget balance, so positive numbers indicate over-optimistic forecasts. In both cases, Greece,

Ireland and Portugal are the countries that have the most over-optimistic forecasts. Figure 3

plots the mean budget balance forecast error by year for European countries. The figure shows

that while budget forecast errors were particularly large in the wake of the global financial crisis

beginning in 2008, budget balances are generally over-optimistic throughout the full sample

period. Again, the over-optimism increases with the forecast horizon. Figure 4 plots the

equivalent figure for real GDP forecast errors for the European countries.




3. Influences on Official Forecasts
         In order to understand the sources of budget forecast errors, it is useful to begin by

examining how forecasts are affected by macroeconomic variables available contemporaneously,

that is, at the time the forecasts are made. To study forecast bias we compare how macro

variables explain forecast budget balance improvements and actual changes in the budget

balance. 11 We define the i-year budget balance improvement (BBIt+i) as the change in the

budget balance (BB) between time t and t+i:


11
  In this paper, we use the revised versions of macroeconomic statistics rather than the statistics that were
contemporaneously available because of data availability. For analysis of budget forecast errors using real-time data
see Beetsma et. al. (2009).


                                                          8
                                        BBIt+i =BBt+i -BBt

The Forecast Budget Balance Improvement (FBBIt+i) is defined equivalently, with the forecast of

the year t+i budget balance replacing BBt+i.

       Here, we limit ourselves to two explanatory variables: the current budget balance (BBt)

and the output gap (OGt). To calculate the output gap, log real GDP is HP filtered and the output

gap is defined as the cyclical component, that is, log GDP minus the trend component (times

100). Table 1 looks only at European countries. We regress Forecast and Actual Budget

Balance Improvements on the current output gap and budget balance:

                                BBIt+i =0+1 BBt +2OGt +t+i .

       The main finding in these regressions is that governments forecast too much mean

reversion, with 1 strongly negative and significant for forecast improvements but much less so

for actual improvements. The magnitude of 1 increases with the forecast horizon.

       In addition, an excess of current output above trend portends a deterioration in the budget

balance in the subsequent year (presumably due to reversion in output), which is not at all

captured in the forecast. We find that these two macroeconomic variables – the current budget

deficit and output -- explain a large fraction of forecast budget balance improvements: for

European countries the R2 is 0.41 at the one-year forecast horizon, 0.56 at the two-year forecast

horizon, and 0.66 at the three-year horizon. While official government forecasts predict that

deficits will be short-lived, the actual budget balance improvements have much lower 1

coefficients.

       In Table 2, rather than including just the simple budget balance at the time the forecast

was made, BBt, we allow the coefficient on the contemporaneous budget balance to differ

depending on whether the budget is in surplus or deficit. Defining Surplust as an indicator



                                                9
variable that takes the value of 1 when BBt is greater than or equal to 0, and Deficitt as an

indicator variable that takes the value 1 when BBt is less than 0, we run the regression:

                   BBIt+i =0+1 Surplust*BBt +2 Deficitt*BBt +3OGt +t+i .

The key finding is that at the one year horizon, the coefficient 2 on Deficitt*BBt is negative and

very strongly significant, but the coefficient 1 on Surplust*BBt is insignificantly different than

zero. In the short-term, we therefore see that countries forecast deficits to disappear but do not

do so for surpluses.

       In column 2, we see that this prediction is qualitatively correct, as large deficits do

predict budget balance improvements but surpluses do not. However, the 2 coefficient for the

forecast improvement is nearly three times as large as for the actual improvements, meaning that

while deficits tend to be reduced in the short run, they are not reduced as much as they are

forecast to. Interestingly, at the two year horizon, surpluses and deficits are forecast to be nearly

equally mean-reverting, while at the three year horizon deficits are forecast to contract more

quickly than surpluses. Thus, while government forecasts claim that deficits will be quickly

eliminated, and this tendency explains a large amount of the variation in their forecasts, in reality

these measures are poor predictors of the evolution of the budget deficit.

       In appendix Table A4, we run a version of the regressions in Table 1 on forecast and

actual real GDP growth levels. We find that while the output gap has very little explanatory

power for government real GDP growth forecasts, it actually has quite a bit of explanatory power

for actual GDP growth. The output gap at the time forecasts are prepared enters strongly

negatively. This result should be interpreted with some caution as our measure of the output gap

uses future information as it is calculated using the HP filter.




                                                 10
3.1 Forecast Errors
         In this section, we focus explicitly on how current macroeconomic conditions relate to

future forecast errors. We define the i year ahead budget balance forecast errors BBEt+i as the

forecast budget balance value minus the actual budget balance.

                                             BBEt+i =FBBt+i,t -BBt+i

         In the above expression BBEt+i indicates the realized i year ahead forecast error, FBBt+i,t

is the budget balance forecast for period t+i made in period t, and BBt+i is the realized budget

balance in period t+i . Much of the remainder of this paper will focus on understanding when

countries are systematically over-optimistic in their official budget forecasts (a high value of

BBEt+i). We begin this exercise in the first three columns of Table 3 by seeing whether

macroeconomic variables known at the time the forecast is made (time t) can predict the size of

budget forecast errors.

                                      BBEt+i =0+1 BBt +2OGt +t+i .

         In columns 1-3 of Table 3 we see that large budget deficits at the time a forecast is made

on average correspond to forecasts that prove to be over-optimistic. This bias increases with the

forecast horizon. In addition, we find further support for the conclusion of Frankel (2011) that

official forecasts are especially subject to wishful thinking during booms, defined here as output

being above trend.12 For European countries, a 1% increase in the output gap at the time a

forecast is made is associated with a budget forecast that is 0.6% of GDP too optimistic at the

one year horizon, 1.4% at the two year horizon and 1.9% at the three year horizon.




12
  Because the Output Gap is constructed using the HP filter, future data is used in constructing the contemporary
output gap so these are not true predictive regressions. However, these results are generally robust to replacing the
output gap with recent GDP growth.


                                                          11
        In Table 4, we once again introduce dummy variables for surpluses and deficits to see if

surpluses and deficits differentially affect budget forecast errors:

                         BBEt+i =0+1 Surplust*BBt +2 Deficitt*BBt +3OGt +t+i .

We find that at all three horizons, 2 is negatively and strongly significant, confirming that

countries with larger budget deficits are more over-optimistic in their forecasts. At the two year

horizon, we again find that countries forecast that their surpluses will shrink more quickly than

they do.

        Tables A5 and A6 (reported in the appendix) perform the same exercise for two different

subsamples: euro area countries and non euro countries. Larger current budget deficits are

associated with significantly more over-optimistic budget forecasts at all horizons over both the

1999-2007 and 1999-2011 time periods for euro area countries. So the crises of 2008-2011 are

not driving these results.13 The current output gap is a robust predictor of over-optimistic budget

forecasts for both euro area and non-euro area countries, over either period.

        In Columns 4-6 of Table 3, we repeat this exercise for GDP growth forecast errors.

Defining the real GDP growth forecast error as:

                                     GDPEt+i =FGDPRt+i,t -GDPRt+i ,

where FGDPRt+i,t is the time t forecast of real GDP growth rate in year t+i, and GDPRt+i is the

actual real GDP growth rate in period t+i, we regress GDPEt+i on the contemporaneous output

gap and budget balance to see if these current variables can explain the forecasting bias. As was

the case for budget deficits, a large positive output gap is a strong predictor of over-optimistic

forecasts; booms are unrealistically extrapolated into the future. A contemporary budget deficit is

a weaker predictor of over-optimism and is only significant at the two year horizon.

13
  Larger budget deficits are only a predictor of over-optimism at the two year horizon from 1999-2011 for non-euro
area countries.


                                                       12
Governments predict that booms will continue longer than they actually do. Those countries

with budget deficits have a tendency to wish them away via future growth prospects.




4. Over-optimism and the Stability and Growth Pact
       Next, we explore how exactly the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) rules relate to over-

optimism in the euro area. Because the SGP forbids EU members to exceed a deficit of 3% of

GDP we hypothesize that governments will be reluctant to forecast breaches of this limit and will

instead shade their forecasts into the permissible range and then if necessary blame their

subsequent violation on events outside their control. While all signatories of the Maastricht

Treaty technically agree to abide by the SGP limits on deficits and debt, only euro area countries

face the threat of sanctions for violations (in theory) or political pressure and embarrassment (in

practice). We therefore treat euro area members as the only countries for whom the SGP limits

are relevant.

       Figure 5 offers visual support for the idea that the SGP makes countries less willing to

forecast deficits greater than 3% of GDP but not necessarily less likely to violate the limit. In all

four panels, the vertical red line indicates a budget deficit of 3% of GDP. In the upper left hand

panel, we see that prior to the global financial crisis, only once did a euro area country forecast a

violation of the 3% limit at the two year horizon, yet there is no such discontinuity for actual

budget deficits (upper right hand panel). For comparison, we include a similar histogram of two

year forecasts for countries outside the euro area, and the corresponding realizations in the lower

right panel. In Table A7, in the appendix, we contrast forecast and actual violations of the 3%

deficit/GDP limit for Euro area and non Euro area countries from 1999-2007. At all forecast




                                                 13
horizons, euro area countries were less likely to forecast deficits over 3% even though they

actually violated the limit more frequently.

         To examine more systematically this idea that countries bound by the Stability and

Growth Pact try to avoid or postpone reprimands by means of overly optimistic forecasts, in

Table 5 we begin by regressing budget forecast errors on the contemporaneous output gap OGt

and a dummy variable for membership in the euro area Eurot .14 In the first specification we

omit year fixed effects (columns 1 and 4) and in the second we include them (columns 2 and 5).

As can be seen in these baseline regressions, membership in the euro area alone is associated

with an increase in budget forecast over-optimism, though the increase is not statistically

significant at the 5% level.

         In columns 3 and 6, we regress budget forecast errors on the contemporaneous output gap

OGt , a dummy variable for violation of the Excessive Deficit Procedure limit EDPt that is 1 if

the country's most recent budget deficit violates the 3% cap, a dummy variable Eurot that is 1 if

the country was a member of the euro area at the time the forecast was made, and interaction

terms. We also include year fixed effects to control for common time-varying shocks t.

      BBEt+i =0+t.+1 OGt .+2 EDPt +3 Eurot +4 Eurot *OGt .+5 Eurot *EDPt +t+i .



         The main result concerns the interaction between the dummy variable for membership in

the euro area and a violation of the EDP at the time the forecast was made (5). This coefficient

is large and positive in each specification at the one and two year horizons: when Euro area

countries are in violation of the EDP at the time a forecast is made, their one year forecasts are

biased by over 1.5% of GDP more than non-euro violators of the EDP limit. At the two year
14
  Because the large majority of the three-year horizon forecast data we have comes from Stability and Convergence
Programs, in this section we only look at forecast errors at the one and two year horizon to ensure we have sufficient
observations from countries outside the euro area.


                                                         14
horizon, the point estimate is over 2% of GDP. In other words, even controlling for year fixed

effects, the level of the output gap, and a dummy for the common bias coming from deficits

larger than 3% of GDP, euro area countries that make their budget forecasts while in violation of

the deficit limit have forecasts that are 1.6% of GDP more over-optimistic at the one year

horizon than non-euro countries exceeding the 3% criterion. At the two year horizon, the effect is

even stronger, with Euro area countries that violate the EDP at the time a forecast is made having

forecast errors over 2% of GDP more over-optimistic than other countries with deficits that

large.

         This result provides an enlightening interpretation of the result in Frankel (2011) that

Euro area countries are overall more over-optimistic in their budget deficits: in these regressions,

euro area forecast errors are comparable to non-euro area forecasts except that when the limits

set out in the EDP are breached euro members have very large over-optimistic forecast errors.

These regressions provide support for the idea that when faced with fiscal rules like the SGP,

countries find it tempting to adjust their forecasts to meet the criteria, rather than taking the

painful actions needed to meet the criteria in reality.

         These bias estimates are quite large. They reflect in part the fact that these countries were

hit particularly hard during the 2009 financial crisis. Nevertheless, the fact that these countries

missed their forecasts so much more than other countries is quite interesting, especially since the

year fixed effects take out the mean effect of the global financial crisis on government budgets.




                                                  15
5. National Fiscal Rules
        In this section, we examine the impact of national fiscal rules on official forecast errors.

Even though the eurozone’s fiscal compact was only agreed in late 2011, many of the members

already had rules at the national level. It should be possible to learn from their experience.

        The fiscal constraints of the SGP provide a clear motivation for wishful thinking in the

forecasts, in order to avoid the political embarrassment of reprimands if not outright sanctions

from a supranational monitoring authority. It is not clear a priori if we should expect the same

sort of pattern for national rules. On the one hand, the country is “grading its own homework.”

Rather than the sovereign being monitored and disciplined by an external authority removed

from domestic politics, national fiscal rules are enforced by branches of the same government

that does the forecasting. On the other hand, national law and especially national constitutions

are often thought to take legal precedence over international agreements.




5.1 Fiscal Rule Index
        Before turning to the examination of the impact of different types of fiscal rules on

budget balance forecast errors, we briefly describe the indices we use to measure the strength of

national fiscal rules. The underlying data on the classification of these rules come from the

European Commission's (EC) “Numerical Fiscal Rules in the EU Member States.”15 The

database provides the data at varied levels of aggregation. At the finest level, it provides details

on every individual fiscal rule in each EU member state from 1990 through 2010 (107 individual

rules). The European Commission classifies each fiscal rule as either a budget balance rule


15
  Available at http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/db_indicators/fiscal_governance/fiscal_rules/index_en.htm .
The data on national fiscal rules in euroland were also applied to this problem by Zlatinova and Otto (2012).


                                                       16
(BBR), debt rule (DR), expenditure rule (ER) or revenue rule (RR). For each rule, the EC also

provides a numerical “Fiscal Rule Strength Index” (FRSI). This index is a weighted average of

five rule criteria: Statutory base of the rule, how much room the rule allows in setting or revising

objectives, the nature and independence of the monitoring and enforcement body, the

enforcement mechanisms of the rule, and visibility of the rule in the media.16

        In order to construct an aggregate Fiscal Rule Index (FRI) for each country, the EC then

multiplies the FRSI by the fraction of general government finances covered by the rule. If only

one rule is in force in a country in a given year, this product of the FRSI and the fraction of

finances covered is the Fiscal Rule Index (FRI) for the year. If, however, multiple rules apply to

the same government sector17, they are ranked by the product of the fraction of government

finances they cover and their FRSIs; the strongest rule covering each government sector is given

a weight of 1, the second 1/2, the third 1/3, and so on. These weighted rules18 are then summed

to form the FRI. In the EC index, budget balance rules, debt rules, revenue rules, and expenditure

rules are all treated equally in the construction of the aggregate FRI.

        These types of rules are conceptually different. Thus, rather than use the composite FRI

constructed by the EC, which is what Zlatinova and Otto (2012) do, we construct separate FRI's

for budget balance, debt, expenditure and revenue rules. We follow the same process used by the

EC in constructing the aggregate index in constructing our four separate indices. We then

normalize each of the indices to run between 0 and 1. For budget balance rules, the United

Kingdom’s budget balance rule in place from 1997-2008 achieved the highest score in sample



16
   The FRSI indices use the random weights method as in Sutherland et. al. (2005).
17
   Each rule is classified by the government sector that it covers: the central government, regional governments,
local governments and social security. A rule can also be classified as covering multiple sectors or the general
government. If one rule covers the general government sector and a second rule covers only certain sectors, the rule
covering the individual sector is discounted as it were the second rule covering that specific sector.
18
   The weighted rules are (rule weight) X (coverage of general government finances) X (FRSI).


                                                        17
and is therefore given the value of one in our index.19 The budget balance rule index thus runs

from 0 (no budget balance rule) to rules comparably strong as the United Kingdom’s “Golden

Rule.” The countries for which we have data on national fiscal rules and sufficient budget

forecast data20 to include in the regressions are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France,

Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the

United Kingdom. Regression results that includes specific national fiscal rules is limited to these

countries, which are called “EC dataset countries” in the regressions.

        Figure 6 plots these FRI for budget balance rules, revenue rules, expenditure rules, and

debt rules for all of the countries on which we have data.




5.2 Budget Balance Rules
        Having constructed these indices, we next examine the impact of national budget balance

rules on budget forecast errors. In the first two columns of Table 6, we regress the one and two

year budget balance forecast errors on the output gap, the budget balance FRI (BBR FRIt) and an

interaction term. We find that stronger national budget balance rules are associated with a

statistically insignificant reduction in the amount of over-optimism in budget forecasts. In

columns 3 and 4, we mirror the Euro regressions of Table 5 by adding a dummy variable for a

deficit greater than 3% of GDP (EDPt ) and an interaction between this dummy and the budget

balance fiscal rule index. Whereas euro area countries that violate the excessive deficit procedure

at the time they are making budget forecasts make much more over-optimistic forecasts, the

effect is reversed when it comes to national budget balance rules (albeit statically insignificantly


19
   The so-called “Golden Rule” restricted the general government to borrow only to finance investment rather than
current spending.
20
   As in the previous sections, we require at least 10 budgets.


                                                        18
different from zero). Thus, while all countries with budget balances greater than 3% of GDP

generally have over-optimistic forecasts, this bias is reduced but not eliminated by stronger

national fiscal rules. This effect is in the opposite direction from the case of the supranational

SGP, although the 3% level is generally not the target of national budget balance rules.




5.3 Budget Balance Rules and the SGP
The final issue we address in this section is how exactly national budget balance rules interact

with the SGP. To examine this question, in the first two columns of Table 7 we regress budget

balance forecast errors on the contemporaneous output gap, the budget balance fiscal rule index,

a dummy for membership in the euro area and an interaction between national budget balance

rules and euro area membership.

          BBEt+i =0+t.+1 OGt .+2 BBR FRIt +3 Eurot +4 Eurot *BBR FRIt +t+i .

 The main result is that while membership in the euro area is associated with more over-

optimistic budget balance forecasts, this effect is reduced when euro area membership is

combined with national budget balance rules. Although the direct effect of budget balance rules,

without conditioning on euro membership, is statistically insignificant (Table 6), the results of

the first two columns of Table 7 imply that national fiscal rules help reduce over-optimism when

counteracting the effect of a supranational rule.

       The last four columns of Table 7 attempt to understand why national fiscal rules are

effective in reducing the bias in euro area forecasts. Since the over-optimism bias in the euro

area is mainly present when countries are already in violation of the statutory limit, we examine

whether national fiscal rules are effective in eliminating this specific bias. To do so, we look at

the coefficient on an interaction variable of Eurot*BBR FRIt*EDPt, a dummy variable for


                                                    19
membership in the euro area, the budget balance FRI, and a dummy variable for violation of the

3% limit. In columns 3 and 4, we include this interaction along with Eurot*EDPt , a dummy for

euro membership, a dummy for violation of the EDP and the output gap. We find that the

coefficient on the Eurot*EDPt variable is large, positive, and significant, confirming the earlier

result that euro area member forecasts are particularly biased when made at a time when the

deficit is larger than the 3% cap. However, this effect is greatly reduced if the country has fiscal

rules, as seen by the coefficient on Eurot*BBR FRIt*EDPt. Based on the point estimates, if a euro

country violating the EDP limit were to go from having no fiscal rule to adopting a rule as strong

as Britain’s Golden Rule, we estimate that forecast bias, at the one year horizon, would be no

more optimistic than that of a non-euro area country not in violation of the EDP limit

(.980+2.646-3.771). This is also the case for the two year horizon, which is particularly

interesting because even non-euro area countries have very biased forecasts when they have

deficits large enough that they would violate the 3% limit (the coefficient on the EDP dummy is

over 2). Therefore, strong fiscal rules can counteract not just the bias among euro area countries,

but also the bias that other countries with comparably large deficits face. In columns 5 and 6 we

repeat the analysis of columns 3 and 4 but include all possible interaction terms of EDP

violation, budget balance rules, and Euro area membership. The coefficients are nearly

unchanged from columns 3 and 4, though the individual coefficients lose some significance.




6. Independent fiscal institutions and the SGP
       In this section, we consider the effect of combining budget balance rules with

independent government forecasts. As described in Frankel (2012), the Chilean government has

been successful in combining fiscal rules with a legal requirement to use forecasts of a panel of



                                                 20
independent experts in the government budget process. The European Commission has a

database on the role of independent fiscal institutions in the budgetary processes across EU

member states.21 Unfortunately it is not possible to create a proper time series as in the case of

the national budget balance rules.22

         For each EU member, if the country has an independent fiscal institution the database

includes its date of creation, whether the government is required to consult with it during the

budgetary process, whether it is generally consulted despite the lack of a legal obligation,

whether it provides an analysis of fiscal policy with or without normative judgment, whether it

provides independent macroeconomic or budgetary forecasts, how the government is required to

use its forecasts during the budgetary process, and several other pieces of information.

         In Table 8 we limit ourselves to using only one dimension of the database: whether a

country has an independent fiscal institution that provides independent forecasts of the general

government budget balance. While we would have liked to examine the impact of the

government being legally bound to use these forecasts, as in Chile, no country in the European

Union has a legal or constitutional obligation to use the independent forecasts.23

         Therefore, we are limited to analyzing the effect that the existence of an independent

fiscal institution making independent forecasts has on the government's own forecasts. In Table

8, IND FBBt is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 if the country has an independent fiscal


21
   Available at http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/db_indicators/fiscal_governance/independent_institutions/index_en.htm. The
European Commission defines independent fiscal institutions as “non partisan public bodies, other than the central
bank, government or parliament that prepare macroeconomic forecasts for the budget, monitor fiscal performance
and/or advise the government on fiscal policy matters.” The EC notes that one of the benefits of these institutions is
that they “can provide macroeconomic forecasts for the budget preparation that do not suffer from the optimistic
biases often found in official government forecasts.”
22
   Other than through the dates the independent fiscal institutions were founded, the database does not include
whether the tasks performed by the institution or its legal position has changed since its inception. Therefore, we
assume that these characteristics are unchanged since the institutions were created.
23
   In Austria, the government needs to justify publicly deviations from the forecasts of the Austrian Institute of
Economic Research.


                                                             21
institution that provides independent budget balance forecasts at time t.24 In Columns 3-4 of

Table 8, conditional on the current output gap and budget balance, the forecasting bias associated

with euro membership appears to be reduced in countries where independent fiscal institutions

provide independent budget balance forecasts. Without conditioning on the present budget

balance (Columns 1 and 2), the sign is the same and the magnitude is economically significant,

though not statistically so.

         In columns 5 and 6, we examine whether independent forecasts can be helpful in

overcoming the tendency of euro area countries to offer more biased budget forecasts when they

are in violation of the 3% SGP limit. In Columns 5 and 6, we see this is in fact the case: although

euro area countries violating the EDP at the time a forecast is made (Eurot *EDPt ) offer more

optimistic forecasts, this bias is reduced for euro area countries violating the EDP that have

independent budget forecasts (Eurot *Ind FBBt*EDPt ). It is unclear why the direct effect of

independent forecasts and violations of the EDP (Ind FBBt *EDPt) is so strong at the two year

horizon. But even this strong effect is more than reversed by the effect for Eurot *Ind

FBBt*EDPt .

         The regressions show that euro area governments making forecasts while in violation of

the EDP with an independent fiscal institution that makes independent budget forecasts have a

mean bias that is smaller by 2.9% of GDP at the one-year horizon and 2.6% of GDP at the two

year horizon, compared to a euro area country violating the EDP without such an independent

fiscal institution.

         The causal interpretation of these results must be qualified: countries that place a high

value on the integrity of the forecasts may be less inclined to bias their budget forecasts and may


24
  In constructing this variable, we assume that if the independent fiscal institution provides independent forecasts as
of 2010 that it provided these forecasts since the institution’s creation.


                                                          22
be more inclined to adopt national fiscal rules or create independent fiscal institutions compared

to other countries.




7. Conclusion
   Our two most important conclusions can be stated succinctly. First, Euro area countries

   appear to have responded to the 3% limit imposed by the Stability and Growth Pact by

   offering over-optimistic forecasts when they are most in danger of breaching the limit.

   Second, national budget balance rules or independent fiscal institutions that provide their

   own independent forecasts help to reduce this bias.

Budget Balance and Growth Data Realizations
European countries: All realizations from Eurostat. For 1999-present, budget balance is Eurostat series EDP B.9,
net lending/net borrowing under the excessive deficit procedure, as this is the exact budget balance the European
countries forecast in their stability and convergence programs. Prior to 1999, the deficit is defined according to
ESA95 (series B.9). The difference between the two series differs in their treatment of interest relating to swaps and
forward agreements. In practice, the differences between the series are very small, but the ESA95 calculation
generally extends farther back than EDP B.9, which only goes back through 1995. See
http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/en/gov_dd_esms.htm for more information.


For Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, budget balance realizations are taken from the
World Bank World Development Indicators. Budget balance realizationd for the United States are taken directly
from the Historical Tables included in the annual budget documents.

Similarly, all real GDP growth realizations for European countries come from Eurostat and from World
Development Indicators for the remaining countries with the exception of the United States. Because the United
States reports fiscal year GDP growth forecasts in the budget, US real GDP growth rate realizations are calculated
using the annual change in real GDP from Q3 over Q3 using data from Global Financial Data. Data on the level of
real GDP used to compute the output gap are from the same sources as real GDP growth.
