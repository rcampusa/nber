I. Introduction
Despite the accomplishments of the Uruguay Round of the GATT,1 there remains

concern that nations are circumventing the agreements by means of various non-tariff

barriers. One specific concern is that the “Antidumping Agreement,”2 created to allow

unilateral measures against dumped imports causing material injury to domestic firms, is

being used more often as pure protection than as a trade remedy and that it is being used

to excess by an increasingly large number of countries.

        Antidumping (AD) use has increased dramatically over the last two decades

(Miranda, Torres and Ruiz, 1998; Prusa, 2001). For instance, more than three times the

number of countries have been involved in AD disputes – both in terms of those filing

cases and those being filed against – during the 1990s as compared with the 1980s.

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the growth and certainly the most crucial for the

issues examined in this paper is the fact that the “traditional” users of antidumping

(Australia, Canada, the E.U., New Zealand, and the U.S.) have been joined by an ever-

growing group of “new” users, including South Africa, Brazil, and Mexico among others.

        In theory, AD actions are intended for use only against importers suspected of

unfair trade practices. In practice, there is considerable latitude in usage due to the

manner in which most AD codes are written. As the number of users and cases filed

annually grow, it is increasingly difficult to identify the motives of the users of AD and to

argue that increased usage signals merely an increase in unfair trade.



1 Since the end of the Uruguay Round in 1994, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has
been administered by the World Trade Organization (WTO). This latest round of agreements reduced
developed country tariffs on industrial products by 40% and increased the percentage of product lines with
bound tariff levels from 78% to 99% in the developed countries and from 21% to 73% in the developing
countries; further details on the agreements reached during the Uruguay Round can be found at
www.wto.org/wto/about/agmnts2.htm.
2 The Antidumping Agreement is formally known as the “Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994.”


                                                                                                         1
       This paper uses data on all antidumping cases filed and reported to the

GATT/WTO between 1980 and 1998 to examine these motives of AD users. We identify

two sets of motives to which AD usage can be tied, one “economic” and one “strategic,”

and analyze filing patterns over the two decades to determine which of the motives

receive support in the data. In addition, we take a critical look at the differences in filing

patterns and motives across the two groups of AD users.

       The economic motives we consider are based on the traditional view of AD as a

response to unfair trade and on the newer description of AD as “special protection”

(Bagwell and Staiger, 1990). Here we look for evidence of AD cases filed against “big”

suppliers or against suppliers with large import surges. Our set of strategic motives

follows work by Finger (1993) and Prusa (2001) in identifying “club” and “retaliation”

motives for AD use. Countries who have used previously used AD protection (against

any country) are considered club members. The retaliation motive is more narrowly

defined and refers to a country filing AD actions specifically against those countries that

had previously named it in the past.

       Our analysis consists of an overview first of the number of AD cases initiated

during the 1980s and 1990s, including a break-down by country of origin, and then of the

number of cases consistent with the various economic and strategic motives we have

identified. We also provide some formal non-parametric tests that allow us to quantify

the statistical significance of the observed trends.

       The results of the analysis are striking. The general picture we find is in full

accordance with the concerns regarding increased usage of AD. That is, the growth in

the number of cases has been tremendous and the use of AD is spreading rapidly across

countries. Beyond those well-acknowledged figures, however, we find in the raw data

evidence to support both economic and strategic motives for AD case filings for both

traditional and new users, with the most support for use against big suppliers and AD

club members. Formal tests for statistical significance of the various motives show

                                                                                              2
greater variation across the two user types, with traditional users showing more

significance in both the economic and strategic motive categories but with considerable

support for the existence of strategic motives for AD use. While further research aimed

at distinguishing the individual effects of each motive is warranted, we believe that our

results here help to reject the notion that the rise in AD activity can be solely explained

by an increase in unfair trade.

       The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section provides a brief

overview of the historical trends in AD use and its spread during the last two decades.

Section III reviews the theoretical underpinnings for the various explanations for AD use.

In Section IV, we describe our data, including a breakdown of cases consistent with each

of the different motives and in Section V we present the results of our non-parametric

tests. Concluding comments are provided in Section VI.



II. Spread of Antidumping Use
       The relatively recent upsurge in antidumping case filings and the attention it has

received belies the longer history of antidumping policy and its use. Antidumping was,

in fact, in use very early in the 20th century. The first modern antidumping law was

passed in Canada in 1904 with Australia following close behind in 1906. By 1921, the

U.S., France, Britain and most of the British Commonwealth had similar laws on their

books (Finger, 1993, pp. 15-23).

       Despite its long lineage AD was not a widely used trade law until the late-1970s.

For example, according to Finger and Fung (1994) fewer than a dozen cases were filed

each year during the 1960s. The reason is two-fold. First, tariffs were higher so

industries were less exposed to import competition and fewer industries perceived

imports as a threat. Second, during this period the rules for imposing AD duties were

difficult to satisfy. The U.S., for instance, did not levy duties in a single AD case during

the entire decade of the 1950s. The pattern during the 1960s was about the same with

                                                                                               3
only about 10 percent of U.S. AD cases resulting in duties. The high standards were in

effect among all contracting parties. In 1958, when the contracting parties canvassed

themselves about the use of AD, the resulting tally showed only 37 AD decrees in force

across all GATT member countries (Finger, 1993).

         However, AD’s life in the backwater of trade policy ended with the 1979 Tokyo

Round agreement. The agreement contained two key amendments that transformed this

little used trade statute into the workhorse of international trade protection. First, the

definition of “less than fair value” (LTFV) sales was broadened to capture not only price

discrimination but also sales below cost.3 Cost-based allegations now account for

between one-half and two-thirds of U.S. AD cases (Clarida, 1996) and for as much as

ninety percent of EU cases against developing countries (Messerlin, 1989). According to

one noted legal expert cost-based AD petitions have become “the dominant feature of US

antidumping law” (Horlick, 1989, p. 136).4

         Second, there was a change to the procedures involved in showing material injury

to domestic firms. The Kennedy Round Code had required that the dumped imports be

“demonstrably the principal cause of material injury” before duties could be imposed. In

response to pressure from a number of the developed countries, the Tokyo Round Code

revised this provision to render such a demonstration unnecessary.

         There was an almost immediate increase in the number of AD disputes

(Figure 1).5 In 1980, 69 new AD cases were filed and more than 150 cases were filed the
following year. In fact, in only one year since 1980 has the number of cases fallen below

100. In recent years, about 250 AD cases have been initiated each year. Over the entire



3 The rule codified recent practice in several of the signatory states, including Australia, Canada, and the
United States.
4 Lindsey (1999) provides strong evidence for Horlick’s view: over the four-year period 1995-98, only 4 of
141 LTFV calculations were based on a true price-to-price comparison.
5 All AD data reported in this paper are based on the mandatory “Reports of AD activity” required by the
GATT/WTO.


                                                                                                           4
19-year period, over 3500 AD cases were filed worldwide (an average of 185 cases per

year), with the bulk of these being filed during the 1990s.

       Despite the increase in its use, it did not initially appear that AD was a worldwide

problem; it was an instrument wielded by only a handful of countries. Until the late-

1980s, essentially all AD actions were initiated by the five “traditional” users: the U.S.,

Canada, the European Union, Australia, and New Zealand. Traditional users were

responsible for a total of 99.4% of all of the AD cases filed between 1980 and 1985 as

well as for more than 95% of the cases filed during the entire decade of the 1980s.

       By the late-1980s, however, the AD club was no longer nearly as exclusive: the

traditional users were being joined at an increasing rate by non-traditional or “new” users

of AD. To highlight this point we also plot the percentage of AD cases filed by new

users in Figure 1. New users first filed a significant fraction of all worldwide AD cases

(20%) in 1987. Their prominent role in AD use has never abated; in every year since

1993 new users initiated over half of all AD cases filed and were responsible for more

than two-thirds of AD disputes in both 1996 and 1998. Overall, during the 1990s, new

users accounted for more than 40% of the total number of cases filed, a considerable

increase over the 4.5% of cases filed by new users during the 1980s.

       It is informative to see which countries filed AD cases over the two decades

covered by our study and to look at their changing roles in the international filing

patterns. Table 1 provides details on the countries that filed AD cases between 1980 and

1989, as well as those that filed between 1990 and 1998, indicating the percentage of

filings over each period that can be attributed to individual nations. For new users, the

year of their first AD filing is also shown in the table. As mentioned above, over 95% of

the cases filed during the 1980s can be attributed to the five traditional users. With the

exception of Finland, new users began filing AD complaints only in the latter half of the

decade, with South Korea starting in 1985 and Mexico and Brazil following shortly

thereafter in 1987 and 1988 respectively.

                                                                                              5
       The difference across the periods is remarkable. No single new user of AD

accounted for more that 3% of the total cases filed during the 1980s and new users as a

group accounted for fewer than 5% of all cases filed during that decade. During the 1990s

the picture changed dramatically. That decade saw a noticeable increase in the number of

countries filing AD complaints to a total of 33, compared to only nine in the 1980s. The

24 countries that first filed AD cases after 1990 joined the list of AD users in a steady

stream. Eleven countries (including Japan, Argentina, Turkey, and Israel) first used AD

between 1991 and 1993; eight countries (including South Africa, Malaysia, and Trinidad

and Tobago) first used AD between 1994 and 1996; a further five countries (including

Egypt, Czechoslovakia, and Nicaragua) started using AD in 1997 and 1998.

       Most of the new users filed a very small percentage of the total AD complaints

lodged during the decade, with 21 countries filing fewer than 2% of the total cases each.

Within those 21 countries were nations from all stages of economic development and

from all parts of the world, ranging from Japan, Poland, Turkey and Egypt, to Nicaragua,

Venezuela, Singapore and Thailand. The cumulative effect of this AD activity by new

users was such that the five traditional users accounted for only slightly more than half

(56%) of the cases filed in the 1990s. This fact emphasizes the manner in which the

increased AD filings by non-traditional users eclipsed traditional user behavior over the

last decade.

       One of the goals of this paper is to examine the motives behind the increasingly

large number of AD complaints filed each year, especially by non-traditional users.

Countries can always claim, of course, that they are motivated only by a sincere desire to

“level the playing field” and “fight unfair trade.” The enthusiasm with which the new

users have embraced AD, however, certainly makes us question whether other factors are

involved.

       Along these lines we highlight one particularly interesting trend in the final

column of Table 1. There we indicate, for each new user, the number of AD cases filed

                                                                                            6
against that country between 1980 and the year of its first AD filing. For instance, when

South Korea began to use AD law in 1985 it had been subject to almost 40 AD

investigations since 1980. When Brazil started its AD program in 1988, it had been the

subject of 55 investigations. With the exception only of Panama and Guatemala, every

new user was subject to AD complaints before it initiated its own AD policy; many

countries had been named in dozens of investigations. In fact, almost two-thirds of the

28 new users were subject to at least ten investigations before they began to initiate their

own AD complaints.

        This suggests that the new users were not unfamiliar with the implications of AD

policy prior to their first filed complaints, that they had prior experience with the vagaries

of the broad notions of injury and dumping, and that they would have been able to

identify those countries that had successfully used AD against them in the past. If

ulterior motives lie behind the increase in AD filings by new users in the 1990s, the data

in the last column of Table 1 suggest why such countries might have felt that strategic

retaliation was warranted. We will return to this issue in the following sections.

        When considered as a whole package, the evidence on recent trends in AD use

suggests that, to a large extent, the table has turned for the traditional users. The share of

cases accounted for by the United States, the world’s most prolific user of AD law,

decreased by almost 50% during the 1990s as compared with the 1980s. In fact, the

United States is now the second most investigated country, trailing only PR-China.6
Countries such as Mexico, Argentina, South Africa, Brazil, and India have become some

of the heaviest users of AD. And every year, new countries that have been investigated

by others in the past make their own forays into the AD policy arena. Such striking

trends certainly raise the specter that countries are using AD law for reasons other than

punishing unfair trade.

6Leaving out cases brought by U.S. industries, the United States is the country most often alleged to have
dumped.


                                                                                                             7
III. Motivations for Antidumping Use

Our look at the trends in antidumping use raises questions regarding the motivations that

underlie the use of antidumping policy. Although AD actions, in their purest form,

should occur only after an incident of dumping, AD statutes as generally written allow

countries significant discretion in their application of the law and implementation by

authorities is often poor. Thus, the data reviewed in Section II lead us to ask whether the

upsurge in AD case filings is truly indicative of an upsurge in unfair trading practices

with the increased importance of global markets or whether there might be other

incentives that drive each nation’s decision to file, or begin to file, AD complaints. In

reviewing the economic literature on antidumping, we find competing explanations for

the use of AD, from the traditional analysis of AD as a response to unfair trade, through a

more modern explanation of AD as special or safeguard protection, to the possibility that

countries might use AD strategically.

        The standard theoretical explanation for AD is based on the existence of dumped

imports, goods that are sold either at a price below that set in the importer’s domestic

market or at a price below the importer’s cost of production, implying that goods are not

sold at “fair value.”7 In response to such unfair trade practices an importing country may

then file AD actions. Such actions are consistent with the GATT/WTO code that

provides for the imposition of AD duties in cases in which dumped imports are found to

have caused material injury to domestic firms.

        Given the level of detail at which the WTO records AD actions we are

constrained to use country-level data in our current study. Therefore, we cannot directly

identify instances of dumping or unfair trading practices. However, we can look for

indirect evidence of such practices. For example, one could expect that exporting at

unfairly low prices would result in large import volumes and/or large increases in

imports. If AD cases were predominantly directed at trading partners with such trends,

that fact could be construed as evidence of the use of AD to combat unfair trade.8

        A newer explanation for the use of antidumping categorizes AD policy as an

example of “special protection.” Such protection has been argued to be an important

component in achieving overall trade liberalization by allowing countries to suspend their

tariff-reduction obligations for those industries that are more significantly injured by

imports than trade negotiators anticipated. Bagwell and Staiger (1990) provide a formal

game-theoretic model in which special protection arises as a short-term cooperative

remedy for changes in the underlying trade flows.

        The tariff reduction game between two countries has the structure of a prisoners’

dilemma, with the “cooperative” tariff rate being at the low, trade-liberalizing level. In a

repeated version of the game, countries could solve the dilemma by using contingent

strategies that incorporate punishment schemes to handle instances of defection from the

cooperative outcome, or by the creation of formal agreements that include third-party

enforcement mechanisms, such as the GATT.9 Bagwell and Staiger (1990) argue,

however, that schemes such as these cannot account for the growing incidence of the use


8 The injury requirement also makes it more likely that one would name countries with large imports or
large changes in imports since such trends are usually taken as evidence of economic harm.
9 Papers by Dixit (1987), Jensen and Thursby (1984), Mayer (1981), and Riezman (1982) explore these
issues.


                                                                                                         9
of special protection such as escape clause actions, VERs and AD. Their model

incorporates observed random shocks to each country’s output with positive shocks

leading to higher volumes of trade. Crucially, they then show that the cooperative tariff

rate is increasing in both import size and variance. In other words, Bagwell and Staiger

formalize Corden’s (1974) argument that special protection may be a tacitly agreed

method to maintain cooperation in volatile trade periods.

       When looking for Bagwell-Staiger incentives for the use of AD in our data, we

check to see whether AD cases are being filed against a country’s largest trading partners

or against those trading partners with recent surges in import volume. Our indirect

measures of such behavior include measures of trade volume and trade surges. Evidence

of filings against countries would also be consistent with the use of AD to combat unfair

trading practices.

       A final possible explanation for the observed trends in AD filing behavior points

to potential strategic motives on the part of the involved countries. Within the Bagwell-

Staiger model, special protection-based changes in tariff levels are equilibrium responses

to changes in the level or variance of imports. Yet, other work points out that there may

be additional factors that should be considered. For example, Finger (1993) argues that

the countries that use AD form a type of “club,” in that they tend to apply AD against one

another rather than against non-club members. As evidence, Finger notes that during the

1980s about two-thirds of AD cases were filed against countries who also used AD (p. 7).

Similarly, Prusa (2001) argues that many countries appear to file AD actions against

countries that have previously investigated them, suggesting a type of retaliatory

behavior.




                                                                                        10
        Both of these arguments suggest that countries may be using AD in a strategic

fashion to punish defectors from the cooperative (liberalized) equilibrium, or perhaps to

deter such defection. Neither the club nor the retaliation motive for AD use is consistent

with AD as protection against unfair trade, nor are they possible as equilibria within an

unmodified Bagwell-Staiger model.10 Another possibility is that worldwide AD use is

not in equilibrium (in the Bagwell-Staiger notion of cooperative equilibrium). That is,

the heavy use of AD law during the late 1970s and the early 1980s may have been too

aggressive. Rather than maintaining the cooperative tariff level as implied by Bagwell

and Staiger, such heavy use may have been perceived as a defection to the non-

cooperative (one shot) prisoners’ dilemma equilibrium. If this is the case, then recent AD

actions might be “out of equilibrium” responses to the earlier defections.



IV. Data description

In order to investigate the motives for filing AD cases, we examine AD filing patterns in

more detail. Before we begin our analysis we note that about one-fifth of the AD cases

initiated between 1980 and 1998 were filed against non-market economies. This is

noteworthy because the rules for determining the existence of dumping are quite different

when the affected country is a non-market economy (Boltuck and Litan, 1991). As a

result, the motivation for filing against a non-market economy is likely to be quite

different than that for filing against a market economy. Therefore, from this point on we




10 Extensions to the Bagwell-Staiger model might be made in order to generate club or retaliatory AD
filings. Incorporating imperfect monitoring of demand shocks (following Green and Porter (1984)) or
political economy incentives to misuse AD (following Grossman and Helpman (1994)) could give rise to
observing AD cases filed as indirect (club) or direct (retaliatory) punishment for previous AD use.


                                                                                                   11
drop cases against non-market economies from our analysis. Furthermore, because of

limited availability of bilateral import data, we must drop 1998 filings from our analysis.

       We will be testing for two different explanations for AD filings, “economic” and

“strategic.” In terms of the economic incentives, we will be looking for evidence that AD

cases are filed against the largest suppliers (“big supplier” hypothesis) and/or against

suppliers who have the largest percentage change in imports (“import surge” hypothesis).

Unfortunately, the Bagwell-Staiger model does not provide any guidance on how to

define “big” so we test their theory as follows. For each year, we first rank each

country’s import suppliers from biggest to smallest. Suppliers who are above a specified

cut-off percentile will be considered “big.” This means that a country might be

considered a big import supplier for the U.S. market in one year but not in other years. It

also means that a country might be considered a big import supplier for one market but

not another (e.g., big for the U.S. but not for Canada). We perform similar ranking

(based on the percentage change in imports) to derive whether each supplier’s “import

surge” is big. For each hypothesis we present results for three cut-offs: 50th, 75th, and

90th percentile. As we will show, the results are not particularly sensitive to the choice of

cut-off. We find this reassuring as it suggests that the main insights are not being driven

by how we define “big.”

       As for the strategic explanations we will be looking for evidence for “club” and

“retaliation” motives. Empirically, we will be looking for evidence that AD cases are

filed against countries that also use AD (regardless of whom they have filed against).

Such evidence would support the “club” hypothesis. For example, if in 1990 South

Korea has previously used AD, then, under the club hypothesis, Mexico would be more




                                                                                            12
likely to name South Korea than Uruguay (i.e., a country that had not used AD at all).

For the “retaliation” hypothesis we will be looking for evidence that countries file AD

cases against suppliers who have previously filed an AD case against them. For example,

if Australia has filed cases against Mexico prior to 1990, then Mexico will be more likely

to file cases against Australia in 1990 than against, say, Japan (i.e., a country that had not

previously filed against Mexico).

       For the strategic motives we also consider whether recent filing activity is more

important for club and/or retaliation incentives. That is, it seems plausible that AD users

might discount behavior in the relatively distant past and put more weight on recent

actions. To be precise, consider Finland’s use of AD. Finland filed about 20 AD cases

during the 1980s but last used it in 1991. It is possible that by the mid-1990s other

countries no longer considered Finland a “club” member. Similarly, despite being the

subject of a Finnish AD action in 1988, it seems reasonable to believe that Poland might

no longer hold retaliation incentives against Finland after sufficient time had passed.

       In order to address this concern, we consider two versions of the club and

retaliation hypotheses, “long” memory and “limited” memory. Under the long memory

scenario, club and retaliation incentives are never discounted. This means that Finland

should be considered a club member throughout the 1990s and retaliation incentives

should exist for all the countries Finland investigated during the 1980s. By contrast,

under the limited memory scenario we hypothesize that the strategic incentives are only

operative for the three years following the initiation of a particular case. In the case of

Finland this means that it would be considered a club member only through 1994.




                                                                                              13
Similarly, any retaliation incentives that Poland might have against Finland (due to the

1988 case) would be relevant only through 1991.

       In Table 2 we report the percentage of cases consistent with the various

hypotheses. This gives a feel for how the four hypotheses are reflected in the raw data.

Several insights are quickly observed. First, we can see that regardless of the cut-off

used, almost all AD cases are aimed at big suppliers. For instance, when we use the 75th

percentile to define “big,” over 90% of AD cases initiated by new users and over 97%

initiated by traditional users are against big suppliers. When the 90th percentile is used,

the share of cases for both new and traditional users falls to a still non-trivial 80%.

       Second, there is far less support for the import surge hypothesis. Even when we

use the 50th percentile cut-off – the most liberal interpretation of “big surge” – only about

half of the AD cases over the sample are against suppliers whose imports have surged.

When we use the more stringent cut-offs (75th and 90th percentiles) the fraction of cases

against suppliers whose imports have surged falls dramatically. Fewer than 6% of all

cases can qualify as having been filed against importers with surges when using the 75th

percentile cut-off; fewer than 1% of all cases qualify at the 90th percentile.

       Third, the club hypothesis receives strong support. More than 80% of AD cases

filed by new users are against club members; almost 60% of AD cases by traditional

users are against club members. The fact that there is almost no difference between the

long and limited memory results reflects the fact that AD is an addictive habit; once

countries begin using AD protection, they rarely cease using the statute for very long. In

other words, the case of Finland is the exception to the rule.




                                                                                              14
       Fourth, retaliation patterns are also reflected in the data. Overall, countries file

about half of their cases against countries that previously had used AD against them,

slightly more for new users, slightly less for traditional users. Even when we restrict

retaliation incentives to only the previous three years (i.e., limited memory) we find that

almost 40% of cases are consistent with the retaliation motive.

       A few comments are in order. First, these statistics suggest that of the economic

hypotheses, being “big” matters more than surges do. However, we need to be cautious

before embracing this conclusion. First of all, it is more difficult for large suppliers to

experience a large percentage change in imports (a surge) simply because they are

starting with such a large base. The countries with “surges” tend to be those that are

initially small suppliers, making it easier to experience a large “surge.” This is a

reminder that while it often appears that AD actions are motivated by import surges one

must be careful to examine the entire universe of suppliers before drawing such a

conclusion.

       Second, AD cases are often aimed at quite narrow product categories, a particular

type of steel, for example, rather than all steel products. Unfortunately the WTO does not

require countries to report the exact categories, so we cannot identify trade at these

disaggregated levels. As long as our trade measure is correlated with trade at the product

category level, our analysis is accurate. If, however, trade at the disaggregated level

consistently varies from our measure, we might be understating the importance of the

surge hypothesis. Taken together, these two caveats lead us to be very cautious in

interpreting results for the surge hypothesis.




                                                                                              15
       Overall, we find the support for retaliation incentives quite striking. New and

traditional users alike tend to file AD cases against those who have investigated them in

the past. Because so many users apparently file partly due to these incentives, we can

identify countries that are being named (or investigated) in AD disputes for apparent

retaliatory motives. In Figure 2 we plot the shares of cases consistent with retaliation for

each country (over the entire 1980-98 period). On the x-axis we plot the share of

initiated cases that are consistent with retaliation (i.e., the tendency for a country’s use of

AD to reflect retaliation incentives). On the y-axis we plot the share of cases in which the

country is investigated that are consistent with retaliation (i.e., the tendency for a country

to be named in a way consistent with retaliation incentives). The 45-degree line

indicates countries that file and are subject to the same share of cases consistent with

retaliation. Countries lying above (below) the line are subject to more (less) retaliation

than their own filings suggest.

       The figure is quite revealing. Even though about half of the AD actions initiated

by traditional users (EU, Australia, U.S., Canada) are consistent with a retaliation

incentive, a larger, near-90 percent of the cases in which they are investigated are

initiated by countries that have a retaliation incentive. Only two new users, Chile and

Costa Rica, demonstrate a similar pattern. The data for all the other new users reflect that

their filings tend to be more retaliatory than the cases in which they are investigated.

This pattern suggests that the traditional users are paying a high price for their refusal to

strengthen AD rules. They are paying heavily for their past transgressions because they

are now being regularly investigated in a retaliatory fashion.




                                                                                             16
       In Figure 3 we also plot the shares of cases consistent with retaliation (initiated

and investigated), but here we restrict ourselves to looking only at the 1994-98 period.

This allows us to control for the fact that the four major traditional AD users had a near

monopoly on AD filings during the 1980s. In a sense, the analysis for the more recent

years reflects a more level playing field because both new and traditional users were

actively filing AD actions over the period. And as we can see, the story changes

somewhat when we restrict ourselves to the more recent period. While the traditional

users continue to be subject to a higher fraction of retaliatory cases, the new users have

shifted up and now have a larger share of cases in which they are investigated consistent

with retaliation. The lesson appears to be that as countries (both new and traditional

users) embrace AD protection, they are subjecting themselves to long run costs in the

form of ongoing retaliation.



V. Nonparametric analysis of filing patterns

The evidence from the raw data, presented in the previous section, provides support for

both the economic and strategic incentives for AD filings. We now offer formal tests that

allow us to quantify the statistical significance of the trends. In computing these tests we

focus on the filings by country, and ask whether the cases filed by each country in each

year are statistically consistent with each of our hypotheses.

       In Table 3 we look at South Africa’s filings in 1994 in order to illustrate the type

of statistical tests that we use to determine whether each hypothesis is supported in the

data. In 1994 South Africa filed 15 AD cases. Of these 15 filings, 11 (73%) were

consistent with the retaliation hypothesis (i.e., 11 cases were against countries who had




                                                                                             17
named South Africa in 1993 or earlier); 13 cases (87%) were consistent with the club

hypothesis; 14 (93%) were against big suppliers (using the 50th percentile cut-off); only

one case (6.7%) was against a big import surge supplier (again, using the 50th percentile

cut-off).

        The question is whether these filing patterns provide any support for the various

hypotheses. Consider first the economic hypotheses. If economic motives were not

present then we would expect cases to be filed independently of the volume of imports

from any particular country. Therefore, we would expect that the share of cases against

big suppliers would be the same as the cut-off percentile used to define “big” (i.e., 50th,

75th, or 90th percentile).

        In the case of South Africa in 1994, 93% of its cases were filed against big

suppliers. Under the null hypothesis that economic motives were not present, we would

expect only 50% of its cases to be filed against big suppliers when using the 50th

percentile cut-off. Using the binomial test we can indeed conclude that such a large

fraction of cases against big suppliers is highly (99%) unlikely; the binomial probability

Pr(15,14,50%) is essentially zero. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis and

conclude that South Africa’s 1994 filings provide statistical support for the big supplier

hypothesis.

        Using the same logic as above, we can test the big import surge hypothesis after

constructing a null hypothesis that there is no motive to use AD against big import

surges. In this case, we would again expect the share of cases against big surge suppliers

to be the same as the cut-off percentile used to define “big.” In the case of South Africa

in 1994 when using the 50th percentile cut-off, only one case was against a big surge




                                                                                              18
supplier. Under the null hypothesis, however, we would expect 50% of the 1994 cases to

be filed against big suppliers. Using the binomial test we find that we should expect

(with 99% likelihood) that at least one case would be filed against a big surge supplier.

Therefore, South Africa’s 1994 filings do not provide any statistical support for the big

surge hypothesis.

       Consider next the strategic hypotheses, beginning with the club hypothesis. Table

3 shows that only 10% of South Africa’s suppliers had ever used AD (against any

country) in the past, so only 10% of its suppliers qualify as club members. Under the null

hypothesis that the club effect is not present, we would expect cases to be filed

independently of whether a country is a club member. Given the information about

South Africa’s suppliers, we would expect that under the null hypothesis only 10% of

South Africa cases should be against club members. We observe, however, that 13 of

South Africa’s 15 AD cases (87%) were against club members. To statistically confirm

that this pattern is significant, we again use the binomial test. We conclude that such a

large fraction of cases against club members is highly unlikely (essentially zero). Thus,

South Africa’s 1994 filings provide statistical support for the club hypothesis.

       Finally, similar calculations can be performed to test for evidence of the

retaliation motive. Only 4.7% of South Africa’s suppliers had ever named it in an AD

case by 1994; yet, 73% of South Africa’s cases were against countries that had named it

in the past. Once again, formulating the null hypothesis that there is no retaliation motive

we can use the binomial test to conclude that such a large fraction of cases consistent

with retaliation is extremely unlikely. Thus, South Africa’s 1994 filings also show

support for the retaliation hypothesis.




                                                                                            19
           We perform such binomial tests on the filing patterns for each country in each

year.11 For example, South Africa’s AD activity gives us four years of filings (1994,

1995, 1996, and 1997) on which we can perform binomial tests. Over all countries and

all years of their AD use, we have a total of 212 country-year pairs and we present results

for 212 separate binomial tests of each of our four hypotheses. We use a significance

level of 5% to determine whether a country-year observation supports a hypothesis.

Depending on how many country-year observations have significant tests, we can

determine the extent to which each hypothesis is supported by the data.

           In Table 4 we report the binomial test results for the economic hypotheses. These

results indicate that AD filings are far better explained by the big supplier hypothesis than

by the import surge hypothesis. For instance, when we use the 50th percentile cut-off,

about half of the annual observations (104 of 212) support the big supplier hypothesis but

only 13 percent of the annual observations (29 of 212) support the import surge

hypothesis. The same qualitative pattern exists regardless of what cut-off we use.

Simply stated, the AD filings provide far more support for the big supplier hypothesis

than for the import surge hypothesis.

           There are also important differences between traditional and new user filing

patterns. In particular, continuing to use the 50th percentile cut-off, we note that over 90

percent of the annual observations on traditional users’ AD activity support the big

supplier hypothesis. In particular, 70 of the 77 country-year observations have binomial

probability less than 0.05. Interestingly, less than 30 percent (23 of 77) of the annual

observations on traditional users’ AD activity support the big surge hypothesis.



11   Once a country begins using AD protection, we perform the tests in every year thereafter.


                                                                                                 20
       By contrast, we find that new user AD activity provides far less statistical support

for either economic hypothesis. For example, only about one-quarter of the observations

on new users’ AD activity support the big supplier hypothesis. The big surge hypothesis

receives even less support. Less than five percent of the observations on new users AD

activity support the big surge hypothesis.

       The qualitative results are the same for the 75th and 90th percentile cut-offs.

Namely, traditional user AD activity strongly supports the big supplier hypothesis and

provides (at best) weak support for the import surge hypothesis. On the other hand, new

user AD activity provides no support at all for the import surge hypothesis, and only

weak support for the big supplier hypothesis.

       We report the binomial results for the strategic motives in Table 5. The first

finding of note is that, overall, both the club and retaliation hypotheses receive strong

support. Under either the long or limited memory scenarios, 56% (118 of 212) of the

country-year observations are statistically significant with the club hypothesis at the 5%

level. Between 40 and 50% of the observations support the retaliation hypothesis.

       Interestingly, there is a striking difference between the new and traditional users.

A full 87% of the annual observations on traditional users’ filings are consistent with the

club effect, but only 38% of the annual observations on new users’ filings are consistent

with the club effect. Similarly, over 70% of traditional users’ filings, but only about 30%

of new users’ filings, support the retaliation hypothesis.

       Thus, even though in the raw data it appeared that new users’ AD filings were

more often consistent with the retaliation and club hypotheses, once we control for the

expanding set of AD users we are able to conclude that statistically the club and




                                                                                            21
retaliation motives are far more relevant for traditional users than for new users.

Nevertheless, new user filing behavior is better explained by strategic motives than by

economic motives.

        There are several possible interpretations of these results. First, the finding that

economic considerations are not the only explanation for AD filings is consistent with

earlier studies. Other research has found that EU and U.S. AD decisions are influenced

by political pressure, national security interests, and historical economic relationships

(Hansen and Prusa, 1996, 1997; Tharakan and Waelbroeck, 1994a, 1994b).

        Second, the finding that economic motivations do a poor job explaining the filing

behavior of new users may partially reflect the weak rules and informal institutions

governing AD proceedings in those countries. New users are particularly likely to

determine injury using very simple methods, especially when compared with methods

employed by traditional users (Santos, 1998). Thus, it may be quite difficult for the new

users to accurately evaluate economic injury. This would make it more likely that

strategic considerations would play an unusually important role in new users’ AD

activity.

        Third, measurement issues are a concern across all of the hypotheses. As

mentioned above, GATT/WTO reporting limits the level of disaggregation at which we

are able to measure imports. While we would like to utilize product level import data,

countries are not required to report which products are subject to AD case filings. As a

result, our measures are more aggregated than we would like. Similarly, our variables

capturing the strategic motives for AD use are also more broadly defined than the ideal.

For instance, retaliation and club effects may play a particularly important role at the




                                                                                               22
industry level, and less so at the country level. Once again, until the WTO collects AD

filing data at the industry level this issue cannot be addressed.

       Fourth, the results suggest that both economic and strategic considerations play a

role in motivating national-level AD filings. The nonparametric tests performed in this

paper do not let us separate these effects, however. While such a task is beyond the

scope of the current paper, we use parametric techniques in related work (Skeath and

Prusa, 2001) and find results that are consistent with those discussed here. Namely, AD

filing patterns cannot be explained completely by only economic considerations. Rather,

a combination of both economic and strategic considerations is important in explaining

trends in AD filings.



VI. Concluding Comments

Our review of the worldwide AD filing patterns between 1980 and 1998 indicates that

strategic considerations are an important explanation for AD filings. After reviewing the

filing patterns we find that three-quarters of all AD filings are consistent with the club

effect and half are consistent with retaliation incentives. When we perform statistical

tests on annual filings at the country level we find that approximately 50 percent of

observations provide statistically significant support for the strategic hypotheses. For

traditional users we find evidence that both economic and strategic motives are

important; however, for new users we find that strategic motives are more important than

the economic motives.

       Our results are consistent with evidence beginning to be reported elsewhere in the

literature. Both Blonigen (2000) and Bown (2001) investigate the effects of the threat of




                                                                                             23
foreign retaliation on U.S. antidumping case filing behavior. Their independently-

derived results indicate that retaliation exposure and, in particular, the threat of foreign

reciprocal AD duties can reduce the likelihood of U.S. AD cases being filed against

certain countries. Further work needs to be done in this area as our findings indicate that

the growth of AD has not slowed down and that AD club members tend to file against

one another. Our results suggest that the dampening effect implied by Blonigen’s and

Bown’s work may be statistically significant but not quantitatively important.

       Taken together, the sources of evidence on the importance of retaliatory motives

underscore the importance of including AD rules on the agenda in any future WTO

negotiations. The fact that so many AD cases worldwide are apparently motivated by

strategic considerations indicates that the rules currently in use are too broad and too

easily subjugated to other forces. Improved AD rules and tighter guidelines for the

implementation of AD legislation would greatly help in limiting the use of AD protection

for reasons other than that intended by the WTO statute.
