                        MACROECONOMIC CONVERGENCE: INTERNATIONAL
                      TRANSMISSION OF GROWTH AND TECHNICAL PROGRESS


                                             ABSTRACT
        This paper uses data for nineteen industrial countries over the
period 1960-1985 to examine the evidence for international convergence
of technical progress. Several models of convergence, including a model
in which convergence is affected by changes in a country's openness to
trade, are evaluated against competing alternatives. We also assess the
extent to which convergence depends on some key measurement                          issues,
including the use of purchasing power parities to compare real output in
different countries,       the use of different capital stocks in aggregate
production functions, and          ~~ternative       ways of representing embodied or
disembodied technical      pT~)gress.      Th(\ various models of technical progress
are assessed by      non-ne"t<~d.~m~t.;     0': both the estimated output equations,
using the factor        ur..' lization model,        and their related factor         demand
equations.     The    T~Hults      show    significant       evidence     of   international
convergence     Ln   the   rates    of     growth    of   labour    efficiency,    and   some
evidence     that    convergence     is     faster     for   countries     that   have   been
increasing their openness to international trade. A more general model
of output    d0.te)~nation,     encompassing variations in factor utilization
as well as tho Gutocorrelated technology shocks used in real business
cycle    models,     was   found      to     be     preferred      over   more    restricted
alternatives.
