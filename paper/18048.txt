Using a comprehensive dataset of all medium and large enterprises in China between 1998 and 2007,
we show that industrial policies allocated to competitive sectors or that foster competition in a sector
increase productivity growth. We measure competition using the Lerner Index and include as industrial
policies subsidies, tax holidays, loans, and tariffs. Measures to foster competition include policies
that are more dispersed across firms in a sector or measures that encourage younger and more productive
enterprises.

           Using a comprehensive dataset of all medium and large enter-
          prises in China between 1998 and 2007, we show that industrial
          policies allocated to competitive sectors or that foster competition
          in a sector increase productivity growth. We measure competition
          using the Lerner Index and include as industrial policies subsidies,
          tax holidays, loans, and tariffs.          Measures to foster competition
          include policies that are more dispersed across firms in a sector
          or measures that encourage younger and more productive enter-
          prises.


  In the aftermath of World War II, several developing countries opted for “in-
dustrial policies” aimed at promoting new infant industries or at protecting local
traditional activities from competition by products from more advanced coun-
tries. However, these policies came into disrepute in the 1980s mainly on the
ground that industrial policy prevents competition and allows governments to
pick winners (and, more rarely, to name losers) in a discretionary fashion, thereby
increasing the scope for capture of governments by vested interests.
  In this paper we argue that properly governed sectoral policies, in particu-
lar sectoral policies that are competition-friendly, may enhance productivity and

productivity growth. Without industrial policy, innovative firms may choose to
operate in different sectors in order to face lower competition on the product
market, leading to high sectoral concentration and low incentives to innovate be-
cause of a “monopoly replacement effect”. In such a case, industrial policies that
encourage firms to be active in the same sector, such as through tax holidays
or other tax-subsidy schemes, will decrease concentration in the targeted sector
and enhance incentives for firms to innovate. Therefore there can be complemen-
tarity between competition and suitably designed industrial policies in inducing
innovation and productivity growth.
    To document the potential complementarity between competition and indus-
trial policy, we use a comprehensive dataset of all medium and large enterprises
in China between 1998 and 2007 and consider the effect of industrial policies on
firm level productivity growth. Our main finding is that when sectoral policies
are targeted towards competitive sectors or allocated in such a way as to preserve
or increase competition, then these policies increase productivity growth.                             We
measure competition using the Lerner Index and include as industrial policies
subsidies, tax holidays, loans, and tariffs. Competition-friendly policies are de-
fined as targeting that is more dispersed across firms in a sector or measures that
encourage younger and more productive enterprises.
    Our paper relates to a whole literature on the costs and benefits of industrial
policy. First are the infant-industry models advocating government support to
sectors with potential economy-wide knowledge externalities but with high ini-
tial production costs which decrease only progressively over time as a result of
learning-by-doing: the idea is that these sectors need to be protected against
foreign competition in the short-run until they become fully competitive (see for
example Greenwald and Stiglitz (2006)).1 The infant industry argument has been
    1 For an overview of infant-industry models and empirical evidence, see Harrison and Rodriguez-Clare
(2010). The infant-industry argument could be summarized as follows. Consider a local economy that
includes both a traditional sector (especially agriculture) and an industry in its infancy. Production costs
in industry are initially high, but “learning by doing” decrease these costs over time, even faster as the
volume of activity in this area is high. In addition, increased productivity which is a consequence of this
learning by doing phase has positive spillovers on the rest of the economy, i.e., it increases the potential

challenged, both theoretically (the ‘pick-winners” argument) and empirically. For
example Krueger and Tuncer (1982) analyzed the effects of industrial policy in
Turkey in the 60s, and “showed” that firms or industries not protected by tariff
measures were characterized by higher productivity in growth rates than pro-
tected industries.2 However none of these papers look at the design or at the
governance of industrial policy.
  Most closely related to our analysis is the paper by Nunn and Trefler (2010).
Using cross-country industry-level panel data, they analyze whether, as suggested
by “infant industry” arguments, the growth of productivity in a country is pos-
itively affected by tariff protection biased in favor of activities and sectors that
are “skill-intensive”, that is to say, use more intensely skilled workers. They find
a significant positive correlation between productivity growth and the “skill bias”
due to tariff protection. As the authors point out though, such a correlation
does not necessarily mean there is causality between skill-bias due to protection
and productivity growth: the two variables may themselves be the result of a
third factor, such as the quality of institutions in countries considered. How-
ever, Nunn and Trefler show that at least 25% of the correlation corresponds to
a causal effect. Overall, their analysis suggests that adequately designed (here,
skill-intensive) targeting may actually enhance growth, not only in the sector
which is being subsidized, but in other sectors as well. The issue remains whether
industrial policy comes at the cost of a lowering of competition, e.g., between
high and low skill intensive sectors or within a high skill sector. As we show in
this paper, industrial policy in the form of targeting may in fact take the form of
enhancing competition in a sector and serves the dual role of increasing consumer
surplus and growth. We show this in our previous working paper version.

rate of growth also in the traditional sector. In this case, a total and instantaneous liberalization of
international trade can be detrimental to the growth of the local economy, as it might inhibit the activity
of the local industry whose production costs are initially high: what will happen in this case is that the
local demand for industrial products will turn to foreign importers. It means that learning by doing
in the local industry will be slowed itself, which will reduce the externalities of growth from this sector
towards the traditional sector.
    2 However, see Harrison (1994) who shows that their results are not robust to rigorous statistical
analysis.

    The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sketches a simple model to guide
our empirical analysis.3 Section 3 presents some brief historical background for
industrial policy in China, as well as the data and measurement and some raw
correlations between competition, industrial policies and firm level performance.
Section 4 describes the estimation methodology and presents the main empirical
results. Section 5 concludes.



                                  I.   The theoretical argument




    In this section we sketch our theoretical argument for why properly designed
sectoral policy may enhance rather than harm competition. The argument can be
summarized as follows: consider an economy where two firms can either differenti-
ate horizontally or innovate to improve their productivity. Under laissez-faire the
two firms will typically choose to “diversify”, i.e., to produce in different sectors in
order to escape competition between them. Forcing (or encouraging) these firms
to operate in the same sector and on an equal footing will induce them to resort to
vertical innovation (i.e., to productivity-improving innovation) in order to escape
competition with each other. This in turn will foster productivity growth.

    Note that this argument is quite distinct from the infant industry argument and
is also novel in the literature on the effects of industrial policy. In particular it does
not rely on a learning-by-doing externalities or on knowledge externalities between
an industrial (tradable good) sector and a traditional (non-tradable good) sector.
Instead, it relies on standard growth externalities and on an escape-competition
effect (see for instance Aghion et al 2005). Thus, while (foreign) competition is
damaging for domestic growth in the infant-industry model, here competition is
always growth-enhancing.


    3 The   details of the model as well as the proofs are developed in Appendix B.

                                              A.    Basic setup


  We consider a two-period model of an economy producing two goods, denoted
by A and B. Denote the quantity consumed on each good by xA and xB . The
representative consumer has income equal to 2E and utility log(xA ) + log(xB )
when consuming xA and xB . This means that if the price of good i is pi , demand
for good i will be xi = E/pi . To simplify the writing, we assume that E = 1
throughout this paper.4
  Production can be done by one of two ‘big’ firms 1, 2, or by ‘fringe firms’.
Fringe firms act competitively and have a constant marginal cost of production
of cf whereas firms j = 1, 2 have an initial marginal cost of c, where 1 > cf ≥ c.
The assumption cf ≥ c reflects the cost advantage of firms 1, 2 with respect to
the fringe and the assumption 1 > c insures that equilibrium quantities can be
greater than 1. Marginal costs are firm-specific and are independent of the sector
in which production is undertaken.
  Firms can improve productivity through quality-improving innovation. For
simplicity, we assume that only firms 1, 2 can innovate. Innovation reduces pro-
duction costs, but the size of the cost reduction is different between the two sectors
A and B. Without loss of generality, we assume that in sector A, innovations re-
duce production costs from c to c/γA = c/(γ + δ) whereas in sector B they reduce
costs from c to c/γB = c/(γ − δ), where γ − δ > 1 or δ < γ − 1.5
  We also make the simple assumption that, with equal probability, each firm can
be chosen to be the potential innovator. To innovate with probability q this firm
must incur effort cost q 2 /2. This is like saying that each firm has an exogenous
probability of getting a patentable idea, which then has to be turned into cost
reduction thanks to effort exerted by the firm.

    4 As will be soon apparent, the rate of innovation is linear in E, and except for this size effect, what
matters for the analysis are the ratios E/c and E/cf .
    5 Even if δ = 0, that is if the two sectors are similar, industrial policy is beneficial. In previous versions
of the paper we considered also imperfect information about the identity of the high growth sector, and
our results were qualitatively similar. This suggests that a regulator does not need necessarily to identify
the “high growth” sector in order to implement the type of industrial policy we are considering.
6                        AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL                                         MONTH YEAR


    Finally, we assume Bertrand competition within each sector unless the two
leading firms choose the same sector and collude within that sector. Let ϕ be the
probability of the two leading firms colluding in the same sector when they have
the same cost, and let us assume that when colluding the two firms behave as
a joint monopoly taking the fringe cost cf as given. In this case, the expected
                                                                   cf −c
profit of each leading firm with cost c < cf is ϕ 12                cf     since when collusion fails
firms compete Bertrand.


                             B.    The effects of targeted tax/subsidies


    Firms can choose to be active in different sectors or in the same sector: we refer
to the first situation as one of diversity, and the second as one of focus. Under
focus, both firms choose the better technology A. Under diversity, one firm (call
it firm 1) chooses A and the other (call it firm 2) chooses B (this is a coordination
game and which firm ends up with technology A is random). Diversity is stable
if the firm ending up with technology B does not want to switch to technology A;
otherwise the equilibrium is focus. Conditional on this choice firms then decide
to invest in order to innovate.
    We look at how firms’ choice whether to produce in the same sector or in dif-
ferent sectors, and their resulting innovation intensities, depends upon industrial
policy. For industrial policy we will focus on interventions based on taxes or sub-
sidies that are proportional to profit levels, that is on tax levels tA , tB per profit
level in sectors A, B respectively, where tk < 0 is a subsidy and tk > 0 is a tax.6
We restrict attention to the case where there is perfect information about γi and
where the profit is net of the cost of innovation.7
    We first derive the equilibrium choices under arbitrary tax/subsidy schemes
tA ≤ tB (“laissez-faire” corresponds to the case tA = tB = 0) and show the

    6 We assume without loss of generality an initial level of taxation equal to zero in each sector.
    7 If
       the tax/subsidy is on the profit gross of the cost of innovation, then it will also affect the rate at
which firms innovate. A reduction in the tax rate on gross profits has a similar effect as a subsidy to the
marginal cost of innovation.
VOL. VOL NO. ISSUE              INDUSTRIAL POLICY AND COMPETITION                   7


interaction between our measure of competition ϕ and the growth rate that can
be achieved via such a tax system. We then identify the growth-maximizing
tax/subsidy scheme when the planner is subject to a budget constraint.
  Considering the laissez-faire situation with tA = tB = 0, firms will choose focus
only if the equilibrium profit is greater than the lowest profit obtained under
diversity. This will be the case only if the degree of competition is not too high;
hence the stronger competition as measured by (1 − ϕ), the higher the range of
δ’s for which firms will choose diversity.

Proposition 1. There exists a cutoff value δ F (ϕ), a decreasing function of ϕ
such that focus is the industry equilibrium if, and only if, δ ≥ δ F (ϕ).

  Now, let us introduce a system of tax/subsidies, and let us use as a measure of
targeting the ratio

                                           1 − tA
(1)                                 τ≡            .
                                           1 − tB

The larger τ is, the higher are the “tax holidays” in sector A with respect to
sector B. It should be clear that τ is sufficient to characterize the incentives of
firms to choose between diversity or focus. Alternatively, τ is a measure of the
asymmetry in tax holidays between the two sectors. The effect of the tax ratio
on industry equilibrium is summarized in the following result.

                                                                                1−tA
Corollary 1. Consider a system of tax/subsidies with a targeting ratio τ =      1−tB .
When τ > 1, there exists a cutoff ∆(ϕ, τ ) < δ F (ϕ) such that the industry equilib-
rium is focus whenever δ > ∆(ϕ, τ ). Moreover this cutoff is decreasing in τ and
in ϕ.

  Hence, a larger target ratio τ increases the range of values of δ for which there
will be focus. Alternatively, if δ < δ F (ϕ), there exists a targeting tax τ such that
δ = ∆(ϕ, τ ); because ∆(ϕ, τ ) is a decreasing function of τ , the lower the value of
δ, the higher this value of τ should be.
8                    AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL                        MONTH YEAR


    Now solving for the optimal innovation investments respectively under focus and
under diversity, we obtain the complementarity between the degree of competition
in a sector and the effectiveness of a tax/subsidy scheme.

Proposition 2. An effective τ -industrial policy has a bigger effect on per capita
GDP and on innovation intensity in more competitive industries.


                                   C.   Predictions


    The following predictions from the above theoretical discussion will guide our
empirical analysis in the next sections:

    1) A tax policy that is more targeted towards sector A has a bigger impact on
       output and innovation: a higher value of τ (that is a lower tA with respect
       to tB ) makes it more likely that focus will be the industry equilibrium.
       By Proposition 2, it follows that higher values of τ have a larger effect on
       innovation and on the level of per capita GDP, independently of ϕ.

    2) Since a policy that gives a tax holiday to only one firm will not modify the
       industry equilibrium, tax holidays that are common to the two firms have a
       bigger impact on innovation and the level of per capita GDP than a policy
       that would apply to a unique firm.

    3) There is complementarity between industrial policy through tax holidays
       and the degree of competition.


                    II.   Background, Data and Measurement


                                   A.   Background


    The Chinese government has long been actively involved in promoting indus-
trialization in China.    Industrial policy relies on a whole range of instruments,
including tariff protection, low-interest loans, tax holidays, and subsidies for the
VOL. VOL NO. ISSUE             INDUSTRIAL POLICY AND COMPETITION                 9


purpose of promoting investment in key sectors. We begin by documenting the
range of industrial policies and their changes over the sample period. Readers
interested in more detailed descriptions of China’s changing industrial policies
over the sample period are referred to Du, Harrison, and Jefferson (forthcoming)
or Harrison (forthcoming).

  The first row of Table 1 reports the percentage of firms who received positive
subsidies from the government. In 1998, 9.4 percent of all reporting firms received
subsidies. That number climbed steadily during the sample period, reaching a
high of 15.1 percentage of all manufacturing firms in 2004, before falling to 12.4
percent in 2007. The number was even higher for state owned enterprises (SOEs)
and foreign firms (many of which formed joint ventures with SOEs), but lower
for domestic firms with no public or foreign participation. For private domestic
enterprises (”Domestic Private Only” in Table 1), the share of firms receiving
subsidies was slightly lower, increasing from 8 percent of all firms in 1998 to a
high of 13.8 percent in 2004, before falling to 11.6 percent in 2007.

  The second row of Table 1 indicates the percentage of firms receiving tax holi-
days over the sample period. We define a firm as receiving a tax holiday if either
the firm paid less than the statutory corporate income tax rate in that year or if
the firm paid less than the statutory value added tax rate. A large share of man-
ufacturing firms paid less than the full statutory rate during the sample period.
The share of enterprises with tax holidays varies from 41.6 percent in 1998 to
nearly 50 percent in 2007. Comparing the incidence of tax holidays across differ-
ent types of enterprises, Table 1 shows that the incidence was lowest for SOEs and
highest for firms with foreign equity participation. Up to 59 percent of foreign
firms received some type of tax holiday in 2003, compared to only 36.5 percent
for SOEs.

  While low-interest loans have been an important form of industrial policy in
China, we do not have data on directed credit provided through state banks or
local governments. However, firms do report total interest and current liabilities,
10                     AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL                          MONTH YEAR


so we can calculate an effective interest rate on loan obligations. We report those
averages in the third row of Table 1. The average ratio of interest paid to current
liabilities across all firms with non-zero interest or liabilities was 5.57 percent in
1998. The interest ratio steadily declined during the sample period, to a low of 2.7
percent in 2004 and then increased to 3.3 percent in 2007. Across different owner-
ship categories, there was significant variation, with domestic private enterprises
facing an effective interest rate that was almost double that faced by SOEs.
     In the last row of Table 1 we report the average tariff on imports by year for 1998
through 2007. Since tariffs are set nationally by sector, there is not significant
variation in tariffs across enterprise types. During the sample period, average
tariffs came down dramatically, from an average of 20 percentage points in 1998
to an average of 10 percentage points in 2007. By contrast, average tariffs in the
United States over the last several decades have been less than 5 percent. The
largest drop in tariffs occurred in 2001, the year China joined the WTO.
     Table 2 reports average industrial policies across 2 digit manufacturing sec-
tors between 1998 and 2007. There was significant variation in the intensity of
industrial policy across different subsectors. For example, the ratio of interest
payments to current liabilities, our proxy for the (subsidized) interest rate facing
the enterprise, was very low for the computer and telecommunications sector,
averaging 1.8 percent, but significantly higher for non-metallic minerals (4.6 %),
beverages (4.4 %), and paper products (4.4 %). Tariffs also show significant dis-
persion, with the highest tariffs on goods such as tobacco products (over 52 %),
transport equipment (17 %) and the lowest tariffs on wood products (7.6 %), and
fuels (6 %). The percentage of firms receiving subsidies and tax holidays also
varied across sectors, as reported in the last two columns of Table 2.

                             B.    Data and measurement


  We measure industrial policy using four types of policy instruments: subsidies,
interest paid as a share of current liabilities, tax holidays, and tariffs. Subsidies,
interest payments, and tax holidays are allocated at the firm level, while tariffs
are set at the national level. Our data for tariffs are available at the 2 or 3 digit
level. Tariffs are set nationally and are exogenous with respect to a particular
region or a particular firm. However, since tariffs do not vary across firms, we
cannot use measures of policy dispersion within a sector to test whether tariffs are
set in a way that preserves competition. For tariffs, all we can do is test whether
the imposition of tariffs in more competitive sectors is more likely to result in
higher firm performance.
  To measure competition, we will compute a Lerner index at both the county
and sector level.   The Lerner Index measures the importance of markups (the
difference between prices and marginal costs) relative to the firm’s total value
added.   To calculate it, we first aggregate operating profits, capital costs, and
sales at the industry, county and year level.    The Lerner index is defined as the
ratio of operating profits less capital costs to sales. Under perfect competition,
there should be no excess profits above capital costs, so the Lerner Index should
equal zero.   Since the Lerner Index is an inverse measure of competition, we
redefine competition as 1 - Lerner, so under perfect competition it should equal
1. A value of 1 indicates perfect competition while values below 1 suggest some
degree of market power.     We address the potential endogeneity of competition
using initial period Lerners in all the estimating equations below.
  The standard approach to measuring firm-level performance is to identify total
factor productivity (TFP) levels or growth. Since TFP is an overall efficiency
parameter, it is best understood as measuring process innovation–the cost reduc-
tions associated with improving the efficiency in producing an existing product.
Another measure of innovation is product innovation–associated with the intro-
duction of new products or higher quality goods. Our primary focus is on process

innovation, since product innovation is not reliably measured and was also less
pervasive for firms in the sample during this period.
     The dataset, collected by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics, is described
in greater detail in Du, Harrison, and Jefferson (2012). We retain only the manu-
facturing enterprises and eliminate establishments with missing values or negative
or zero values for key variables such as output, employees, capital and inputs. The
years covered include 1998 through 2007. This is a true panel, following the same
firms over time. We dropped three sectors with incomplete information on prices
from the sample8 . The final sample size is 1, 545, 626 observations.
     The dataset contains information on real and nominal output, assets, num-
ber of workers, renumeration, inputs, public ownership, foreign investment, sales
revenue, and exports. Because domestically owned, foreign, and publicly owned
enterprises behave quite differently, in all the regression results presented below
we will restrict the sample to firms that have zero foreign ownership and have
only minority state ownership. In the dataset, 1, 069, 563 observations meet the
criterion9 .
     To control for the effects of trade policies, we have created a time series of tariffs,
obtained from the World Integrated Trading Solution (WITS), maintained by the
World Bank. We aggregated tariffs to the same level of aggregation as the foreign
investment data, using output for 2003 as weights. During the sample period,
average tariffs fell nearly by 9 percentage points, which is a significant change
over a short time period. While the average level of tariffs across all years was
nearly 13 percent, this average masks significant heterogeneity across sectors,
with a high of 41 percent in grain mill products and a low of 4 percent in railroad
equipment.
     Before adopting a more formal approach to analyzing the relationship between

    8 They are the following sectors: processing food from agricultural products; printing, reproduction
of recording media; and general purpose machinery.
    9 Typically we distinguish domestic and foreign-invested firms based on whether the share of sub-
scribed capital owned by foreign investors is equal to or less than 10%. The results are generally robust
to the choice of definition for foreign versus domestic ownership.

industrial policy, competition, and firm-level outcomes in the next section, we
first report some raw correlations in Table 3. The remainder of the paper will
focus only on domestically owned firms, but for the correlation results we include
all enterprises in order to highlight the significant differences across ownership
types. All the reported correlations are statistically significant at the 5 percent
level. In particular these correlations indicate: (i) that firms receiving subsidies
exhibited higher total factor productivity levels; (ii) that subsidies were signifi-
cantly associated with new product introductions; (iii) that while subsidies and
tax holidays are significantly and positively correlated with firm-level innovation,
final goods tariffs are not; (iv) that higher levels of TFP are positively correlated
with firm-level subsidies and tax holidays; however, the two other industrial pol-
icy measures are negatively correlated with firm-level performance as defined by
levels of TFP: final goods tariffs and low interest payments.

Notes: Index_subsidy, index_tax, and Index_interest are dummy variables which equal 1 if a firm receives subsidies, tax breaks, or a below-median borrowing
interest rate, respectively. TFP is estimated with the Olley- Pakes method. For the OP estimation of TFP, we use a two-stage procedure. In the first stage, we
use the OP regression method to obtain estimates for the input coefficients and then calculate TFP (the residual from the production function). In the second
stage, we regress TFP on the remaining controls. Ownership variables public and foreign vary from zero to 100 percent publicly or foreign owned.

  The raw correlations also confirm that SOEs and foreign firms behave quite
differently from other enterprises. Industrial policies were also allocated differ-
ently for these enterprises, consistent with the evidence presented in Tables 1 and
2. Public sector enterprises were more likely to receive subsidies and tariff pro-
tection, but less likely to receive tax holidays. Public ownership was negatively
associated with TFP, with a correlation coefficient of -0.19. These correlations
are consistent with the perception of SOEs as less competitive and less efficient
than other enterprises. Firms with foreign ownership (column (8)) were system-
atically more likely to receive all types of industrial support. In contrast to SOEs,
foreign ownership is positive and signicantly correlated with TFP. The very dif-
ferent performance outcomes and industrial policy targeting for SOEs and foreign
firms justifies our decision to focus on domestically owned enterprises with only
minority public ownership in the remainder of this paper.
  Overall, these correlations suggest that some forms of industrial policy, such as
subsidies and tax holidays, were associated with significant firm level innovation,
while others–such as tariffs, which typically discourage competition–were not.
Our empirical analysis in the next section will confirm these conjectures.


                      III.   Empirical analysis and results


  In this section we analyze the complementarity between industrial policy and
competition using two approaches. First, we test the hypothesis that introducing
industrial policies in more competitive sectors is more likely to lead to improved
outcomes. This is a somewhat different approach from ”picking winners”: instead,
this approach suggests picking sectors where firms already compete intensively.
The intuition would be that to make government support effective, it needs to
be allocated where there is competition, and not collusion. Second, for given
sectoral choice, we investigate what would be the best strategy for allocating
support across firms within a sector. In a nutshell, the first approach explores
differences across sectors, whereas the second approach explores how best to
18                     AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL                          MONTH YEAR


allocate industrial policy support within a sector.


                                 A.   Estimation methods


     To implement our first approach, which tests Corollary 1, we measure the corre-
lation of subsidies with competition and then to see whether a stronger correlation
coefficient at the city-year level raises firm performance. To measure whether sub-
sidies are biased towards more competitive sectors in city r in year t, we calculate
the correlation between the industry-city level initial degree of competition and
current (period t) subsidies in sector j and city r:


(2)            Ωrt,subsidy = Corr(SU BSIDYrjt , COM P ET IT IONrj0 )


     Since all industrial policies vary over time, we thus obtain a time-varying change
in the correlation between initial levels of competition in year zero and the pat-
terns of interventions across different parts of China. We then explore whether
higher correlations between current period subsidies and initial competition, as
measured by Ωrt,subsidy , are associated with better performance. As an illustra-
tion, if in Shanghai the largest amount of subsidies are allocated to sectors with
low markups and small or zero subsidies are given to sectors with high markups
in the year 2003, then for Shanghai in 2003 this correlation coefficient will be
close to unity.
     Similarly, we introduce the variables Ωrt,interest and Ωrt,taxholidays where:


(3)          Ωrt,interest = Corr(IN T ERESTrjt , COM P ET IT IONrj0 )

(4)      Ωrt,taxholidays = Corr(T AXHOLIDAY Srjt , COM P ET IT IONrj0 )


The only type of industrial policy which does not vary across regions is tariffs, but
the Ω variable for tariff policies will still vary by location and year because the
composition of industrial sectors is different, and the degree of competition varies
VOL. VOL NO. ISSUE                       INDUSTRIAL POLICY AND COMPETITION                                  19


across regions. Consequently, we can compute a separate Ω variable by replacing
subsidies with tariffs and replacing the correlation between initial competition
and subsidies with the correlation between initial competition and current period
tariffs. At the city level, the correlation between that city’s degree of competition
at the beginning of the sample period and current period tariffs should be strictly
exogenous, as the level of competition is predetermined and tariffs are set at the
national, not the city, level. Our last correlation measure is now defined as:


(5)               Ωrt,tarif f s = Corr(T ARIF Fjt , COM P ET IT IONrj0 )


Consequently we have four different correlation coefficients, that vary only across
locations and over time. These Ω variables measure a city’s scope to target
more competitive sectors, where competition is pre-determined using beginning
of period Lerner indices.10 To calculate our measure of competition, we first
aggregate operating profits, capital costs, and sales at the industry-level. Under
perfect competition, there should be no excess profits above capital costs, so the
Lerner Index should equal zero and the competition measure should equal 1. A
value of 1 indicates perfect competition while values below 1 suggest some degree
of market power.

  Our second goal is to identify which approaches to allocating industrial support
within a given sector are most effective. Our main empirical challenge is to
capture the notion of firm-specific industrial support being allocated in a way
that preserves or increases competition. We first consider the sectoral dispersion
of industrial support as a measure of the degree of ”competitiveness”. As an
(inverse) measure of sectoral dispersion, we use the Herfindahl index constructed
using the share of support each firm in a given sector receives relative to the total
support awarded to the sector. We thus derive a measure of concentration, such

   10 Recall that the Lerner index is defined as the ratio of operating profits less capital costs to sales. It
is an inverse measure of product market competition.

as Herf subsidy, which for subsidies is given by:

                                          X                        2
                                                     Subsidy ijt
(6)                 Herf subsidyijt =
                                                   Sum subsidy jt
                                         h∈j,h∈i
                                              /



     We then do the same thing for tax holidays, and obtain a measure of concen-
tration, Herf tax, where:

                                     X                             2
                                                T axHoliday ijt
(7)                 Herf taxijt =
                                              Sum T axHoliday jt
                                    h∈j,h∈i
                                         /



     The amount of tax holiday granted to any firm i is simply the quantity of
tax revenues that the firm saves by qualifying for the tax holiday. During the
time period of our analysis, corporate tax rates varied from 15 to 33 percent.
Consequently, the amount of the tax holiday is equal to profits times the tax rate
less actual taxes paid plus any savings from exemptions to the value-added tax
(which was set to 17 percent of value-added).         If the statutory tax rate facing
an enterprise was 20 percent, then we calculate the tax holidays as the difference
between profits multiplied by 20 percent and actual taxes paid. The results are
robust to choice of statutory tax rate (ie the top 33 percent rate versus a lower
rate).

     As with standard Herfindahl indices, a smaller number indicates a higher degree
of dispersion of subsidies or tax holidays, or a more equitable (and competition-
preserving) allocation of those across firms in the sector. We then take the 1 -
these Herfindahl indexes to capture the degree of sectoral dispersion of the tax
holidays or subsidies. The 1− Herf subsidy term we call CompHerf subsidy.
The 1 − Herf tax term we call CompHerf tax. To the extent that greater dis-
persion of subsidies within a sector induces greater focus by encouraging more
firms to innovate within a specific sector, we would expect the coefficient on that
variable in the productivity regression to be positive.
VOL. VOL NO. ISSUE             INDUSTRIAL POLICY AND COMPETITION                  21


  We also compute an analogous measure for loans. Since it is difficult to know
what portion of loans are low-interest, we identify by sector and year the mean
interest rate paid.   We compute industrial support as the difference between
mean interest rates paid in a sector and actual interest paid by firms for those
enterprises paying lower rates. To the extent that firms in a particular sector
and region are unable to access capital, we would expect a more concentrated
distribution of subsidized interest payments.

  If we were to regress firm-level measures of total factor productivity (TFP)
on these sectoral dispersion measures, such an approach could raise potential
endogeneity issues. For example, if governments favor large and more successful
firms in the allocation process, then a firm that accounts for a large share of total
tax holidays or subsidies within a sector might also exhibit higher TFP. These
would lead our estimation procedure to reflect spurious relationships between
state support and performance. A similar possibility exists if the government tends
to support weaker enterprises, which could bias the coefficient in the opposite
direction.

  To address the potential endogeneity of our policy instruments, we calculate
them separately for each firm and exclude the firm’s own industrial support (sub-
sidies, tax holidays, interest payments) in estimating our Herfindahl measures.
This means that in calculating 1 − Herf subsidy, we exclude firm i’s subsidy in
both the numerator and the denominator. For the inverse of the Herf tax or
the Herf interest, we do the same exclusion.        Consequently, this sector-level
measure is exogenous with respect to firm i’s performance.

  Combining our Ω’s which measure the links between sectoral targeting and
initial competition at the local level, and our Herfindahl indices which measure
the dispersion of industrial policy, the basic estimating equation can then be
written as follows, where m indicates an industrial policy type:


(8) ln T F Pijt = θ1 Zijt + θ2 Sjt + βm CompHerfimjt + αm Ωmrt + `i + dt + ijt ,
22                       AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL                                     MONTH YEAR


where Z is a vector of firm-level controls including state ownership at the firm
level. Although we are excluding 100 percent state-owned enterprises from the
analysis, many so-called private firms retain some degree of state participation.
The variable S includes sector-level controls, such as tariffs or the degree of (ini-
tial) competition in the sector or the degree of foreign penetration in the sector
as well as upstream and downstream foreign investment.                    11


     CompHerfimjt is a vector of industrial policies which measures the extent of
sectoral dispersion in subsidies, tax holidays, and interest payments. The specifi-
cation includes firm fixed effects `i as well as time fixed effects dt . Our conjecture
is that αm > 0, i.e that industrial policies targeted towards sectors with higher
competition as measured by the Lerner index in the initial year of the sample are
more TFP enhancing. We also conjecture that βm is likely to be positive if the
distribution of industrial policies targets innovators or promotes more competi-
tion. We explore different possible targeting schemes in our analysis below.


                                        B.   Baseline results


     We begin with the baseline estimates from (8). The critical parameters are
the coefficients on the vector of industrial policies αm and βm .Table 4 reports
the coefficient estimates. The dependent variable is the log of TFP, using both
the Olley-Pakes (OP) method and OLS with firm-level fixed effects to compute
input shares in the first stage as a comparison. Our OP approach follows Olley
and Pakes (2003) in calculating sector-specific input coefficients in the first stage
and is described in more detail in an online appendix. As indicated earlier, all
specifications include both time and firm fixed effects. We also include as controls
different sector-level measures of foreign presence, but do not report them in Table
4.


  11 For more discussion of the measures of foreign presence, which include measures for horizontal
(”horizontal”) and vertical (”backward” and “forward”) foreign exposure, see Du, Harrison, and Jefferson
(2012).

More dispersed intervention is more TFP-enhancing. — To the extent that
greater dispersion of subsidies within a sector induces greater focus by encourag-
ing more firms to innovate within a specific sector, we would expect the coefficient
on CompHerf to be positive. This is precisely what we obtain in the first row of
Table 4, which shows positive and significant coefficients on CompHerf for sub-
sidies. The coefficient estimates in column (1) indicates that a perfectly dispersed
set of subsidies, leading to a Herfindahl for subsidies of zero and consequently the
complement of that at 1, would increase TFP by 3.9 percentage points.

  The coefficient on Ωrt,subsidies indicates the extent to which targeting at the
city level via subsidies is more efficient in more competitive industries, as mea-
sured by the initial degree of competition at the beginning of the sample period.
The coefficient estimates are reported in the second row of Table 4. While the
coefficient is positive across all specifications, it is not significantly different from
zero.

  Together, the first two rows of Table 4 indicate that while allocating subsidies
to initially more competitive sectors did not significantly affect productivity, a
greater dispersion of subsidies was associated with improved firm performance.
Later we will explore how moving beyond equitable allocations of subsidies to tar-
geting innovative firms could further increase the positive impact of firm subsidies
on performance.

  The next row of Table 4 looks at the correlation between firm level TFP and
our measure for the dispersion of tax holidays CompHerf tax. The coefficient
is statistically significant and positive, indicating that greater dispersion of tax
holidays increases productivity. The coefficient estimate, which varies from .086
to .103, indicates driving the Herfindahl for the dispersion of tax holidays on
income taxes and value-added taxes to zero would leads to an increase in TFP of
8.6 to 10.3 percentage points.

  The coefficient estimate on the correlation between tax holidays and initial
competition Ωrt,taxholidays at the city level in column (1), equal to −0.0143, in-
dicates that if the correlation between tax holidays and competition at the city
level was perfect (100 percent), then productivity would be 1.43 percent higher.
Based on the sample means, a one standard deviation increase in the city-industry
correlation would increase TFP by .3 percentage points for firms in that city and
industry.

  The fifth row of Table 4 reports the impact of wider dispersion of interest
payments for loans on productivity outcomes. The coefficient on the Herfindahl
for interest payments is positive and significant across all specifications, indicating
26                         AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL                                         MONTH YEAR


that a wider dispersion of subsidized interest payments is consistent with higher
productivity at the firm level. The coefficient estimate varies from .057 to .085,
indicating that a perfectly disperse set of interest payments would be associated
with higher productivity by 5.7 to 8.5 percentage points. A one standard deviation
increase in the variable would be associated with 1.2 to 1.6 percentage points
increase in TFP.12
     While the first 3 columns of Table 4 report the effects of different industrial
policies separately, column (4) combines all of them in one specification. The
coefficient estimates are unaffected.               The results in column (4) indicate that a
more equitable dispersion of subsidies, tax holidays, and interest payments across
firms within a sector are unequivocally associated with higher productivity growth
at the firm level. While a higher level of subsidies or tax holidays are associated
with higher productivity in initially competitive sectors, the results are mixed
or negative for loans and tariffs. We shall see below that the positive effects at
the city level of subsidies and tax holidays, and the mixed role of tariffs and low
interest loans, are consistent with their individual effects at the firm level.



Robustness. — The coefficient estimates when using Olley-Pakes to estimate
TFP are reported in the last four columns of Table 4. Consistent with reviews
of the productivity literature, the results are not very different when using OP
estimates of TFP versus OLS with firm fixed effects. One difference is that the co-
efficient on the correlation of tariffs and initial competition becomes insignificant,
but remains negative with an attenuated coefficient.
     The remaining part of Table 4 reports the coefficients on the sector and firm level
controls. At the sector level, competition measured using 1 − Lerner is positively

   12 While the first five rows of Table 4 suggest potentially significant positive effects of industrial poli-
cies, these are not uniform. In particular, the correlation between interest payments and competition is
positive, suggesting improved TFP when effective interest rates are higher in more initially competitive
sectors. Similarly, the correlation between tariffs and competition in the sector, is negative, indicating
that tariff interventions in more competitive sectors have been associated with lower TFP. The coefficient
estimate, which ranges from -0.0199 to -0.0411, suggests that if higher tariffs were perfectly correlated
with higher initial competition, then TFP would be from 2 to 4 percentage points lower.
VOL. VOL NO. ISSUE             INDUSTRIAL POLICY AND COMPETITION                   27


and significantly associated with increased TFP. We also include a squared term,
and the coefficient is negative. This nonlinear relationship between competition
and productivity, which is increasing at lower levels and falling at higher levels, is
consistent with the inverted U-shape found in particular by Aghion et al (2005).
If, instead, we measure competition using sectoral export shares, we also find a
significant and positive association with TFP. This strong, positive, independent
impact of competition–measured using either the sector-level Lerner index or
export shares, is consistent with an important role for competition in enhancing
firm performance.

  One question which might arise is the potential endogeneity of the Lerner in-
dex and its square, which are included as controls.       We address the potential
endogeneity of the correlation and herfindahl measures by explicitly excluding
the own firm in the calculations and using initial period Lerners to construct the
correlations. For the Lerner control measures, endogeneity is also unlikely to be
a problem as we use the initial period Lerner measure in that location and sector.
Using Lerner measures as controls that were calculated at the beginning of the
sample period mitigate possible reverse causality between firm behavior, sectoral
productivity distributions, and market structure.

  We also include controls for subsidies, tax holidays, tariffs, and low-interest
loans at the individual enterprise level. We include a zero-one control variable,
index subsidy, which is equal to one if the enterprise received non-zero and pos-
itive subsidy amounts in that year. We also include a zero-one control indicating
whether the firm received tax holidays, index tax. The tax break is defined as
a zero-one variable indicating whether the firm paid either taxes at a lower rate
than the statutory corporate tax rate or value-added taxes at a lower rate than
the statutory rate. The coefficients on the subsidy and tax holiday dummies
are positive and significant. We also include a control for loans, which is equal
to one if the firm’s interest payments to current liabilities (an effective interest
rate) are below the average for that sector and year. The coefficient on the in-
28                         AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL                                           MONTH YEAR


dex interest term is negative and significant. Firms which receive lower interest
rates do not perform better when performance is measured using TFP. These re-
sults for loans as an industrial policy measure are consistent with the coefficients
on the industry-city correlations indicating better performance at the city level
when interest payments are higher, not lower.13



Summarizing. — Overall, the results in Table 4 suggest that preserving com-
petition through a more equitable targeting policy is associated with superior
performance, as measured by productivity. We addressed the potential endo-
geneity of targeting by excluding a firm’s own subsidies or tax holidays when
estimating the impact of sectoral dispersion of subsidies or tax holidays on that
firm’s TFP. Overall, the evidence suggests that instruments such as tax holidays
and subsidies have systemically been associated with improved productivity per-
formance when combined with high initial levels of competition, as measured by
the Lerner index.
     One interesting question to ask is how much actual tariff and subsidy levels
at the city-industry level were in fact correlated with actual competition levels.
The summary statistics in Appendix Table 1 suggest that in fact the Chinese
government did not set tariff or subsidy levels higher in cities or industries where
competition was more intense. The average correlation coefficient between tar-
iffs and the Lerner measure is -0.02, suggesting almost zero correlation between
tariffs and competition. The correlation with subsidies is positive but close to
zero, at 0.03. The only instrument where there is significant targeting is taxes,
where the correlation with competition is equal to -0.1. The coefficient of -0.1 is
suggestive of a strong negative association between more initial competition and

   13 The impact of tariffs depends on where they are allocated. While final tariffs facing a sector are
positively associated with TFP, the effect is not statistically significant. Higher tariffs in input or using
sectors have negative effects on firm TFP. These insignificant or negative effects of tariff protection on
firm level TFP are consistent with our results showing that even if tariffs are targeted at more competitive
sectors they fail to yield improved performance. Tariffs discourage competition and are generally second-
best incentive devices, so it is not surprising that using tariffs as a tool of industrial policy is not effective
in the Chinese context.
VOL. VOL NO. ISSUE               INDUSTRIAL POLICY AND COMPETITION               29


lower taxes. While the evidence in Table 4 is consistent with higher performance
as measured by TFP when policy instruments are introduced in conjunction with
greater competition, the actual pattern of policies does not suggest that this is
what the Chinese actually did. One interpretation is that there is enormous
scope for improved performance outcomes associated with industrial policy if it
is introduced in a way that preserves competition in the future.


                          C.   Targeting innovative enterprises



     Should some firms receive more support than others? This is the question we ad-
dress in Table 5. If industrial policies are more effective when they induce greater
competition between innovating firms as we are hypothesizing, then it should in
principle be possible to improve on a purely equitable distribution by targeting
firms most likely to engage in innovation. The new heterogeneous firm literature
pioneered by Hopenhayn (1992) and Melitz (2003) predicts that the most pro-
ductive firms are also likely to be the largest firms. These firms are also likely,
in the heterogeneous firm literature, to be the lowest cost and most competitive
producers. Consequently, one possibility is to redo the analysis with Herfindahls
but give greater weight to larger enterprises. We report the unweighted results
in columns (1) and (2), and the results weighting by firm size using number of
employees in column (3).

     Another way to induce greater competition is to promote new entry and en-
courage younger firms to enter. To capture the importance of entry, we redo the
Herfindahls and weight the individual subsidy, interest, and tax holiday alloca-
tions by the inverse of a firm’s age. Effectively, this means giving the greatest
weight to the youngest firms. These results are reported in column (4) of Table
5.

     The results in Table 5 suggest that in the Chinese case, targeting younger but
not bigger firms significantly increases the positive impact of industrial policies
30                            AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL                    MONTH YEAR


on total factor productivity.14 For subsidies, the coefficient on the Herfindahl
increases by a factor of 3. The coefficient estimate, at 0.10, indicates that a
one standard deviation increase in the Herfindahl would increase a firm’s TFP
by 3 percentage points. One reason why targeting younger firms may be more
beneficial is that younger firms generally have higher TFP (measured either using
the OP procedure or OLS with firm fixed effects).
     One potential pitfall of measuring process innovation using total factor produc-
tivity is when output is calculated using sector deflators with firm level revenue.
This revenue-based TFP is potentially misleading because it could reflect changes
in firm-specific quality or mark-ups. One solution exists when firm-specific price
deflators are available, which account for price heterogeneity (due to market power
differences or quality differences) across firms. For the Chinese industrial census
data, such firm-specific deflators are available for the years 1998 through 2003.
Consequently, we redo the results presented in Table 5 with this shorter time
series, using the firm-specific price deflators to calculate first output and then
TFP. The results using firm-specific price deflators to calculate TFP are reported
in Table 6.




     14 This   is consistent with the analysis in Acemoglu et al (2013).

Notes: Robust clustered standard errors are presented in parentheses. For column (1), the dependent variable is TFP (estimated by
OLS with fixed-effects); in columns (2), (3), and (4) TFP is estimated by OP as described in the text. Each regression includes
firm fixed effect and year dummies. Comp_herf_XX are Herfindhal indices of subsidy, tax, and interest rate policies, measured
on the city-industry-year level. Columns (1) and (2) use an unweighted Herfindhal index, column (3) computes a Herfindhal
index weighted by firm size (number of employees), and column (4) weights the Herfindhal index using 1/age (year since
establishment). Export share is calculated by export procurement divided by industrial sales. State share is defined as the
proportion of the firm’s state assets to its total equity. Those two shares are aggregated at the sector-year level. Index_subsidy,
index_tax, and Index_interest are dummy variables which equal to one if a firm receives subsidies, tax breaks, or a below-median
borrowing interest rate, respectively. Sector FDI measures included but not reported. *significant at 10%, **significant at 5%,

Notes: Robust clustered standard errors are presented in parentheses. Regressions in the first two columns are based
on a sub-sample of firms existed for all years between 1998 and 2003. We use this sub-sample in order to calculate the
TFP using firm-level price-deflator, which is calculated by current value of output divided by constant value of output.
The dependent variable is TFP (estimated by OLS with fixed-effects in columns (1) and (3); estimated by Olley- Pakes
method in columns (2) and (4)). Each regression includes firm fixed effect and year dummies. Comp_herf_XX are
Herfindhal index of subsidy, tax, and interest rate policies, measured on the city-industry-year level. Each regression

one if a firm receives subsidies, tax breaks, or a below-median borrowing interest rate, respectively. Other controls
include horizontal and vertical FDI shares and input and output tariffs, but the coefficients are not reported in this
table. Columns (3) and (4) include policy variables above in the first stage of the OP estimation, which estimates
factor share coefficients. *significant at 10%, **significant at 5%, ***significant at 1%.

     The sample size using the earlier years is considerably smaller, at only a quarter
of the full sample. However, the results are quite robust. The coefficient on the
subsidy Herfindahl, calculated using the OP procedure, increases from 0.03 in
Table 5 to .06, a doubling of magnitudes.            The coefficients for the dispersion
of tax holidays and low interest loans also increase significanty.            The evidence
suggests that using a much smaller sample and implementing firm-specific prices
magnifies the effects significantly.
         Another potential concern is the possible mis-measurement of TFP using
Olley-Pakes when policies are omitted in the first stage.            Recent developments
in the productivity literature suggest that excluding policies in the first stage
could lead to biased estimates in the first stage of OP, which estimates input
share coefficients. To test for this possiblity, we redid the analysis adding all the
key policies in the first stage, and report the results in the last two columns of
Table 6.      The coefficients on the herfindahl terms remain significant and even
more important in magnitude than the original specification reported in Table
4.     The evidence in Table 6 suggests that our results emphasizing the positive
impact of dispersion on productivity are robust to many different specifications
and subsamples.


         D.   Within-firm versus across-firm reallocation effects of industrial policy


     In recent years, applied productivity researchers have shifted their focus away
from the determinants of changes in behavior within the same firm to address
market share reallocation across firms and the consequences for aggregate pro-
ductivity. This shift in focus can be traced to the work of Olley and Pakes (1996),
who propose a simple approach to disentangling within versus between compo-
nents. The interest in within versus between firm reallocation also increased with
the work of Hopenhayn (1992), Melitz (2003) and others, who assume that firms
have a pre-determined exogenous productivity draw and that consequently much
of industry productivity growth is not through learning within a firm but through
34                       AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL                                     MONTH YEAR


reallocation of market shares across firms.15
     Tables 4 through 6 explored the extent to which within-firm productivity gains
were affected by how different types of industrial policies were allocated across
firms. In Table 7, we explore reallocation towards more productive enterprises.
This in turn requires a measure of TFP at the sector level, thus we recalculate
our measure of TFP at the city-sector-year level, and execute the same specifica-
tion as in Table 4 using these more aggregate reallocation terms. The results are
reported in Table 7. Now, instead of focusing on whether industrial policies en-
courage the same firm over time to innovate more, we focus on whether industrial
policies encourage reallocation of market shares towards the more productive en-
terprises. One can think of this as exploring the extensive margin of productivity
growth, rather than the intensive margin, which focuses on improvements in firm
performance within the same firm over time.
     The first two columns of Table 7 report the relationship between the realloca-
tion component of industry-city-level production and our policy measures. Col-
umn (1) reports the measures when TFP is calculated using OLS with firm fixed
effects, and column (2) reports the OP estimates. The results indicate that while
a broader distribution of low interest loans and tax holidays are significantly and
positively associated with greater productivity improvements due to reallocation
towards more productive firms, the unweighted results for subsidies are negative.
Taken together with our earlier results, we can conclude that while low interest
policies were not effective in contributing to within-firm improvements in inno-
vation, they did encourage reallocation of market share towards more innovative
firms. Low interest policies and a broader dispersion of tax holidays contributed
to the extensive margin of productivity growth. The same is not true for sub-
sidies –which appear to have operated more at the intensive margin, inducing
   15 The empirical work in this area has somewhat lagged behind the theoretical contributions. One
of the first to apply the Olley and Pakes (1996) decomposition was Pavcnik (2003), who found that
reallocation accounted for up to two thirds of productivity growth at the industry level and within firm
learning accounted for one third. For India, the results are the opposite: Harrison, Martin, and Nataraj
(2013) find that most of industry productivity growth is due to within firm effects and almost none is
due to market share reallocations. This result for India is corroborated by work by Sivadasan (2010).

  The next four columns of Table 7 report the outcomes when we weight industrial
policy by firm size or the inverse of age. The results indicate that the impact of
subsidies switch from negative to positive, suggesting that they can play a positive
role in encouraging the reallocation component of TFP growth if they are directed
at younger or larger enterprises.16 As with the earlier results, the largest impact
on TFP occurs when industrial policies are oriented towards younger enterprises.
The last two columns of Table 7 show significant TFP gains from reallocation of
market share when subsidies, tax holidays, and low interest loans are focused on
younger enterprises.

                                          IV.     Conclusion


  In this paper we have argued that sectoral state aid can foster productivity
growth to a larger extent when it targets more competitive sectors and especially
when it is not concentrated on one or a small number of firms within the sector.
  Thus, using a comprehensive dataset of all medium and large enterprises in
China between 1998 and 2007, we show that industrial policies (subsidies or tax
holidays) that are allocated to competitive sectors (as measured by the Lerner
index) or allocated in such a way as to preserve or increase competition (e.g.
by inducing entry or encouraging younger enterprises), have a more positive and
significant impact on productivity or productivity growth.
  If we focus on the intensive margin of within firm behavior, spreading these
instruments across more firms is associated with positive productivity increases
at the firm level. Even greater benefits, leading to a doubling or tripling of
the effects, is associated with allocating more benefits to more competitive (i.e.,
typically younger) firms.
   16 One question which arises is to what extent TFP growth in China reflects primarily increases in
average firm productivity versus reallocation of market shares In the Chinese case, only five percent
of industry level TFP reflects the reallocation component, as reported in Appendix Table A.2 The
small role of market share reallocation underscores the importance of focusing on individual firm-level
productivity changes, which has been the focus of most of our analysis. While market share reallocation
has increased during the sample period, it is significantly smaller than in countries like the United States.
The predominance of firm level productivity as acccounting for industry level performance for China was
also highlighted by Loren Brandt and his co-authors.

     We also find evidence of improved firm performance when industrial policies
are targeted towards sectors with initially more competition. This is true for
subsidies and tax breaks as instruments of industrial policy, but not for loans or
tariffs.   17


     This in turn suggests that the issue should be on how to design and govern
sectoral policies in order to make them more competition-friendly and therefore
more growth-enhancing. Our analysis suggests that proper selection criteria to-
gether with good guidelines for governing sectoral support can make a significant
difference in terms of growth and innovation performance.
     Yet the issue remains: how to minimize the scope for influence activities by sec-
toral interests when a sectoral state aid policy is to be implemented. One answer
is that the less concentrated and more competition-friendly the allocation of state
aid to a sector, the less firms in that sector will lobby for that aid as they will
anticipate lower profits from it. In other words, political economy considerations
should reinforce the interaction between competition and the efficiency of sectoral
state aid. A comprehensive analysis of the optimal governance of sectoral policies
still awaits further research.
     One question which might arise is how this approach can work when there are
significant economies of scale. We tested the framework in the context of the
Chinese domestic market, which is large enough to allow producers to exploit
scale economies in most industrial sectors. In a smaller economy, the question
of how to encourage more focus and rivalry while allowing firms to reap the cost
gains from exploiting scale economies would have more relevance. In that context,
competition could be preserved by exposing firms to international rivalry. It is
not surprising that smaller economies like South Korea were able to exploit the
benefits of competition by forcing firms that received targeted support to compete

   17 In China, low interest loans and tariffs were associated on net with lower productivity performance
of targeted manufacturing firms. Not surprisingly, thus allocating higher tariffs or more low interest loans
towards more competitive sectors as a result was not associated with improved productivity performance.
A main implication from our analysis is that the debate on industrial policy should no longer be for or
against the wisdom of such a policy.

on global markets. Further research exploring the implementation of industrial
policy under increasing returns remains an avenue for future research.

                                          B1.    Basic setup



Preferences and production. — We consider a two-period model of an economy
producing two goods, denoted by A and B. Denote the quantity consumed on
each good by xA and xB . The representative consumer has income equal to 2E
and utility log(xA ) + log(xB ) when consuming xA and xB . This means that, if
the price of good i is pi , demand for good i will be xi = E/pi . To simplify the
writing, we assume that E = 1 throughout this paper.18
     The production can be done by one of two ‘big’ firms 1, 2, or by ‘fringe firms’.
Fringe firms act competitively and have a constant marginal cost of production
of cf whereas firms j = 1, 2 have an initial marginal cost of c, where 1 > cf ≥ c.
The assumption cf ≥ c reflects the cost advantage of firms 1, 2 with respect to
the fringe and the assumption 1 > c insures that equilibrium quantities can be
greater than 1. Marginal costs are firm-specific and are independent of the sector
in which production is undertaken.



Innovation. — For simplicity, we assume that only firms 1, 2 can innovate. In-
novation reduces production costs, but the size of the cost reduction is different
between the two sectors A and B. Without loss of generality, we assume that in
sector A, innovations reduce production costs from c to c/γA = c/(γ + δ) whereas
in sector B they reduce costs from c to c/γB = c/(γ − δ), where γ − δ > 1 or
δ < γ − 1.
     We also make the simple assumption that, with equal probability, each firm can
be chosen to be the potential innovator. To innovate with probability q this firm
must incur effort cost q 2 /2. This is like saying that each firm has an exogenous

 18 As will be soon apparent, the rate of innovation is linear in E, and except for this size effect, what
matters for the analysis are the ratios E/c and E/cf .

probability of getting a patentable idea, which then has to be turned into cost
reduction thanks to effort exerted by the firm.



Competition. — We assume Bertrand competition within each sector unless the
two leading firms choose the same sector and collude within that sector. Let ϕ be
the probability of the two leading firms colluding in the same sector when they
have the same cost, and let us assume that when colluding the two firms behave
as a joint monopoly taking the fringe cost cf as given. In this case, the expected
                                                                   cf −c
profit of each leading firm with cost c < cf is ϕ 21                cf     since when collusion fails
firms compete Bertrand.



Industrial policy via tax/subsidies. — Laissez-faire can lead to diversification
(different sector choices by the two firms) or focus (same choice, be it A or B).
For industrial policy we will focus on interventions based on taxes or subsidies
that are proportional to profit levels, that is on tax levels tA , tB per profit level
in sectors A, B respectively, where tk < 0 is a subvention and tk > 0 is a tax.19
We restrict attention to the case where there is perfect information about γi and
where the profit is net of the cost of innovation.20
  Firms can choose to be active in different sectors or in the same sector: we refer
to the first situation as one of diversity, and the second as one of focus. Under
focus, both firms choose the better technology A. Under diversity, one firm (call
it firm 1) chooses A and the other (call it firm 2) chooses B (this is a coordination
game and which firm ends up with technology A is random). Diversity is stable
if the firm ending up with technology B does not want switch to technology A;
otherwise the equilibrium is focus. Conditional on this choice firms then decide
to invest in order to innovate.
  19 We  assume without loss of generality an initial level of taxation equal to zero in each sector.
  20 Ifthe tax/subsidy is on the profit gross of the cost of innovation, then it will also affect the rate at
which firms innovate. A reduction in the tax rate on gross profits has a similar effect to a subsidy to the
marginal cost of innovation.
46                     AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL                           MONTH YEAR


     Tax/subsidies affect the sectorial choice of activity of firms, for instance, they
may choose focus rather than diversity. Because the tax applies to total profits,
net of the cost of investing in order to innovate, the investment level is unaffected
by the tax rate put in place. Growth, the expected probability of innovation is
therefore influenced by the variance of taxes across sectors.
     We first derive the equilibrium choices under arbitrary tax/subsidy schemes
tA ≤ tB (“laissez-faire” being the case tA = tB = 0) and show the interaction
between our measure of competition ϕ and the growth rate that can be achieved
via such a tax system. We then identify the growth-maximizing tax/subsidy
scheme when the planner is subject to a budget constraint.

                    B2.   Equilibrium profits and innovation intensities


Diversity. — Under diversity, firm 1 is in sector A and firm 2 is in sector B
and both firms enjoy a cost advantage over their competitors. Let e denote the
representative consumer’s expense on sector A, p1 the price charged by firm 1
and cf the limit price imposed by the competitive fringe.
     The representative consumer purchases xA    A                           A
                                            1 , xf in order to maximize log(x1 +

xA                  A       A                             A
 f ) subject to p1 x1 + cf xf ≤ e. The solution leads to x1 > 0 only if p1 ≤ cf .

The consumer spends e and since firm 1’s profit is e − c1 xA
                                                           1 , firm 1 indeed chooses

the highest price (hence the lowest quantity xA
                                              1 ) consistent with p1 ≤ cf , that is

p1 = cf . It follows that xA = xA                A
                                1 and therefore x = e/cf .

     The problem is symmetric in the other sector and since the representative con-
sumer has total income 2 she will spend 1 on each sector, yielding xA = xB = 1/cf .
     Suppose first that there is no tax/subsidy in this sector. If the firm is not a
potential innovator (which happens with probability 1/2), its profit is equal to:

                                              cf − c
                                     π DN =          .
                                                cf

     If the firm in sector i is chosen to be a potential innovator, it will get a profit

                   c
margin of cf −     γi   if it innovates and a profit margin of cf − c if it does not.
Hence, the ex ante expected payoff of the firm conditional on being chosen to be
a potential innovator and upon choosing innovation intensity q, is equal to:

                           q         γi                           2

     Using xi = 1/cf , the optimal probability of innovation under diversity qiD and
the corresponding ex ante equilibrium profit πiD1 when chosen to be a potential
innovator, are respectively given by:

     Overall, the ex ante expected payoff from diversifying on sector i is

48                     AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL                         MONTH YEAR


With a tax rate t on profits in sector i, the investment in cost-reduction is still
equal to qiD but the expected profit of the leading firm in sector i is


                                     πiD (t) ≡ (1 − t)πiD .




Focus. — Consider first the case with full Bertrand competition within each
sector (A or B). If both leading firms decide to locate in the same sector, it is
optimal for them to choose the sector with higher growth potential, i.e., sector A.
Under focus, the next best competitor for firm 1 is firm 2 rather than the fringe,
so the equilibrium price is always equal to c which is lower than cf by assumption.
Hence, in this case, xA = 1/c while xB = 1/cf since the consumer buys from the
fringe in sector B.

     Suppose first that there is no tax/subsidy in sector A. If firm 1 is chosen to be
                                                           c
a potential innovator, it will get a profit margin of c − γ+δ when it innovates since
it will then compete in Bertrand with the other firm and gets the full market
share 1/c. If it does not innovate, it will collude with probability ϕ in order to
set a price cf and split the demand 1/cf with a profit margin cf − c; if collusion
fails, the firms make zero profit. Hence, the firm that is called to innovate solves

                                    γ+δ−1            1 cf − c q 2
                    π F I ≡ max q         + (1 − q)ϕ         −
                             q       γ+δ             2 cf      2

The optimal choice of q is then

                                        γ + δ − 1 ϕ cf − c
(B2)                             qF ≡            −
                                          γ+δ      2 cf

and therefore
                                          (q F )2 ϕ cf − c
                                 πF I =          +         .
                                             2     2 cf
If the firm is not chosen to be the innovator, it will get positive profits only if the
VOL. VOL NO. ISSUE                INDUSTRIAL POLICY AND COMPETITION              49


other firm fails and if collusion succeeds, that is the expected profit is

                                                     ϕ cf − c
                                π F N = (1 − q F )
                                                     2 cf

  Hence the expected profit of each firm under focus in sector A is

                                1      1
                           πF = πF I + πF N

                              =   q    + (2 − q F )          .
                                4                   4 cf


  Note that since the objective functions defining π F I and π F N are increasing in
ϕ, the value functions are increasing in ϕ. Now, q F is an increasing function of δ
but is a decreasing function of ϕ, and has zero cross-partial variation with respect
to δ, ϕ. It follows that

                           ∂ 2πF   1 ∂q F ∂q F   ∂q F 1 cf − c
                                 =             −

(B3)                             < 0,


implying that the cross partial between δ and 1 − ϕ is positive.
  If we introduce a tax rate of t in sector A, the probability of innovation of a
firm is still q F while its expected profit is


(B4)                               π F (t) ≡ (1 − t)π F .



Industry equilibrium and the role of taxation. — Consider the laissez-faire
situation with tA = tB = 0. Focus will be the industry equilibrium if no firm
prefers to be active in sector B, the lowest profit sector, that is when π F ≥ πB
                                                                                D.

This establishes Proposition 1 which shows that there exists a cutoff value δ F (ϕ),
a decreasing function of ϕ such that focus is the industry equilibrium if, and only
50                     AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL                        MONTH YEAR


if, δ ≥ δ F (ϕ).
     Hence, the stronger competition as measured by (1 − ϕ), the higher the range
of δ’s for which firms will choose diversity.
     Putting in place a system of tax/subsidies will modify the industry equilibrium
                                                      D > (1−t )π F , which is more
since diversity arises in equilibrium only if (1−tB )πB       A

difficult to achieve the larger tB with respect to tA . We will use as a measure of
targeting the ratio

                                           1 − tA
(B5)                                  τ≡          ,
                                           1 − tB

the larger τ is, the higher the “tax holidays” in sector A with respect to sector
B. It should be clear that τ is sufficient to characterize the incentives of firms to
choose between diversity or focus. Alternatively, τ is a measure of the asymmetry
in tax holidays between the two sectors. Note that tax systems with τ = 1
are neutral in the sense that they do not modify the industry equilibrium since
∆(ϕ, 1) = δ F (ϕ).
     Tax policies that are targeted towards sector A, that is have a higher value of
τ will increase the likelihood of focus to be an industry equilibrium. Indeed, the
industry equilibrium is focus whenever τ π F > πB
                                                D ; the value ∆(ϕ, τ ) for which

there is an equality is decreasing in τ since π F is increasing in δ. It follows that
targeting makes focus more likely, and establishes Corollary 1.
     Hence, a larger target ratio τ increases the range of values of δ for which there
will be focus. Alternatively, if δ < δ F (ϕ), there exists a targeting tax τ such that
δ = ∆(ϕ, τ ); because ∆(ϕ, τ ) is a decreasing function of τ , the lower the value of
δ, the higher this value of τ should be.



Industrial policy, innovation and the level of per capita GDP. — Consider
first the innovation rate under diversity versus focus, and the implication of this
comparison for the effect of industrial policy. Focus maximizes the innovation

rate if and only if it implies a higher innovation rate, namely whenever

This condition is more likely to be satisfied the lower ϕ, i.e., the more intense the
degree of within-sector competition, and it always holds for ϕ sufficiently small.

  Whenever this condition is satisfied, but δ < δ F (ϕ), one can increase long run
growth through a tax/subsidy policy such that δ > ∆(ϕ, t).

  Now consider the effects of industrial policy on the level of output (i.e the level
of per capita GDP). If there is diversity, independently of the degree of innovation
in this sector, the price is cf since in each sector the leading firm competes with
the fringe only: innovation decreases the cost of production but does not affect
directly the price. Therefore, output under diversity is equal to:

                                              2
(B6)                                   YD =      .
                                              cf


  By contrast, under focus, innovation affects output directly. If there is no
innovation, there is a probability ϕ that the firms collude and set a price cf , but
if they fail, the price will be equal to c since the two leaders compete in this case.
If one firm innovates, the price will be equal to c. Hence, the level of output under
focus is

                                 qF
                                                            

                                                        

                               = − ϕ(1 − q F )      −      .

  Therefore moving from diversity to focus increases output (i.e., the level of per

which is larger the smaller the product ϕ(1 − q F ). Note that this difference is
positive when ϕ = 0.
     Overall, by Corollary 1, an industrial policy taking the form of a taxation on
profits targeted towards sector A, that is τ > 1, will have an effect on innovation
and the level of per capita GDP, if and only if there would be diversity without
targeting and τ is large enough to induce the firms to choose focus. In this case
we call the τ -industrial policy effective.
     From (B2), q F is decreasing in ϕ, and therefore ϕ(1 − q F ) is increasing in ϕ. It
follows that industrial policy has a bigger impact on growth and output, the lower
ϕ: competition and industrial policy , are complements. This discussion proves
Proposition 2 in the text; an effective τ -industrial policy has a bigger effect on
per capita GDP and on innovation in more competitive industries.
