1        Introduction

Life expectancy in the United States at mid and older ages has been rising during the twentieth

century. At the beginning of the century men’s life expectancy at age 55 was 17 years and at age

65 it was 11 years. By the century’s end life expectancy at ages 55 and 65 had risen to 23 and

16 years, respectively. This increase in life expectancy was extremely slow at first, rising by only

about half a year during the first three decades of the twentieth century. Between 1930 and 1960

the increase was much more rapid, with increases of more than a year at age 55 and of a year at

age 65. Between 1960 and 1990 life expectancy at ages 55 and 65 respectively rose by an even

greater 3 and 2 years. By 1997 life expectancies at each of these ages had risen by another year.1

              Several factors may explain increases in life expectancy at older ages. Advances in

medical care have reduced the deadliness of chronic conditions. Cutler et al. (1998) document

the increases in life expectancy from new heart attack treatments. Velkova, Wolleswinkel-Van

den Bosch, and Mackenbach (1997) show that the sudden availability of medical care has an

immediate effect on older age mortality. Life style changes such as the cessation of smoking or

the switch to a low fat diet may account for some of the recent mortality improvements; however,

the increase in smoking from the late 1900s through the first half of the twentieth century probably

contributed to increased mortality rates. Occupational exposure to harmful dust and fumes has

declined. Smoke and salt are no longer heavily used as food preservatives. Infectious disease

rates have fallen. Men reaching age 55 in 1960 were born when 14 percent of children died

before age one whereas those reaching age 55 in 1995 were born when less than 6 percent of

children died before age one (see the Berkeley Mortality Database). There is extensive evidence

that mid-life, young adult, and early childhood events matter to older age health and longevity

(Manton, Stallard, and Corder 1997; Costa 2000b; Elo and Preston 1992; Barker 1992, 1994).

                                                         1
But, there is also evidence that earlier life events have relatively little impact on older age mortality

(Christensen et al. 1995; Kannisto, Christensen, and Vaupel 1997; Kannisto 1994). Selection

may lead to only the healthiest surviving and mortality at older ages may therefore be lower than

in a population not exposed to stress at young ages. Furthermore, current life events may be more

important determinants of mortality than past life events.

          This paper examines a past population, veterans of the Union Army, to establish the role

of infectious disease early and late in life and of occupation at young and mid-life ages on older

age mortality. This population was exposed to a wide variety of infectious diseases while in the

army, faced very different disease experiences at young ages that depended upon the size of city

of origin, faced high occupational risks, and had medical care that was ineffective at best. I can

therefore examine the effect of untreated infectious disease on later mortality. Causes of death

among Union Army veterans differ from those of modern populations because of the high death

rates from infectious, diarrheal, and respiratory diseases that prevailed in the past. The findings

therefore have implications for modeling the determinants of mortality in past populations. They

also have implications for modern populations as well, because I can examine the determinants

of waiting time until death from a specific cause.

          The findings will help us improve our forecasts of future mortality trends and therefore

help us assess the effectiveness of policies to reduce the fiscal deficits in Social Security and

Medicare. The findings will also help us formulate public policies for countries undergoing an

epidemiological transition. The infectious diseases and on the job hazards that were prevalent in

the United States in the nineteenth century are still common, and as deadly, in many developing

countries today. If ill-health among older populations arises from their experiences in early

childhood or as young adults, then these years may be the appropriate ages at which to target

health interventions. Finally, the findings have implications for estimates of the standard of

living during industrialization in the United States and in developing countries that are rapidly


                                                   2
urbanizing. If infectious disease has a long reach, then the urbanization that accompanied

industrialization may have been much more costly than suggested by comparisons of urban and

rural mortality rates (Williamson 1990; Steckel and Floud).

          The paper begins with an overview of the empirical strategy. To help motivate the

empirical specification, this section also reviews the medical literature on the relationship between

infectious disease and chronic conditions. The next three sections describe the data, the regression

results, and the decomposition of the twentieth century increase in survival rates. The increase

in survival rates is decomposed into the portions due to reduced infectious disease rates and to

occupational shifts from manual to white collar jobs. It is also decomposed into the fractions

attributable to the immediate effects of reduced infectious disease rates and of mortality from

infectious disease and to the long-run effects of reduced infectious disease rates. The implications

of the results are discussed more fully in the conclusion.



2    Empirical Framework

2.1 Specification

I model Union Army veterans’ waiting time until death from all causes or from a specific cause by

means of a proportional hazard model. The hazard, (t), or the rate at which spells are completed

after duration t given that they last until at least t, is


                        (t)   =   exp(x  0
                                               t
                                              ) 0( )                                                    (1)

                        (t)   =   exp(xI I
                                          0
                                               +   xC0
                                                          C + xO O + xM M )0 (t)
                                                                0        0
                                                                                                        (2)


where 0 is the baseline hazard and exp(x      0
                                                   ) is   the relative hazard. The vector x consists of four

basic types of variables: 1) direct indicators of episodes of infectious disease while in the army


                                                          3
(xI ); 2) indicators of size of city of residence both at enlistment in 1861-1864 and at older ages

in 1900, a proxy for exposure to infectious disease (xC ); indicators of occupation at enlistment

and at older ages (xO ); and, miscellaneous other control variables (xM ). These control variables

are indicators of both early and late life events. Artisans, laborers, and farmers were more likely

to suffer from respiratory symptoms than professionals or proprietors because of their greater

exposure to harmful dust, fumes, and gases (Costa 2000b). Size of city of enlistment and of

residence in 1900 proxy for the severity of the disease environment. Antebellum cities of over

50,000 were particularly deadly. Although by 1900 the largest cities were less deadly than mid-

size cities because of their earlier initiation of such sanitary reforms as water filtration (Preston

and Haines 1991: 98), exposure to air-borne disease is likely to be greater in larger cities because

of crowding. By 1995-1997 age-adjusted death rates were greater on average in rural than in

urban areas, but this relationship varied by race, sex, and region (United States National Center

for Health Statistics 2000).

          I use a competing risks framework, treating individuals who die from a cause of death

other than that being examined as censored, and estimate the impact of infectious disease and

occupation on waiting time until death from a specific cause. I examine all natural cause mortality,

mortality from chronic disease, mortality from acute diseases, all heart disease, ischemic heart

disease, myocarditis, respiratory illness, infectious illness, and stomach ailments.

          I determine how much of the difference in survival probabilities between Union Army

veterans and a modern population is accounted for by reductions in infectious disease rates and

how much by occupational shifts. I also calculate the portion of the difference attributable to

immediate reductions in infectious disease rates and their mortality sequelae and the portion

attributable to early life infectious disease rates. I begin by estimating hazard models for all cause

mortality, A, for mortality from chronic conditions (all deaths other than infectious, respiratory,

or diarrheal diseases), H , and for mortality from infectious and parasitic disease, F . The survivor

functions, or the probabilities of not dying from cause J at least until t if other causes of death

are precluded, SJ (t), J    =   A; H; F , are

                SJ (t) = exp[ln SJ;0 (t) exp(xI     0
                                                         J;I      +   xC  0
                                                                              J;C   +   xO  0
                                                                                                    J;O + xM J;M )]
                                                                                                            0
                                                                                                                                         (3)


where SJ;0 (t) is the baseline survivor function. Assuming no infectious disease in the army

(xI   =   0) and no elevated mortality risk in large cities (xC                         =   0), the survival functions become


                         SIJ (t) = exp[ln SJ;0 (t) exp(xO                 0
                                                                               J;O + xM J;M )] :
                                                                                                0
                                                                                                                                         (4)


Assuming elimination of infectious disease in the army and of elevated mortality risk in large

cities of enlistment but no change in mortality risk in large cities in 1900 (xI                                    =   0 and xc   =   xyc ),
the survival functions are


                  SY IJ (t) = exp[ln SJ;0 (t) exp(xY C        0
                                                                      J;C + xO J;O + xM J;M )] :
                                                                                    0                   0
                                                                                                                                         (5)


Finally, if the occupational distribution had been the same as that prevailing today (xO                                       =   xTO),
the survivor functions become


             SOJ (t) = exp[ln SA;0 (t) exp(xI   0
                                                        A;I    +   xC 0
                                                                              A;C   +   xO  0
                                                                                                    A;TO + xM A;M )] :
                                                                                                                0
                                                                                                                                         (6)


The survivor function will underestimate the effect of reduced job hazards on older age mortality

because reduced hazard within occupation is not measured.

             I present two different calculations decomposing the increase in survival rates into the

portion due to reduced infectious disease rates and the portion due to occupational shifts. I first

use the all cause mortality equation to estimate the increase in survivor probabilities assuming



                                                                  5
no infectious disease (xI   =   0 and xC    =   0) and assuming today’s occupational distribution

(x O   =   xTO),

                                          SIA(t) ; SA(t)                                             (7)

Secondly, I estimate the estimate the increase in survivor probabilities for both the chronic and

acute disease specifications assuming no infectious disease at young ages (xI   =   0 and xC   =   xY C )
and today’s occupational distribution. I also estimate the effect of immediate reductions in

infectious disease rates and in acute disease mortality, that is eliminating infectious, respiratory,

and parasitic disease as a cause of death, as


                                         SH (t) ; SA(t) :                                            (9)


The additional gain from eliminating infectious disease at young ages is


                                     [SY IH (t) ; SH (t)] :                                         (10)


Because many individuals in the sample undoubtedly suffered from infectious disease either

before or after their army experience (though perhaps less severe forms of these infections), this

quantity will underestimate the gain from eliminating early life infectious disease among Union

Army veterans. Dividing this quantity by the observed difference in survivorship rates between

Union Army veterans and a modern population yields a rough estimate of the gain in survivorship

rates due to reductions in infectious disease rates. Unobserved disease episodes among Union

Army veterans will lead me to underestimate this gain whereas unobserved disease episodes

among men in modern populations and unobserved changes in the scarring effects of infectious


                                                  6
disease will lead me to overestimate this gain.

          Decomposing the increase in survivor rates into the portion due to eliminating early

life infectious disease assumes that there is a gain at older ages to eliminating infectious disease

early in life. But, the relationship between residence in a large city when young or illness

while in the army and mid and older age mortality could be either positive or negative. In

the following subsection, I discuss this relationship, considering the linkages between specific

infectious disease (xI ), socioeconomic status (xO ), and the major causes of death that I examine

(all heart disease, ischemic heart disease, myocarditis, respiratory illness, and such stomach

ailments as gastritis/duodenitis and ulcer).



2.2 Medical Background

The relationship between residence in a large city when young or illness while in the army and mid

and older age mortality could be negative because cohorts who survive infectious diseases may

acquire partial or complete immunity from such diseases as measles, typhoid, and malaria and

therefore may have lower mortality rates. If genetic susceptibility to death from infectious disease

or other insults at young ages is positively correlated with genetic susceptibility to develop chronic

disease at older ages, then, because fewer genetically “frail” individuals survive to old age, the

mortality rate of such a cohort may be lower relative to a cohort in which more genetically frail

individuals survive. The deceleration in the age pattern of mortality at older ages is compatible

with just such selection (Horiuchi and Wilmoth 1998).

          Stress in early life may, however, lead not to selection of the fittest but to permanent

scarring. As discussed below, the medical literature provides many examples of this for heart,

respiratory, and stomach disease.

          Infectious diseases that can affect cardiac functioning include rheumatic heart disease,

late stage syphilis, measles, and typhoid fever. Acute rheumatic fever follows group A streptococ-

                                                  7
cal upper respiratory tract infection, involves the joints and the heart and subcutaneous tissue, and

results in damage to the heart valves and in myocarditis. Studies of typhoid and measles patients

in developing countries reveal electrocardiogram abnormalities (Khosla 1981; Olowu and Taiwo

1990). Myocarditis is one of the complications of measles.

          There is also increasing evidence of a link between infectious disease and atherosclero-

sis. Infections are known to influence lipid metabolism and may play some role in the atheroscle-

rotic process itself by inducing damage and inflammation in the vascular endothelium in the

presence of hypercholesterolemia (see reviews by Lindholt et al. 1999; Valtonen 1991; Wong,

Gallagher, and Ward 1999). Infections that have been implicated include helicobacter pylori, a

bacterium that causes gastritis and stomach ulcers and is transmitted through tainted food and wa-

ter; chlamdyia pneumonia, a bacterium that causes acute upper and lower respiratory infections;

Coxsackie B4 virus, generally causing symptoms no more serious than a common cold or sore

throat; and, some herpesviridae. The evidence linking chlamdyia pneumonia to atherosclerosis

is the strongest; however, helicobacter pylori infection may be especially harmful when folate

absorption is reduced, either because of decreased consumption of ascorbic acid or of folates

(Markle 1997). The army diet may therefore have worsened infection.

          Early life upper respiratory tract infections have been implicated in later life suscepti-

bility both to pneumonia and to chronic obstructive lung disease (e.g. Barker 1992, 1994; Wesley

1991). In the United States of the nineteenth century malaria sufferers might be at greater risk

of death from respiratory distress as well. Falciparum malaria, imported to North America with

slavery, is frequently accompanied by pulmonary manifestations in non-immune individuals (e.g.

Gozal 1992; Hovette et al. 1998). Others at greater risk of chronic obstructive lung disease include

individuals who were exposed to dust and fumes in their jobs.

          Correlates of later gastritis and ulcers include infection with helicobacter pylori; socioe-

conomic status – manual workers are at greater risk of gastric ulcers and non-manual workers of


                                                  8
duodenal ulcers (Caygill et al. 1990); and, prisoner of war status (Venn and Guest 1991). Prisoner

of war status is likely to be a correlate of gastritis and ulcers among past populations as well.

Fifty-nine percent of all deaths from disease at Andersonville were from diarrhea and dystentery

compared to 38 percent in the Union Army as a whole (United States Surgeon General’s Office

1870: 636-641; United States Surgeon General’s Office 1888: 35).



3       Data

The data used in this paper are drawn from a unique longitudinal dataset based upon the

records of the Union Army pension program (see the Appendix for a discussion of sample

representativeness).2 This pension program was the most widespread form of assistance to the

elderly prior to Social Security, covering 85% of all Union Army veterans by 1900 and 90%

by 1910 (Costa 1998:160). The program began in 1862 when Congress established the basic

system of pension laws, known as the General Law pension system, to provide pensions to both

regular and volunteer recruits who were severely disabled as a direct result of military service

(see Costa (1998:197-212) for a history of the Union Army pension program). The Union Army

pension program became a universal disability and old-age pension program for veterans with the

passage of the Act of June 27, 1890 which specified that any disability entitled the veteran to a

pension. Even though old age was not recognized by statute law as sufficient cause to quality for a

pension until 1907, the Pension Bureau granted the minimum pension to those age 65 unless they

were “unusually vigorous.” The records contain complete medical examinations conducted by a

board of three examining surgeons because those with a severe chronic condition, particularly if

it could be traced to war-time experience, were eligible for larger pensions. The surgeons rated

the severity of specific conditions using detailed guidelines provided by the Pension Bureau.

           Copious records were generated by the Union Army pension program. Pension appli-

cations included detailed medical examinations both for men whose pension application or bid

for a pension increase was rejected and for men whose applications were accepted. These records

have been linked to the 1900 census and to military service records. The 1900 census provides

occupational and residential information and the military service records information on stress at

young adult ages such as prisoner of war status and such illnesses as measles, diarrhea, tubercu-

losis, typhoid, rheumatism, acute respiratory infections (e.g. pneumonia, bronchitis, influenza),

malaria, and war injuries.

           The sample is restricted to native-born men linked to the 1900 census, aged 50 to 64

in 1900, and on the pension rolls by 1900.3 A surgeon’s exam detailing medical conditions

is available for 93 percent of men. The sample is restricted to the 48 percent of men whose

pension records provide information on cause of death. For the most part, these were men with a

surviving spouse and men who lived longer. Health conditions in 1900 as noted by the examining

surgeons do not predict whether information on cause of death is missing. However, if men in my

sample are on the whole healthier, I am likely to underestimate the impact of infectious disease

and occupation on mortality. Total sample size is 2,907. In the analysis all deaths beyond a 25

year observation period are censored. Shorter follow-up periods yield similar results but do not

provide enough observations for some causes of death such as myocarditis. Beyond this 25 year

observation period variables cease to have predictive power.

           Causes of death were coded as heart disease, respiratory illness (chronic respiratory

     Men not on the pension rolls are not at risk of dying. The additional restrictions were made to ensure the
availability of occupational and residential information for all men circa 1900 and information on size of city of
residence at young ages.

and pneumonia, influenza, and bronchitis), stomach ailments (gastritis/duodenitis and ulcers),

infectious (including tuberculosis but excluding pneumonia, influenza, and bronchitis), cancer,

diarrheal, and genito-urinary. Heart disease was subdivided into cerebrovascular, valvular, is-

chemic (atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, coronary occlusion, and coronary thrombosis), and

myocarditis.4 Acute disease includes all infectious, respiratory, and diarrheal disease. Men with

vague and unclassifiable causes of death tended to be those without a surviving spouse. Con-

ditions noted by the examining surgeons in 1900 predicted mortality by cause: valvular heart

disease in 1900 predicted death from valvular heart disease but not from ischemic heart disease;

stroke, angina, and varicose veins predicted cerebrovascular deaths; stroke predicted death from

ischemic heart disease; irregular pulse predicted death from myocarditis; bronchitis and emphy-

sema predicted death from respiratory causes; gastritis weakly predicted death from stomach

ailments; and, prostate problems predicted death from genito-urinary causes. A tumor in 1900

was not a good predictor of death from cancer, perhaps because the examining surgeons could

only diagnose the tumors that they could visually observe. On the whole, however, causes of

death noted on death certificates at the beginning of the twentieth century appear to be reasonably

accurate.

            Table 1 presents trends in causes of death. It shows major causes of death among Union

Army veterans over a 25 year period and, over a 17 year period, among Union Army veterans

and white men in the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a random sample

of the population. This table shows that heart disease is now largely ischemic, whereas in the

past, because deaths from unidentifiable heart disease were probably attributable to valvular heart

     See Fleming (1997) and Finlayson (1985) for a history of diagnosis of ischemic heart disease. Chronic and
acute respiratory illnesses are classified together because of the difficulty in distinguishing between the two in cause
of death information.

disease, up to 21 percent of all deaths may have been from valvular heart.5 Table 1 also illustrates

the high levels of infectious, respiratory, and diarrheal disease in the past relative to today. This

suggests that it may be difficult to detect the effects of early life events on all cause mortality

because such current events as recent exposure to infectious and parasitic disease may be more

important.



4        Results

Recall that I model the relationship between such early life events as infectious disease while

in the army and cause specific morbidity at mid and late ages by means of a competing risks

proportional hazards model,

where  0 is the baseline hazard and where the estimated coefficients have the interpretation of
hazard ratios for a one unit change in x. Deaths from causes other than those examined are treated

as censored. The vector xM consists of age in 1900 and dummy variables indicating whether the

veteran was ever wounded in the war or was ever a prisoner of war. The vector xC consists of

dummy variables for size of city at enlistment (over 50,000, between 25,000 and 50,000, 2,500

to 25,000, less than 2,500); size of city of residence in 1900 (one of the top 10 largest cities in

the country, one of next 11th to 36th largest cities, and a smaller city or not a city). The vector

xO consists of dummy variables indicating occupation at enlistment (professional or proprietor,
farmer, artisan, laborer, or unknown) and occupation circa 1900 (professional or proprietor,

farmer, artisan, or laborer). Finally, the vector xI consists of dummy variables specifying whether

the veteran ever suffered in the army from diarrhea or cholera, respiratory infections (bronchitis,

pneumonia, and influenza), measles, typhoid, malaria, tuberculosis, rheumatic fever or rheumatic

athropathies, such stomach ailments as gastritis and ulcers, and syphilis.

          Table 2 presents the results for all cause mortality and for mortality from all chronic

disease and from all acute (or, more precisely, infectious, respiratory, and parasitic) disease.

Tables 3 and 4 present the results for all cause mortality and for mortality from respiratory illnesses,

stomach ailments, infectious disease, all heart ailments except cerebrovascular, ischemic heart

disease, and myocarditis. Except for deaths from infectious disease in Table 4, I cannot reject

the hypothesis that all coefficients in the regressions are jointly statistically significantly different

from 0. I also cannot reject the hypothesis that the proportional hazards assumption is met. These

tables do not present results for deaths from cerebrovascular, valvular heart disease, cancer, and

genito-urinary causes. None of the explanatory variables were significant predictors of death

from stroke, suggesting that an unobservable such as salt intake may be the culprit. Laborers

were at greater risk relative to professionals and proprietors of dying from valvular heart disease,

but none of the wartime disease variables were predictors. Hepatitis infection during the war was

the only significant predictor of cancer deaths, perhaps because deaths from stomach cancer were

a significant proportion of all recognized cancer deaths. Only a large city of enlistment predicted

deaths from genito-urinary causes. None of the variables predicted violent deaths.

          Tables 2, 3, and 4 illustrate the importance of distinguishing mortality by cause of death,

particularly in investigating the impact of infectious disease while in the army. Stomach ailments

while in the army significantly predicted mortality from all causes, all chronic disease, stomach

ailments, all heart disease other than cerebrovascular, and ischemic heart disease. Stomach

ailments were also a large, though not significant, predictor of myocarditis mortality. Diarrhea

was a significant predictor of mortality from stomach ailments. It was also the only illness that

signficantly provided protection against mortality, in this case from respiratory illness. Malaria

2,907 observations. The symbols ,y, and z indicate signifance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent level, respectively. The
sample consists of Union Army veterans on the pension rolls by 1900, age 50-64 in 1900, linked to the 1900 census, and
with cause of death information. The follow-up period is 25 years. Deaths during the 1918 influenza pandemic were
excluded. Excluding these deaths did not materially change the results. Deaths from violence were treated as censored.
The category chronic excludes all respiratory deaths, tuberculosis, diarrheal, and other parasitic and infectious diseases.
These excluded deaths are in the category infectious, respiratory, and parasitic. The proportional hazards assumption
is tested by testing for a non-zero slope in the generalized linear regression of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals on a
function of time.                                         15

and respiratory infection significantly predicted mortality from respiratory illnesses. Respiratory

infection significantly predicted death from acute illnesses because this category largely consisted

of respiratory illnesses. Rheumatic fever significantly predicted mortality from all heart disease

other than cerebrovascular and from myocarditis and was a large though not significant predictor of

death from ischemic heart disease. Syphilis was a significant predictor of death from all categories

of heart disease. Measles was a significant predictor of death from myocarditis. Tuberculosis was

a significant predictor of death from infectious disease. Typhoid was not a significant predictor

of death from any cause.

          Infectious diseases that were significant predictors of cause specific mortality also

significantly predicted the probability of having a related disease state in 1900 and in 1910.

Malaria and respiratory infections while in the army significantly predicted respiratory problems at

older ages. Diarrhea had a protective effect for “dullness of chest.” Rheumatic fever significantly

predicted tachycardia, irregular pulse, congestive heart failure, murmurs, and arteriosclerosis.

Syphilis was associated with arteriosclerosis and tachycardia. Stomach ailments significantly

predicted tachycardia. Not all predictors of disease states in 1900 or in 1910 were predictors of

death from related causes. Whereas measles was a significant predictor of respiratory distress

later in life and typhoid of irregular pulse and valvular heart disease, neither measles nor typhoid

predicted death from related causes (Costa 2000a, 2000b).

          Tables 2, 3 and 4 show that growing up in a large city had a lasting effect on mortality

even controlling for later residence. Men who enlisted in a city of 50,000 or more faced a

significantly greater risk of death from all cause mortality, from all chronic disease, from all

respiratory, infectious, and parasitic disease, from respiratory illness, from stomach ailments,

from all heart disease except for cerebrovascular, and from ischemic heart disease. They also

faced a greater risk of mortality from infectious disease, though not significantly so. I cannot

ascertain whether they faced a greater risk of death from myocarditis because of collinearities


                                                18
between large city of enlistment and large city of residence in 1900. Large city of residence in

1900 was a significant predictor of death from myocarditis, from respiratory disease, and from all

respiratory, infectious, and parasitic diseases.6

            The other measure of environmental stress with significant predictive power was prisoner

of war status. Former prisoners of war faced substantially greater risk of death from stomach

ailments, though not from other causes. Note that studies of Australian prisoners of war during

World War II (Venn and Guest 1991) find that these men were at greater risk of gastritis but not

of other illnesses.

            Men who worked as laborers and artisans faced an elevated risk of death relative

to professionals and proprietors and to farmers. Laborers were significantly more likely than

professionals and proprietors to die of stomach ailments, all heart disease, and myocarditis.

Artisans were significantly more likely to die of all heart disease relative to professionals and

proprietors. Farmers were significantly less likely than professionals and proprietors to die of

ischemic heart disease and of all chronic disease. Both artisans and laborers were more likely to

die of respiratory disease (and from all acute illnesses), though not significantly so.

            On the whole occupational shifts have a smaller impact on the predicted 25 year survival

probability,   S (25), than reductions in infectious disease rates.              Table 5 illustrates the effect on

the predicted survival probability of setting all diseases while in the army equal to zero, setting

all large city dummies equal to zero (arguably reducing infectious disease rates), and setting the

occupational distribution in 1900 to that prevailing in 1970 and the occupational distribution at

enlistment to that prevailing in 1920. Except for death from respiratory and infectious disease,

occupational shifts have a smaller impact on the relative survival probability even though the


   6
     Large city of residence in 1900 does not become a significant predictor of death from other causes when size of
city of enlistment is omitted nor is the interaction between large city of enlistment and large city in 1900 a significant
of death from respiratory heart disease.

    Survival probabilities are probabilities of survival until death from a specific cause. Deaths from other causes
    are censored. All survival probabilities are predicted setting whether a veteran was ever wounded in the war
    or was ever a prisoner of war equal to 0. Age is set equal to 60. Standard errors (not shown) were large.



impact of infectious disease on the survival probability is likely to be understated because of

unobserved disease episodes.



5     Explaining Rising Survivorship

What is the role of reduced infectious disease rates and of occupational shifts from manual to white

collar work in explaining the long-run increase in survivorship at older ages? The difference in 17

year survival rates between Union Army veterans and white men in NHANES was 24 percentage

points. Table 6 presents two different calculations. The first calculation use the all cause mortality

regression in Table 2 and sets the wartime disease dummies to 0 and all city size variables to

small, yielding an increase in the predicted survival rate (SA (17)) in the Union Army sample

of 3 percentage points and therefore explaining 14 percent of the difference in survival rates

between the Union Army sample and NHANES. A similar calculation setting the occupational

distribution in 1900 to that prevailing in 1970 and the occupational distribution at enlistment to

that prevailing in 1920 implies that occupational shifts explain none of the difference in survival

rates between the Union Army sample and NHANES because farmers faced favorable survival

rates and their numbers declined. The second calculation uses the regressions for chronic and

acute disease mortality in Table 2 to obtain the probability of not dying from chronic disease,

SH (17) and the probability of not dying from infectious, respiratory, and parasitic causes, SF (17).
Eliminating infectious disease early in life (as proxied by wartime disease dummies and by city

size at enlistment) would raise each survival rate by 3 percentage points. Occupational shifts

play a negligible role. Eliminating infectious, respiratory, and parasitic diseases as a cause of

death would raise survival rates by 15 percent and therefore explain 62 percent of the increase in

survival rates between the Union Army sample and NHANES.7 Eliminating early life infectious

disease leads to a further 3 percentage point increase in survival rates and explains 12 percent of

the increase in survival rates. The total reduction due to the elimination of infectious, respiratory,

and parasitic disease is 17 percentage points or 73 percent of the difference in survival rates

between the Union Army sample and NHANES.



6       Implications

This paper has shown that early life events can lead to permanent scarring. Episodes of infectious

disease while in the army and exposure to infectious disease during the growing years in large

cities had an impact on the 25 year survival rate of Union Army veterans aged 50 to 64 in 1900.

If there is a role for selection, it is at much older ages. None of the covariates were significant

predictors of mortality after the 25 year follow-up period.

          This paper has also shown that studies of past populations that seek to understand the


    7
    This is a slight overestimate because slightly less than 2 percent of men in NHANES died from infectious
disease.


                                                    22
determinants of mortality need to examine mortality by cause because of the high prevalence of

respiratory, infectious, and diarrheal deaths in past populations. The effect of specific diseases

depended upon the cause of death that was being investigated. Predictors of death from various

types of heart disease among Union Army veterans included stomach ailments, rheumatic fever,

syphilis, and measles while in the army. Of particular note was the relationship between stomach

ailments and death from ischemic heart disease, suggesting that such infections as helicobacter

pylori may have played a role. Predictors of waiting time until death from respiratory disease

included prior respiratory infections and malaria, which is frequently accompanied by respiratory

infections in non-immune individuals. Predictors of waiting time until death from stomach

ailments were prior stomach ailments and diarrhea. Tuberculosis while in the army predicted

death from infectious disease at older ages, suggesting that the nodular scars left by tuberculosis

in the apices of one or both lungs could be the seeds for later active tuberculosis many years later.

          The results suggest that the costs of the urbanization that accompanied industrialization

prior to the widespread acceptance of the germ theory of disease and the accompanying institution

of sanitary reforms were high. Men who grew up in a large city faced much higher mortality rates

at older ages from all causes and from both chronic and acute disease controlling for size of city

of residence at older ages. Men who lived in a large city in 1900 faced a higher mortality rate

from all acute (infectious, respiratory, and parasitic) causes of death.

          Reduced infectious disease rates and reduced mortality from acute disease explained up

to 73 percent of the increase in 17 year survival rates between the Union Army sample and men first

observed in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 1971-1975. Period effects

accounted for up to 62 percent of the increase in 17 year survival rates and probably depended

upon public health reforms, the increased efficacy of medical care, particularly antibiotics, and

improved overall health making infectious disease less deadly. Early life events explained 12

percent of the rise in survival rates – an underestimate because of unobserved infections early


                                                 23
in life. Occupational shifts from manual to white collar jobs were relatively unimportant in

accounting for any of the increase in survival rates. Occupational shifts were far more important

in explaining declines in disability because of their role in such debilitating chronic conditions as

back problems and arthritis (Costa 2000b).

            The findings imply that our analyses of the costs and benefits of public health programs,

particularly in developing countries, should account not only for the period effect of reduced

infectious disease rates, but also for lifetime cohort effects. They also imply that our forecasts

of future trends in mortality rates need to account for reductions in infectious disease rates.

In the United States those who reached age 55 in 1995 were born when almost 6 percent of

children died before age 1. Those cohorts who will reach age 55 in 2025 were born when only 2

percent of children died before age 1. Although the United States has already seen most of the

benefits of reductions in infectious disease rates, many developing countries are still undergoing

an epidemiological transition and these countries may have much larger elderly populations than

expected.

            What accounts for the 27 percent of the increase in survival rates that was unexplained

by reductions in infectious disease rates and in mortality from acute disease? Probable factors

include the reduced use of salt and smoke as preservatives with the rise of refrigeration, perhaps

the primary explanations for declines in deaths due to stroke; improved dietary and health habits;

and, the increased efficacy of medical care for chronic conditions. Perhaps not coincidentally

older age mortality has declined more sharply since the 1970s when the number of therapies

targetted toward the elderly began to grow rapidly. Future work will use the Union Army dataset

to observe the impact of untreated disease on waiting time until death and provide insights into

the role of the increased efficacy of medical care in reducing mortality rates.

Appendix

Men who entered the Union Army were probably healthier than the population as a whole. An

examination of men who were rejected for military service suggests that mean height for the

population was about 0.18 inches less than the mean of the recruits. Once men entered the

service, rural farmers, who were the better nourished segment of society, were more likely to

die because they lacked immunities to such common camp diseases as measles and typhoid (Lee

1997). However, men who survived the war (regardless of occupation) were only 0.02 inches

shorter than all recruits at enlistment, suggesting that the war itself induced minimal survivorship

selection on the basis of height and hence on early net nutritional status. Increased exposure to

disease probably left men in worse health than when they entered the army, but by age 50 even

men who had grown up in rural areas and had not served had probably been exposed to as many

infectious diseases as veterans because of increased migration. Although little is known about

experience of Union Army veterans from the time they left the service until they appear on the

pension rolls, several tests indicate that this sample is representative of the general population

before the war in terms of wealth and circa 1900 in terms of mortality experience.8




   8
     Among all adult males age 20 and over in the households to which recruits were linked in the 1860 census,
mean wealth was similar to that found in a random sample, suggesting that military service was not very selective
of men of lower socioeconomic status. In fact, 95% of the sample consisted of volunteers. Cohort life expectancies
of veterans who reached age 60 between 1901 and 1910 resemble the cohort life expectancies found in genealogies
and the distribution of deaths from specific causes for all veterans who died between 1905 and 1915 does not differ
significantly from the distribution of expected number of deaths from those causes in the death registration states in
1910 (Costa 1998:197-212).
