                                            ABSTRACT

Much has been written about the seemingly less formal, more agile biotechnology industry and its
extensive interactions with academia and startups, as well as its distinct scientific, manufacturing and
regulatory profile. Employing a data base encompassing all 96 biologics and 212 small molecules
newly launched in the U.S. between 1998Q1 and 2008Q4, we compare their downstream clinical and
commercial characteristics -- therapeutic class concentration, launch delays following approval, Orphan
Drug and priority review status, supplemental indications, black box warning and safety record, and
pricing and revenue growth during the product life cycle. We conclude that the market dynamics of
biologics differ substantially from those of small molecules, although therapeutic class composition
plays a major role.

CHARACTERIZING MARKETS FOR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATIONS:
DO BIOLOGICS DIFFER FROM SMALL MOLECULES?




I.       INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
        The biotechnology therapeutic industry is relatively young, tracing its
creation to science breakthroughs in the 1970s. Cetus was founded in 1971,
Genentech in 1976, and Genzyme in 1981. The first U.S. sales of a major
recombinant therapeutic—human insulin—occurred in 1982. A decade later in
1992 Amgen became the first biotech Fortune 500 company, driven by the sales
of Epogen (epoietin alfa). A decade later, just after the millennium, the human
genome was sequenced leading to an explosion of new companies pursuing novel
therapeutic targets. Today, in the midst of an economic crisis, the biotechnology
industry is retrenching while simultaneously moving forward hundreds of
candidate therapeutic products.

       The biotechnology industry has always been a mix of genetic research
techniques and the resultant biologic products. Therefore defining the industry is
challenging, for the techniques can be used to produce products not thought of as
biologic. Biologic products span industrial, agricultural, food processing and
healthcare markets. In addition, commercial evolution, particularly over the past
decade, has further blurred the biotechnology identity as large biopharmaceutical
companies formerly focused entirely on small molecules now develop and market
both biologic and small molecule drugs, while small ―biotech‖ companies often
use genetic research techniques to create small molecule therapies.

        We focus here on biologic human therapeutic products. These medicines
are produced by living organisms and then isolated by various separation
technologies. Because of their size and complexity, particularly with regard to
their folding and chirality-their ‗handedness‘, these medicines are not made by
chemical synthesis as are small molecules. Sometimes they are made from
extracts of animal blood or tissues. Some blood products to enhance clotting for
hemophiliacs, or avoid clotting for cardiac patients, are made this way as are
some forms of insulin for diabetics. Vaccines are still mostly made by inoculating
chicken eggs and then isolating the antigens after a period of time. This is one
reason rapidly expanding production for pandemics has proven difficult. In
many cases today, however, biologics are made by animal, yeast or bacteria cells
that have had a gene, often a human gene, inserted into them. Using that genetic
blueprint, the cells then use all their other DNA, RNA and protein producing
mechanisms to make the desired product, along with all the other structures,
products and wastes that cells create to live. So not only are biologic therapeutics
(biologics) themselves larger and more complex than traditional small molecule
medicines like aspirin, their production methods are also more complex and
subject to natural, biological variation. Finally, many biologics cannot be taken

CHARACTERIZING MARKETS FOR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATIONS:
DO BIOLOGICS DIFFER FROM SMALL MOLECULES?




orally because the patient‘s digestive track would deconstruct them as a large
protein for food. Thus, biologics must often be injected or infused rather than
swallowed. As a result, biologics are often administered by health care providers
in physician offices or clinics, unlike self-administered tablets and capsules.
Moreover, many biologics are covered by a medical rather than pharmaceutical
benefit in health insurance plans.

        For all these reasons of innate biology, production and dosing approach,
biologics often differ from small molecule medicines in their product
development, regulatory approval, distribution and commercial paths. Thus while
having the same medical goals-to treat disease, small molecule and biologic
therapeutics differ substantially in ways that might affect innovation, safety, costs,
clinical adoption, patient access and pricing. Biologics are now about a third of
the medicines approved. Understanding whether their biological differences
translate into commercial and economic differences is therefore important for
understanding health care economics, effective innovation incentives and
anticipated public health improvements.

        Much has been written about the seemingly less formal, more agile
biotech industry and about its extensive interfaces among academia and startups.
Recently a literature has also developed that compares the costs of developing
biologics vs. small molecules. For example, see Berndt, et al. (2009), Calfee and
Dupre (2006), and DiMasi and Grabowski (2007). Literature also addresses the
time and cost differences across therapeutic classes in bringing new
biopharmaceuticals to market. Among articles addressing this issue, see
Abrantes-Metz et al. (2005, 2008), Adams and Brantner (2006, 2009), Danzon, et
al. (2005), DiMasi et al. (2004), and DiMasi et al. (2003). This literature
demonstrates that biologics and small molecules have reasonably similar costs to
bring to market, though success rates vary at different development phases.

       Within the recent past much attention has also been given to the potential
for generic or biosimilar pathways for biologics that could in principle mimic
what the Hatch-Waxman 1984 legislation did for small molecules. On this, see,
for example, Cacciatore et al. (2008), Grabowski (2008), Grabowski et al. (2006),
Grabowski and Kyle (2008), Grabowski et al. (2007), Hollingshead and Jacoby
(2009), Kotlikoff (2008), Mishra (2009) and U.S. Federal Trade Commission
(2009). With passage of health care reform in 2010, a regulatory pathway for
biosimilar products was created, and biologics were granted a twelve year data
exclusivity, longer than the five years accorded small molecules.

      Over the last year the pace of merger announcements has increased,
combining firms with significant biologics and vaccine portfolios with traditional




Page 2                                               NBER Working Paper w16014
CHARACTERIZING MARKETS FOR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATIONS:
DO BIOLOGICS DIFFER FROM SMALL MOLECULES?




small molecule pharmaceutical companies, such as those between Genentech and
Roche, Schering Plough and Merck, and Wyeth and Pfizer. These combinations
raise issues concerning possible new directions for traditional pharmaceutical
companies. Will these mergers result in the synergies and amplified success their
originators expect or will they result in mismatched organizations such as that
experienced by the integrated financial service companies and life science
conglomerates in the late 1990s?

        Although we build on these various literatures and industry experiences,
our focus here shifts downstream – subsequent to the FDA approving a new
therapeutic. At the level of the individual product, the difference between
biologic and small molecule drugs remains sharp as scientific characterization,
manufacturing process and regulatory reviews have tended to remain substantially
distinct.     It is at this level of individual products, rather than aggregate
organizations, that we focus our attention and examine how the clinical and
market experiences differ depending on whether thet therapeutic is a biologic or a
small molecule.

        We begin our analysis by examining several potential clinical distinctions
between biologics and small molecules that may have substantial commercial
implications. Are the diseases and conditions for which biologics are approved
different from those for small molecules? Is there a sense in which biologics
embody more significant medical innovation than do small molecules? Are there
differences in safety profiles, and rates of product exit? Since biologics are
largely infused or injected, whereas small molecules are most commonly
delivered in oral tablet/capsule form – are there differences in physician specialty
types who prescribe biologics vs. small molecules?

        Having characterized clinical issues such as therapeutic area, innovation,
provider and safety differences and similarities among biologics and small
molecules, we then go on to consider commercial market issues. Over their
product life cycles, do patterns of revenue growth since initial product launch
differ? Do small molecule revenues on average grow more rapidly and to greater
levels than do biologics? In the late stages of the product life cycle shortly before
loss of patent protection, do biologic and small molecule sales revenues and
clinical/payer value (as reflected in real price growth) continue to increase, or do
they tail off?

      We examine these various issues empirically, employing a data base that
encompasses all new biologics and small molecules launched in the U.S. from
1998Q1 though the end of 2008Q4 – an 11 year time frame.

CHARACTERIZING MARKETS FOR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATIONS:
DO BIOLOGICS DIFFER FROM SMALL MOLECULES?




        The outline of our article is as follows. We begin with a definition of what
we consider a biologic vs. a small molecule. We next describe the construction of
a unique, complete, curated and annotated data set derived from a wide variety of
sources that include all 308 new molecular entities (―NMEs‖) launched in the
United States over the eleven year period, and then briefly outline statistical
methods we employ. Next we present results of analyses concerning similarities
and differences in biologic and small molecule product characteristics such as
therapeutic area prevalence, along with various measures of innovation and
safety. We follow up this more clinical discussion with an examination of
comparative commercial experiences, such as real dollar sales, growth and pricing
over the product life cycle. We then discuss our findings in a broader context,
and suggest issues meriting future research. Finally, we summarize findings and
identify limitations of the data and analyses.

II.       DATA SOURCES AND METHODS
         To examine the differences and similarities between biologics and small
molecule products we constructed the TABITHA (Trusheim, Aitken, Berndt
Innovative Therapeutics Historical Archive) database which includes information
from the IMS Health MIDAS database, the FDA, the World Health Organization
and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis for all new molecular entity
therapeutic products launched in the U.S. from 1998Q1 through 2008Q4.1 The
data set was hand curated and subject to multiple cross checking and data
integrity checks as described below. Error! Reference source not found.
illustrates the data sources as well as the data curation and annotation methods we
employed.

         A. DEFINITION: WHAT IS A BIOLOGIC?
       Before describing the data sources and curation steps, we believe it is
important to be clear about distinguishing between biologic and small molecule
medicines. In the introduction we provided a general sense of what makes
biologics unique and how they differ from traditional, small molecule medicines.
For the purposes of this paper, we adopt the specific technical biologic definition
as developed and implemented by IMS Health in its IMS MIDAS information
resource. The definition is intended to yield a set of molecules that are relevant to

    Note that our inclusion and exclusion criteria involve launch date, not FDA approval date.
          Launch date is determined by identifying the first month in which IMS Health observes
          sales in the U.S. market.

market analysis. For a molecule to be defined as a biologic, it must possess the
following characteristics:

 Molecular structure: Specific macromolecules included in the definition are
  proteins, nucleic acids and carbohydrates. Current conventions can refer to a
  collection of molecules as a single entity (e.g., antisera). Only if all the
  components in such a collection are biologic molecules will this collective
  entity be deemed a biologic.
 Molecular identification: Biologic molecules must be clearly identified. Any
  ―molecule‖ where the molecule name is descriptive and the actual
  composition of the molecule is not identified (e.g., vegetable extract) is not
  classified as a biologic.
 Active substance: Biologic molecules must be, or are intended to be, clearly
  defined active therapeutic ingredients embodied within a product.
 Regulatory: Biologic molecules must have undergone (or be undergoing) a
  regulatory human clinical trial program under the auspices of a national or
  regional regulatory authority.

       Those therapeutics which did not meet these criteria remain classified as
small molecule therapeutics.

         B. CORE DATA SET: SALES AND UNIT VOLUMES
        We extracted U.S. sales and unit volume data for all NMEs and novel
biologics launched from 1998-2008, inclusively, from the global IMS MIDAS
database. Generic sales and volumes are not included in this data set, since none
of the products approved since 1998 experienced loss of patent protection by the
end of 2008.

        The IMS MIDAS database provides therapeutic product U.S. market sales
at the ex-manufacturer level, as well as standard unit volume data. We calculate
price as unit value (sales revenues/standard units). Sales revenue values are based
on wholesaler invoice data, and therefore include prompt payment discounts and
chargebacks, but do not include rebates given to non-providers (non-mail order
PBMs, third party payers, HMOs, etc.).

CHARACTERIZING MARKETS FOR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATIONS:
DO BIOLOGICS DIFFER FROM SMALL MOLECULES?




         C. PRODUCT SALES AND VOLUME DATA CURATION
        The core data set was hand curated for data quality and satisfaction of all
selection criteria through a multistage process of selection validation, missing
data screening, derived data creation (such as GDP deflated constant dollar
transformation and relative launch date alignment), and minimal threshold
trimming.

         In terms of selection validation, we initially identified 444 named
therapeutic products as approved or commercially introduced branded products in
the U.S. during, or near the January 1998 – December 2008 time period. A
product was determined as qualifying for inclusion if it met the following primary
criteria:

        1. The product was approved by the FDA or had its first full quarter of
sales between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2008;

         AND EITHER:

        2A. The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)
classified the product‘s Chemical Type as ‗1 New Molecular Entity‘ OR the
product was a new formulation or packaging form of an NME originally
appearing in the qualified period;

         OR

       2B. The FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)
approved the product‘s original (not supplemental) Biological License
Application.

        Of those 444 possible new products, upon further examination we
identified 110 products as new formulations, new manufacturers of previous
products, branded generic introductions, or outside the date range. We removed
these 110 products from the analysis.

        We then identified 26 products that were formulation or packaging
variations by the original manufacturers of the qualified products. Although we
do not consider these as new products, their sales and volumes were added to
those of the originally qualified product to yield total molecule-specific sales and
volume data.

       The 308 remaining distinct new products were included in the analysis for
purposes of product counts.

CHARACTERIZING MARKETS FOR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATIONS:
DO BIOLOGICS DIFFER FROM SMALL MOLECULES?




        Derived Data Creation Part 1: To adjust for general inflation, sales data
for each product were transformed using the Bureau of Economic Analysis‘
quarterly GDP Price Deflator data, with 2005 as the base year. Monthly GDP
deflators were linearly interpolated from quarterly values and were then applied to
the monthly sales data.

        Relative Launch Date Alignment: The monthly core sales and volume
data for each product were aligned on the basis of the first month in which sales
and volume were observed for that product. Several products had an initial
shortened launch followed by a period of low or zero sales, and then a second
sustained launch thereafter. The BiogenIdec product Tysabri is an example of
such a product which was launched, halted and re-launched after a monitoring
system was instituted for surveillance of a particularly concerning adverse
reaction. In such cases, after confirming source data integrity, the initial launch
was ignored and the data were aligned to the first month of the second sustained
launch. Data were aggregated from monthly to quarterly sales and standard unit
volumes. Final quarters with less than three full months of data were truncated
from the data set.

        Missing Data Screening: IMS audits generally cover 99% of the U.S.
market, although this varies on very low volume products, and on those with very
specific distribution patterns. To avoid inappropriate conclusions, some of these
products, particularly products from Genzyme, were excluded from the growth
rate and pricing analysis, but were included in analyses based on product counts.
In addition, products with approval dates in the period but no recorded sales or
intermittent sales or other factors resulting in zero or missing sales were excluded
from the growth rate analyses.

        Derived Data Creation Part 2 -- Sales, Volume and Pricing Growth Rates:
Rolling annual growth rates for sales and standard unit volumes were calculated
for each quarter compared to the prior year‘s same quarter, to facilitate year-over-
year same quarterly growth computations. Therefore the first quarter for growth
rate data is the fifth quarter from launch. Prices were calculated for each product
by dividing sales by standard unit volumes. Price growth was then calculated
using the same methodology as that used for sales and volumes. Some products
possessed less than the minimal five quarters of data required to enter the growth
rate analysis.

        Minimal Threshold Trimming: To avoid misleading results due to erratic
quarterly growth rates caused by small or seasonal products, minimal threshold
rules were implemented based on absolute levels and data continuity. Several
minor products with sales under $50,000 (nominal) per month were deleted from




Page 8                                              NBER Working Paper w16014
CHARACTERIZING MARKETS FOR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATIONS:
DO BIOLOGICS DIFFER FROM SMALL MOLECULES?




the analysis. In addition, products that exited the US market (sales and volume
data ceased prior to 12/31/2008) were examined for clear market cessation. Any
sales and volumes after an initial quarterly sales drop of 90% or more were
subsequently trimmed from the data set as were those quarters, and subsequent
quarters, with sales less than $150,000 (nominal). In addition two seasonal
products with alternating quarters of large and zero sales were trimmed from the
growth rate and pricing analysis data.

          D. ANNOTATION WITH PRODUCT REFERENCE DATA
        In addition to the core data set consisting of each product‘s sales, volume
and price data, each product was further annotated with a broad set of metadata
regarding its product form, therapeutic class, specialist or primary care physician
status, FDA status, FDA review process and number of supplemental approvals.

       Biologic Classification: As discussed above, each product was annotated
as being either a biologic or a non-biologic product. For convenience and ease of
reading, hereafter we refer to non-biologic products as small molecule products
regardless of which FDA office approved them.

        ATC assignment: IMS Health assigns each drug to a therapeutic class
according to the World Health Organization‘s Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical
classification system (ATC).2 The ATC system allocates drugs into different
groups according to the organ or system on which they act and on the basis of
their chemical, pharmacological and therapeutic properties.

        Drugs are classified in groups at five different successively disaggregated
levels. The drugs are divided into main groups (first level), with one
pharmacological/therapeutic subgroup (second level). The third and fourth levels
are chemical/ pharmacological/ therapeutic subgroups and the fifth level is the
chemical substance. The second, third and fourth levels are often used to identify
pharmacological subgroups in cases where that is considered more appropriate
than therapeutic or chemical subgroups. We annotated each product with its one,
two and three digit ATC classification.

        Specialist or Primary Care Status: The IMS specialist (SP) driven and
primary care (PC) driven therapy class segmentation is an assignment of SP or PC
status respectively, based on a review of available data and IMS‘ experts‘ review

CHARACTERIZING MARKETS FOR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATIONS:

of predominant physician type prescribing the drug. Classes where the majority
of prescribing and particularly new and changed prescribing is driven by
specialists or primary care physicians are assigned to one category or the other.
This analysis allows the segmentation of sales data by the type of physician who
most routinely makes the key decisions regarding drug prescriptions within the
class, regardless of whether physician-specific data is available.

       FDA Review Classification: Using FDA website and third party
published information, we annotated each product according to whether it
underwent a priority or standard review process.

        FDA Orphan Status: Each product‘s orphan status at the time of its
original approval was researched and annotated. If supplemental approvals
gained orphan status but the original NDA/BLA did not, for this analysis the
product is not considered an orphan drug.

         Black Box Warning Status: Using information originally provided on the
FDA website as a single table regarding black box warning actions, and after
confirming this action via sampling of our data set, we determined whether over
the life of each product a black box warning status was ever indicated.

        sNDA and sBLA History: Using the IMS Lifecycle R&D Focus, we
identified the number and timing of supplemental approvals for each product.
IMS Lifecycle R&D Focus is a database of all active pipeline products, including
follow-on indications of marketed products. Our analysis was based on the dates
of U.S. approvals of follow-on indications for the products in the core data set.

       E. OTHER DATA
     Aggregate product pipeline data was obtained from the IMS Lifecycle
R&D Focus database.

          F.    STATISTICAL METHODS
        Because we observe the population universe of newly launched products,
rather than a random sample drawn from the population universe, we do not carry
out traditional statistical inference tests. However, we compute a variety of
population means and standard deviations.     Our computations were carried out
in Microsoft Excel, from Office 2002.

       Our commercial analyses focus on sales and price growth rather than on
absolute prices. We calculate such growth rates for each individual product prior
to computing population statistics to obtain important data quality advantages.
Pricing per unit varies substantially among the therapeutic classes, making




Page 10                                           NBER Working Paper w16014
CHARACTERIZING MARKETS FOR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATIONS:
DO BIOLOGICS DIFFER FROM SMALL MOLECULES?




comparisons across classes difficult. Dosing approach such as oral, intravenous
infusion, subcutaneous injection and inhalation also vary widely, making
comparisons of standard units and unit prices difficult across formulations. A
tableted oral drug taken four times a day carries a dramatically different price per
dose than a monthly injection even if the price per patient treatment year is
identical. Moreover, the price per patient treatment year varies among medicines.
In addition, distribution channels and their pricing transparency vary dramatically.
Injectable drugs and oral drugs are often covered under different medical benefit
plan sections with differing patient co-pays, provider incentives and distribution
margins, thereby affecting pricing and demand. In addition, the transparency of
the different channels for injectables, vaccines, infusions and oral drugs differ.
For instance, oral drugs often carry rebates which are not reported to the IMS
Health database. Injectables, particularly those for oncology or which are
hospital-administered, are often obtained at a discount by providers who are then
reimbursed at the higher Average Wholesale Price or Average Sales Price. While
now undergoing more restrictions, such ―Buy and Bill‖ practices were prevalent
during the examined period. Calculating sales growth and price growth for each
product separately self-corrects for reporting biases among these various dosing,
distribution and reimbursement regimens. For this reason we emphasize growth
rates rather than absolute measures. We emphasize average growth rates where
the growth rates themselves are averages of individual product growth rates rather
than a sum of product sales divided by the count of products. While this corrects
for the biases discussed, it also has the effect of not weighting products by their
relative sales-a small product carries as much importance as a large product.
Thus, the reader is cautioned on interpreting the results average growth rate
results.

III.      RESULTS
         A. NUMBER AND COMPOSITION OF NEW PRODUCT LAUNCHES
       Over the 1998-2008 time frame, a total of 308 new biopharmaceuticals
were launched in the U.S. market, averaging 28 per year over the eleven-year time
period. Of these, 212 (69%) were small molecules, and 96 (31%) were biologics.
As shown in Figure and as discussed by numerous others, (See, for example,
Berndt et al., 2006 and U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2004). there is a clear
downward trend in the number of new biopharmaceuticals launched annually.

DO BIOLOGICS DIFFER FROM SMALL MOLECULES?




    Figure 2: Number of Newly Launched New Molecular Entities, Small
                   Molecules and Biologics, 1998-2008




        Table shows that between 1998 and 2003 the mean number of launches
averaged just under 34 per year, and then fell to an average of about 21 annually
between 2004 and 2008—a decline of about 37%. Although the biologics share
of total launches varies considerably across years, over multi-year periods it has
remained remarkably stable – 31% between 1998 and 2003, and 32% from 2004
through 2008. The biologics share was highest in 2008 – 47% (9 of 19 new
approvals), the final year in our investigation.

        Over the entire eleven year period, as shown in Table, the largest number
of new products were launched in the anti-infectives for systemic use therapeutic
class (n=61), antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents (49), alimentary tract
and metabolism (42), and central nervous system (37) classes; together these four
therapeutic classes accounted for 189 of the 308 (61%) new product launches.

        Newly launched biologics have tended, however, to be more concentrated
in select therapeutic classes than have small molecules. Table indicates there are
four therapeutic classes in which ten or more new biologics have been launched:
anti-infectives for systemic use (n=23), antineoplastic and immunomodulating
agents (n=21), alimentary tract and metabolism (n=16) and blood and blood
forming organs (n=16). In comparison, ten or more new small molecules have
been launched in nine of the 15 therapeutic classes. While new small molecule
launches occurred in 14 of 15 therapeutic classes (only systemic hormonal
preparations had no new small molecule product launches), no new biologics
were launched in three classes – genito-urinary systems and sex hormones,
intravenous solutions and antiparasitic products.

       The biologics share of new biopharmaceutical products is highest in the
blood and blood forming organs class at 73% (16 of 22), but is also substantial in
oncology at 43% (antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents, 21/49). By
contrast, small molecules strongly dominate among central nervous system new
product launches (36/37), cardiovascular (20/21), genito-urinary systems and sex
hormones (13/13), respiratory system (11/12) and the ―various other‖ class
(11/12).

        Table 3 documents that biologics are more concentrated than small
molecules. The concentration of new biologics in their top four therapeutic
classes is substantial, accounting for almost 80% of the new biologic launches (76
of the 96 biologics). By contrast the top four small molecule therapeutic classes
contain only 60% of the new small molecule NMEs.

        Nonetheless, the fact that new biologics have been introduced in a wide
variety of therapeutic classes reflects the breadth of their clinical applicability and
suggests that the future composition of new biologics might diffuse more
generally, differing considerably from that observed historically. In this context,
in Figure 3 divides the data set into two periods, 1998-2002 and 2003-2008. In
the latter period biologics are present in three additional therapeutic areas
(nervous system, respiratory system and sensory organs) while losing presence in
the cardiovascular system therapeutic area. Over the period the top four
therapeutic area biologics concentration falls from 83% to 75%. We comment
briefly on pipeline composition later on in this article.

        We now digress briefly to examine in greater detail the four therapeutic
classes in which the most new biologics have been launched. As seen in Figure ,
among the infectious disease class, while new antibacterials and antimycotics
(antifungals) are entirely small molecules (as historically have been all the
penicillins), the antivirals (including AIDs medicines) are a mix of biologics and
small molecules. By contrast, the various immune sera and immunoglobulins
(circulating antibodies) and prophylactic vaccines have no small molecule
analogs, and are therefore entirely comprised of new biologics. Note that over the
1998-2008 timeframe, 14 new vaccines were launched.

      Figure 4: Product Distribution Within ATC J, Infectious Disease




       Figure decomposes the various cancer-related new products into three
subcategories. Among the antineoplastic and endocrine therapy agents, there
have been both substantial new biologics (12/38) and new small molecules
(26/38), reflecting the fact that different mechanisms have been pursued to disrupt
binding at receptor sites; notably, among the new small molecules is Novartis‘

Gleevec (imatinib mesylate) tablet, one of the ―poster children‖ of the new
―personalized medicines‖. For a discussion of targeted, personalized or what we
have called stratified medicines, see Calfee and DuPre (2006), and Trusheim, et
al. (2007). All three new immunostimulants are biologics, as are six of the eight
new immunosuppressive agents.

              Figure 5: Product Distribution Within ATC L, Oncology




       The digestive and metabolic therapeutic class (alimentary tract and
metabolism) includes a wide variety of conditions, as shown in Figure . Among
new products used in treating diabetes, six are biologics and six are small
molecules. A fascinating set of biologics are the monoclonal antibodies which
modulate inflammation. These biologics can manifest their effects in seemingly
disparate conditions, see Reichert (2005) and Reichert and Paquette (2003).
Centocor‘s Remicade (infliximab), for example, while originally approved for
rheumatoid arthritis, is now also approved for Crohn‘s disease (a gastrointestinal
condition), ankylosing spondylitis (a spine and joint illness often also affecting
the eyes and heart, and co-occuring with inflammatory bowel disease),3 psoriatic

arthritis, plaque psoriasis, and ulcerative colitis. 4 Other monoclonal antibody
biologics with a diverse set of FDA indication approvals include Abbott‘s Humira
(adalimumab) and Amgen‘s Enbrel (etanercept).5 It is worth emphasizing here
that although supplementary indication approvals granted by the FDA can
constitute very important and significant innovations, because these FDA
approvals are typically granted subsequent to the initial new Biologics License
Application or New Drug Application approval, they are typically not counted as
―new products‖ when tallying up the number of new product approvals or
launches annually. 6 For discussion of review time to initial NME FDA approval
relative to review time from sNDA/sBLA application to supplemental approval,
see Berndt et al. (2006), Gosse and Nelson (1997), and Gosse et al. (1996). We
comment on supplementary indications for biologics in further detail below.

    In some cases the number of patients affected by a supplementary approval is considerably larger
           than those benefiting from the original indication. For examples and further discussion,
           see Berndt et al. (2006).

        The fourth largest number of new biologics is found in the hematologic
(blood and blood forming organs) class; this is the only class in which new
biologics dominate small molecules (16 of 22). As seen in Figure , of the 13
antithrombic (anticlotting) agents, nine are biologics, and four are small
molecules. Although smaller in absolute numbers, biologics also comprise the
predominant share of new antihemorrhagics (six of seven) – products used to treat
hemophilia and other blood loss conditions. The ―other hematological agents‖
subcategory includes second generation erythropoietin (―epo‖) products, such as
Amgen‘s Aranesp (darbepoietin alfa) used for treatment of anemia.

       Before leaving this section and moving on to discuss the significance of
innovation embodied in new biopharmaceuticals, we comment on relative delays
following FDA approval but before launch of the new product and the initial
recording of sales revenues. There are several sources of launch delays that can
occur following FDA new product approval. First, quite frequently there is
considerable discussion between the FDA and the new biopharmaceutical sponsor
involving the precise wording that will appear on the product label (also
frequently called the product insert).

        Second, occasionally companies experience manufacturing difficulties and
delays in scaling up their production from clinical to commercial levels. Since
manufacturing complexities are generally thought to be more common among
biologics than small molecules, one might conjecture that delays between FDA
approval and actual product launch are likely to be greater for biologics. Finally,
sponsoring companies may need to prepare marketing materials and train sales
representatives for the new product launch, and since date of FDA approval is
uncertain, training sales representatives with material containing approved
labeling may delay the launch date. We quantify the launch delay as the number
of days between FDA product approval and the date at which new product sales
revenues are first observed by IMS Health‘s shipment invoicing data. 7

        Table presents average days delay between FDA approval and first
observed sales, by therapeutic class, separately for biologics and for small
molecules, and then for all new biopharmaceuticals. As seen in the bottom row of
Table , mean days delay for biologics is 58.7, about a week less than the 65.1
mean delay for small molecules. Given the very large standard deviations (above
100), this one week difference is not significant. These apparent similarities in
days delay between biologics and small molecules mask, however, very large
difference within certain therapeutic classes. In class A (alimentary tract and
metabolism), for example, the average delay for biologics is about four months
(128 days), twice that for small molecules (63 days); in class B (blood and blood
forming agents), however, the reverse occurs – for biologics the mean delay is 61
days, less than half that for small molecules (166 days). This striking
heterogeneity is also observed in other therapeutic classes.      Given the small
number of products in each class, the means are often driven by a lengthy delay
by one or two products in the class. This is reflected in the very large standard
deviations in these classes which make the apparent mean differences statistically
insignificant. An understanding of whether the hypothesized causes for delay
occurred, to what extent and in which classes is not suggested by this data and
would require individual investigations of specific cases, which is beyond the
scope of this article. The data do, however, clearly indicate that a wide range of
delays occurs with 56% (172) having a mean delay of a month or less and 13
having a mean delay of more than one year.



7
    When a new product‘s sales revenues are first observed by IMS Health, we set the date to the
         15th of that month. As a result, it is possible for a launch delay to be negative (if, for
         example, the product received FDA approval after the 15th of that month, and sales were
         observed by IMS Health during that month).

DO BIOLOGICS DIFFER FROM SMALL MOLECULES?




          B. INNOVATION: NDAs, BLAs AND SUPPLEMENTAL APPROVALS
        It is difficult if not impossible to quantify reliably, objectively and
unambiguously the extent to which new biopharmaceuticals embody significant
innovation and address unmet medical needs. With that caveat in mind, we
nevertheless examine three metrics that provide some information on the
significance of the biopharmaceutical innovation, and then compare new biologics
and small molecules on these metrics.

        In 1983 the U.S. Congress passed the Orphan Drug Act P. L. 97-414 that
provides market exclusivity, protocol assistance and grant funding in connection
with the development of drugs for rare diseases and conditions. The original
definition of ―rare disease or condition‖ in the Orphan Drug Act was amended in
October 1984 by P.L. 98-551 to add a specific numeric prevalence threshold to
the condition: ―…the term rare disease or condition means any disease or
condition which (a) affects less than 200,000 persons in the U.S. but for which
there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making
available in the U.S. a drug for such disease or condition will be recovered from
sales in the U.S. of such drug.‖ U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2009a). A
sponsor may apply for Orphan Drug designation along with its Biologics License
Application (―BLA‖) or its New Drug Application (―NDA‖), but it can also apply
for Orphan Drug designation as part of a supplementary BLA or NDA for a
previously approved biopharmaceutical.

        As seen in Table , a non-trivial portion, 17% (51 of 308) of all newly
approved biologics and small molecules between 1998 and 2008 were designated
as Orphan Drugs at the time of initial approval. 8 Interestingly, the portion of new
biologics receiving Orphan Drug designation (24%, 23 of 96) was almost twice as
large as that for small molecules (13%, 28 of 212). That one of about every eight
newly approved small molecules treats a rare condition is a testimony to the
beneficial and powerful incentives provided by the Orphan Drug legislation. That
this proportion is almost twice as large at 24% for biologics is surprising and
remarkable.

      A second indicator of the potential significance of the innovation
embodied in a new biopharmaceutical is the review status assigned to the NDA or


8
    We also observe that numerous biologics and small molecules received Orphan Drug designation
          on the supplementary BLA or supplementary NDA applications. We are unaware of any
          studies that have examined and quantified the extent to which, and timing of, Orphan
          Drug designation through the product life cycle of a small molecule or biologic.

BLA by the FDA at the time the application is submitted by the sponsor. In 1992,
under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (―PDUFA‖) legislation, Congress and
the FDA agreed on a two-tier system of review times -- standard review and
priority review. Standard review is applied to a drug that offers at most, only
minor improvement over existing marketed therapies. The 2002 amendments to
PDUFA set a goal that a standard review of an NDA/BLA application be
accomplished within a ten-month time frame. A priority review designation is
given to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment
where no adequate therapy exists. Under the 2002 amendments to PDUFA, the
goal for the FDA completing a priority review is six months, U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (2009b). A substantial portion, but not all Orphan Drug
designations are also given priority review status.

product approvals between 1998 and 2008 were granted priority review status.9
The difference between biologics and small molecules in priority review status
also occurs, but is much smaller than for the Orphan Drug designation.
Specifically, while 44% of biologics were given priority review status, a very
respectable 39% of approved small molecule applications were assigned priority
review.

       Biologics include many novel therapeutics, but they also include insulin
products and vaccines which rarely receive priority reviews. In the bottom of the
middle panel we remove these biologic classes and recalculate the priority review
percentages. Fourteen products are removed, only two of which (both vaccines)
received priority review. This raises the percentage of biologics receiving priority
review to nearly half (40 of 82, or 49%).

       A final metric involving quantification of innovation involves the extent to
which biologics and small molecules secured supplemental indication approvals.
Above we noted that particularly for some of the biologic monoclonal antibodies,
the range of disease/condition approvals eventually received by the sponsor has
been remarkably large.

        In the bottom panel of Table we tabulate the mean number of
supplemental approvals obtained by newly approved biopharmaceutical products
between 1998 and 2008. Over all new products, the mean number of
supplemental approvals is 0.69; for biologics, however, this average at 0.75 is
slightly greater than that for small molecules at 0.66.10

       As shown in Table, when examined by therapeutic area, the gap between
biologics and small molecules is particularly large among the alimentary tract and
metabolism agents, where the mean number of supplemental approvals over 16
biologics is 1.31, about twice the 0.62 for the 26 small molecules. Similarly, for
the blood and blood forming organs class, the mean number of supplemental
approvals for the 16 biologics was 0.88, more than twice the 0.33 for the six small
molecules. On the other hand, among the anti-infectives for systemic use, on

           the FDA, see Dranove and Meltzer (1994).
10
     Initially this mean number of supplemental indications appeared unreasonably small. However,
             a manual check of the R&D Focus data base entries for several biologics and comparison
             with FDA Orange Book approval data revealed no undercounting. We intend to examine
             supplemental approvals more deeply in subsequent research.

average the 38 small molecules had 0.61 supplementary approvals, substantially
more than the 0.35 for biologics. This last disparity may be accounted for by the
fact that the biologics focus on HIV treatment whereas the small molecules
contain a substantial number of general antibiotics and antifungals, thereby
having greater inherent ability to secure multiple indications.

       In summary, on the basis of three distinct indicators of embodied
innovation – Orphan Drug designation, priority review status and mean number of
supplemental approvals, biologics rank higher than small molecules, although
only in the case of Orphan Drug designation is this superiority ranking
substantial.

          C. SAFETY ASPECTS
        Whether biologics or small molecules have differing safety track records
is not obvious a priori. One metric commonly employed by observers is the
extent to which approved products are assigned black box warnings by the FDA,
the most stringent warning the FDA can give without entirely removing the
product from the marketplace.

        In Table we tabulate rates at which newly approved biologics and small
molecules have been required to place black box warnings on their product
labeling by the FDA. As is seen there, over all new biopharmaceuticals, 22% (67
of 308) have placed black box warnings on their label. Moreover, at 26% (25/96)
this proportion is slightly greater for biologics than for small molecules at 20%
(42/212). As noted above, biologics are concentrated in fewer therapeutic areas
than are small molecules. To adjust partially for therapeutic area biases, we also
tabulated the black box warning rates for the top four biologic therapeutic areas.
The biologics rate falls to 25% (19/76) while the small molecule rate remains
relatively stable at 19% (19/98). Again, the proportion of biologics remains
slightly greater than that for small molecules.

       A different safety-related metric involves calculating the proportion of
new biopharmaceuticals that subsequently permanently exited the market. The
exit could be for safety reasons, as was the case for small molecules Bextra and
Vioxx and for the biologic vaccine Rotashield, or for related commercial reasons,
as was the case for GlaxoSmithKline‘s lyme disease vaccine, LymeRx, On this,




       Page 27                                     NBER Working Paper w16014
CHARACTERIZING MARKETS FOR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATIONS:
DO BIOLOGICS DIFFER FROM SMALL MOLECULES?




see Berndt, Denoncourt and Warner (2009). Since reasons for product exit may
be difficult to determine in an objective and replicable manner, we simply
compute the proportion of newly approved products that eventually permanently
exited the marketplace, where exit was determined by the IMS Health‘s data
reporting that product sales revenues, while non-zero earlier, were zero in the
final months of 2008.

       As seen in Table, over all newly approved biopharmaceuticals between
1998 and 2008, 8.8% (27/308) had exited the market by the end of 2008.
Moreover, at 9.4% (20/212) this proportion is slightly greater for small molecules
than the 7.3% (7/96) for biologics. Notably, among vaccines this attrition rate
was particularly high; of the fourteen vaccines approved between 1998 and 2008,
three (Certiva, LymeRx and Rotashield, or 21.4%) eventually exited the market.
Excluding the 14 vaccines from all biologics leaves only 4.9% of non-vaccine
biologics (4/82) exiting the market permanently.

                                     Table 8: Product Exits

        A related safety aspect involves the characteristics of the physician
prescribing the new product. A plausible hypothesis is that biologics are more
complex new medications, whose administration by injection or infusion is more
likely to be carried out at least initially by specialist (―SPs‖) rather than primary
care (―PC‖) physicians.11 However, since vaccines are biologics and are largely
prescribed by PCs, the extent to which biologics are disproportionately prescribed
by SPs is unclear.

      Based on global data, IMS Health classifies physician prescriber type at a
very detailed Anatomical Therapeutic Classification basis.        As seen in

     For related discussion and some recent evidence, see Aitken et al. (2008).




           Page 28                                              NBER Working Paper w16014
CHARACTERIZING MARKETS FOR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATIONS:
DO BIOLOGICS DIFFER FROM SMALL MOLECULES?




        Table, over all new biopharmaceuticals, 46% of newly approved products
are prescribed predominantly by primary care physicians, while 54% are
prescribed predominantly by specialists. There is, however, a substantial
difference in PC/SP prescribing shares between small molecules and biologics.
While PCs predominantly prescribe 53% of the newly approved small molecules,
they are the predominant prescribers of only 32% of the newly launched
biologics. We further observe in the detailed data in the lower panel of the Table
9 that among biologics, the disproportionate SP share is falling slightly, from an
average of 69% 1998-2003 to 65% in 2004-2008. Interestingly, among small
molecules the SP trend is reversed. Specifically, the SP share of predominantly
prescribed new small molecules is increasing, from 46% 1998-2003 to 49% 2004-
2008.

          D. PRODUCT COMMERCIAL EXPERIENCE ANALYSIS
        We now shift to examine the similarities and differences among biologics
and small molecules during their launch phase and subsequent commercial
periods over their product life cycles. We have sales, volume and derived price
(sales / volume) data from products newly launched between 1998 and 2008.
Rather than take a calendar year perspective we aligned each product‘s data
according to its relative time from the quarter of its first observed U.S. revenues.
For those products first sold in the first quarter of 1998, we have up to 44 quarters
of sales revenue data, whereas for those newly approved in 2008, we have at most
four quarters of sales revenue data. Note that no product first launched in the U.S.
during or after 1998Q1 had lost patent protection by the end of our maximum
eleven-year time period, 2008Q4, and therefore there are no generic products in
this product life cycle analysis.

       As Figure illustrates, the time series nature of the launches displays itself
as a monotonically declining number of products in each period as one moves
away from the launch date. We have 299 initial product observations for sales
revenue in the first quarter (Quarter 1), 185 in Quarter 20 and 38 in Quarter 40.
In Quarter 33 the number of biologic products with data falls below 20. Due to
this small number of products, we restrict the following analysis to the periods
from Quarter 1 through Quarter 32.

          E. PRICING OVER THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE
        We now turn to consider several of the economic characteristics
potentially differentiating biologics from small molecules.        The conventional
wisdom regarding pricing of biologics vs. small molecules typically focuses on
very high launch price levels for biologics, particularly those focused on treatment
for cancer, although Gleevec, a small molecule, costs over $25,000 per treatment
episode, 1 On this, see Aitken et al. (2008). It is challenging to compare price
levels between biologics and small molecules – treatment episodes differ in
length, and comparison of treatment costs for episodic vs. chronic conditions is
problematic. Instead of level, we focus on the price growth rate for the same
molecule over time. After launching at an initial price, do prices of biologics
increase less or more rapidly than prices of small molecules?

        Our measure of relative price growth is not without some ambiguity,
however, since for a given molecule the dosage strengths per standard unit can
vary, and change over time. Nonetheless, bearing these caveats in mind, we
compute unweighted arithmetic mean annualized (quarter over previous year‘s
same quarter) growth rates in real prices, over all therapeutic classes, separately
for biologics and small molecules. It is worth stressing that this unweighted mean
annualized growth rate calculation in real prices is quite different from price
indexes computed by, for example, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Producer Price
Index program.12 Results of this calculation are given in Figure .

         The most striking, and to us surprising, finding displayed in Figure is
that over the product life cycle, in most quarters and especially between quarters 9
and 32 (years three through eight), mean real price increases are substantially
larger for small molecules than for biologics.

        We also note that small molecules experience a generally rising rate of
price growth increases from Quarter 9 through Quarter 18 followed by a decline
in rate of price growth from Quarter 19 through Quarter 32.          While biologic
price growth fluctuates from quarter to quarter, no similar trending is obvious.

        This higher price growth phenomenon for small molecules is a most
surprising and intriguing finding, for which we have no obvious explanation.

     For a discussion of price index calculation procedures and their interpretation in the context of
           biopharmaceutical products, see Berndt, Griliches and Rosett [1993].

          F.   SALES REVENUES OVER THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE
        What we are interested in is comparing inflation-adjusted (based on the
Gross Domestic Product implicit deflator) sales revenue data over the up to 32-
quarter product life cycle, separately for biologics and small molecules.

        Bearing the funnel nature of our data set in mind, in Figure we plot the
mean sales from first quarter of observed revenues over all therapeutic classes,
separately for biologics and small molecules. Four findings from Figure are
particularly noteworthy.

         First, both biologics and small molecules initially reach a mean of about
$100 million in GDP deflated real quarterly sales revenues around quarters 21-22,
i.e., after being on the market slightly more than five years. This equal time to
$100 million in mean real sales revenues is a most surprising result, given the
conventional wisdom that biologics predominantly tend to be small-revenue
products.

        Second, although the time to $100 million in quarterly inflation adjusted
sales is very similar for biologics and small molecules, the path by which they
arrive there is very different. As seen in Figure , in the first 3-4 years on the
market, small molecules have greater mean quarterly sales revenues than do
biologics, but around quarters 17-18 this gap begins to decline, and essentially it
is closed by quarters 21-22. While the slope in the sales revenue line for biologics
is relatively constant up through quarters 21-22, for small molecules it is
increasing until about quarters 13-14, and then begins to decline.

       Third, after quarter 25 the mean real sales revenue of both biologics and
small molecules has no distinct trend and is essentially flat.

        Fourth, during quarters 21 through 32, mean sales revenue for biologics is
consistently larger than that for small molecules, although there is considerable
variation in their relative values.

        Another way of viewing the ―rapid start‖ phenomenon for small molecules
and ―late bloomer‖ phenomenon for biologics is by computing mean annualized
growth rates (quarter over same quarter in previous year) in real sales revenues,
rather than real sales revenue levels. The results of such an empirical exercise are
given in Figure . Mean annualized real sales growth rates are plotted on the
vertical axis, whereas quarter since first observed sales revenue is plotted on the
horizontal axis. Up until about quarter 15 the red curve corresponding to small
molecules is above the blue curve corresponding to biologics, but thereafter,
especially after around quarter 25, the blue curve is more often than not above the

red one, indicating greater late product life growth in mean real sales revenues for
biologics than for small molecules.

        The extent to which this differential late in product life cycle growth in
real sales revenues for biologics reflects relative increases in supplemental
indication approvals, lower rates of product exit, and/or the cumulative impacts of
more specialist-intensive prescribing, is unclear, but clearly of great interest, and
worthy of further research.

IV.    DISCUSSION
           A. SUBSTITUTES, DISRUPTIVE ENTRIES OR DIFFERENTIATED
           COMPETITORS?
         Biologics and small molecules are usually considered substantially
different types of products—perhaps as dissimilar from each other as they
themselves are from medical devices. From a scientific, regulatory and
manufacturing perspective this would appear true. Our analyses have shown,
however, that from a commercial perspective, biologics and small molecules
share substantially similar experiences during their first 32 quarters after launch,
while also exhibiting intriguing differences in key commercial behaviors such as
initial adoption and late stage price and sales revenue growth.

        In retrospect, the similarities of commercial experience may not be as
surprising since in many therapeutic areas (but not including vaccines, for
instance), biologics and small molecule therapies are increasingly highly
substitutable products from the perspective of physicians and patients selecting
treatments and payers evaluating reimbursement policies. Understanding these
substitution behaviors and limitations should provide an important forcus for
future investigations. Relaxing the assumption that each product is independent
of the others, and is independent of products launched prior to 1998, might also
provide greater insight into the dynamics of mixing biologics and small molecule
modalities in a given therapeutic indication. Important questions to examine
include: Does the entry of a biologic into a market perform like a disruptive
technology, or does it behave more similarly to a highly substitutable product? Is
there a tipping point within a therapeutic area once biologics achieve a certain
share of the product offerings or overall sales? How do biologics respond when
new small molecules or smaller biologics such as RNAi and peptides enter a
market?

          B. THE PRESENCE OF BIOLOGICS IS EXPANDING
        The analyses demonstrate that while biologic products remain
concentrated in a few therapeutic areas, their presence is expanding and can now
be found at least in small numbers in nearly every large therapeutic class. While
it is too early to call it a trend, nearly half the new products approved in 2008
were biologics.

       An examination of the drug development pipeline indicates that biologics
have the potential to sustain their growth as a larger fraction of future drug
approvals. We queried the IMS R&D Focus database which tracks both biologic
and small molecule therapeutic programs in development. Figure reveals that




       Page 38                                      NBER Working Paper w16014
CHARACTERIZING MARKETS FOR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATIONS:
DO BIOLOGICS DIFFER FROM SMALL MOLECULES?




biologics comprise over 40% of the late stage development pipeline tracked in
IMS R&D Focus. This alone suggests the potential to increase the biologics
fraction of new product launches above their traditional level. Others have found
that biologics have a somewhat higher probability of overall technical and
regulatory success once they reach Phase II clinical trials, see DiMasi and
Grabowski (2007). If this pattern holds in the future, biologics could account for
approximately half of future novel therapeutic approvals in the United States.

       Figure 12: Biologics Percentage of Global Therapeutic Pipeline




          C. OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE NEW BIOLOGICS USE EARLIER?
         We have observed substantial differences between biologics and small
molecules in their initial adoption and later stage continued growth. The slower
initial growth for biologics represents a relative lost opportunity to meet more
patient needs if their adoption in the early quarters could be made similar to small
molecules, and provided it were medically appropriate. Potential actions that
could be envisioned include more effectively identifying and educating physicians
likely to be treating patients who would potentially benefit from the innovative
biologic. However, we also recognize that biologics typically possess patient
inconvenience properties due to infusion and injections that may limit initial
adoption and acceptance relative to that of comparable small molecules.

          D. REIMBURSEMENT APPROACHES DIFFER BOTH EARLY AND LATE
          IN THE PRODUCT CYCLE
        As described above, Figure          displays some intriguingly disparate
commercial behavior between small molecules and biologics. While in this
research we present no evidence explaining the differences, we suggest the
following hypotheses that future work and researchers might explore. First, price
increases may be inversely related to total sales of the product in later periods.
Businesses and payers may manage not only to percentage changes but also to
absolute amounts so that a small increase on a larger sales base for biologics may
result in approximately the same incremental new revenue (profit) as a larger
increase on a lower revenue small molecule product. This hypothesis may hold
true particularly in the later periods when the mean inflation adjusted sales of
biologics are nearly double those of small molecules. Second, pricing may be
related to firm type, data not included in our analysis. Biologics may be more
often marketed by smaller firms focused on research innovation with different
attitudes and expectations regarding pricing than larger pharmaceutical firms that
have more resources to devote to both research and business innovation. Third,
small molecules may be marketed as part of a larger portfolio of products
enabling greater negotiation power, while biologics may be marketed by firms
with smaller or narrower portfolios. Fourth, since approaches to the pricing and
reimbursement of retail-based prescription drugs generally differ from hospital or
clinic-based prescription drugs, the likely skew of biologics toward the latter type
may drive some of the distinctions observed here between small molecules and
biologics. In this context, we note that many biologics are provided as a medical
rather than a drug benefit in health insurance plans, in contrast to most small
molecules that are administered through the drug benefit component. More
detailed research with the current data and augmented with additional information
could begin to address these hypotheses.

          E. EXPERIENCES VARY CONSIDERABLY AMONG THERAPEUTIC
          CLASSES
        We observed substantial heterogeneity in various analyses at the
therapeutic class level. This suggests that therapeutic class dynamics may be as,
if not more, important than therapeutic type in influencing commercial success.
In some classes with large numbers of both biologics and small molecules such as
oncology, dynamics may play out at an individual cancer type level such as
breast, colon, lung, prostate or pancreatic cancer. The emergence of targeted
therapeutics adds a further dimension of potential heterogeneity among the
products.     Since both biologics and small molecules have entered this
‗personalized medicine‘ space it is unclear to what extent product form proves
influential in these markets. However, we observe that many of the most noted




       Page 40                                      NBER Working Paper w16014
CHARACTERIZING MARKETS FOR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATIONS:
DO BIOLOGICS DIFFER FROM SMALL MOLECULES?




targeted therapeutics tend toward the biologic. This suggests that the dominant
factor in influencing commercial experience is not the scientific basis of a product
but rather the dynamics of the therapeutic class in which it is competing and the
basis of its competition.

V.     SUMMARY, LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
        In this research project we have constructed and analyzed a curated,
annotated data set of every new NME product launched in the United States over
the eleven year period from 1998 through 2008. Analyses of that data have
shown that the commercial experiences of biologics and small molecules are
similar in many ways. Many of the apparent mean differences, while suggestive,
possess large standard deviations and so may narrow or even reverse in the future.
Some, however, such as differences in orphan drug designation, mean sales
growth and mean price changes suggest that material differences indeed exist in
the commercial experiences of biologic and small molecule therapeutic products.

       Results at the therapeutic class level appeared substantially more
heterogeneous for the subset of metrics which we examined. Applying these total
U.S. market results to any individual product or therapeutic area should therefore
be done with caution.

       Other limitations of the work include that:

 The post-1998 period examined – while a substantial period of more than a
  decade—excludes some of the most successful biologics (e.g., epoietin alfa,
  brand name Epogen) and small molecules (e.g., atorvastatin, brand name
  Lipitor) on the market during the period and continuing to current time
  periods.
 The sales data is not complete as the reported sales amounts do not include
  rebates given to non-providers (non-mail order PBMs, HMOs, etc.) and
  perhaps other components of net sales; since prices are calculated as revenues
  divided by standard units, the pricing data should be viewed with caution.
 The post-1998 products selected, by definition include many recently
  launched products and so do not portray the full product life cycle. This
  selection approach yields declining numbers of products in the later ‗time
  from launch‘ cohorts, generating small sample variability.
 While 308 products in total were analyzed, many therapeutic class and later
  quarter cohorts may have relatively few observations which make analyses
  more challenging and conclusions more cautious.

 The FDA product information annotations were collected via a targeted
  manual search process and so even with the care taken, it is possible that some
  items were not identified.
 The mean growth in real price calculation over time is not a price index
  similar to that published by the BLS, but is rather an unweighted arithmetic
  mean of annualized percentage price changes.
 The data is for the U.S. market only and does not include the experiences of
  these and other products launched in other world regions during this time
  period. The U.S. market structure is unique in the world and so direct
  extrapolation of these results to other regions may be inappropriate.
 This analysis did not consider what fraction of revenues came from innovative
  therapies nor what fraction of all drug approvals and marketed therapeutics
  are novel, innovative, and targeted at unmet medical needs. By definition,
  these analyses focused on NMEs which each bring a new active ingredient to
  the market.

        While the commercial experiences of biologics may be more similar to
small molecules than have been their scientific, manufacturing and regulatory
paths, the market dynamics of biologics remain unique. With biologics
comprising a substantial, and likely growing, part of the branded market the
dynamics of ever more comingling of the two product types in more therapeutic
areas by biopharmaceutical firms with ever more diverse biologic-small molecule
product portfolios generates a fluid environment – but whether they mix to form a
solution, suspension or oil and water separation, remains to be seen.
