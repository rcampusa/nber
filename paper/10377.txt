Transaction Prices and Managed Care Discounting for Selected Medical
Technologies: A Bargaining Approach

JEL No. I11
                                       ABSTRACT

It is generally assumed that managed care has been successful at capturing discounts from medical
providers, but the implications have been a matter of debate. Critics argue that managed care
organizations attain savings by reducing intensity of services, while others have argued that savings
are ‘real’ and are a consequence of discounts per unit of care. To address this, we obtain separate
transaction prices for hospital episodes (treatment) and for the narrowly defined surgical procedure,
using the example of heart bypass surgery. Both sets of prices were drawn from a database of
insurance claims of self-insured firms that offer a menu of insurance options. We use a Nash-
Bargaining framework to obtain price discounts by type of insurance. Adjusting for product and
patient heterogeneity, the per-procedure prices yield the anticipated pattern of discounts: Relative
to traditional fee for service, point-of-service HMOs exhibited the largest discounts followed by
Preferred-Provider-Organizations (18 and 12 percent, respectively). While reductions in intensity
of services are not directly observable from the data, combining the results from the per-procedure
and per-episode analysis yields a range of intensity reduction of 20-6 percent, with a corresponding
per-unit price discount of 4-18 percent for the entire episode. We conclude that a large share cost
savings by managed care organizations are due to per-unit price reductions.

   I.      Background

   It is generally assumed that managed care has been successful at capturing discounts from

medical providers, but the implications have been a matter of debate. Critics argue that managed

care organizations attain savings by reducing intensity of services, while others have argued that

savings are ‘real’ and are a consequence of discounts per unit of care rather than reduced

intensity. Because medical services tend to be bundled together into episodes of care, separating

out prices and quantities can be difficult. Given available data, past studies focused on an

“average” price for the aggregate hospital, calculated from total revenue divided by the number

of inpatient days or cases (e.g., Melnick et al., 1992; Keeler and Melnick, 1999). Dranove and

Ludwick, (1999) caution that these methods provide approximations of actual prices, and are

subject to measurement error due to unobservable service mix differences. Examining treatment

episodes for acute myocardial infarctions (heart attacks), Cutler, McClellan and Newhouse

(2000) infer that discounts are attained by managed care plans are only partly due to reductions

in intensity. Here, we employ data that enables us to observe transaction prices, i.e., actual

payments borne by the payer and received by the hospital for major procedures on an

“unbundled” basis. Our analysis differs from theirs in several important dimensions. Among

these is the focus on pricing differences between various insurers and employers rather than

differences within a single large insurer; as a consequence, we derive an empirical specification

based on the bargaining framework due to Brooks, Dor and Wong (1997), rather than their

insurer-based model. Moreover, to identify pure unit discounts we focus on the narrowly defined

procedure. Like Cutler et al., we focus on coronary heart disease, a leading cause of death. We

examine a major procedure used to treat this disease, one that is costly and relatively common. In

bypass surgery (more fully, coronary arterial bypass graft, or CABG) healthy segments of artery



                                                                                                    1
are surgically inserted around the diseased arteries. In 2002 about 344,000 CABGs were

performed in the U.S., with expenditures exceeding $21 billion. Other economists have focused

on these procedures to examine market phenomena such as the hospital’s entry decision

(Chernew et al., 2002) or information diffusion (Dranove et al., 2003), yet the pricing decision

was not treated fully.



   II.      Bargaining Model for Pricing

         Hospitals have been willing to grant procedure-specific discounts to various insurers in

return for guaranteed referrals (Anders, 1996, Hilzenrath, 1994). Price negotiations are

conveniently captured in the Nash-bargaining process, in which two players are shown to

maximize a joint objective function defined simply as the product of their net benefit functions.

The resulting outcome is defined by a set of special properties, including symmetry of the two

players. Dor and Watson (1995) use this framework to draw welfare implications in hypothetical

hospital-physician bargaining over joint payments. Binmore, Rubinstein, and Wolinsky (1984)

and Svejnar (1985) proposed a generalized Nash-bargaining model of the form Ω = Uτ(Z) ·V1-τ(Z) ,

where τ denotes relative bargaining power, and U and V are the respective payoff functions of

the two players, which the players maximize jointly. This model is particularly adaptable to

analyses of actual market phenomenon such as wage or price negotiations since it relaxes the

symmetry assumption of the original model, and allows for an empirical representation of

relative bargaining power.

         For “per-procedure” prices, Brooks, Dor and Wong (1997) have shown that under the

assumption of profit maximization and constant economies of the scale the payoff function of the

hospital reduces to U = N(P-Pl), while the payoff function net gain to the self-insured firm from



                                                                                                    2
bargaining is given as V = N(Pm- P), where N = number of insured all of whom are assumed to

require medical care, and Pl and Pm are the disagreement prices of each of the players: Pl is the

lowest price the hospital is willing to accept and Pm is the maximum price the insurer is willing

to pay. Substituting into Ω and solving for P yields the solution

         P – Pl = τ · (Pm –Pl)

Further parameterization of τ can be summarized as τ = τ (Z: H, I, F), where H is vector of

hospital characteristics and its market, I denotes the type of insurance plan and market structure

for the insurer-firm, and F reflects patient heterogeneity. The latter is required since the medical

procedures are complex and cannot be delivered in a uniform fashion. Substituting into the above

and slightly rearranging yields the estimating equation

         P – Pl = β · (Pm –Pl) + Z’ γ ·(Pm –Pl) + D’φ + ε

where D is a vector of state fixed-effects, ε is the disturbance term and β , γ, and φ are equivalent

to coefficients obtained from a restricted least-squares regression. With additional restrictive

assumptions precisely the same price equation can be written when bargaining occurs over

payment per-episode of inpatient care (per hospitalization, or per ‘treatment’ a Cutler et al. refer

to it) rather than over the more narrowly defined procedure price1. Thus, both regressions shown

in Table 2 are specified using the same functional form.



1
    Using E to denote per-episode payment, we can describe the hospital’s payoff as U = E - Em,
where, and EI = the hospital’s disagreement outcome, i.e., the minimum revenue that the
hospital would be willing to accept to treat such a patient. Let the self-insured firm’s payoff
function is V = Em - E, where Em is the maximum expenditure the firm would incur to pay for an
episode of hospitalization for a privately insured patient the relevant market. Players must jointly
select E which maximizes Ω, noting that E is found on the interval Em < E < Em. With the
additional assumption that revenues EI exactly covers the hospital’s average or marginal costs we

                                                                                                       3
      III.      Data and Definitions of Transaction Prices for Hospitals

             To obtain transaction prices we turn to the 1995-1996 MarketScan ‘service-level’ files

that assemble insurance claims from about 80 large U.S. employers that self-insure. We extracted

claims data for hospital admissions for which bypass surgery was the only invasive procedure

performed (see Table 1). We obtained prices under two definitions – for the narrowly defined

procedure (procedure-price) and for the complete hospital case (treatment price), which includes

services performed in conjunction with the main procedure, such as diagnostic tests, laboratory,

and post-operation recovery. For a small subset of cases, price negotiations may have centered

on ‘treatment’. The data also allow us to control for heterogeneity of patients and procedures.

Sample sizes and mean prices are summarized in Table 1. Values for both types of prices are

comparable to values reported in the industry sources. In Brooks et al., disagreement prices were

obtained from an external database, which was available for the analysis herein. Therefore

Disagreement prices were defined as the lowest price and highest price in the MSA conditional

on a given severity for observations from the MSA with >80 observations. Over two-thirds of the

sample came from such MSAs. For observations from smaller MSAs disagreement prices were

based on the minimum or maximum for the entire state. To assure sufficient sample sizes, only

the ten largest states were included.2



      IV.       Data and Definitions of Managed Care

can rewrite Ω as: E – El = τ(Em –E). Optimizing with respect to E yields the analogous
specification as for the per-procedure equation in the text.

                                                                                                      4
       About 60% of all insured individuals in the U.S. receive coverage through employer-

sponsored plans. The rate of self-insurance among employers is surprisingly high: in 1997, 55%

of all insured employees who received employer-sponsored health insurance were enrolled in

self-insured plans. In large firms of 500 or more employees the proportion of insured employees

in self-insured plans was even higher, at 63% (Marquis and Long, 1999). Most self-insured firms

tend to offer only one basic plan to their employees. Under a typical self-insured plan, the firm

provides at-risk coverage to its employees and assumes responsibility for reimbursing providers

directly. A private insurer may be contracted for the limited purpose of processing claims,

receiving compensation for administrative expenses only.

       Rapid increases in HMO premiums coupled with concerns over bureaucratic controls

have led large employers to shun traditional HMOs in favor of newer forms of managed care that

allow employees greater flexibility and choice of providers (Freudenheim, 2000). This is

reflected in the MarketScan data: although ‘closed-form’ HMOs were listed as an option, in

practice no such cases occurred. About half of employees in the data enrolled in traditional fee-

for-services plan. A small number of individuals (about 5%) enrolled in fee-based Major Medical

plans that provide limited coverage for serious illness and high-end medical services only. The

dominant form for managed care is the preferred-provider-organization (PPO), a type of

insurance plan whereby a selected network of providers is contracted to provide medical services

at discounted fees, accounting for a third of all cases in the data. This includes a rare number of

cases (7), which belonged to exclusive-provider organizations (EPOs). EPOs operate similar

networks, but unlike PPOs they do not provide consumers with the option of going outside the

network of providers under a higher copayments.




                                                                                                      5
          About 6% of individuals were enrolled in point-of-service HMOs (POS-HMO). POS-

HMOs resemble traditional HMOs as long as consumers stay within the network: cost-sharing by

patients is minimal, but the ability to choose among providers is also minimal; in addition

patients are assigned a ‘gatekeeper’, usually a family physician or nurse case manager, and are

not able to access specialists directly without the gatekeeper’s referral. However, like PPOs,

POS-HMOs give their members the option of choosing physicians and hospitals outside the

network, in exchange for higher out-of-pocket participation. Hospitals may assume some of the

insurance risk, but this varies across plans.

          The distribution of cases by type of insurer can be gleaned from Table 1. For comparison,

nationwide PPOs were the dominant form of private insurance in 1995 with a market share of

49% compared with 22% for HMOs and only 26% for fee-for-service plans. POS-HMOs

comprised about 3% of the national market, but their market share has grown to 7 percent in

recent years. (HIAA, 2000).



          IV. Supplementary Data Sources

          MarketScan data were augmented with variables describing market structure as predictors

of bargaining power. These included the Herfindahl index for hospitals with cardiac services and

the HMO penetration rate calculated over metropolitan statistical areas3, and the percent of

employees in the county in large firms of 100 employees or more, all with a one-year lag. They

were drawn from the American Hospital Association Annual Surveys, the Area Resource file and

the County Business Practice Pattern file respectively. A supplemental MarketScan file

contained additional variables on hospital teaching and for-profit status. The combined analysis

files mapped to 472 hospitals.



   V.      Bargaining Results and Price Discounts

        Table 2 reports regressions on procedure and treatment prices. Models are qualitatively

similar, although hospital characteristics are significant only in the treatment model. The

significant coefficients of the herfindahl index for hospitals performing heart surgery indicates

that increased concentration in hospital markets leads to higher prices: an increase of this index

from a ‘low’ level of concentration of 0.25 to a high concentration of 0.75 (mean=0.34) implies a

12% increase procedure-price and a 15 increase in treatment-price. The results of greatest

interest are the levels of price discounting associated with the various forms of insurance, as

summarized in Table 3. For comparison, results of three main functional forms are presented:

semi-log, linear (OLS), and restricted OLS for the Nash-bargaining model. While all models

yield qualitatively similar results, our main interest lies with the bargaining model where

transaction-level costs are implicitly differenced out (Brooks et al. 1997). The per-treatment and

per-procedure cases yield the same expected pattern: HMOs exhibit the deepest discounts,

followed by PPOs. Prices for major-medical plans are not significantly different from fee-for-

service and were therefore excluded from Table 3. However, HMO discounts are higher on a

per-treatment basis than on a per-procedure basis (24% and 18% respectively). Since the data

would not allow us to separate out prices and quantities for every additional service delivered in

conjunction with the main surgical procedure, it is not possible to determine the share of the per-

treatment discounts attributable to reductions in service intensity. However, we are able to place

bounds on the intensity factor by making the alternate assumption that the observed per-



                                                                                                     7
treatment discount applied either to the main procedure exclusively or to all other related

services equally. If the observed per-treatment discount applied to the main procedure

exclusively, then the average per unit discount would be 4% and the reduction in intensity would

be 20%. On the other hand if the price applied equally to all procedures, then point of service

HMOs would reap a price cut of 18% and a service reduction of only 6%.4



    VI. Summary and Conclusion

    It is anecdotally known that managed care organizations attempt to lower their costs

internally by providing lower payments to providers. Our analysis suggests that these payments

represent discounts that persist even after adjusting for the underlying patient heterogeneity and

the characteristics of the medical procedure in a given case, for managed care plans offered by

employers. We further find that greater market concentration in hospitals tends to raise prices.

Together these results are consistent with the predictions of the bargaining model. Rather than

focusing solely on the entire episode of care as in an earlier related study by Cutler et al., our

 To illustrate it, suppose there are two procedures (1 and 2) associated with the full treatment.
Let e be expenditures on the treatment. Then e = p1q1 + p2q2, where p1 and p2 are prices and q1
and q2 are quantities. Let x represent the insurance variable (for convenience, we assume it is
continuous; the use of dummy variables to estimate plan effects will not alter the following
point). Differentiate e with respect to x to get
~e = k (~
        p1 + ~
             q1 ) + (1 − k )(~
                             p2 + ~q 2 ).

            p1 = 18 percent. We assume ~   q1 = 0. Based on Table 1 for the fee-for-service group,

analysis focused on transaction prices for the narrowly defined medical procedure. Both studies

conclude that a large share of cost savings by managed care organizations are due to per-unit

price reductions. Our results are especially relevant to the current marketplace, as purchasers

transition out of closed model HMOs into the types of flexible managed care plans that are

observed in our data. However, the extent to which these discounts are passed on to consumers

remains an open question. This limits our ability to comment on the welfare implications of these

price discounts.
