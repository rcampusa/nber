                                            ABSTRACT

Increases in the proportion of the working age population can yield a "demographic dividend" that
enhances the rate of economic growth. We estimate the parameters of an economic growth model
with a cross section of countries over the period 1960 to 1980 and investigate whether the inclusion
of age structure improves the model's forecasts for the period 1980 to 2000. We find that including
age structure improves the forecast, although there is evidence of parameter instability between periods
with an unexplained growth slowdown in the second period. We use the model to generate growth
forecasts for the period 2000 to 2020.

1: Introduction

       During a demographic transition, falling death rates set off a population boom that

continues until fertility rates decline. In addition to its effect on population size, a transition can

have a sizable impact on the age structure of the population. Mortality rate reductions are

initially concentrated among young age groups, triggering a surge in the number of children and

the youth dependency rate. As this “baby boom” generation enters working age, and as falling

fertility rates reduce the total number of children, the ratio of working age population to total

population goes up. This increase reverses when the baby boom cohort ages and the old age

dependency ratio rises.

       Changes in population age structure can have a large impact on economic performance

because labor supply and saving rates vary over the life cycle. Increased longevity may also

boost labor supply and saving rates. In addition, a decline in fertility increases female labor

supply (Bailey, 2006) and the resources available to invest in children’s health and education

(Joshi & Schultz, 2007). Several studies emphasize the role of shifting birth and death rates and

age structure in explaining cross-country variation in economic growth (Bloom & Canning,

2003; Bloom, Canning, & Malaney, 2000; Bloom, Canning, & Sevilla, 2003; Bloom & Freeman,

1988; Bloom & Williamson, 1998; Brander & Dowrick, 1994; Kelley & Schmidt, 1995).

       This paper investigates whether age structure can be used to forecast long-run economic

growth. Such forecasts may be of interest in their own right or in the investigation of other

topics. For example, the problem of forecasting climate change has created a need for long-run

forecasts of economic growth because energy demand is highly income elastic; to be useful,



                                                  3
these economic growth forecasts have to be combined with projections of population, pollution,

and global warming (for example, see Nordhaus & Boyer, 2000). In addition to direct interest in

the forecasts produced by a model, the ability of a model to forecast can serve as a robustness

check, guarding against specification searches that over-fit models to existing data (Clements &

Hendry, 2005).

       To forecast economic growth we adopt a reduced form conditional convergence

framework. Our main variable of interest is the average annual growth rate in real GDP per

capita (“growth” or “economic growth” hereafter). Starting with a structural model we derive a

reduced form in which growth over a period depends on factors at the beginning of the period,

including the initial level of income per capita. We estimate the model on data from the period

1960–1980 and use the estimated coefficients to predict economic growth in the period 1980–

2000. The specification for the growth model is taken from Sala-i-Martin, Doppelhofer, and

Miller (2004) who use Bayesian methods to find the variables with the highest posterior

probabilities (based on the data) of being required in a growth model; we add the log of the

initial ratio of working age to total population ("age structure") as an explanatory variable.

        We show that economic growth models perform well in forecasting growth when

analyzing twenty-year periods; we also show that adding age structure to the growth model

significantly improves forecast accuracy. However, we find that all models tend to predict

higher growth for the period 1980–2000 than actually occurred. This prediction bias is due to a

worldwide slow down in economic growth in the period 1980–2000 not captured by the model.

       There are a variety of approaches to forecasting economic growth. Fully specified

structural models (McKibbin & Wilcoxen, 1998) represent one extreme of the spectrum of

forecasting methodologies. Atheoretical models, where past trends are used to predict future




                                                  4
economic growth, exist at the other extreme (Kraay, 1999). Methods that fall between these

include reduced form models that incorporate a selected subset of contemporaneous and past

characteristics. Short-run forecasts of single-country growth rates using autoregression or vector

autoregression models are common (Brischetto & Voss, 2000; Clements & Hendry, 1998; Fair &

Shiller, 1990; Robertson & Tallman, 1999; Stock & Watson, 1998), but forecasts of cross-

country variation in economic growth have entered the literature only recently (Lee & Mason,

2006; Malmberg & Lindh, 2004; Prskawetz, Kögel, Sanderson, & Scherbov, 2004). Kraay

(1999) compares the forecasting performance of univariate time series models with that of cross-

sectional economic growth models for a panel of countries. For the forecast period 1990–1997,

he finds that the time series model is a better predictor of growth than forecasts based on a

growth model using information from the period 1960–1990, but that the reverse is true for the

forecast period 1980–1997. It appears that time series models may do well forecasting over a

short time horizon, but that the reduced form, conditional convergence growth models perform

better when forecasting over longer time horizons.

       In the next section we discuss the data used and the forecasting method adopted for our

investigation. In section 3 we analyze the forecast performance of the different specifications

and present a formal comparison of the forecasting ability of each model. In section 4 we

present results for our preferred models of absolute and relative growth and decompose the

residual to identify the contributions to forecasting error of noise, parameter instability, and

estimation error. In section 5 we present out-of-sample forecasts of average annual growth rates

over the period 2000–2020. We conclude in section 6 with a summary and discussion.




                                                5
2: Methodology and Data

        Bloom, Canning, and Malaney (2000), Bloom, Canning, and Sevilla (2003), and Bloom

and Canning (2003) emphasize that labor supply and aggregate output are closely tied to the size

of the working age population. In this view, income per capita tends to be higher when the share

of working age people in the population is high. Taking income to be Y and population to be P

we can express income per capita as

                                              Y   Y WA
                                                =                                                  (1)
                                              P WA P

where WA is the number of working age people. We assume that the working age population

measures the workforce, which implies a constant participation rate. In fact, participation is not

constant, with female participation rates varying widely in developing countries and schooling

and early retirement depressing participation rates in developed economies. Taking logs

                                          Y           Y            WA
                                y = log     , z = log    , w = log                                 (2)
                                          P           WA            P


We assume that there is a steady state level of income working age person, z * , given by

z* = β x where the vector x consists of a set of variables that determines steady state income per

working age person. We can express the steady state level of income per capita y * as

                                          y* = z * + w = β x + w                                   (3)

As in Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2003), economic growth occurs as each country converges from

its initial position to its steady state.2 Thus, we can derive

                               Δy = λ ( y * − y−1 ) = λ ( β x + w − y−1 )                          (4)

 This representation of the economic growth equation can be derived from the neoclassical Cobb-Douglas
production function and is used widely in empirical applications aimed to explain cross country differences in
economic growth. See for example Acemoglu & Johnson (2006), Bloom, Canning & Sevilla (2004), Dowrick and
Rogers (2002), Sachs and Warner (1997).


                                                        6
       The steady state determines the long-run equilibrium and economic growth reflects

transitional dynamics. Let us suppose that we can write a structural model for the factors that

affect the long-run equilibrium as

                        x = α1 x−1 + α 2 w + α 3 y, w = γ 1 x + γ 2 w−1 + γ 3 y                 (5)

Then we can derive the reduced form

                          Δy = λ ( y * − y−1 ) = δ1 x−1 + δ 2 w−1 + δ 3 y−1                     (6)


where the reduced form coefficients δ are combinations of the structural coefficients from

equations (4) and (5). The advantage of the reduced form is that all of the variables on the right-

hand side of the equation are measured at the beginning of the growth period under

consideration. Thus, they are plausibly exogenous with respect to growth shocks.

       We estimate an economic growth model of the type set out in equation (6) for the period

1960–1980, and then use the coefficient estimates to forecast economic growth in the period

1980–2000. This prompts consideration of the variables, in addition to the log working age

share w , that should be used to explain economic growth. Many variables have been suggested

as factors that can potentially affect economic growth.                       Rather than propose our own

specification, we use the results of recent work by Sala-i-Martin, Doppelhofer, and Miller (2004)

(henceforth, SDM). They use a large set of potential explanatory variables for economic growth

and calculate the Bayesian posterior probability of each variable being included in the

specification, given a fixed model size. We focus on models with 5, 9, and 16 regressors, in each

case using the variables with the highest posterior rankings as shown in bold in Table 1 below.



Table 1 here: SDM Rankings



                                                       7
       Although the posterior rankings of the variables differ across the 5, 9, and 16 regressor

specifications, smaller models are strict subsets of larger models. The rankings differ across the

different-sized specifications as some variables, like mining, require more “conditioning

variables in order to display its full importance” (Sala-i-Martin et al., 2004, p.831). Our main

variable of interest is the log of the working age share, which our theory above predicts will be

important for economic growth. We assume that the working age population measures the

workforce, which implies a constant participation rate, which as discussed above does not hold in

fact. Age structure has a mechanical effect on income per capita. It may also act a proxy for

other variables, such as work experience. Bloom, Canning, and Sevilla (2004) investigate the

effect of adding detailed data on age structure to a growth model to find if worker age, and work

experience, matter; however, they find little impact. SDM do not include the log of working age

share among their candidate variables, and instead include both the fraction of the population 15

and younger and the fraction of the population over 65. Neither of these variables performs well

according to the SDM selection criteria. Although it would be interesting to know how the log

of the working age share performs in a SDM-type analysis of the variables that best explain past

economic growth, our focus is somewhat different. We ask if the log of the working age share

can help predict future economic growth. We use the SDM analysis only to find a reasonable

specification for the rest of the growth regression.      We show that augmenting the SDM

specification with the log of the working age share improves forecasting ability.

       We examine the ability of SDM models with 5, 9, and 16 regressors to forecast economic

growth and test whether the addition of age structure adds to the models’ forecasting

performances. For variables that do not change over time we use the same data as SDM. Time-




                                                8
varying variables require more attention. SDM examine growth over the period 1960–1996.

Our growth periods are the periods 1960–1980 and 1980–2000, and we use data from 2000 to

forecast future economic growth.3 We measure our time-varying variables at 1960, 1980, and

2000 using the sources cited by SDM, or more up-to-date versions of these sources when

available. Values for real gross domestic product per capita, investment prices, and government

consumption share are from the Penn World Tables 6.2 (Heston, Summers, & Aten, 2006).

Educational attainment data are from Barro and Lee (2000), and data on life expectancy are from

the United Nations World Population Prospects (United Nations, 2004). We restrict our analysis

of the period 1960–2000 to those countries where all series of interest are available for the full

sample period, resulting in a balanced panel of 67 countries; we provide forecasts for the period

2000–2020 for all countries that have data for the year 2000. A full description of the variables

is included in the appendix. Summary statistics are provided in Table 2 and the correlation

matrix is displayed in Table 3 below.

3: Empirical Results

         We start our empirical analysis by estimating each of the SDM models in the period

1960–1980 based on explanatory variables from 1960. Using the estimated coefficients, we then


3
  Later we also undertake a pooled regression using a 10-year panel for 1960–1990 to forecast 1990–2000. This time
split also yields the same key result: the addition of the log of the working age share improves the forecast ability of
the model over specifications that only include the SDM-ranked variables. See Tables 12 and 13 for the forecast
error measure summary of this sample split.


                                                           9
forecast growth rates for the period 1980–2000 based on data from 1980 and the time invariant

variables. We compare the forecasts with the actual growth rates over the period. We estimate

five growth models. Our first two models provide a baseline: we start with a naive model where

we use growth in each country over the period 1960–1980 as the forecast for the period 1980–

2000. The second baseline model uses average growth across countries in the period 1960–1980

(SDM0) as the forecast for all countries in the period 1980–2000. We then estimate three

reduced form models, with 5 (SDM5), 9 (SDM9), and 16 (SDM16) explanatory variables

respectively. In each case the variables are shown in bold in Table 1.

       Table 4 shows the results for the SDM specifications without the age structure variable.

Column 1 of Table 4 shows the results using a country’s growth for the period 1960–1980 as a

forecast for the period 1980–2000.      Column 2 of Table 4 provides details of the forecast

performance of a model in which growth during the period 1960–1980 depends on a constant

only. Columns 3, 4, and 5 show the results for the larger growth model specifications. Each

model is estimated using data from a sample of 67 countries for the period 1960–1980, with the

degrees of freedom declining as the number of explanatory variables increases. As expected, the

R2 in the estimation period (1960–1980) increases as the number of explanatory variables

increases, rising from zero (with a constant only) to 0.66 with 16 additional regressors.

However, the SDM9 model has the largest adjusted R2, which indicates that the additional

variables in SDM16 do not significantly improve the fit.

       We use each of the models estimated over the period 1960–1980 to produce forecasts for

the period 1980–2000. There is a debate as to the best measure for assessing the goodness of fit

of forecasts (Ahlburg, 1992; Armstrong & Collopy, 1992; Clements & Hendry, 1998; Fair &

Shiller, 1990; Fildes, 1992; Hendry & Hubrich, 2006; Hyndman & Koehler, 2005). We assess

(MAE), Geometric Mean Relative Absolute Error (GMRAE), the Arithmetic Mean Relative

Absolute Error (AMRAE), and the Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE). These measures are

calculated as follows

                                                                                       j




where Δy j is the actual growth rate in country j, Δyˆ j is our forecast growth rate, Δy*j is a naive

forecast, and N is the number of countries. RMSE is the natural forecasting counterpart to

minimizing the residual sum of squares in fitting the model in the first period. However RMSE

is very sensitive to outliers and the mean absolute error (MAE) may be a more robust measure.

These measures have been criticized for being dependent on the unit of measurement. This is

mitigated in our case by noting that the growth rate at time t can be written as Δyt = log( yt / yt −1 )

and is therefore invariant to the scale used to measure income per capita. In addition, the

percentage-error measures proposed to overcome scale dependence are very sensitive to errors

when the actual outcome is close to zero, which occurs frequently in our data.

        Another approach to measuring the accuracy of forecasts is to compare the goodness of

fit of the forecasts relative to the performance of a baseline naive forecast. This gives us the


                                                                    11
relative forecast measures GMRAE and AMRAE.                These measures are averages (either

geometric or arithmetic) of each forecast error relative to the naive forecast. Note that these

averages can become very large if the naive model predicts one observation almost exactly

because it creates a number close to zero in the denominator. Our final measure is MASE, which

scales our forecast error by the average forecast error in the naive model and has a natural

metric: zero is perfect forecasting, less than one improves over the naive model, and greater than

one is worse than the naive model. For the naive forecast we use the simple extrapolation of the

last period’s growth rate for the country reported in column 1 of Table 4.

       As shown in the middle section of the table, the forecasts of the model SDM5 with 5

explanatory variables outperforms the simple lagged forecast and constant forecast models on

most criteria. The only criterion on which it fails is AMRAE, where the lagged growth rate

appears to be a better forecast. This is because the naive forecast, lagged growth, is almost

exactly right for Chile. This produces a very large error relative to the lagged forecast for all our

other models, which dominates the arithmetic average. In what follows we focus on RMSE,

MAE, and MASE as our preferred measures of forecast error to avoid this problem. Note that

forecast performance on all measures worsens relative to SDM5 as further covariates are

included in SMD9 and SDM16.

       We use three tests of model adequacy. The first is bias: we test whether the average

forecast error is different from zero. In our sample, the average annual growth rate fell from 2.7

percent during the period 1960–1980 to 1.3 percent during the period 1980–2000. None of our

forecasting models predicts this slowdown. Our preferred forecasting model SDM5, has a bias

of -1.1 percent per year, which is significant even at the one percent level.




                                                 12
          The predictive efficiency test checks whether the slope of the relationship between

predicted and actual growth is significantly different from one. Failure of this test would suggest

that forecasts are systematically biased even when controlling for changes in the global

macroeconomic environment. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that the estimated slope

coefficient equals one for any SDM model. We do find a coefficient significantly less than one

for lagged growth. This suggests lagged growth contains both a permanent component that is

predictive, and a temporary component that does not help forecast.

          The serial correlation test looks for a correlation between the residuals from the 1960–

1980 growth regression and the 1980–2000 forecast errors. A significant correlation would

suggest that the growth residuals from the period 1960–1980, which could be known in 1980,

would be useful in constructing forecasts, although our forecasting model does not use them.

One potential explanation for positive serial correlation is the presence of omitted variables that

affect economic growth but are fixed in each country over time. The presence of such fixed

effects could be addressed by the use of panel data forecasting methods as discussed in Baltagi

(2006).     For the naive SDM0 (constant only), we reject the null hypothesis of no serial

correlation, indicating that a country’s relative growth rate over the period 1960–1980 has

predictive power for the period 1980–2000.4 However, for each of the models with some

explanatory variables (SDM5, SDM9 and SDM16), we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no

serial correlation, indicating model adequacy with respect to this criterion.



Table 4 here: Absolute Growth SDM Only




4
 Easterly et al. (1993) find little correlation between growth rates at 5 year intervals. For longer time intervals,
however, correlations between successive periods’ growth rates are higher.


                                                           13
       To test the forecasting performance of age structure compared with that of the basic SDM

specifications, we repeat the previous regressions with the addition of the log of the working age

(aged 15–64) share of the total population, w. The results are summarized in Table 5 below.

Although there is little improvement in the fit of the regression in the period 1960–1980, the

inclusion of the working age share improves forecasting accuracy on a number of measures. In

our best performing model, SDM5, adding the log working age share improves the RMSE,

MAE, and MASE measures of forecast accuracy.



Table 5 here: Absolute Growth SDM plus Demographics



       We test if this improvement in RMSE forecasting ability is statistically significant; the

results are shown in Table 6. We use the methodology suggested by (West, 2006). If we have

both the estimated gain in RMSE and the statistical distribution of the estimated gain under the

null due to sampling error, we can test the null hypothesis that the expected gain in average

squared forecast error is zero. Given the small sample size, we bootstrap the standard error to

calculate the critical values for this test.     We use 500 repetitions of the non-parametric

bootstrapping method with replacement to generate corresponding sampling distributions. Each

cell of Table 6 shows the average gain in RMSE when enlarging the model, and the p-value for a

test of the null hypothesis of zero gain. The test is one tailed, so that we reject only if there is a

significant increase in forecasting ability. Including age structure significantly improves the

RMSE in specifications SDM0, SDM5, and SDM9, although not in SDM16. Most important,

adding age structure significantly improves the SDM5 specification, our preferred model for

forecasting without age structure.

Table 6 here: Nested Model Comparison for Absolute Growth Models



Figure 1 here: Absolute Growth 1980–2000: Predicted and Actual



       Figure 1 shows the actual growth rates for the period 1980–2000 and our forecasts using

SDM5 and the log working age share. Figure 1 shows that actual outcomes are systematically

below the forecasts, which is in line with the prediction bias reported in Tables 4 and 5. Growth

slowed around the world in the period 1980–2000 and our model fails to predict this. The failure

of cross-country growth models to predict the worldwide slowdown is not surprising. Such

models explain relative growth rates in a cross section of countries using country-specific

characteristics, while changes in the world growth rate over time are likely to be due to

worldwide shocks. For example, Hamilton (2003) examines the effect of oil price shocks on

macroeconomic performance and Easterly (2001) links the slow growth in the developing

countries after 1980 to slow growth in the developed world and high world interest rates. Cross-

country growth models lack these worldwide time series variables.

       To avoid this problem we consider a forecast of relative economic growth. This shifts the

question from how fast each country will grow to how fast it will grow relative to the world

average; cross-country growth models seem better suited to this second question. We de-mean

each variable by subtracting the sample mean for that period. We use regression analysis to fit

relative growth rates over the period 1960–1980 using the de-meaned explanatory variables from

the same period. Accordingly, we take de-meaned variables from 1980 to forecast relative

growth over the period 1980–2000. This approach allows for a period-specific intercept that

changes arbitrarily between periods.     We leave open the question of what causes these




                                               15
worldwide changes to growth rates. The results for relative growth forecasts with and without

age structure are summarized in Tables 7 and 8 below.



Table 7 here: Relative Growth Without Demographics



       All the models shown in Table 7 perform better in predicting relative growth than in

predicting absolute growth, and the bias of the forecast is now zero by construction. The

hypotheses of model adequacy, prediction efficiency, and lack of serial correlation cannot be

rejected for any of the models that contain at least the SDM5 set of variables. In terms of

RMSE, MAE, and MASE, our preferred model is now SDM9.

       Table 8 reports the results of the same relative growth regressions with the addition of

age structure. Adding age structure lowers the RSME, MAE, and MASE of the forecast in every

case. As shown in Table 9, these improvements in RMSE forecast accuracy are significant for

the SDM0, SDM5, and SDM9 models. Overall, the best performing forecasting model for

relative growth is SDM9 plus age structure. This model displays prediction efficiency and lack

of serial correlation and has the lowest RMSE among all our models.

The actual and predicted values for relative growth using SDM9 + w are plotted in Figure 2. The

plotted points tend to lie along the 45-degree line, showing prediction efficiency and no bias.

4: Error Decomposition

       Although the predictions of our two preferred models (SDM5 + w for absolute growth

and SDM9 + w for relative growth) appear to satisfy our model adequacy criteria, the average

errors are considerable: the RMSE are 1.1 percent and 1.7 percent for relative and absolute

growth forecasts, respectively. From a theoretical viewpoint, assuming the data-generating

process is correctly specified, three main factors contribute to forecasting errors: random noise in

the data-generating process, parameter instability between the estimation and forecast period,

and imprecision in the coefficient estimation. Provided there is no covariance between these

sources of error we can decompose the variance of the growth forecasts as follows
                       )                                                                 )
              V (Δy1 − β 0 x1 ) = V (Δy1 − β1 x1 ) + V ( β1 x1 − β 0 x1 ) + V ( β 0 x1 − β 0 x1 )   (10)

where we make a forecast in period 1 based on estimates from period 0. The first term on the

right-hand side of equation (10) is random noise, the second is the effect of parameter instability

over time, and the third is the effect of estimation error. We can estimate the size of the first two

error components by replacing the unknown parameter vectors β 0 and β1 with their estimated

values based on regressions for the two sub-periods. The third error component can be

calculated using the estimated variance-covariance matrix of the first period coefficient

estimates.

       We can further decompose the first term, the forecast variance due to random noise, into

two parts: the expected noise based on the variance of the noise in the first period, and the

change in the variance of the noise term between the two periods.




                                                           17
         Table 10 below shows the contribution of each of these factors to the actual RMSE

forecast error of our two preferred models. The mean squared error in annual average percentage

growth rate over the sample period is 1.71 percent for the absolute growth forecast based on the

SDM5 + w model, and 1.26 percent for the relative growth forecast based on the SDM9 + w

model.     For both models, random noise accounts for roughly half of the forecast error.

According to our estimates, total random noise slightly decreases in the second period for the

absolute growth variable, but remains fairly steady for relative growth.



Table 10 here: Error Decomposition



         The effect of imprecise parameter estimates in the first period is very small, accounting

for less than 3 percent of total variance. The most important source of forecast error when

forecasting absolute growth rates is parameter instability across the two periods. However, for

relative growth the parameter instability effect is substantially smaller. This indicates that in the

absolute growth model parameter instability is largely due to a shift in the intercept across

periods.

         Table 11 shows the estimated coefficients of our preferred models for the two sub-

samples (1960–1980 and 1980–2000), as well as for the full (pooled) sample for the period

1960–2000. An F-test of parameter stability rejects the null that the parameters are the same in

both sub-periods for both the relative and absolute growth models. For absolute growth, Wald

tests for each variable reject parameter equality between the two sub-periods at the 5 percent

significance level only for the intercept and the log of the working age share of the population.

In the case of relative growth, we reject parameter equality over the two periods only for the log

of the working age share.


                                                 18
       Our age structure variable, the log of the working age proportion of the population, has a

small, statistically insignificant coefficient in the 1960–1980 estimation period, and a much

larger coefficient in the forecast period. It would have been difficult to justify putting age

structure into the model based on the 1960–1980 estimation. Ex post, we would have liked to

increase the estimated parameter tenfold for forecasting purposes although, as shown, even the

small estimated coefficient significantly improves the forecast. Our argument for including age

structure was primarily theoretical, suggesting that theoretical as well as “goodness of fit”

arguments should be considered in the construction of forecasting models.



Table 11 here: Coefficient Estimates in Sub-Samples



       We have focused on 20-year periods for both estimation and forecasts. In Tables 12 and

13 we report forecasts of the relative growth model based on estimating for three 10-year time

periods between 1960 and 1990 and using these estimates to forecast for the period 1990–2000.

As before our preferred model in Table 12 is SDM9, which outperforms the other models in

terms of MAE and MASE (though SDM16 performs best in terms of RMSE).

       We now use our preferred models to forecast future economic growth. Given the twenty-

year horizon used in our analysis, the natural forecast period is 2000–2020. To generate these



                                              19
forecasts, we use estimates from our preferred models of absolute (SDM5 + w) and relative

(SDM9 + w) growth over the pooled sample combining observations from the period 1960–1980

and the period 1980-2000. We then use the year 2000 values of the relevant explanatory

variables to forecast future growth. We forecast growth for all countries that have the relevant

data for 2000, even if they are not in the sample for the period 1960–2000. Table 14 displays the

growth rate for each country over the period 1980–2000 and both our absolute and relative

growth forecasts for the period 2000–2020. The absolute growth model predicts growth of 2.05

percent per year on average, and the model predicts positive growth rates for all countries. The

countries we expect to fare best in terms of absolute growth are China, South Korea, and the

Philippines5 (all of which are classified as East Asian by Sala-i-Martin et al. (2004)), with

forecasted average growth rates above 4.5 percent. The lowest growth rate is predicted for Mali,

followed by Guatemala and Niger.

         Table 14 also shows our forecasts for relative growth. These forecasts are based on a

larger model (9 variables from SDM rather than 5 as in the absolute growth forecast) and make

no prediction on the world average growth rate over the period 2000–2020, which may be wise

given the past volatility of average growth. The ranking for the top three countries, China, South

Korea, and the Philippines stays the same. However the countries that have the worst forecast

when turning to relative growth are South Africa, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. This change results

from the inclusion of life expectancy in the SDM9 model we use for forecasting relative

economic growth. The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa has substantially reduced life

expectancy in these countries; their low life expectancies in 2000 lead to predictions of slow

economic growth in most of Sub-Saharan Africa over the next twenty years.

5
 The high primary school enrollment in the Philippines, in addition to being classified as an East Asian country,
gives this country a high predicted growth rate. India, on the other hand, might be expected to perform well over the
next two decades, but has very low primary school enrollment and is not classified as East Asian.

6: Conclusion

       By looking at forecasts of growth over the period 1980–2000 based on data from the

period 1960–1980, we are able to evaluate the forecasting ability of cross-sectional growth

models. We show that such models do have forecasting power, though larger growth models do

not necessarily perform better than smaller models in forecasting future economic growth. We

also show that the addition of age structure significantly improves the forecasts. Much of the

forecast error is due to parameter instability between periods. In particular, there is a downward

shift of the intercept term in the period 1980–2000, which causes actual outcomes to lie below

forecast growth on average.     Changing the focus to forecasting relative economic growth

(relative to the world average) improves the forecast considerably and removes this bias. We

provide forecasts of economic growth for a cross section of countries for the period 2000–2020

to allow ex post validation of our model.

       Future studies of models for forecasting economic growth should consider how to

combine the cross-section approach used in this paper with time series methods that can forecast

movements in world growth rates over time. This will require exploitation of the full panel-

series nature of the data. The nature of parameter instability should also be investigated, to

determine whether it reflects shifting parameters or is a symptom of deeper mis-specification.

Time-Variant Variables

Investment Price       PPP over investment / exchange rate in Current Prices. Current prices are for the
                       year 2000. Investment price in Uganda in 1980 is recorded as 1738.41, which
                       features as an outlier in that country series and affects the final results. We replace
                       the 1980 price of investment in Uganda with the 1981 price of investment to
                       address the outlier problem. Source: Heston et al. (2006)
Government             We calculate the real government share of GDP using three series from the
Consumption Share      PWT6.2 Current Government Share of GDP multiplied by the ratio of the price of
                       government share of GDP and the price of GDP (cg*pg/p). We choose not to use
                       the PWT6.2 Real Government Share of GDP as these series are imputed from the
                       current year, 2000, by multiplying the base year with the real growth rates of the
                       corresponding item of the national accounts. A further note on the PWT6.2 data
                       construction is that each price level has its own PPP measure, so the PPP over
                       government consumption, we denote as PPP(g), will differ from that over GDP,
                       PPP. As a result, the nominal government share, cg, is not a perfect measure of the
                       government consumption share as the numerator and denominator PPP will differ
                       given, cg = (G/PPP(g))/(GDP/PPP). By using our calculation we have the true
                       share of government consumption to GDP, G/GDP = cg*(pg/p) =
                       G/PPP(g))/(GDP/PPP)*((PPP(g)/XRAT)/PPP/XRAT)).
                       Thus we account for the different PPP measures used for GDP and government
                       consumption. Source: Heston et al. (2006), own calculations
Log(GDP)               As described the PWT6.2 Appendix, “RGDPL is obtained by adding up
                       consumption, investment, government and exports, and subtracting imports in any
                       given year…It is a fixed base index where the reference year is 2000, hence the
                       designation "L" for Laspeyeres.” Source: Heston et al. (2006)
Primary Schooling      Primary schooling in the initial periods (1960, 1980, 2000) is the proportion of the
                       population older than 15 who has at least some primary schooling. This data series
                       is generated by subtracting the proportion that has no schooling from the full
                       population. Source: Barro & Lee (2000)
