1. Introduction

A classic question in international macroeconomics is whether fluctuations in the
real exchange rate (RERcpi ) constructed using the consumer price index (CPI)
are primarily associated with movements in the relative price of tradable goods
across countries or with fluctuations in the relative price of nontradable to trad-
able goods. Engel (1999) and Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2002) conclude that
fluctuations in the real exchange rates of developed economies are almost exclu-
sively driven by changes in the relative price of tradable goods across countries.
Their evidence suggests it is not important to distinguish between tradable and
nontradable goods to understand cyclical real exchange rate fluctuations.
   We argue that fluctuations in the relative price of nontradable to tradable
goods are an important source of RERcpi movements. We use an approach pro-
posed by Engel (1999) and decompose the variance of RERcpi into the variance of
the relative price of tradable goods across countries, the variance in the relative
price of nontradable to tradable goods, and a covariance term. To implement
this decomposition we must take a stand on how to measure prices of tradable
goods. A standard approach in the literature is to use retail prices. Unfortunately,
retail prices are heavily contaminated by the cost of nontradable distribution ser-
vices such as retailing, wholesaling, and transportation (see Burstein, Neves, and
Rebelo (2003)). One approach to dealing with the distribution cost issue is to
measure tradable goods’ prices using the producer price index (PPI). However, a
problem with the PPI is that it generally excludes import prices (IMF(2004)) and,
for roughly one third of OECD countries, it also excludes export prices (Maitland-
Smith (2000)). For this reason, we focus on the prices of pure-traded goods at
the dock, i.e. the price of goods that are actually traded exclusive of distribu-




                                         1
tion costs.1 We measure the relative prices of pure-traded goods across countries
using a weighted average of import and export price indices. We use quarterly
data for 11 OECD countries for the period 1971 to 2002. We find that, for the
median country, variations in the price of nontradable goods relative to the price
of pure-traded goods account for over half the movements in RERcpi .2
       This finding depends critically on our measure of the price of tradable goods.
To substantiate this statement we use U.S. data to decompose the variance of
RERcpi using two alternative measures of the price of tradable goods: the retail
price of tradable goods and a weighted average of import and export prices. The
first price measure implies that the relative price of nontradable to tradable goods
accounts for virtually none of the variance of RERcpi . In sharp contrast, the
second price measure implies that the relative price of nontradable to tradable
goods accounts for at least 55 percent of the variance of RERcpi . Using the retail
price of tradable goods leads one to overstate the fraction of cyclical RERcpi
fluctuations that are due to changes in the price of pure-traded goods across
countries.
       Viewed overall, our results suggest that a successful theory of real exchange
rate fluctuations must incorporate changes across countries in the relative price of
nontradable goods to pure-traded goods. At the same time, our results are con-
sistent with the view that there are significant fluctuations in the relative price of
pure-traded goods across countries. These fluctuations could reflect a variety of
factors such as sticky prices and endogenous changes in real markups. In addi-
   1
     In addition to including distribution costs, CPI-based retail prices diﬀer from import and
export prices because the former includes “local goods.” These are goods that are produced
solely for the domestic market and are not traded.
   2
     Betts and Kehoe (2005) argue that movements in nontraded goods prices are important in
explaining real exchange rate fluctuations. Their analysis is based on real exchange rates con-
structed using gross output deflators. These deflators are available only at an annual frequency,
and they do not include the price of imported final goods.

tion, diﬀerent countries import and export diﬀerent baskets of goods. Therefore,
changes in the relative price of these goods lead to changes in the relative price of
traded baskets and in the measured real exchange rate. Assessing the plausibility
of these alternative hypotheses is an important objective of ongoing research.
   The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the
method that we use to decompose RERcpi movements. We report our empirical
results in Section 3. Section 4 concludes.

2. Decomposing Real Exchange Rate Fluctuations

We define the CPI-based real exchange rate as:
                                               Pt
                                 RERtcpi =           .                          (2.1)
                                              St Pt∗
Here St denotes the geometric-trade-weighted nominal exchange rate of the home
country defined as units of local currency per unit of geometric-trade-weighted
foreign currency. The variables Pt and Pt∗ denote the level of the CPI in the home
country and the geometric-trade-weighted CPI of foreign countries, respectively.
   To implement Engel’s (1999) approach, we assume that Pt is computed as a
geometric average of the price of tradable goods (PtT ) and the price of nontradable
(PtN ) goods:
                               Pt = (PtT )1−ω (PtN )ω .

Similarly, we assume that the foreign CPI is given by:
                                              ∗           ∗
                             Pt∗ = (PtT ∗ )1−ω (PtN∗ )ω ,

where PtT ∗ and PtN∗ denote the foreign price of tradable and nontradable goods,
respectively. The variables ω and ω ∗ represent the share of tradable goods in the
domestic and foreign CPI baskets.


                                          3
   We denote the logarithm of RERtcpi , RERtT , and RERtN by rertcpi , rertT , and
rertN , respectively. We decompose rertcpi as:


                                   rertcpi = rertT + rertN .                               (2.2)

The first component, rertT , is an index of the extent to which the price of tradable
goods is diﬀerent across countries:


                                rertT = log[PtT /(St PtT ∗ )].

The second component, rertN , reflects the between-country diﬀerence of the rela-
tive price of nontradable goods to tradable goods:

                    rertN = ω log(PtN /PtT ) − ω∗ log(PtN∗ /PtT ∗ ).

Using (2.2) we can decompose the variance of rertcpi as:


            var(rertcpi ) = var(rertT ) + var(rertN ) + 2cov(rertT , rertN ).              (2.3)

   We construct empirical measures of rertcpi and rertT and compute rertN as a
residual, using the identity (2.2). We estimate the individual elements of equa-
tion (2.3). We compute a lower bound, LN , on the importance of movements in
rertN by attributing the covariance term to fluctuations in the price of tradable
(nontradable) goods when the estimated covariance is positive (negative):

                   ⎧
                   ⎨               var(rertN )               if cov(rertT , rertN ) > 0,
                                  var(rertcpi )
         LN =          var(rertN )     2cov(rertT ,rertN )                                 (2.4)
                   ⎩          cpi +
                       var(rert )         var(rertcpi )      if cov(rertT , rertN ) < 0.

We compute an upper bound, U N , on the importance of movements in rerN by at-
tributing the estimated covariance term to fluctuations in the price of nontradable
(tradable) goods when the estimated covariance is positive (negative):

                                                  4
                        ⎧
                        ⎨   var(rertN )
                                          + 2cov(rer
                                                      T      N
                                                      t ,rert )   if cov(rertT , rertN ) > 0,
                N           var(rertcpi )       var(rertcpi )
            U       =                    var(rertN )                                            (2.5)
                        ⎩
                                        var(rertcpi )             if cov(rertT , rertN ) < 0.


       A key empirical question in implementing (2.2) is: how should we measure
PtT ? The most common approach in the literature is to measure PtT using CPI-
based retail prices of tradable goods. In contrast, we measure the price of tradable
goods using the price of pure-traded goods at the dock. Specifically, we use an
equally weighted geometric average of import and export price indices.3 These
indices have two important advantages relative to retail prices and the PPI. First,
import and export indices measure the prices of goods that are actually traded.
Second, these indices are much less contaminated by nontradable components such
as distribution costs.
       We use quarterly data covering the period 1971.Q1 to 2002.Q3 for 11 countries:
Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands,
Sweden, UK, and the U.S. All price series (nominal exchange rates, consumer
price indices, import and export price indices) are from the IMF’s International
Financial Statistics. We measure St , Pt∗ and PtT ∗ as trade-weighed averages of
the individual country price series.4 To isolate cyclical frequencies we detrend the
   3
      We use import and export price indices when possible, and unit values when price indices
are not available. For Denmark, where only import price indices are available, we assume that
the export price index is equal to the import price index.
    4
      The trade share of country i from country j is calculated as 0.5 exportsij / exportsi + 0.5
importsij / importsi , where exportsij and importsij denote total exports and imports of country
i, respectively, exportsij denotes exports of country i to country j, respectively, and importsij
denotes imports of country i from country j, respectively. We obtain import and export data
from the IMF’s Direction of Trade Statistics. Export and import shares are computed as simple
averages using annual data from 1980 to 2002. For each country in our sample we choose the
set of 20 countries with which this country has the highest trade share. We then eliminate
those countries for which we do not have import and export price indices. The remaining 17
countries are: Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Korea,


                                                      5
logarithm of all time series using the Hodrick-Prescott filter using a smoothing
parameter of 1600.
   Despite their advantages, there are three caveats about import and export price
indices that are worth noting. First, some of the import and export prices used in
the construction of these indices can reflect transfer prices within multinational
corporations instead of market transactions. Second, import and export indices
include investment, intermediate goods, and raw materials as well as consumption
goods.5 Finally, for Denmark, Italy and Germany, import and export price indices
are based on unit value indices (UVIs) computed from trade statistics as the ratio
of the local currency value of exports or imports to volume (weight or quantity).
A potential problem with UVIs is that they are aﬀected by shifts over time in
product composition.

3. Empirical Results

Figure 1 displays the time series of log(St ), rertcpi , and rertT for 11 countries. We
normalize the level of these variables to zero in 1972the beginning of the sample.
It is evident that rertcpi and rertT behave quite diﬀerently. These diﬀerences are
particularly pronounced for Australia, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, and Sweden.
   The first panel of Table 1 displays summary statistics of the data. We compute
three statistics for both rertcpi and rertT : the standard deviation, the correlation
with log(St ), and the elasticity with respect to log(St ). The latter is the slope
of a linear regression of the logarithm of either rertcpi or rertT on log(St ). These
elasticities do not have a causal or structural interpretation. However, they are a
convenient way to summarize the quantitative relation between rertcpi , rertT , and
Mexico, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, U.S., and Venezuela. For the median
country, our trade weights account for 57 percent of total imports and exports.

nominal exchange rates.
    Consistent with Mussa (1986) we find that there is a very strong correlation
between the logarithm of the nominal exchange rate and rertcpi . The median
correlation between these two series is −0.96. The volatility of these series is also
very similar. The median value of the ratio of the standard deviations of rertcpi
and log(St ) is 1.03. The median value of the elasticity of the rertcpi and rertT
with respect to log(St ) is −0.99. Taken together our summary statistics suggest
a very tight relation between rertcpi and log(St ). One widely held interpretation
of this tight relation is that it reflects the pervasiveness of sticky prices, with no
distinction being made between tradable and nontradable goods.
    Next we consider our summary statistics for rertT . The median correlation
between rertT and log(St ) is −0.69, while the median value of the ratio of the
standard deviations of these two series is 0.62. Finally, the elasticity of rertT with
respect to log(St ) is only −0.41. Clearly, the relation between rertT and log(St ) is
substantially weaker than the relation between rertcpi and log(St ).
    We now examine the role of tradable and nontradable goods prices in account-
ing for movements in the real exchange rate. The last two columns of Table 1
report the lower and upper bounds for the importance of movements in nontrad-
able goods prices as sources of rertcpi fluctuations, defined in (2.4) and (2.5). The
median values of these bounds are 52 and 68 percent. We redo our calculations
measuring the price of pure-traded goods using only the price of imported goods.
In this case we find that the median values of LN and LU are 49 and 82 percent,
respectively. We infer that movements in the price of nontradable goods relative
to tradable goods are important, accounting for more than half of the fluctuations
in rertcpi .
    This finding stands in sharp contrast with the results in the literature obtained
using retail prices to measure PtT and PtT ∗ (see Engel (1999) and Chari, Kehoe,


                                          7
and McGrattan (2002)). We illustrate the contrast by estimating the lower and
upper bounds defined in (2.4) and (2.5) for the U.S. using two alternative measures
of tradable goods’ prices.
     In the first case we measure PtT using an equally weighted geometric average
of U.S. import and export price indices. We measure PtT ∗ using a trade-weighted,
equally-weighted geometric average of import and export price indices for the fol-
lowing trading partners of the U.S.: Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan,
Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, UK, and Venezuela. To-
gether these countries account for 64 percent of U.S. imports and exports for the
period 1980 to 2001.
     In the second case we measure PtT using the retail price of tradable goods in the
U.S. We average monthly data on the retail price of tradable goods obtained from
the Bureau of Labor Statistics to produce a quarterly time series. We construct
PtT ∗ as a trade-weighted average of the U.S. trading partners’ consumer prices.
For Canada, Italy, Japan, and Mexico we use the retail prices of tradable goods.
These countries account for 43 percent of U.S. trade during the period 1980 to
2001. Due to data limitations, for Australia, Germany, Korea, the Netherlands,
Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and Venezuela we measure the price of tradable goods
using the CPI. The sample period, 1975.Q1 to 2002.Q3, which diﬀers from that of
the data used to construct Table 1, was dictated by the availability of retail prices
of tradable goods for some of the U.S. trading partners. We report our results in
Table 2.
     Consistent with the results in Table 1, when PtT is measured using import and
export prices fluctuations in nontradable goods prices account for well over half
of the movements in rertcpi . In sharp contrast, when PtT is measured using retail
prices, these fluctuations account for 5 percent or less of the movements in the
rertcpi .


                                           8
   Taken together, our results make clear that the conventional view that move-
ments in nontradable goods prices are unimportant as sources of cyclical RERcpi
fluctuations, depends critically on the questionable assumption that the price of
tradable goods can be accurately measured using retail prices. Measuring the
price of tradable goods using retail prices understates the importance of move-
ments in the relative price of nontradable goods as a source of cyclical RERcpi
fluctuations.

4. Conclusion

Burstein, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2005) argue that in the aftermath of large
devaluations, changes in the real exchange rate are overwhelmingly driven by
movements in the price of nontradable goods relative to the price of pure-traded
goods. This paper analyses the source of real exchange rate fluctuations at cyclical
frequencies. We find that more than half of these fluctuations are accounted for by
movements in the price of nontradable goods relative to the price of pure-traded
goods. The remaining half are due to movements in the relative price of traded
goods across countries. Understanding the sources of these latter movements has
been the focus of a large literature. Our findings suggest that equal attention
should be paid to modeling movements in the relative price of nontradable to
pure-traded goods.
