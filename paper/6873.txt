I. Introduction

        Income and wage inequality among adults with at least some college education has risen in the U.S.

since 1970, so that the difference between a male in this group who is at the 90th percentile of the income

distribution and a male at the 10th percentile has risen from about $13,275 in 1972 to about $49,000 in

1995 (both in 1995 dollars). In this paper, we attempt to decompose the increase in income and wage

inequality into three components. The first is the "extensive margin," or the increase due to the increasingly

diverse backgrounds of people who attend college.1 The second is an increasing rate of return to aptitude,

so that a given distribution of aptitude among the college-educated generates an increasingly wide income

distribution.2 The third component is the change in the market structure of college education such that a

person of a given aptitude interacts differently with colleges. As shown in Hoxby (1997a,b), colleges have

become increasingly segregated on the basis of students' aptitude, so that aptitude differentials within each

college are falling and aptitude differentials between colleges are rising. Also, colleges' per-student

expenditures have become increasing correlated with the aptitude of their student bodies. We call these

phenomena the "intensive margin" because they affect the peers and other inputs that a student experiences

once he has joined the ranks of college students.

        We are particularly interested in the intensive margin, partly because it is a phenomena that has not

been studied and partly because it is a mechanism by which a given distribution of aptitude can play out

differently over time as education supply changes. Moreover, it is the only one of the three components


        1
          The terms "extensive margin" is used to avoid confusion. Alternative terms would be "selection into the
group" or "composition of the group," but the concepts of selection and composition are also needed to explain the
"intensive margin" of college education.
        2
           We use "aptitude" to refer to the combination of ability and achievement that forms the "aptitude to
succeed in college," the standard used in college admissions tests and similar examinations. Our references to
aptitude should not be interpreted as though they referred to innate, cognitive ability.
         Several other authors have suggested that an increasing return to aptitude explains a significant amount of
the increase in income and wage inequality. See Blackburn and Neumark (1993), Heckman (1995), Levy,
Murnane, and Willett (1995), Heckman et al (1996), Cawley, Heckman, and Vytlacil (1998), and Murnane et al
(1998).
                                                                                                                2

that is both real and probably permanent. The increasing integration of the market for college appears to

be due to decreased information costs (multilateral information exchanges between students, colleges, and

sources of financial aid) and decreased mobility costs (transportation, long-distance communication, long-

distance media and culture). See Hoxby (1997a). These factors–especially the information exchange

mechanisms that now characterize college searches–are likely to be permanent. In contrast, changes in

within-group income inequality that are due to moving the group boundary (the extensive margin) are

mainly of practical policy interest. They suggest that groups may need to be redefined if policies are to

retain their intended meaning. Also, a rising rate of return to aptitude may be the result of a recent tendency

for technological innovations to be complementary to skills. This tendency may continue for some years to

come, but there have been past periods in which technological innovations tended to substitute for skills.

        We decompose the increase in income and wage dispersion among the college educated by

comparing the incomes, wages, backgrounds, and college experiences of males who are approximately age

32 in 1972, 1986, and 1995. The males are selected on the basis of age from three data sets: Occupational

Changes in a Generation (OCG, 1972 incomes), the National Longitudinal Study of the Class of 1972

(NLS72, 1986 incomes), and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY, 1995 incomes). We

matched these data, which we hereafter call "the combined surveys," to detailed information about each

college's student body, selectivity, expenditures, and inputs. The college data come from institutional

surveys and many other sources.

        Our results suggest that each of the three components has contributed substantially to the increase

in income and wage inequality. Within the increase in inequality that can be explained by observable

factors, we find that about 1/4th is associated with the extensive margin, about 1/3rd with an increased rate

of return to aptitude, and about 5/12ths with the intensive margin. Naive estimates that do not account for

the intensive margin greatly overstate the pure increase in the rate of return to aptitude. That is, aptitude

would not earn as much as it currently does if it continued to interact with the college market as it did in
                                                                                                                3

1970.

        In this paper, we may state that a student of a given aptitude earns more if the market changes in

such a way that he experiences a college that has a higher concentration of high aptitude peers and higher

per-student expenditures. This is a treatment effect of the general changes in the college market. We

would not argue that these are individual treatment effects. That is, we would not argue that we could drop

high aptitude peers and high expenditures on other students and expect to see a similar effect on their

earnings. In this paper, we cannot differentiate between an intensive margin that works because high

quality peers and expenditures generate actual human capital and an intensive margin that works because

high quality peers and expenditures are necessary components of an elaborate signaling mechanism that

signals aptitude. In either case, the intensive margin is necessary for aptitude to be associated with greater

earnings, so we will say that the increased earnings are associated with the increasing role of the intensive

margin. We return to this point in the conclusion.

        A preview of the empirical strategy is as follows. We first use the Current Population Survey

(CPS) to establish the time trends in income and wage inequality that we are attempting to explain. We

examine males who are college-educated and have either 5 or 25 years of experience. They are

comparable to other estimates of within-college income quantiles from the literature based on the CPS.

Next, we show income and wage quantiles for 1972, 1986, and 1995, based on males who are about age 32

in the combined surveys. For each year, we examine two groups: those who completed at least two years

of college, and and those who have at least a baccalaureate degree. We also show mean incomes and

wages for individuals grouped by their colleges and by their aptitude. In the parametric part of the paper,

we use regression and analysis of variance to decompose each year's variance in incomes and wages into

variance attributable to individual attributes other than aptitude (family background), aptitude, the intensive

margin (peer concentration, per-student expenditure), and residual inequality. We use Oaxaca-type

decompositions to attribute the changes in variance to changes in the variance of attributes (such as
                                                                                                               4

increased demographic diversity or increased diversity of per-student expenditure), changes in the return to

attributes (such as the return to aptitude), and changes in the residual. We consider a number of alternative

specifications. In particular, we try different methods of estimating the extensive margin, and we use

simulated instrumental variables to ensure that the attributes of an individual's college do not pick up

unmeasured aptitude. Overall, when our choice of an estimation strategy is likely to bias the results, we

consistently choose the strategy that will favor the conventional explanations of increasing inequality (the

extensive margin, then the return to aptitude) over the intensive margin explanation.



II. Background: Wage Inequality Measures from the CPS 1969-96

        The increase in income and wage dispersion in the U.S. since 1970 has been well documented by

numerous authors, for instance Katz and Murphy (1992), Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1993), Levy and

Murnane (1992), and Gottschalk (1997). About one-third of this increase is associated with increasing

differentials between groups, such as the differential between people with a college education and just a

high school education. The other two-thirds of the increased dispersion has been within groups. The group

that concerns us, the college-educated, have shown an increase in the variance of their wages that is about

16% larger than the overall increase in variance.3

        Figures 1 through 4 show log wages at various percentiles of the income distribution from 1969 to

1996 for white males who report having completed at least 16 years of education.4 Figure 1 shows time

paths of the difference between the 90th and 10th percentiles, the difference between the 90th and 50th, and

the difference between the 50th and 10th for men with 25 years of experience. Figure 2 repeats the exercise

substituting the 75th percentile for the 90th percentile, and the 25th percentile for the 10th percentiles.

            Authors' calculations, based on combined surveys.
        4
           For all four surveys used in this paper, hourly wages are constructed from periodic earnings (for
instance, weekly earnings) and usual weekly hours for those men who do not report hourly wages.
                                                                                                               5

(Experience is measured as age minus education minus six, so the men are aged about 57.) Figures 3 and 4

show the corresponding time paths for men with 5 years of experience (who are aged about 27). The

estimates for 1969 through 1977 are taken from Buchinsky (1995) and are based on the March CPS. We

estimated the incomes at various percentiles for 1978 to 1996 using the Merged Outgoing Rotation Groups

of the CPS. Our method otherwise replicates that described by Buchinsky (1995) so that the updated series

continues smoothly. Appendix Tables 1-4 present the estimates that are displayed in Figures 1-4.

        Figures 1 and 2 show steady upward trends in wage inequality among men with 25 years of

experience. In 1969, wages at the 90th and 10th percentiles are separated by 1.070 log points, and wages at

the 75th and 25th percentiles are separated by 0.540 log points. The corresponding 1996 differences are

1.385 log points and 0.691 log points. The paths show relatively steady rates of increase over the entire

period, with the exception of a dip in the 90th-50th difference from 1983 to 1987. Even though the men

whose wages are shown in Figures 1 and 2 are significantly older than the men we examine in the combined

surveys, it is useful to begin with them. Their wages paths are more steady, reflecting more of the trend in

wage inequality than short term labor market fluctuations. Also, wage inequality among men younger than

30 understates the true inequality in their current earning potential (because schooling activities depress

some men's earnings) and grossly understates the inequality in the lifetime earning potential.5 As Heckman

et al (1996) show, an examination of the incomes of men who are just a few years out of their 20s is much

more informative than an examination of the same men a few years previously.

        Figures 3 and 4 show that men with 5 years of experience also displayed increasing wage

inequality over the 1969 to 1996 period. However, the time paths of the percentiles of their income

distribution are much less steady and display plateaus (1971-77, 1981-87, 1990 onwards) and rather

abrupt increases (1970-71, 1977-81, 1987-90). It is difficult to state with confidence whether their wage

            See Murphy and Welch (1990).
                                                                                                             6

inequality has recently stopped growing or whether it is just currently on a plateau and will soon resume the

upward trend shown by the income inequality of men with 25 years of experience. The1969 wages of men

with 5 years of experience differed by 0.930 log points between the 90th and 10th percentiles and by 0.420

log points between the 75th and 25th percentiles. Their 1996 wages differed by 1.311 log points between the

90th and 10th percentiles and by 0.648 log points between the 75th and 25th percentiles.

        It is useful to compare the combined survey data to the CPS data just shown. The combined

survey men are about age 32, so they have approximately 10 years of experience (calculated using the age-

education-6 method). They belong between the figures for men with 5 years and 25 of experience. Also,

all of the CPS males in Figures 1-4 reported that they had completed at least 16 years of education,

supposed to be equivalent to a baccalaureate degree. Unlike the combined surveys, however, the CPS does

not provide other information we might use to confirm the existence of a baccalaureate degree (such as

attending a college that actually grants baccalaureate degrees). Based on our experience with the other

surveys, we expect that a minority of men (15 to 20%) in the CPS group have completed some college but

do not actually have a baccalaureate degree.

        The combined surveys' data are shown for the appropriate years as isolated "X"s on Figures 1

through 4. The wage differentials are, as expected, between those of men with 25 years of experience than

for those of men with 5 years of experience. For baccalaureate holders in the combined surveys, wages at

the 90th and 10th percentiles differ by 1.043 log points in 1972 (compare 1.100 log points for CPS men with

25 years of experience and 0.970 log points for CPS men with 5 years of experience) and by 1.288 log

points in 1995 (compare 1.397 log points for CPS men with 25 years of experience and 1.338 log points

for CPS men with 5 years of experience). The corresponding numbers for the 75th and 25th percentiles are

0.547 log points in 1972 (compare 0.540 log points for CPS men with 25 years of experience and 0.470

log points for CPS men with 5 years of experience) and 0.658 log points in 1995 (compare 0.695 log points

for CPS men with 25 years of experience and 0.660 log points for CPS men 5 years of experience).
                                                                                                              7

        Thus, the combined survey data exhibit a time pattern in wage inequality that is consistent with

that shown by CPS data. Figures 1 through 4 also show that inequality in the combined survey data

continues to grow after the 1972-86 period. For instance, the average annual growth of the 90-10 wage

differential is about the same (0.01 log points) both before and after 1986, according to the combined

survey data. This implies that we should be able to learn as much from comparing NLSY data (1995

wages) to NLS72 data (1986 wages) as we can from comparing NLS72 data (1986 wages) to OCG data

(1972 wages). This implication is useful because the NLSY and NLS72 contain measures of scholastic

aptitude that the OCG does not contain.



                                     III. The Combined Surveys Data

        The first principle of our empirical strategy was to choose data from the beginning, middle, and

end of the 1970 to 1995 period that were as comparable as possible before econometric analysis. The

second principle was to choose wage data that would strongly reflect current trends in inequality, yet not

reflect too many competing phenomena–such as job search activities undertaken by young labor market

participants or the changing labor supply behavior of young women.

        In practice, these data requirements pose the principal obstacle to empirical work like that we

attempt in this study. We need survey data on wages, incomes, and family background that are nationally

representative (or are provided with appropriate weights to generate nationally representative statistics).

The data must span the period of interest–approximately 1970 to the present–and must identify each

individual's actual college. The data must allow us to compare men who are out of their 20s, yet young

enough to have wages that strongly reflect current trends in inequality and young enough to have attended

college in a period for which college data are available. We must match the survey data to data about each

institution of higher education, drawn for the relevant year. Data on the universe of colleges (not just those

attended by someone in the survey) must be assembled so that colleges may be ranked and we can assess
                                                                                                                    8

what behavior is typical for a student of given aptitude in a given year. Information on colleges' selectivity

and student bodies is particularly difficult to assemble, because it is scattered in a variety of sources and

comes in a variety of formats. Early (pre-1970) financial information on colleges is also onerous to

assemble.

        This section describes the key features of our data. The Data Appendix Table contains sample

information and descriptive statistics for each data set.

A. A Description of the Data

        The NLS72 provides us with 1986 wage and income data on X men, whose high school and college

experiences were recorded in earlier waves of the survey (1972-86). Because the NLS72 began with a

sample of people who high school seniors in 1972, the vast majority of the men are age 32 in 1986. We

therefore use 32 as the focal age for drawing samples from the OCG and NLSY surveys. The NLS72 has

clustered sampling based on high schools, and we take account of this clustering in the empirical analysis.6

We use the weights, provided by the survey, that are designed to make the 1986 data nationally

representative. Men are dropped from the sample if they have zero or missing earnings information. This

is true for the other two surveys as well, so that it is appropriate to interpret all the results as "conditional

on having positive earnings." In practice, this is not an onerous restriction because the men whom we

analyze, those with at least some college education, are more likely to have positive earnings. For instance,

among men in the NLS72 who have baccalaureate degrees, only 10.4 percent of the observations must be

dropped because earnings are non-positive or non-interpretable.7

        The NLSY provides us with 1995 wage and income data on X men, whose high school and college



        6
           Stata contains a set of survey or "svy" procedures that account for clustering. These procedures compute
group means, group proportions, regression coefficients, and so on. We define the school as the cluster or
probaptitude sampling unit for the NLS72, and we find that using the "svy" procedures with the school cluster is
important for correct computation of variances and quantiles in the NLS72.
        7
            This computation does not include men who have already left the sample previous to the 1986 wave.
                                                                                                             9

experiences are recorded in waves of the survey dating from 1979 to 1996.8 The men in the NLSY were

aged 30 to 38 in 1995, and we kept observations on those men who were aged 30 to 35. Thus, the sample

is roughly centered on age 32–though there is an asymmetry. In choosing these ages, we considered the

trade-off between the explanatory power we would gain from increasing sample size and the explanatory

power we would need to estimate age effects convincingly enough that the NLSY could be compared to the

NLS72. We use the weights provided by the survey for 1995 data. The NLSY contains an oversample of

people from minority and disadvantaged backgrounds. We found that keeping or excluding this sample did

not affect our results significantly, so long as we used the appropriate weights.9

        Men from the NLS72 and NLSY are associated with the college from which they obtained a

baccalaureate degree, if they obtained one. Men who remain unmatched after this procedure are associated

with the college from which they obtained an associates degree, if they obtained one. Men who remain

unmatched after this procedure are associated with the college they attended the longest in an

undergraduate capacity. We create a category for men who claim to have attended college, but whose

reported colleges could not be matched with any accredited institution of higher education by the United

States Department of Education.

        So far as we are aware, the OCG is the only nationally representative survey that provides early

1970s wages, incomes, and background data on a large number of men and records the specific college that

each individual attended. The OCG was a CPS supplement, so it has the same sample structure as the

CPS. We use the X men who were aged 30 to 35 in 1972.10 The OCG contains less family background

information than either the NLS72 or the NLSY, so it was the limiting factor in our choice of background


        8
             NLSY earnings and hours data for 1995 were collected in the 1996 survey.
        9
           The NLSY also originally contained a military sub-sample, but these men were perforce dropped
because the survey stopped following them before the 1996 wave.
        10
           The sample was conducted in 1973, but the earnings and hours data apply to 1972. The OCG is not
longitudinal, so some information is retrospective.
                                                                                                                  10

variables. For all three surveys, however, we were able to obtain the background variables that have

substantial explanatory power for earnings and college attendance: race, ethnicity, parents' completed

education, family income at the time the respondent was in high school, family size, birth order, foreign

birth of parents, and state in which the respondent attended high school. Men in the OCG are associated

with their most recent college. We use the weights provided by the OCG, although these do not make much

difference in practice owing to the sample design.

        Colleges' financial and institutional data for 1969 onwards is derived from CASPAR, a panel

version of the data gathered by the U.S. Department of Education in its Higher Education General

Information System (HEGIS) and Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) surveys. The

variables include expenditures per student, revenues per student, tuition revenue per student, tuition, in-

state and out-of-state tuition (for colleges that differentiate tuition by state of residence), average faculty

salary, faculty-student ratio, and total enrollment. For the years prior to 1968, the same variables were

coded from a variety of college guides, but especially the American Council on Education's guide entitled

American Universities and Colleges, which includes every accredited institution.11

        Each individual was matched with information about the college he attended, where the information

was drawn from the approximate year in which he would have been applying to college if he had applied in

his senior year of high school. Thus NLS72 men are matched with college information from 1971-72,

NLSY men with college information from 1980-81, and OCG men with college information from 1958-60.

We chose this matching procedure partly because of data availability, and partly because we would have

otherwise had to instrument each individual's college information with the college information that would

have pertained if he had applied at the normal time. (Otherwise, the effects of his college characteristics




        11
            Other guides that provided us with a substantial number of observations on financial and institutional
variables for this period were Lovejoy's Guide to Colleges and Cass and Birmbaum's Comparative Guide to
American Colleges.
                                                                                                                   11

would be contaminated by the effects of his decision to attend college at an unusual time in his life.) In any

case, the information for a college does not change so rapidly that a mis-match of one or two years would

affect the results.12

         Information on colleges' student bodies and selectivity was taken from a variety of college guides,

including Peterson's, Barrons, Cass and Birmbaum's Comparative Guide, Lovejoys, and American

Universities and Colleges. For any given college in any year, multiple sources of information were used.

For instance, general admissions information (admissions tests required, required grade point average, and

so on) might be confirmed by three sources, while Barrons might provide median Scholastic Aptitude Test

(SAT) and/or American College Test (ACT) scores, Peterson's might provide cumulative densities for

various points on the SAT and/or ACT distribution, and Lovejoys might provide mean SAT and/or ACT

scores. Some colleges are nonselective, meaning that they do not have any admissions requirements beyond

a high school diploma or the equivalent. These colleges are identified by a nonselective dummy variable.

Other colleges' student bodies are described by the distribution of their admissions test scores, with ACT

scores translated into SAT scores using the tables provided by the College Board. We then translated SAT

scores translated into 1982 national percentiles using the distribution information published by the College

Board. Since we are interested in how diverse a college's student body is, this translation is important. For

instance, the 100 point difference between 700 and 800 on the SAT verbal test is only 1 percentile, but the

100 point difference between 450 and 550 is 27 percentiles. In addition, the SAT verbal test is

considerably more sensitive than the SAT math test above 550 points, so that a 100 point difference on the

verbal test contains fewer percentiles than a 100 point difference on the math test.13

         We estimated the standard deviation of admissions test scores for each college using the method of


         12
              This is one reason why we use surveys that record earnings in years that are about a decade apart.
         13
           All of these comments refer to the pre-1994 SAT verbal and math tests, which are relevant for our
analysis. Each test has since been separately recentered.

moments on the multiple moments that we typically had for each college and assuming that the distribution

for each college was normal. (Reported means and medians were usually within 10 points of one another

for each college.) For instance, a college's mean SAT verbal score and its percentage of students with SAT

verbal scores above 600 (both translated into national percentile scores first) would generate one method of

moments estimate of the standard deviation of its verbal scores. We then took the mean of each college's

method of moments estimates of the standard deviation of verbal scores (though the median of the estimates

worked similarly). We performed the same procedure for SAT math scores.

B. Two Measurement Issues

        We would like a measure of each college's peer influences that indicates how likely a student is, in

an encounter with a fellow student, to meet person who is a beneficial academically. We attempt to form

such a measure by interacting the standard deviation of colleges' admissions test scores with their mean

admissions test scores. For a college with a given mean level of aptitude, peer effects are affected by the

dispersion of aptitude. If we believe, for example, that interactions with much less able peers are

unproductive or bad for a student's achievement, then we would expect that, conditional on attending a

college with high mean SAT scores, a tighter distribution of SAT scores (a smaller standard deviation of

SAT scores) generates better peer effects. On the other hand, if the aptitude of the most able student in the

college is all that matters, excellent peer effects are possible even at a college with low mean SAT scores so

long as the distribution of scores is not tight (the standard deviation in large). It is important to emphasize,

however, that without knowing how peer effects work, we cannot take a stand on the sign of the interaction

term. For instance, homogeneous classes may be good for all students. Or, homogeneous classes may be

good only for students who are of high aptitude and are thereby segregated from low aptitude students. Or,

colleges' dispersion of aptitude may matter very little because there are many means by which students can

self-segregate within colleges. We do not wish to constrain the mechanism by which peer effects work.

We will simply associate peer effects with the effects of the interaction between a college's average SAT
                                                                                                                 13

score and the standard deviation of its scores, and our preferred specification (see below) allows many

different peer mechanisms to reveal themselves.

        The figure below may clarify the intuition. It shows a stylized version of what has happened to the

college market over time. The vertical axis shows SAT scores, arranged so that students are uniformly

distributed over the axis. Each college's student body is represented as a part of this distribution. For

instance, college A's students have SAT scores that are uniformly distributed between the dashed lines.




                                                                                                            In

                                                                                                 all 3

                                                                                                 colleges, the

                                                                                                 standard

                                                                                                 deviation of

                                                                                                 students'

SAT scores shrinks over time. Each college's mean SAT score (not shown, but obviously at the center of

each college's range) also changes. The income of a student who attends college A is not just a function of
                                                                                                              14

his own aptitude (measured both by his individual score and the college's mean score), but also a function

of the students he meets in college A. If he attends college A at time 1, he is more likely to meet a low

aptitude student than if he attends college A at time 3. Conversely, a student who attends college C is more

likely to meet a high aptitude student if he attends at time 1 than at time 3. Students at all colleges are

more likely to experience classes with heterogenous students if they attend at time 1 rather than time 3.

        In summary, we associate an individual's aptitude scores and the main effect of his college's

average SAT scores with his individual aptitude. That is, we assume that a college's average SAT scores

are another measure of individual aptitude that has descriptive power even when we control for individual

measures of aptitude. Only the interaction between colleges' average SAT scores and the standard

deviations of the scores are associated with the intensive margin. This pattern of association overstates the

role of aptitude and understates the role of the intensive margin. This is one example of how we chose

methods that would understate the intensive margin. Note that the previous literature has conventionally

called the effect of a college's average SAT scores "peer effects" when an individual's own SAT score was

controlled for. If we were to adopt this convention, the role of aptitude in explaining inequality would

shrink and the role of the intensive margin would expand.

        Both the NLS72 and NLSY administered tests of math and verbal skills to their entire survey

population. These provide useful measures of scholastic aptitude. The NSL72 test was created by the

United States Department of Education for use in the survey and was administered to all the respondents

when they were high school seniors. We use its mathematics and language/reading components. In the

NLSY, the universally administered test was the ASVAB, from which we use the parts on numerical

analysis, vocabulary, and reading comprehension. Respondents' scores on all these tests are expressed as

percentile scores and have distributions (see the Data Appendix Table). We hereafter give these scores the

generic names of "Verbal Aptitude" and "Math Aptitude," and we claim that these scores measure

attributes in which colleges admissions officers are interested. The NLS72 and NLSY contain respondents'
                                                                                                                   15

scores on the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test (PSAT), SAT, and ACT.14 The Verbal Aptitude and

Math Aptitude scores are correlated with PSAT, SAT, and ACT scores with correlation coefficients that

consistently exceed 0.90.

        No aptitude test was administered as part of the OCG, so the only measure of a student's aptitude

is his college's average SAT score. We use colleges' average SAT scores and the standard deviations of the

colleges' SAT scores in a second empirical strategy that is a small variation on the strategy described in the

preceding paragraph. This second strategy (which is described in detail below) has a few advantages: (1)

it allows use of the OCG and, thus, comparison over a longer period of time; (2) it allows peer effects to be

modeled flexibly, and (3) it eliminates some attenuation bias that might be caused by error in the aptitude

measures.



                     IV. Descriptive Analysis of the Income and Wage Distributions

        In this section, we show that the combined surveys data suggest some role for each of three

possible sources of within-college inequality: the extensive margin, aptitude, and the intensive margin.

Our strategy is to first examine earnings quantiles of the whole sample, then eliminate individuals who are

likely to contribute to inequality through the extensive margin and reexamine the earnings quantiles in the

reduced sample, and finally show how much of income and wage inequality is associated with aptitude or

college rank.

        Each figure in this section has a corresponding appendix table that presents the same data

numerically. Thus, all the statistics in Figure 5 are shown in Appendix Tables 5a and 5b, and all the

calculations presented in this section are based on numbers available in the appropriate appendix table. We

prepared statistics for each of four definitions of college-going: attended any college, completed at least 2


        14
          If a respondent took an admissions or pre-admissions test, the score is recorded on his transcript and
becomes part of the survey record.
                                                                                                               16

years of college, attended a baccalaureate-granting college, and earned a baccalaureate degree. Statistics

based on the first three definitions tend to be similar, so, for brevity, we usually present only statistics

based on the second and fourth definitions. Most of the income and wage statistics are expressed in natural

logs, but a few figures show statistics in real dollars because it is instructive to see the analysis both

ways.15

          Figure 5 shows income for 1972, 1986 and 1995 at the 95th, 90th, 75th, 50th, 25th, 10th, and 5th

percentiles of the income distribution. The set of all men with a least 2 years of college are shown in one

part of the figure, and the subset of men who have a baccalaureate degree are shown in the other part. The

income distribution is clearly widening over time. Among those who have at least two years of college, the

upper and lower halves of the distribution each account for about an equal share of the widening. Among

the baccalaureate-holders, however, the upper half of the distribution accounts for a slightly

disproportionate share. For them, the 90-10 differential was 34,478 dollars in 1972 and 50,050 dollars in

1995. The 90-50 differential rose from 19,050 dollars to 28,027 dollars over the same period, implying

that the upper half of the distribution accounted for 57.6% of the increase in the 90-10 differential. For

both groups of college-goers, earnings at the 5th and 10th percentile are flat or declining over the period,

while earnings at the 50th percentile and above are rising.

          Figure 6 shows the same analysis as Figure 5, except that hourly wages are presented instead of

income. Figure 6 shows increasing dispersion, like Figure 5, but wages increase more on average over the

period than incomes do. Nevertheless, wages at the 5th and 10th percentiles are nearly flat. Among those

with at least 2 years of colleges, the 90-10 differential is 13.47 dollars in 1972 and 18.55 dollars in 1995.

For the same group, the 90-50 differential is 8.45 dollars in 1972 and 10.70 dollars in 1995, implying that

the lower half of the distribution accounts for 55.7% of the increase in dispersion. Among the

                                                                                                                 17

baccalaureate holders, the 90-10 differential grows from 14.39 dollars in 1972 to 19.25 dollars in 1995,

and the two halves of the distribution account for roughly equal shares of the increase in dispersion. In

both groups of men, the increase in dispersion decelerates slightly in the 1986-95 period relative to the

1986-72 period. This deceleration is not observable in the income data shown in Figure 5.

        Figures 7a through 8b attempt to show what Figures 5 and 6 would have looked like if the

backgrounds of people going to college had remained the same over the whole period. That is, we attempt

to eliminate the increase in inequality due to the extensive margin in background–especially the increased

access to college among students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds. (There is also an

extensive margin in aptitude, but we do not attempt to estimate it until we do parametric analysis in the

next section.) We wish to overstate rather than understate the increase in inequality due to the extensive

margin in background, so we adopt the following procedure for culling the sample.16 Using the OCG

sample, we estimated probit equations for at-least-two-years-of-college and baccalaureate-degree using all

of the background variables and various interactions among them.17 We calculated a propensity score for

each individual to be a member of each group and we calculated the mean propensity within each group–for

instance, the mean propensity to be a baccalaureate holder, conditional on actually belonging to the

baccalaureate-holding group. We classified the people in the OCG who were above the mean propensity for

each group as "very likely to belong." We used the estimated coefficients from the OCG probit equations to

generate propensity scores for men in the NLS72 and NLSY, and we classified them as "very likely to

belong" to each group if they were above the mean propensity scores calculated using the OCG data (as



        16
           We do this to emphasize how much of the increase in dispersion remains to be explained even when the
extensive margin has been given (more than) its due. In the next section, we adopt a more balanced method of
computing the increase in variance due to the extensive margin.
        17
           The variables are number of siblings, number of older siblings, black, hispanic, asian, native american,
maximum of parents' highest grade completed, log(family income) when respondent was in high school, foreign-
born parents or major household language is foreign, and indicator variables for state of residence while in high
school.
                                                                                                           18

described above). The outcome of the procedure is a sample of men from each of the surveys who would

have been very likely to have at least two years of college or to have baccalaureate degrees if they had lived

when the men in the OCG lived. A by-product of the procedure is a demonstration that selection into

college on the basis of good background characteristics was stronger in the OCG than in the other two

surveys.18

         Figure 6a shows what happens to the distribution of income among predicted-baccalaureate-

holders between 1972 and 1995. The distribution among actual baccalaureate-holders is also shown for

comparison. Careful visual comparisons or, even better, a few calculations using the numbers in Appendix

Table 7a demonstrate that eliminating the extensive margin in background wipes out only a minority of the

increase in income inequality. (Recall that the method employed tends to overstate the role of the extensive

margin.) For instance, the 90-10 differential grew by 15,572 dollars (from 34.378 dollars in 1972 to

50,050 dollars in 1995) among actual baccalaureate-holders. It grew by 14,164 dollars (from 37,888

dollars in 1972 to 52,052 dollars in 1995) among men who were always likely to be baccalaureate-holders.

These numbers imply that the extensive margin in background accounts for about 10% of the increase in

income inequality. We get a larger estimate, 19%, if we examine the 75-25 differential instead of the 90-10

differential.

         Figure 7b is the same as Figure 7a, except that hourly wages are shown instead of income. If we

make the same calculations as we made in the preceding paragraph for Figure 7a, we find that the extensive

margin accounts for between 8% and 26% of the increase in wage inequality. The former number is based

on the 90-10 wage differential; the latter number is based on the 75-25 differential.

         Figures 8a and 8b repeat the exercise of Figures 7a and 7b, except that at-least-2-years-of-college

is the group of interest, rather than baccalaureate holders. Careful visual comparisons or calculations like



         18
              Coefficient estimates that show this point are presented in the next section.
                                                                                                               19

those above (based on Appendix Tables 8a and 8b) reveal that the extensive margin can account for as

much as 18-30% of the increase in income inequality and 11-47% of the increase in wage inequality among

men with at least 2 years of college. In all cases, the lower estimate of extensive margin's contribution

comes from calculations based on the 90-10 differential, and the higher estimate comes from calculations

based on the 75-25 differential. Having shown that even an exaggerated extensive margin accounts for

only a minority of the increase in inequality, we use regression analysis in the next section to get more

better estimates of the contribution made by the extensive margin. The parametric analysis imposes more

structure, but it also uses all of the available data to calculate each contribution.

        In Figures 9a through 10b, we abandon percentiles of the income and wage distributions, and we

instead show incomes and wages for people who attended colleges of differing selectivity. In the figures,

we group colleges into 6 ranks based on their selectivity (for visual clarity, the 12 rank groups used in the

parametric analysis are contracted into 6). Rank group 1 contains nonselective and minimally selective

colleges, and rank group 6 contains the most selective colleges. The first thing we observe about Figure 8a

is that individuals who attend more selective colleges tend to earn higher wages. The second thing we

observe is that the income differentials associated with college rank have grown over time. The increase in

dispersion has occurred especially because the incomes of individuals from colleges with extreme ranks (1

and 6) have moved away from the center.

        In Figures 11 and 12, individuals are grouped by their Verbal Aptitude and Math Aptitude scores

into 5 convenient groups, where individuals placed in group 5 have high scores on both the Verbal and

Math tests and those placed in group 1 have low scores on both tests. The groups were constructed so that

the weighted proportion of people in each aptitude group would be the same in both surveys. In other

words, the actual scoring of the tests should not affect the figures. (In any case, both tests are scored in

terms of national percentiles and have quite similar weighted distributions of test scores, as we would

expect.) The figures show only 1986 and 1995 earnings because only the NLS72 and the NLSY contained
                                                                                                               20

Verbal Aptitude and Math Aptitude scores.

        There is an increase in income and wage dispersion associated with higher aptitude. For instance,

consider the baccalaureate holders in Figure 12. The difference in wages between group 5 (most able) and

group 1 (least able) is 0.17 log points in 1986, but 0.33 log points in 1995.



                  V. Parametric Decomposition of the Variance of Income and Wages

        In this section, we use regression methods to decompose the increase in the variance of income and

wages among the college-going into the extensive margin, the return to aptitude, and the intensive margin.

We want to learn, to the extent possible, how much of the increase in earnings variance is due to the

extensive margin, the return to aptitude, and the intensive margin. We also want to know how the

estimated effects of aptitude change when we add measures of college peers and inputs to an earnings

regression. This will help us sort out the contribution of pure increases in the return to aptitude from the

contribution of the intensive margin (increased variance in college attributes associated with aptitude).

Along the way, we can examine issues such as whether selection into the college-going group has become

less demanding in terms of good background characteristics and aptitude.

The First Empirical Strategy

        Our first strategy uses the following earnings regression:

(1)                                      ln(yit)' Xit $t %Zit *t%Wit (t%,it

where i indexes individuals, t indexes the survey year, and y is the measure of earnings (either income or

wages). The vector Z contains the individual's own Verbal Aptitude or Math Aptitude and his college's

mean SAT scores. The vector W contains measures of the intensive margin. These include college inputs

and college peer effects--that is, interactions between an individual's aptitude measures and his college's

standard deviation of SAT scores. The vector X contains background variables that might affect the

extensive margin–for instance, selection into the group of men with two years of college education. An
                                                                                                                 21

alternative to including the background variables themselves would be to include a propensity score based

on those background variables and aptitude, weight by a propensity score, or use some other selection

correction technique. We consider these alternatives in the next section, but we find that including the X

variables themselves is the procedure that is, at once, the least restrictive and the most generous towards the

extensive margin. Since we are not interested in identifying the effect of being black, say, on income

separately from its effect on the propensity to go to college, we simply call all of the variation associated

with X and the return to X "the extensive margin." This naturally maximizes the contribution of the

extensive margin, which is acceptable for our purposes.

        Before estimating equation (1) itself, we first estimate two restricted versions of the equation. The

first restricted equation contains only the background variables–that is, * and ( are set equal to zero. The

second restricted equation contains only the background and aptitude variables–that is, ( is set equal to

zero. Finally, we estimate equation (1). Each of the above regressions is estimated separately, using

weights, on each of the three surveys. We add explanatory variables sequentially because we are interested

in knowing how the effects of background are affected by aptitude, and how the effects of aptitude are

affected by college attributes.

        Having estimated these regressions, we do a standard analysis of the variance of earnings, showing

how much of the total variance is explained by the model and how much is residual variance. We then

compute the partial variance due to each group of variables: the X, Z, and W vectors. That is, we

compute the partial sum of squares for each vector and divide it by the model degrees of freedom. Each of

these partial variances is a rough estimate of the amount that that group of variables contributes to the

explained variance.19 For instance, the partial sum of squares for X in the above model is:


        19
            If there were no covariances among the blocks of the explanatory variables, it would be an accurate
estimate. In the process of computing the partial variances, we also computed the partial covariances. These were
relatively small for the results we examine in the text (perhaps because so many of the variables in the regression
are indicator variables), and it did not appear that they would be informative if presented.       The equation
                                                                                                                                         22
                                )   )                                   &                             &       &)       &     &)
(2)                        $̂t ( X t MX & X t ) $̂t           where X t '[ Zt Wt] and MX & 'I&X t (X t X t )&1 X t
                                        t                                                         t



This is a rough measure of the contribution of X to the explained variance, since we have partialed out Z

and W. However, we can learn how the contribution of X changes as we add Z and W, since we add them

sequentially.

         We can also see how much each of the partial variances increases from survey to survey. That is,

when the total variance of earnings increases from 1972 to 1986, how much of the increase is contributed

by the increases in the partial variances due to X, or Z, and W?

         Up to this point, the analysis does not differentiate between changes in the variance of earnings that

are due to changes in the variance of explanatory variables and changes in the returns to those explanatory

variables. Applying an Oaxaca decomposition to our partial variances, we find we need to compute the

following difference:

Alternatively, we could compute the following:

                $̂t ( X t MX & X t ) $̂t & $̂t (Xt&1 MX & Xt&1 ) $̂t % $̂t ( Xt&1 MX & Xt&1 ) $̂t & $̂t&1 (Xt&1 MX & Xt&1 ) $̂t&1

In equations (3) and (4), we decompose the change in the variance into the part due to the change in the

variance of X and the part due to the change in $ (the return to X). Each of these parts is enclosed in

square brackets. In equation (3), the change in the partial variance of the explanatory variables is weighted

by the "old" return and the change in the return is weighted by the "new" partial variance of the explanatory



shown for the partial sum of squares is for exposition. It does not include the weights or cluster design that we
used
                                                                                                               23

variables. If returns are increasing and the partial variance of the explanatory variables is also increasing,

this procedure tends to minimize the estimated contribution of the change in the partial variance of the

explanatory variables. It tends to maximize the estimated contribution of the change in the return. In

equation (4), the change in the partial variance of the explanatory variables is weighted by the "new" return

and the change in the return is weighted by the "old" partial variance of the explanatory variables. If

returns are increasing and the variance of the explanatory variables is also increasing, this procedure tends

to maximize the estimated contribution of the change in the partial variance of the explanatory variables

and tends to minimize the estimated contribution of the change in the return.

        We computed the decomposition using both equation (3) and equation (4). The two methods

produce similar patterns, but we present the decomposition based on equation (3) in order to maximize the

apparent contribution of the return to aptitude and minimize the apparent contribution of the intensive

margin (which depends on increased partial variation in W). That is, we present the decomposition that

lends itself to the more conventional explanation. Since we sweep both X and the return to X into the

extensive margin, the choice of equation (3) or (4) does not affect our assessment of the importance of that

source of inequality.

The Second Empirical Strategy

        There are a few problems with the first empirical strategy. The OCG does not contain individual

measures of aptitude, apart from the average SAT score of an individual's college. Also, there is fair

amount of measurement error in a college's average SAT score, which might cause estimates of the effect

of aptitude to be attenuated. Finally, the independent variables do not easily orthogonalize. This makes the

decomposition less effective and more difficult to interpret--essentially because the covariances among

groups of variables (between W and Z, for instance) must be assigned. The covariances can be assigned to

one group of variables, split between the relevant groups of variables, or assigned to the residual (this is

what we do), but none of these choices is clearly best. If the measures of aptitude are, instead, indicator
                                                                                                               24

variables for aptitude groups, the amount of covariance decreases greatly and assignment of covariance is

less of an issue.20

         Our second empirical strategy addresses all three problems by grouping colleges into 12 aptitude

rank groups, based on their selectivity. The grouping standards are the same for all years of data. The

regression is a modified version of equation (1), where the vector Z contains indicator variables for the rank

groups instead of individuals' aptitude scores and colleges' average SAT scores. The vector W contains

interactions between each college's rank group indicators and its standard deviation of SAT scores, rather

than interactions between each college's average SAT scores and its standard deviation of scores. The

interpretation is still the same. Z, or the main effect of colleges' aptitude rank, is associated with aptitude.

W is associated with the intensive margin, and X with the extensive margin.

         The first empirical strategy produces coefficient estimates that are easier to read and interpret--

simply because there are fewer of them--than the coefficient estimates from the second strategy. The

second strategy, however, is more flexible, uses more data, and produces better decompositions. On the

whole, we prefer the second strategy and we present its results as the main results, despite the awkwardness

of presenting so many coefficients. We then show the results of the first strategy.

         Table 1 shows the regression of baccalaureate holders' income on their backgrounds, colleges'

aptitude rank, and colleges' peers and inputs. The first three columns of table contain regressions based on

1972 (OCG) data; the next three columns contain regressions based on 1986 (NLS72) data; and the last

three columns contain regressions based on 1995 (NLSY) data. The first column for each survey is the

regression in which only background variables (X) are included. The second column for each survey adds

indicator variables for college selectivity (Z), and the third column for each survey adds the peer measures

and per-student expenditure (W). The coefficients on the background variables mainly have the



         20
              The analysis of variance section in most statistics textbooks explains this logic.
                                                                                                               25

coefficients we expect. It is important to recall that they combine the effects of selection and their own

treatment effects. Computations we make below inform us that the returns to good backgrounds and

penalties for bad backgrounds are generally falling over time, but this pattern is hard to discern from the

individual coefficients on the background variables.

        More noteworthy is the pattern of coefficients on the aptitude rank indicators, when these variables

are added in the second column of each survey's set of results. (Aptitude rank=1 is the excluded category.

Colleges in this category are nonselective.) An individual's income increases steadily with the aptitude rank

of his college, but the rate of increase is greater as the survey data become more recent. For instance, in

1972 there is a 0.528 log point difference between the incomes associated with aptitude rank group 12 (the

most selective) and aptitude rank group 1 (nonselective colleges, the omitted category). In 1986, the

difference is 0.645 log points; and, in 1995, the difference is 0.778 log points. Much of this growth in

income differentials takes place in the extreme categories. For instance, the income differential associated

with having a baccalaureate degree from a college that is ultimately selective but minimally so (aptitude

rank=2) versus a college that is ultimately nonselective grows from 0.021 log points in 1972 to 0.082 log

points in 1986 to 0.184 log points in 1995. The income differential associated with having a degree from a

college that has an aptitude rank of 12 versus a college that has an aptitude rank index of 8 grows from

0.200 log points in 1972 to 0.289 log points in 1986 to 0.306 log points in 1995. In summary, the second

regression for each survey suggests that there is a return to a college's aptitude rank and that this return

increased significantly from 1972 to 1995.

        Examining the third column for each survey, we see the effect of adding college attributes. (Note

that the nonselective colleges that form the omitted category do not have standard deviations of SAT

scores–by definition. Thus, the main effect of a standard deviation in SAT scores is implicitly included in

the interaction terms.) Attending a college that has a larger standard deviation of SAT verbal scores is

associated with higher individual incomes if that college has low aptitude rank. In contrast, attending a
                                                                                                              26

college that has a smaller standard deviation of SAT verbal scores is associated with higher individual

incomes if that college has high aptitude rank. The log of per-student expenditure has a positive effect on

income in all three surveys. A log point difference in per-student expenditure generates a 0.060 log point

difference in income in 1972 , a 0.111 log point difference in 1986, and a 0.119 difference in 1995.

        Moreover, adding the college attributes makes the return to aptitude rank increase much less

rapidly over time. In fact, the return to aptitude rank appears to be only slightly higher in 1995 than in

1972, once we control for college attributes. It is still true that higher aptitude rank is associated with

higher income in all years of the survey, but the increase in the return to aptitude rank is small (only really

notable for colleges in aptitude rank groups 9 and 10).

        Since the regression estimates for wages and for men with at least 2 years of college display similar

patterns, we do not discuss these results in detail. Appendix Tables 13-15 show results like those in Table

1, substituting wages as the earnings variable (Appendix Table 13) and then examining income and wages

for men who completed at least two years of college (Appendix Tables 14 and 15). However, we do

examine the by-products of those regression estimates: the variance decompositions of Tables 3-5. First,

consider Table 2, which presents the variance decomposition that corresponds to the regressions shown in

Table 1.

        In its top panel, Table 2 shows changes in the total variance of income between surveys and

attempts to explain those changes in variance. For reference, the bottom panel displays the variances for

each survey year. "Method 1" indicates the regressions that only include background variables; "method 2"

indicates the regressions that include background and aptitude rank variables; and "method 3" indicates the

regressions that include background, aptitude rank, and college attribute variables. The first row of the

table shows the change in the total variance in log(income) between 1986 and 1972, between 1995 and

1986, and between 1995 and 1972. The next row shows, for method 1, the change in the partial variance

due to background variables. The next two rows split this change into the change in returns to background
                                                                                                               27

and the change in the partial variance of background variables. The table also shows residual variance

(plus, in methods 2 and 3, covariances that are not shown elsewhere).

        Table 2 has several noteworthy implications. The partial variance due to background accounts for

a smaller share of total variance in income when the aptitude rank variables are added to the regression.

The partial variance due to background grows over time and explains about 12% of the increase in total

variance, but not because the return to background grows. Instead, the returns to background shrink over

time, but the variance in background characteristics among the baccalaureate-holding group grows. When

we do not include college attributes in the regression, the increase in partial variance due to the aptitude

rank variables explains about 48% of the total increase in the variance of income. The increase in the

partial variance due to aptitude rank is mainly due to increases in the returns to aptitude rank. However,

when college attributes are included in the equation, the increase in partial variance due to aptitude rank is

more modest–about 27% of the total increase in the variance of income. Most of the shrinkage in the

contribution of aptitude rank comes from the estimated contribution of its return. This suggests that

college attributes explain a good portion of the increase in the return to aptitude rank. The increase in the

partial variance due to college peers and per-student expenditure accounts for about 32% of the total

increase in the variance of income. The remaining 27% of the total increase in the variance of income

comes from an increase in the sum of the residual and covariances.

        Summing up, the extensive margin in background accounts for about 15% of the total increase in

the variance of income and this is because baccalaureate holders' backgrounds are becoming more diverse

over time. The decreasing return to background is making a negative contribution towards the increase in

the total variance of income. Colleges' aptitude rank accounts for another 27% of the total increase in the

variance of income. Most of this is due to an apparent increase in the return to aptitude rank, which can

interpreted as an increase in the return to aptitude (broadly construed as aptitude for college). The

intensive margin accounts for about 32% of total increase in the variance of income. Most of this is due to
                                                                                                                28

an increase in the variance of college attributes, not an increase in the return to those attributes. If college

attributes are not included in the analysis, the role of pure increasing returns to aptitude is greatly

overstated (nearly double).

         Table 3 is like Table 2, but presents an analysis of the wages of baccalaureate holders. Most of

the implications of Table 3 are the same as those of Table 2. However, it is noteworthy that the increase in

variance due to background accounts for a larger share (about 21%) of the increase in the total variance of

wages.

         Tables 4 and 5 are the parallels of Tables 2 and 3, but all men with at least 2 years of college are

included. The first thing to note about these tables is that the model explains a smaller share of the increase

in the total variance of the incomes and wages of these men. Only about 50% of the increase in variance

can be attributed to one of the three measured sources of variance. Background still accounts for between

10% and 20% of the increases in the total variance of earnings, and the returns to background still make a

negative contribution. Thus, the difference is that, among men with at least 2 years of college, colleges'

aptitude rank, college peers, and college spending makes smaller contributions to the increase in the total

variance of earnings. The return to aptitude rank accounts for only a small share of the increase in total

variance. For income, the final breakdown is 18% associated with background, 9% associated with

colleges' aptitude rank (of which 1% is due to increased returns), and 15% associated with college peers

and per-student expenditures. For wages, the final breakdown is 9% associated with background, 16%

associated with colleges' aptitude rank (of which 6% is due to increased returns), and 25% associated with

college peers and per-student expenditures.

         The full extensive margin includes the increase in variance due to the increased variance of aptitude

among college students. If we include that piece in the extensive margin, we get the following totals for log

income of baccalaureate holders over the entire 1972-95 period (Table 2, last column): 17.7% of the

increase in total variance associated with the extensive margin, 23.6% associated with the return to aptitude
                                                                                                                   29

rank (aptitude), and 31.9% associated with the intensive margin.



                  VI. Direct Measures of Aptitude and Other Alternative Specifications

         Table 6 shows the results of regressing log income on background, college attributes, and the

individual's own measured aptitude. Aptitude rank is everywhere replaced by aptitude–with the proviso

that aptitude enters linearly rather than as a series of indicator variables.21 Table 6 displays only the

coefficients of interest–the estimated coefficients on the background variables are similar to those in Table

1–and only shows 1986 and 1995 since the OCG does not contain measures of aptitude.

         People with higher aptitude scores earn substantially more income. An improvement of 1 national

percentile point on the Verbal Aptitude test is associated with a 0.0168 log point increase in income in

1986. In addition, attending a college with a mean SAT verbal score that is 1 national percentile point

higher is associated with a 0.0116 log point increase in income. The corresponding numbers for 1995 are

0.0182 log points and 0.0131 log points. Thus, without controlling for college attributes, own aptitude has

a strong positive effect on wages and the effect appears to be increasing over time. This result is consistent

with those of previous studies on aptitude and the return to education (cited in footnote 2). Once we control

for college peers and expenditure per student, however, the increase in the return to aptitude shrinks.

Income is still increasing in an individual's own Verbal Aptitude and the mean SAT verbal score of his

college, and the returns appear to be increasing over time (though not by statistically significant amount).

An improvement of 1 national percentile point on Verbal Aptitude is now associated with a 0.0095 log

point increase in income in 1986 and a 0.0111 log point increase in 1995. Attending a college with a mean

SAT verbal score that is 1 national percentile point higher is associated with a 0.0083 log point increase in


         21
            If aptitude rank is made to enter linearly, the results are generally similar to those shown in Tables 1
and 2. The breakdown of the increase in the total variance of log income is as follows: 15.3% (total associated
with X), -7.9% (return to X), 23.2% (partial variance of X); 19.4% (total associated with Z), 16.6% (return to Z),
2.8% (partial variance of Z); 27.1% (total associated with W), 2.8% (return to W), 24.3% (partial variance of W).
                                                                                                              30

income in 1986 and a 0.0097 log point increase in 1995.

        Moreover, college attributes play an important role. A person who attends a college with a low

mean SAT verbal score is better off if his college has a high standard deviation of SAT scores. A person

who attends a college with high mean SAT verbal score ends up with the highest income if that college's

SAT scores were highly concentrated. An additional log point of expenditure per student generates an

increase in income of about 0.1 log points.

        Finally, Table 7 shows the accounting for the change in the variance of income for a number of

specifications that are alternatives to the baseline specification presented in Tables 1 and 2. The first

column restates the results of Table 2, for comparison. The next two columns show the accounting for the

increase in variance when actual aptitude measures are used. One of these columns is the counterpart of

Table 6; the other column use math tests rather than verbal tests but is otherwise identical to the

regressions shown in Table 6. It is noteworthy that measured aptitude accounts for a smaller share of the

increase in the total variance of income than the aptitude rank dummies accounted for. This is probably

because the aptitude measures are limited in scope so that they are an erroneous redaction of the full set of

aptitude data that college admissions officers perceive. The next column adds several additional variables

to the college attributes: the log average faculty salary, the faculty-student ratio, and the percentile of

expenditures devoted to instruction. The addition of these variables does increase the contribution of

college attributes slightly, but it is apparent that per-student expenditure was a adequate measure of

institutional inputs for many colleges.

        Strictly speaking, it is a poor idea to match each individual with his actual college's characteristics,

since an individual who is matched to a college that appears to unexpectedly selective (given his

characteristics) is likely to have positive traits that we do not observe. These unobserved positive traits

could bias the return to aptitude rank and college attributes upwards. A reasonable way to treat this

problem is simulated instruments–that is, instrumenting for a person's actual college characteristics with
                                                                                                             31

the college characteristics he would be predicted to experience. We formed simulated instruments by

creating a prediction equation for each state that was based on all the observations outside that state and its

adjoining states. In practice, we did not expect that instrumenting would reveal that the least squares

coefficients on college characteristics had suffered from positive bias. The reason is that college

characteristics are rather crudely measured, so that instrumenting might so improve attenuation bias that

any reduction in omitted variables bias would be fully offset. This expectation proved true: using the

simulated instruments raises the contribution of college characteristics very slightly.

          The final column of Table 7 illustrates an alternative approach to estimating the contribution of the

extensive margin. We controlled for the propensity score directly–the score was computed based on probit

regressions using the OCG. Regardless of whether we included other background variables directly in the

log income equation, the propensity score accounted for only a small share of the increase in the total

variance of income. This is probably because the prediction of the score imposes numerous restrictions on

relationship between the background variables and income. We also tried other, related methods of

controlling for the extension margin explicitly: the Heckman selection correction, censored regression,

weighting by the propensity score. Since we have no particularly convincing way to identify the selection

decision and we do not care to interpret the returns to background variables, our preferred method is

including all the background variables and assigning all partial variance due to them to the extensive

margin.



                                               VI. Conclusions

          In this paper, we attempt to explain the rising income and wage inequality among college educated

people. We find that we can explain about 70% of the increase in inequality among baccalaureate holders

and about 50% among people who have completed at least 2 years of college. Although we do not present

the results above, it is worth noting that we can explain only about 38% of the increase among people who
                                                                                                               32

have attended any college. As we move towards more marginal college attendees, our measures of aptitude

rank and college attributes fall off in quality. This quality degradation probably accounts for the fact that

our weakening aptitude to explain the increase in inequality among people with slight college experience.

        We find that the socio-economic and scholastic achievement backgrounds of people who are going

to college are becoming more diverse over time. However, we estimate that the income reward associated

with a good socio-economic background is falling over time so that the overall contribution of the extensive

margin to within-college income and wage inequality is significant but not large: about 1/4 of the total

increase in inequality.

        Like other researchers, we find evidence of an increased return to aptitude over the period. This

increased return is associated with about 1/3rd of the increase in income and wage inequality. However, we

also find that the estimated contribution of an increasing return to aptitude is almost doubled if we do not

allow the intensive margin to affect earnings.

        We find that the intensive margin explains about 5/12ths of the increase in the return to aptitude.

College peers and expenditures both make important contributions to the intensive margin. It is, perhaps,

slightly confusing to interpret the intensive margin, so it may be worthwhile to recall that the intensive

margin is identified (separately from aptitude) only because the way in which more and less able people

have been matched to college experiences has changed over time. If colleges were not becoming more

segregated on the basis of aptitude, it would be impossible to identify the interaction terms that make up the

peer effects. If colleges' per-student expenditures were not becoming more correlated with aptitude over

time, adding expenditures to the equation would not diminish the coefficient on aptitude–at an increasing

rate over time. This is not to say that the intensive margin can function separately from aptitude. A

reasonable interpretation of the results is that intensive margin represents the market equilibrium

distribution of human capital inputs to people, based on their aptitude. Perhaps market equilibrium in

previous years associated fewer peer and institutional inputs with highly able students–because mobility or
                                                                                                           33

other information costs prevented the current equilibrium from evolving. Since signaling equilibria are also

market equilibria, nothing in this paper enables one to easily dismiss the argument that the intensive margin

represents, at least in part, an elaborate mechanism for credibly signaling aptitude.

Standard error in parentheses. See Data Appendix Table for the number of observations in each regression, variable
means and standard deviations. No age effects are included in 1986 (NLS72) regressions because the survey is based on a
single high school class. Family income (when respondent was in high school) and college expenditure per student are in
1995 dollars. Both of these variables are in logs. Selectivity index combines information from college's average
admissions test scores and admissions procedures indexed by Barron's, Peterson's, and Cass and Birmbaum's college
guides. Standard deviations in SAT verbal scores are measured in 10s of percentile points (based on the national
distribution of SATscores). The omitted category is a college that is accredited but nonselective (aptitude rank index=1).
Such colleges do not have SAT score distributions, so the "main effect" of the standard deviation in SAT scores is
included.

The table shows selected coefficients from a regression with all of the covariates shown in Table 1. The only differences
are (1) that the two above measures of ability are substituted for the 11 indicator variables for colleges' aptitude rank and
(2) that the college's standard deviation in SAT verbal and the interaction of the standard deviation with the mean SAT
verbal score are substituted for the 11 interaction terms between aptitude rank and standard deviation of the SAT verbal.
Standard deviations of SAT scores are measured in 10s of national percentile points. See Table 1 and notes to Table 1.
