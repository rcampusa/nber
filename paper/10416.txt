Using a general-equilibrium simulation model featuring nominal rigidities and monopolistic

competition in product and labor markets, this paper estimates the macroeconomic benefits and

international spillovers of an increase in competition. After calibrating the model to the euro area

vs. the rest of the industrial world, the paper draws three conclusions. First, greater competition

produces large effects on macroeconomic performance, as measured by standard indicators. In

particular, we show that differences in competition can account for over half of the current gap in

GDP per capita between the euro area and the US. Second, it may improve macroeconomic

management by increasing the responsiveness of wages and prices to market conditions. Third,

greater competition can generate positive spillovers to the rest of the world through its impact on

the terms of trade.

1       Introduction

Why are there such large differences in income per capita across countries, both within the

industrial core and between this core and the rest of the world? For much of the postwar

period, the standard answer to this question focused on the process of technological catch-up.

More recently, however, it is becoming increasingly clear that structural differences across

countries play a key role, both directly and by providing impediments to the successful

implementation of macroeconomic policies.1 This switch in emphasis is particularly evident

in continental Europe, where the leading explanation of the continuing divergence in material

wealth from that of the United States is that labor and product markets are more hampered

by regulations than their U.S. counterparts.2 Indeed, the action plans endorsed in a series of

recent summits of European leaders suggests that increasing competition in Europe through

deregulation has become a major policy priority.3 Despite the importance of this topic,

however, estimates of the benefits from greater competition are limited.4

     This paper uses a general equilibrium model to estimate the effects of changing competi-

tion on performance within a country and spillovers to the rest of the world. Specifically, the

model posits imperfect competition in product and labor markets which drives a wedge be-

tween the true marginal cost/product and actual prices/wages. These markups are inversely

related to the degree of substitutability across goods/inputs, and hence the underlying level

of competition.5 A two-country setup involving the euro area and the rest of the world —

accounting for differences in labor supply across time and across countries.

where the calibration of the latter is based on the United States — is used to explore how

altering domestic competition in labor and product markets affects performance at home

and abroad across a wide range of elasticities/markups and other key parameters in the

model. Empirical estimates of euro area and U.S. markups are then used to estimate the

impact of increasing competition in the euro area to levels prevailing in the United States.

   Anticipating our conclusions, we find that increasing competition leads to sizable in-

creases in domestic output and consumption, as well as easing the task of the monetary

authorities by reducing the distortions associated with wage-price rigidities. These benefits

also provide positive spillovers to the rest of the world, mainly through a favorable terms of

trade effect which boosts consumption abroad by more than output.

   Indeed, our estimates of the potential long-term gains from greater competition in the

euro area are substantial, and would greatly diminish the difference in material well-being

between the euro area and the United States. Our simulations indicate that increasing

competition in the euro area to U.S. levels could boost output by 12.4 percent in the euro

area as both investment and hours worked rise markedly, and by 0.8 percent in the rest of

the world. The consumption benefits are more evenly spread, with euro area consumption

rising 8.3 percent versus 1.3 percent elsewhere. In addition, monetary policy becomes more

effective in the euro area, as the sacrifice ratio (i.e. the cost in foregone output required

to reduce inflation by 1 percent) declines significantly. These benefits come about because

greater competition reduces the monopolistic power of producers and workers, and hence

the degree to which they restrict their respective supplies to raise prices and wages, thereby

increasing the responsiveness of prices and wages to market conditions.

   The next section presents the theoretical background to the model. Section 3 discusses

the calibration and properties of the model. Section 4 assesses how changes in price and wage

markups impact the world economy, and reports a simulation in which euro area markups

fall to U.S. levels. Section 5 concludes.

2      The model

2.1         Consumption and investment goods

The world economy consists of two countries, Home (the euro area) and Foreign (the rest of

the industrial world). Foreign variables are indexed with a star. The structure of the model

is illustrated in Figure 1.6

     In each country there is a continuum of symmetric firms producing nontradable con-

sumption (A) and investment (E) goods under perfect competition. Home firms producing

the consumption good are indexed by x ∈ [0, s] and Foreign firms are indexed by x∗ ∈ (s, 1],

where 0 < s < 1 is a measure of country size and world size is normalized to 1.

     Home firm x’s output at time (quarter) t is denoted At (x).7 The consumption good is

produced with the following CES technology:
                ² 1                                                                ³ µµA−1
                                                                                      A
                   µA        1− µ1            1
                                                                             1− µ1
                                 A + (1 − ν ) A [M
        At (x) = ν A QA,t (x)                      A,t (x) (1 − ΓM A,t (x))]                             (1)
                                             µ                                   A
                                           A



Two intermediate inputs are used in the production of the consumption good A: a basket QA

of domestically-produced tradable goods, and a basket MA of imported tradable goods. The

elasticity of substitution between domestic and imported inputs is µA > 0, while ν A ∈ (0, 1)

is a measure of Home preferences toward domestic consumption goods.

     To model sluggish adjustment of imports volumes to changes in demand, we assume that

imports as a share of total production are subject to external adjustment costs ΓM A :8
                                                   ²                          ³2
                                          φ            MA,t (x) MA,t−1
                              ΓM A,t (x) ≡ M A                 /       −1                                (2)
                                            2           At (x)   At−1

As is the case for adjustment costs on investment dynamics, these adjustment costs tem-

porarily shrink the production possibilities frontier of the economy.

    6 The   model introduced in this section is a variant of the International Monetary Fund’s Global Economy
Model (GEM). For a detailed presentation of GEM see Laxton and Pesenti (2003) and Pesenti (2004).
    7 The
        convention throughout the model is that variables which are not explicitly indexed (to firms or
households) are expressed in per-capita (average) terms. For instance, At ≡ (1/s) 0s At (x)dx.
                                                                                 R

    8 According   to our specification, it is costly for the firm to adjust its current imports/output ratio
MA,t (x)/At (x) relative to the past aggregate (sectoral) imports/output ratio MA,t−1 /At−1 .

   The baskets QA and MA are CES indexes of differentiated intermediate tradables, re-

spectively produced in the Home country and imported from the Foreign country. Each

intermediate good is produced by a single firm under conditions of monopolistic competi-

tion. Home firms in the tradables sector are indexed by h ∈ [0, s], Foreign firms in the

tradables sector are indexed by f ∈ (s, 1]. Defining as QA (h, x) and MA (f, x) the use by

firm x of the intermediate goods produced by firms h and f respectively, we have:
                                        À² ³ 1 Z                         θ

                                              1                                  1− θ1∗

where θ, θ∗ > 1 are the elasticities of substitution across differentiated goods.

   In the Home country, the prices of the intermediate goods are denoted p(h) and p(f ).

Each Home firm x takes these prices as given and minimizes its costs. Home firm x’s demand

for input h is then obtained as:
                                                    ²                ³−θ
                                                        pt (h)             QA,t (x)
                                    QA,t (h, x) =                                                                    (5)
                                                         PQ,t                s

where PQ is the cost-minimizing price of one basket of local intermediates:
                                             ´² ³ Z s                 1
                                                                   µ 1−θ
                                               1            1−θ
                                    PQ,t   =          pt (h)    dh                                                   (6)
                                               s   0


Similarly we can derive MA (f, x) and PM — respectively firm x’s optimal demand of imports

f and the cost-minimizing price of the import basket.

   Next, each Home firm x takes the prices of the intermediate baskets PQ and PM as

given and minimizes PQ,t QA,t (x) + PM,t MA,t (x) subject to (1). Cost minimization in Home

consumption good production yields:
                  ²          ³−µA                                           ²                     ³−µA
                      PQ,t                                                          PM,t                     At (x)
 QA,t (x) = ν A                     At (x), MA,t (x) = (1 − ν A )
                       Pt                                                       Pt ΩM A,t (x)            1 − ΓM A,t (x)
                                                                                                                     (7)

where P is the price of the consumption good and the variable ΩM A (x) is a function of the



                                                         4
imports/output ratio.9

    Mutatis mutandis, the investment industry E is similar to the consumption sector

described above. Symmetric Home firms producing the investment good under perfect

competition are indexed by y ∈ [0, s], and Foreign firms by y ∗ ∈ (s, 1]. Home firm y’s

output is denoted Et (y). Using self-explanatory notation, output is given by:
                  ² 1                                                                 ³ µµE−1
                                                                                         E

                                             E



and the other variables related to E can be similarly derived.10

    Aggregating across x- and y-type firms we obtain the following Home demand for inter-

mediate domestic good h:
                       Z    s                          Z    s                      ²            ³−θ

                                QA,t (h, x) dx +                QE,t (h, y) dy =                      (QA,t + QE,t )          (9)

Similar considerations apply to Home demand for intermediate imported good f , accounting

for differences in country size:
             Z     s                         Z     s                                   ²             ³−θ∗

                       MA,t (f, x) dx +                ME,t (f, y) dy =                                     (MA,t + ME,t )   (10)

Foreign variables are similarly characterized.

   Each firm h uses a CES combination of differentiated labor inputs. Labor inputs are

immobile geographically. In each country, they are defined over a continuum of mass equal

to the country size: Home labor inputs are indexed by j ∈ [0, s], Foreign labor inputs by

j ∗ ∈ (s, 1]. We can then write:
                                         "² ³ 1 Z                    ψ

                                           s     0


where `(h, j) is the demand of the labor input of type j by the producer of good h and

ψ > 1 is the elasticity of substitution among labor inputs.

   Firms producing intermediate goods take the prices of labor inputs and capital as given.

Cost minimization in the intermediate sector implies that the demand for labor input j by

firm h is a function of the relative wage:

                                                 s    Wt

where W (j) is the nominal wage paid to Home labor input j and the wage index W is

defined as:

                                         s   0

   Denoting by R the Home nominal rental price of capital, cost minimization yields:

         `t (h) = (1 − α)                               ,   Kt (h) = α                                 (15)
                                M Ct (h)          Zt                         M Ct (h)          Zt

where the marginal cost M C(h) is given by:

                                  °                          1
                                                          ± 1−ξ
                        M Ct (h) = (1 − α) Wt1−ξ + αRt1−ξ       /Zt                                    (16)


Similar considerations hold for the production of Foreign intermediates.


2.3    Price setting in the intermediate sector

Consider now profit maximization in the Home country’s intermediate sector. In both

markets there is sluggish price adjustment due to resource costs measured in terms of total



                                                       6
profits.11 The adjustment cost are denoted ΓP Q,t (h) and Γ∗P M,t (h):
                                                          ³2                                 À                        !2

where φQ , φ∗M , ≥ 0. The quadratic costs of price adjustment are related to changes in firm

h’s price inflation relative to the past observed inflation rate in the relevant market, allowing

the model to reproduce realistic inflation dynamics encompassing nominal inertias. Each

firm h takes into account the demand for its product in both countries (that is, expression

(9) and the Foreign-country analog of expression (10)) and sets the nominal prices p(h) in

the Home market and p∗ (h) in the Foreign market by maximizing the present discounted

value of its real profits.

    Formally, denoting the nominal exchange rate as E (defined as Home currency per unit

of Foreign currency), firm h sets its prices by maximizing its profits:

where Dt,τ is the appropriate discount rate (with Dt,t = 1), to be defined below.

    Denoting π t (h) = pt (h)/pt−1 (h) and π Q,t = PQ,t /PQ,t−1 , the first-order condition with

respect to pt (h) can be written as:

                                                                     ∂ΓP Q,t (h)

                                             QA,t + QE,t         π Q,t+1             ∂pt (h)

                                                                                                                           (19)

    Equation (19) is key to our results. First, note that when prices are fully flexible (φQ =

0), the optimization problem collapses to the standard markup rule:

                                                                    θ
                                                     pt (h) =          M Ct (h)                                            (20)
                                                                   θ−1

 11 See   among others Rotemberg (1982) and Ireland (2001).



                                                                    7
where the fixed gross markup θ/ (θ − 1) is a negative function of the elasticity of input

substitution. When φQ > 0, changes in marginal costs translate only gradually into changes

in prices as instantaneous adjustment is costly (left hand side), but not too gradually to

avoid excessive adjustment in the future (right hand side).

   More crucially, (19) clarifies the link between imperfect competition and nominal rigidi-

ties. When θ is very large, (19) is solved by pt (h) ≈ M Ct (h) regardless of how sizable φQ is.

This implies that in a competitive economy (large θ) prices must move in tandem with the

shocks affecting marginal costs, even though such flexibility entails large adjustment costs.

Instead, if price setters have strong monopoly power (θ is close to one, its minimum value),

they can charge a high average markup over marginal costs. In this case, when marginal

costs increase due to cyclical conditions, firms find it optimal to maintain relatively stable

prices and absorb the change in production costs through a markup squeeze. In other words,

when θ is small, firms are able to keep their prices well above marginal costs and accom-

modate changes in demand through supply adjustments, without corresponding changes in

prices. Other things being equal, an increase in θ reduces the firms’ ability to use markup

fluctuations as a shock absorber.

   Similar considerations hold for the price of good h abroad, p∗ (h). If nominal rigidities in

the export market are highly relevant (that is, if φ∗M is relatively large), the prices of Home

goods in the Foreign market will be characterized by significant inertia.12 In the absence of

price stickiness, instead, optimal price setting is consistent with the cross-border law of one

price:
                                                          θ
                                          Et p∗t (h) =       M Ct (h)                                     (21)
                                                         θ−1

Foreign variables are similarly characterized.

 12 Substantially,   this is the ‘local currency pricing’ scenario with low exchange rate pass-through analyzed
by Devereux and Engel (2003), Corsetti and Pesenti (2001) and others.

2.4        Consumer optimization

In each country there is a continuum of symmetric households. Home households are indexed

by j ∈ [0, s] and Foreign households by j ∗ ∈ (s, 1], the same indexes of labor inputs.

Households’ preferences are additively separable in consumption and labor effort. Denoting

with Wt (j) the lifetime expected utility of Home agent j, we have:
                                             ∞
                                             X

                                             τ =t

where β is the discount rate, assumed to be identical across countries.

    There is habit persistence in consumption according to the specification:

where U 0 (j) is the marginal utility, Ct−1 is past per-capita Home consumption and 0 ≤

bC < 1. Similarly, the parametric specification of V is such that:

Home agents hold domestic money M and two bonds, B and B ∗ , denominated in Home

and Foreign currency, respectively. The short-term nominal rates it−1 and i∗t−1 are paid

at the beginning of period t and are known at time t − 1.14 The two short-term rates

allows for the possibility that there can be additional costs to large business cycles if they result in excessive
variability in labor effort.

are directly controlled by the national governments. Without loss of generality, only one

bond (namely, the Foreign-currency one) is traded internationally and is in zero net supply

worldwide, while the other (Home) bond is in zero net supply at the domestic level.15 A

financial friction (ΓB ) is introduced to guarantee that net asset positions follow a stationary

process and the economies converge asymptotically to a steady state, that is the baseline in

our simulation exercises.16

   Home agents accumulate Home physical capital which they rent to Home firms at the

nominal rate R. The law of motion of capital is:


                          Kt+1 (j) = (1 − δ) Kt (j) + Ψt Kt (j)            0<δ≤1                    (26)


where δ is the depreciation rate. To simulate realistic investment flows, capital accumulation

is subject to adjustment costs. Capital accumulation is denoted Ψt Kt (j), where Ψ(.) is a

function of the investment/capital ratio It (j)/Kt (j) such that Ψ(δ) = δ and Ψ0 (δ) = 1. The

specific functional form we adopt is quadratic and encompasses inertias in investment:
                                         ²               ³2          ²                   ³2

where φI1 , φI2 ≥ 0.

   Each household is the monopolistic supplier of a labor input j. Each household sets

the nominal wage for type j-labor input facing a downward-sloping demand, obtained by

aggregating (13) across h-firms. As in Kim (2000), there is sluggish wage adjustment due

to resource costs that are measured in terms of the total wage bill. The adjustment cost is

denoted ΓW,t , with:
                                                ²                           ³2
                                         φ          Wt (j)/Wt−1 (j)
                               ΓW,t (j) ≡ W                         −1                              (28)
                                          2          Wt−1 /Wt−2

 15 International   arbitrage makes the second bond redundant for consumption-smoothing purposes.
 16 Home   agents face a transaction cost ΓB when they take a position in the Foreign bond market. This
                                                                                    Rs ∗
cost depends on the average net asset position of the whole economy, that is (1/s) E 0 B (j)dj/P , and is
zero only when Home agents do not hold any Foreign-currency assets (ΓB (0) = 0). This implies that in a
non-stochastic steady state Home agents have no incentive to hold Foreign bonds and net asset positions
are zero worldwide.



                                                     10
where φW ≥ 0. As was the case for prices above, wage adjustment costs are related to

changes in wage inflation relative to the past observed rate for the whole economy.

    Consumption spending is subject to a proportional transaction cost ΓS that depends

on the household’s money velocity vt (j) ≡ Pt Ct (j)/Mt (j). Agents optimally choose their

stock of real money holdings M/P so that at the margin shopping costs measured in terms

of foregone consumption are equal to the benefits from investing in yield-bearing assets.17

   Home agents own all Home firms and there is no international trade in claims on firms’

profits. The variable Φ includes all profits accruing to Home households, plus all Home-

currency revenue from nominal adjustment rebated in a lump-sum way to all Home house-

holds, plus revenue from financial intermediation which is assumed to be provided by Home

firms exclusively. Finally, Home agents pay lump-sum (non-distortionary) net taxes T Tt (j)

denominated in Home currency. Similar relations hold in the Foreign country, with the

exception of the intermediation frictions in the financial market.

   The representative Home household chooses bond and money holdings, capital and con-

sumption paths, and sets wages to maximize its expected lifetime utility (22) subject to (25)

and (26). Defining the variable Dt,τ as:

                                        Pt U 0 (Cτ ) 1 + ΓS,t + Γ0S,t vt
                                                     ¢                   £
                              Dt,τ   ≡β             h                     i                          (29)
                                        Pτ U 0 (Ct ) 1 + ΓS,τ + Γ0S,τ vτ

which is Home agents’ stochastic discount rate and the Home pricing kernel, the first-order

conditions with respect to Bt (j) and Bt∗ (j) are, respectively:


                  1 = (1 + it ) Et Dt,t+1 = (1 + i∗t ) (1 − ΓB,t ) Et (Dt,t+1 Et+1 /Et )             (30)


The above expression is the risk-adjusted uncovered-interest-parity relationship, recalling

that the return on lending to Foreign is reduced (and the cost of borrowing from Foreign

is increased) by the costs of intermediation ΓB . The first-order conditions with respect to

Mt (j) and Kt+1 (j) are standard. Real money balances M/P are a positive function of

 17 Following   Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2004), the particular functional form for the transaction cost is
                               p
ΓS (vt ) = φS1 vt + φS2 /vt − 2 φS1 φS2 .



                                                    11
consumption and a negative function of the nominal interest rate. In steady state the real

price of capital 1 + R/PE is equal to the sum of the rate of time preference 1/β and the rate

of capital depreciation δ.

   More relevant for our purposes is the first order condition with respect to Wt (j), whose

dynamics is the analog of the price equation (19) above. In the absence of wage rigidities

(φW = 0) the real wage Wt (j)/Pt is equal to the marginal rate of substitution between con-

sumption and leisure, Vt0 /Ut0 , augmented by the markup ψ/ (ψ − 1) which reflects monopoly

power in the labor market.

   Optimization implies that households exhaust their intertemporal budget constraint: the

flow budget constraint (25) holds as equality and the transversality condition is satisfied:


      lim Et Dt,τ Mτ −1 (j) + (1 + iτ ) Bτ −1 (j) + (1 + i∗τ ) (1 − ΓB,τ −1 ) Eτ Bτ∗−1 (j) = 0
                 ¢                                                                        £
                                                                                                     (31)
   τ →∞



Similar results characterize the optimization problem of Foreign agent j ∗ .


2.5       Government

Public spending falls both on consumption and investment goods. In the model GC is

per-capita public purchases of the Home consumption goods and GI is public investment,

financed through net lump-sum taxes and seigniorage revenue. The budget constraint of

the Home government is:

                                            Z    s                  Z   s
                 sPt GC,t + sPE,t GI,t ≤             T Tt (j)dj +           [Mt (j) − Mt−1 (j)] dj   (32)
                                             0                      0


   The government controls the short-term rate it . Monetary policy is specified in terms of

an annualized Taylor rule18 of the form:

                                              h                i

 18 See   Taylor (1993).

where the left hand side is the annualized interest rate, it is the lagged interest rate (with

0 < ω i < 1) and it is the natural interest rate, defined as:

                                                                         ¡4         1 Pt

                                                                                   β 4 Pt−4

In the expression above Pt /Pt−4 is the year-on-year gross CPI inflation rate, and Πt is the

year-on-year gross inflation target.19 The term Y GAP denotes the output gap, which will

be defined in equation (40) below.

    Foreign variables are similarly characterized. Any steady-state discrepancy between i and

i∗ (thus, between Π and Π∗ ) determines the steady-state rate of exchange rate depreciation

(for Π > Π∗ ) or appreciation (for Π < Π∗ ).


2.6        Market clearing

The model is closed by imposing the following resource constraints and market clearing

conditions. The Home tradable h can be used by Home firms or imported by Foreign firms,

so that:

             Z     s                            Z     s                            Z       1                          Z     1

               0                                  0                                    s                                s

The Home good A can be used for private or public consumption, and similarly the Home

good E is used for private or public investment:

                               Z   s                            Z    s

The resource constraints for labor and capital are:

                                       Z    s                                      Z    s                Z    s

  19 In   a steady state with constant inflation target Π it is: π = Pt /Pt−1 = (Pt /Pt−4 )0.25 = Π0.25 , and
when all targets are reached it must be the case that:1 + it = 1 + it = Π0.25 /β.




                                                                              13
Similar expressions hold abroad.20

    Finally, market clearing in the asset market requires:

                          Z     s                   Z   s                   Z   1

Aggregating the budget constraints across private and public agents we derive the macroe-

conomic variables used in the simulation exercises. In particular, the output gap that enters

the policy rule (33) is defined as the deviation of real (constant-price) national income from

baseline:

3         Calibration and model properties

In our simulations the Home country (euro area) is assumed to make up 35 percent of the

industrial world, and the Foreign country is the rest of the industrial world with 1 − s =

0.65.22 Table 1 provides a summary of the main parameter values as well as steady-state

levels in the baseline solution of the model. In addition, Table 4 reports the elasticities

of substitution among labor inputs (ψ) and among differentiated goods (θ), as well as the

underlying steady-state wage and price markups, ψ/ (ψ − 1) and θ/ (θ − 1). In what follows

we discuss our assumptions.

  20 It   is worth noticing that in equilibrium p(n) = PN , p(h) = PQ , p(f ) = PM , p∗ (n) = PN
                                                                                               ∗ , p∗ (h) = P ∗ ,
                                                                                                             M

  21 In   the model, real income and other macro variables are measured in terms of consumption baskets,
and thereby affected by current changes in relative prices. In the simulation exercises where we compare our
results to other models, which are based on data from national accounts, our measure of real (constant-dollar)
GDP is obtained by evaluating expenditures using fixed (steady-state) relative prices.
  22 To    calibrate the dynamics of the Foreign country we rely heavily upon model results for the U.S.
economy.




                                                              14
3.1        Assumptions about elasticities

The inverse of the parameter ζ represents the Frisch elasticity of labor supply, which in the

baseline calibration of the model has been set to 1/3 (ζ = 3). This estimate is at the high

end of the range of estimates from micro studies, which vary from about .05 to .35, but is

significantly lower than what is typically used in the real business cycle literature (see e.g.

Cooley and Prescott (1995)). Because the results are sensitive to the assumption about this

parameter value, an alternative estimate that is closer to the mean estimates from micro

studies (0.15 or ζ = 6.7) is also considered.23

    In the baseline calibration of the model we set the elasticity of substitution between

domestic and imported inputs in the production of consumption and investment goods (µA

and µE ) equal to 2.5. These elasticities are critical determinants of the long-run spillover

effects of changes in the degree of competition in one country on other countries, because

they affect the behavior of net exports and the real exchange rate. An estimate of 2.5 is

lower than the estimate employed by Erceg, Guerrieri and Gust (2003) in a model of the US

economy,24 but it is significantly higher than what has been used in several previous macro

simulation models (e.g., see Laxton and others (1998), Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (2002),

Smets and Wouters (2002a), and Gali and Monacelli (2002)). The section on sensitivity

analysis shows the implications of reducing µA and µE to 1.5.


3.2        Assumptions about steady-state ratios

The following steady-state ratios are calibrated to be consistent with national accounts data.

The steady-state investment-to-GDP ratio is 22 percent in both countries, with 19 percent

representing private sector investment and 3 percent investment by the government. Based

  23 See   the discussion in Galı́, Gertler, and López-Salido (2002).
  24 The   authors argue that, in models with significant adjustment costs on imports, a large long-run import
price elasticity is not inconsistent with smaller estimates of short-run and medium-term elasticities as derived
from aggregate trade equations.




                                                        15
on a quarterly depreciation rate of 2.5 percent and identical total factor productivity in

the two countries (Z = Z ∗ ), this implies a steady-state capital-to-GDP ratio of around

2.2. The values for α and α∗ , the weight of capital in the production of tradables, imply a

smaller labor income share in the Home country (47 percent) than in the Foreign country

(58 percent), consistent with OECD data.

    The import-to-GDP ratio is set at 18 percent for the euro area and 13 percent for the rest

of the world (which is approximately the openness of the U.S. economy). Approximately

two thirds of imported goods in the euro area are investment goods, while for the United

States this figure is only slightly greater than one half. Consistently, the steady-state level of

imports of investment goods relative to GDP is 13 percent in the euro area and 7 percent in

the rest of the industrial world, allocating the remainder to imports of consumption goods.

These ratios were calibrated by setting the appropriate values for the scale parameters (ν A

and ν E ) in the import demand functions for both the Home and Foreign economies.


3.3        Assumptions about dynamics

As regards the short-term dynamic properties of the model, the appropriate parameters

have been calibrated to approximately replicate the monetary transmission mechanisms

embedded in policy simulation models developed at the European Central Bank (ECB) and

the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (FRB).25 The empirical apparatus of these models

does not build upon a choice-theoretic structure, but rather reflects the results of vector

autoregression (VAR) analysis as well as information specific to the two institutions. In

particular, our calibration mimics the dynamic responses to a 1-year interest rate hike in

the ECB’s Area-Wide Model (AWM) and the Board of Governor’s FRB-US model, followed

  25 Our   calibration gives rise to a plausible, empirically-based, representation of macroeconomic dynamics.
At a minimum, it establishes a sensible set of initial priors based on central bank modelers’ views about the
monetary transmission mechanism, setting the stage for the introduction of Bayesian estimation methods
as considered in Sims (2002).

by reversal to the baseline Taylor rule (33).26

    Table 2 reports the responses of key macro-variables to a 1-year hike in the policy rate in

the Home country of our model, and compares these responses with results from the same

experiment using the ECB’s AWM.27 Table 3 repeats the same experiment for the Foreign

economy, and the results are compared with those of the FRB-US model.28 To make the

results more easily comparable we have included a summary column in Table 2 and 3 that

reports the sum of the responses over the first two years of the simulation horizon.

    In both the AWM and FRB-US model, the maximum effect on consumption occurs

after about 3-4 quarters and the peak is about 3 to 4 times larger than the impact effect

in the first quarter. To obtain a similar hump-shaped response of consumption in our

simulations we combine a fairly high value for the consumption habit persistence parameter

(bC = 0.97 in both countries) with relatively high values for the intertemporal elasticity of

substitution (1/σ). In fact, in the simulations reported in Tables 2 and 3 we set 1/σ equal

to 5.0 in both countries. While the values of these elasticities are above the point estimates

typically adopted in structural models that ignore or downplay habit persistence, in the

context of our model they generate a realistically gradual build-up of the effects of interest

rate hikes over time, even in the absence of artificial assumptions such as predetermined

consumption expenditures and decision lags. An alternative parameterization based on a

more conventional logarithmic utility is discussed below.29

    To better assess the interaction of habit persistence and intertemporal substitution in

generating delayed consumption responses, Figure 2 reports some sensitivity analysis for

  26 The   rule in the simulations places equal weights of 0.5 on the output gap (ω 2 ), the inflation gap (ω 1 ),
and the interest rate smoothing term (ω i ). The money demand parameters φS1 and φS2 are set at 0.011
and 0.075 respectively as in Laxton and Pesenti (2003).
  27 These   responses are reported in Fagan, Henry and Mestre (2001).
  28 The   FRB-US results were kindly provided by David Reifschneider.
  29 When    preferences are additive over consumption and leisure, the main virtue of logarithmic utility is
that it gives rise to a balanced growth path.




                                                        17
exactly the same experiments conducted in Table 2 and 3. The top panel reports consump-

tion responses for the Home country without habit persistence in consumption (bC = 0) for

three values of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution that range between 1/3 and 3.0,

with an intermediate case of 0.99 that approximates the assumption of logarithmic utility.

The top panel shows that without habit persistence, consumption behaves as a pure jump

variable in response to interest rate hikes, and indeed in all three cases consumption peaks

(unrealistically) in the very first period when the shock is assumed to take place. The two

middle panels report results when the habit persistence parameter as been set at 0.6 and

0.8 respectively, well within the consensus range of estimates for b. Consumption in these

simulations falls significantly in the period when the shock occurs, and its magnitude grows

only slightly over the next two quarters before quickly reverting to baseline. Realistic dy-

namics is obtained only with a combination of high habit persistence and low values of σ,

as assumed in our calibration.30 Despite the close similarity of the dynamic paths, however,

it is worth noticing that in both the AWM and FRB-US model consumption reverts to

baseline more slowly than in the simulated responses of our model.

    To illustrate the implications of habit persistence in labor effort, Figure 3 shows the

responses of some key macrovariables to a permanent decline in the inflation target of the

Home country under different assumptions on the value of b` . As can be seen in the Figure,

high values of this parameter induce high persistence in the economy, as it can take well

over a decade for the economy to return to equilibrium following a disinflationary episode.

Based on our preliminary econometric analysis of U.S. data, we set b` equal to 0.5 in both

countries.31

  30 To   understand how combinations of bC and σ generate different dynamic responses it may be useful
to consider the linearized version of the Euler equation (30), ignoring transaction costs ΓS in eq. (29):
          bC               1          it −Et pt+1 +pt
ct =         c
         1+bC t−1
                    + Et 1+b ct+1 −       σ(1+bC )
                                                      .   As can be seen from this equation a habit persistence
                           C
parameter that approaches 1 induces a first-order lag that approaches 1/2 and, for a given σ, reduces the
sensitivity of consumption to changes in the real interest rate.
  31 A   caveat is worth mentioning. Our initial empirical work was based on pre-filtering the data prior to
estimation. We expect that estimates of parameters such as b` , which fundamentally influence the speed of




                                                           18
    A number of parameters have been calibrated to generate investment responses as consis-

tent as possible with the central bank models mentioned above. The elasticity of substitution

between capital and labor in the production function (ξ) is set at 0.80 in the Home country

and 0.70 in the Foreign country.32 Our model calibration assigns significant adjustment costs

to changes in investment (φI2 = 70 for the Home country and 80 for the Foreign country)

and very small adjustment costs to capital accumulation (φI1 = 1 for both countries).33

While these assumptions help to attenuate the volatility of investment in our simulations,

we note however that the estimated short-run responses may still be too sensitive to interest

rate shocks.

    Likewise, import adjustment costs have been calibrated to slow down the responsiveness

of the import shares to changes in relative prices. In our simulations it takes several quarters

before the import share adjusts to a permanent real depreciation. Over a time horizon of

about two years, the effective elasticity of the import share with respect to the real exchange

rate is around 1.5.

    The remaining dynamic coefficients to be calibrated are the adjustment cost parameters

on wages, prices and import prices. Given the empirical paucity of reliable estimates, it

was decided to allow for a baseline calibration based on full pass-through onto import prices

(φM = 0) and identical adjustment costs on wages and domestic prices.34 A value of 2800 for

φW and φQ is capable of approximately replicating the slow response of the price level in the

ECB’s model of the euro area and a value of 1400 is capable of replicating the significantly

faster response of the price level in the FRB-US model. Based on these parameters, the

adjustment of the model, might well contain significant pre-filter bias.
  32 The    parameters are different as the sensitivity of investment to interest rates appears to vary between
the euro area and the United States.
  33 This   calibration of the adjustment costs for investment dynamics is very similar to Altig and others
(2003) who assume zero adjustment costs on capital formation but significant adjustment costs on the
change in investment.
  34 Sensitivity   analysis shows that our results do not change significantly when we relax these assumptions.




                                                       19
sacrifice ratios are equal to 2.9 in the Home country and 1.3 in the Foreign country.

    There is however an important caveat. Models of the monetary transmission mechanism

that attempt to reproduce the properties of historical time series may significantly overstate

the degree of structural inflation persistence. This is because the inflationary inertias ob-

served in the data may partially result from a slow learning process during the transition

from high to low inflation regimes.35 In light of these considerations, estimates of φW and

φQ based on historical episodes of disinflation should be expected to be biased upwards.

Short of strong empirical evidence about the magnitude of this bias, we have reduced these

parameters in half to establish a benchmark calibration of the model (see Table 1). Based

on such parameterization of nominal rigidities, the sacrifice ratio is 2.0 in the Home country

and 0.9 in the Foreign country (Table 4).

    As a final check on the calibration of the system, we compared the impulse response

functions of the model with the VAR estimates by Altig and others (2003) for the U.S.

economy. The dashed lines in Figure 4 report the impulse responses (and confidence bands)

for the VAR while the solid line reports the responses in our model when the same interest

rate path is imposed on the Foreign economy for the first 8 quarters of the simulation

horizon. As can be seen in the Figure, with the exception of the impact responses, our

results generally fit within the confidence bands for output, consumption, investment and

the price level. It is noteworthy that our price level declines monotonically over time but

the VAR’s price level increases somewhat over the first year of the shock. This may reflect

the fact that different prices indices are reported from the VAR (the GDP deflator) and for

our model (the consumption deflator), as a result of which the VAR may have less feedback

from the real exchange rate.36

  35 See   Erceg and Levin (2001) and Laxton and N’Diaye (2002).
  36 Altig   and others (2003) emphasize that the initial effect of a rise in interest rates may be to raise
marginal costs, thus explaining why the price level needs to rise temporarily before declining.

4     Simulation results

This section focuses on how differing levels of competition affect macroeconomic perfor-

mance. Increases in competition feed into output and demand as they reduce the ability

of workers and firms to exploit market power by restricting the supply of goods and labor.

As a result, a greater level of competition implies a higher level of real output, investment,

and consumption. The rest of the world also benefits, as greater output in the Home coun-

try leads to an increase in the supply of exports to the Foreign country, and the induced

depreciation in the Home terms of trade boosts real incomes and consumption abroad. In

addition, as explained in the discussion of equation (19) above, greater competition makes

it easier for the monetary authorities to stabilize domestic output and inflation, leading to

less structural inflation persistence.


4.1     Effects of higher markups on economic activity

The impact of changing markups on the long-run levels of economic activity are shown in

Figure 5. Starting from a situation in which both labor and product markets are essentially

in competitive equilibrium, with a markup of 1/2 percent (implying underlying elasticities of

substitution ψ and θ equal to 200), competition in the product and labor markets is reduced

by increasing the relevant markup in increments of 5 percentage points to a final value of

around 55 percent (implying underlying elasticities of around 3, almost a hundred-fold lower

than the initial values). In all of these simulations, the other markups at home and abroad

are held at their baseline values reported in Table 4.37

    In analyzing these simulations, it is worth recalling the thought experiments being per-

formed. Lower competition across firms (lower θ) raises the price markup as these firm

reduce output to exploit their less elastic demand curves. The contraction in output affects

  37 This   ceteris paribus approach downplays the fact that lack of competition in product markets tends to
lead to higher wage markups, implying that the two markups are generally not independent of each other:
see Jean and Nicoletti (2002) and the discussion in Section 4.4.




                                                      21
capital more than labor effort (hereafter assumed to be equivalent to hours worked) as in the

long run labor is the less elastic resource. By contrast, lower competition in labor markets

(lower ψ) allows workers to exploit their greater market power by reducing hours worked, as

a result of which firms adjust their capital stock to remain efficient. In addition, the change

in consumption is closely allied to the change in labor effort as, in steady state, the disutility

of work has to be equated with the benefits of consumption (adjusted by the appropriate

relative prices).

    International spillovers depend crucially on the appreciation in the exchange rate as

competition falls. This appreciation reflects the reduction in availability of Home goods

as opposed to Foreign goods and the impact on the overall propensity to import stemming

from shifts in spending (investment has a higher foreign component than consumption). For

both reasons, spillovers are larger for product market reforms. This favorable terms of trade

effect cushions the impact on consumption at home and exacerbates it abroad.

    These considerations shed light on the simulations reported in Figure 5. The first feature

to note is that higher markups in either market (and hence lower levels of competition) lead

to mildly concave reductions in output and consumption at home and abroad. In the case

of product markets, for example, an increase in the price markup from half a percent to

five-and-a-half percent reduces output by 3.5 percent, while a similar increase from 50 to 55

percent reduces output by 1.9 percent.38 The costs associated with similar changes in wage

markups are around half of these values. Given that wages comprise around two-thirds of

costs, this implies that an increase in goods prices coming from greater competition across

firms is somewhat more detrimental to output than an equivalent increase in costs coming

from labor markets. An increase in the price markup has a particularly deleterious effect

on the capital stock, which falls by 50 percent as the markup rises from zero to one-half,

about double the reduction in output. Hours worked also decline, but by about two-thirds

  38 This   concavity stems largely from the fact that a percentage point increase in the markup has a smaller
percentage increase on overall prices or wages as the markup itself increases.




                                                       22
of the fall in output. Consumption is reduced by a similar amount as lower domestic output

and the fall in investment leads to a favorable terms of trade effect, with the exchange rate

appreciating by some 15 percent.

   Turning to the Foreign country, when the Home price markup rises from zero to one-

half output falls by around 2 percent (less than one-tenth of the reduction in the Home

country) as the demand for exports falls and the terms of trade become more unfavorable.

As a result of the latter effect, the fall in foreign consumption is larger than in output,

and indeed the ratio of the decline in Foreign to Home consumption is around one-fifth,

double the one-tenth figure for output. In short, a lack of product market competition has

significant consumption spillovers to the rest of the world.

   The effects of an increase in the wage markup of a similar magnitude produces a sig-

nificantly different response in domestic inputs, consumption, and spillovers to the rest of

the world. For an equivalent rise in the markup, output falls by under half as much. Labor

effort, investment, and consumption all fall by similar amounts to output. The impact on

consumption partly reflects the more limited real exchange rate appreciation, as the response

of output, investment, and goods prices is more muted than when price markups increase

by the same amount. The more limited exchange rate appreciation also constrains spillovers

to the rest of the world, with Foreign consumption falling by only about one-tenth of its

domestic equivalent.


4.2    Effects of higher markups on sacrifice ratios

Changes in product and labor market competition also have a significant impact on the

flexibility of monetary policy. A useful metric is provided by the sacrifice ratio, i.e. the

cumulative annual output gap that is required to permanently reduce the inflation rate by

one percentage point. Intuitively, monetary policy is easier to operate if the output losses

associated with changing inflation are small.

   Increases in the wage markup have a greater impact on the sacrifice ratio than equivalent



                                             23
changes in product markets. Figure 5 graphs the relationship between markups in goods

and labor markets and the sacrifice ratio. The differences in impact of the two markups

are substantial for low levels of the markup but erode as the markups increase, moving to

near equality at markups of around 50 percent. This reflects the fact that the relationship

is convex for price markups and concave for wage markups.

    The greater sensitivity of wage-price flexibility to labor market competition comes from

the fact that labor is the less elastic resource, and hence its price responds more in the

presence of market power. The bottom line of this analysis is labor market inefficiencies

have a smaller impact on long-term output than equivalent product market inefficiencies

but, for reasonable parameters, the opposite is true for monetary policy flexibility. These

differences largely reflect the fact that firms face direct competition from abroad while labor

does not. Both effects create negative spillovers to the rest of the world, either through

lower demand and a less favorable terms of trade (in the case of output) or a lower ability

to stabilize domestic output (in the case of monetary policy).39


4.3      Sensitivity analysis

We now examine the sensitivity of these results to changes in key parameters. Figure 6 re-

ports the results from reducing the Frisch elasticity of labor supply from 0.33 to 0.15, closer

to the mean of microeconomic estimates but further away from the values generally used in

real business cycle models, as discussed above. Compared to the baseline case, the more lim-

ited labor supply response approximately halves the impact of changes in the wage markup

on both domestic and foreign variables. For the price markup, the equivalent declines are

one-quarter to one-third, reflecting the greater importance of reductions in investment in

this case. The impact on the sacrifice ratio also decreases, particularly as regards the wage

  39 Andrés,   Ortega and Vallés (2003) emphasize that the relative degree of market competition across
countries is a crucial factor governing price responses to shocks. Small deviations in the degree of competition
may be responsible for temporary inflation differentials of up to 28 basis points when the economies are
subject to a common monetary policy shock.




                                                      24
markup, as lower flexibility in labor supply translates into more accommodation through

wages.

    The equivalent deep parameter for firms is the elasticity of substitution between labor

and capital. Figure 7 shows the results from shifting this parameter down by 0.1 in both

countries.40 This change has little impact on the simulations, particularly those examining

shifts in the wage markup. In the simulations of alternative price markups, it leads to a

mildly larger fall in hours worked and smaller reduction in investment than in the base case,

resulting in a slightly larger reduction in domestic consumption and smaller consumption

spillovers to the rest of the world. Changes in this elasticity also have only marginal effects

on the sacrifice ratio compared to the base case. The intuition for these small effects is that

capital is a reproducible factor of production while labor supply is much more constrained,

so that changes in the level of substitutability between capital and labor do not impact

capital inputs significantly.

    Next, changes in the degree of substitutability between domestic and foreign goods were

examined. Figure 8 reports the results when this elasticity is lowered from the baseline value

of 2.5 to 1.5, moving it toward the values found in macroeconomic studies and away from

those typical in microeconomic work. As might be expected, the main impact of decreased

substitutability between domestic goods and imports is to increase the exchange rate re-

sponse to changes in markups. This, in turn, increases spillovers to the rest of the world

through its impact on purchasing power at home and abroad. Indeed, both the appreciation

of the real exchange rate and the impact on foreign consumption doubles compared to that

in the baseline, while the ratio of the change in Foreign to Home consumption rises by even

more, as the appreciation cushions some of the impact on Home consumers.

    Finally, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution on consumption was reduced in both

countries to unity (0.99 to be exact), corresponding to the log-utility value used in many

  40 This   is a more limited shift in value compared to the base case than for the other parameters, as larger
changes in this coefficient require a recalibration of other parts of the model.




                                                       25
other papers. As discussed earlier, this switch has significant implications for the short-

term consumptions dynamics of the model. It turns out, however, that this change has a

relatively limited impact on how shifts in markups affect long-term activity, with domestic

consumption losses from higher markups being reduced by 15-20 percent and their foreign

counterparts by more like 30 percent (Figure 9).

   To summarize, with the important exception of the Frisch elasticity, changing key param-

eters in the rest of the model generally has only negligible effects on the impact of changes

in competition on the domestic economy, but alter the international spillovers significantly.

The intuition is that in the Home economy changes in markups have a first-order effect

which tends to dominate, but the spillovers to the Foreign country come through indirect

channels which are much more sensitive to the specification of the rest of the model. The

Frisch elasticity is an exception as it directly affects the degree to which workers need to

constrain their labor input to achieve a desired rise in markups, and hence has a first-order

effect in the simulations.


4.4    How much is a lack of competition costing the euro area?

The analysis above can be applied to gauge the detrimental effects of low levels of compe-

tition in the euro area on the euro area itself and the rest of the world. The first stage in

this process is to calculate reasonable estimates of price and wage markups from existing

empirical work. A number of authors have looked at price markups by sector following the

initial work on U.S. manufacturing by Hall (1988). But data for U.S. manufacturing may

be atypical for at least two reasons. The United States has a lower regulatory burden than

other countries, implying more competitive markets and lower markups, and manufacturing

is probably more competitive than other sectors of the economy because of the high level

of penetration by foreign producers. To get a broader view of markups, we use results from

Martins, Scarpetta, and Pilat (1996) who estimate price markups across a wide range of

countries and sectors using the methodology of Roeger (1995). Weighting reported markups



                                             26
by value added across sectors produces an estimated average markup of 23 percent in the

United States and 35 percent in the euro area. These are considerably higher than the

estimates for manufacturing of 15 and 19 percent, respectively.41

    Earlier calibrations of wage markups have tended to look at evidence on elasticities of

demand in the United States (see e.g. Smets and Wouters, 2002b). We take a different

approach to estimating these wage markups, based on observed wage differentials across

industries in different countries after controlling for other factors such as skill levels of the

work force and age of workers, as reported in Jean and Nicoletti (2002). The wage markup

is estimated by comparing wages in sectors in which labor is likely to have relatively little

bargaining power to the average wage across the economy as a whole. The three sectors in

which labor was assumed to have little bargaining power were textiles, worn apparel, and

leather, all fragmented industries facing stiff competition from abroad. The results imply

a wage markup of around 16 percent for the United States and around 24 percent for the

euro area (based on GDP-weighted data for France, Italy, Austria, Belgium, Greece, and

Ireland).42

    Jean and Nicoletti (2002) also find that regulation in product markets is linked to higher

wage markups, implying that labor is able to capture some of the rents accruing from lower

competition due to regulation. This suggests that the markups on wages and prices are

linked to some extent, although the wage premium can also depend upon numerous other

factors, including whether the industry is in the private or public sector. In fact, regulation

drives up relative wages in the private sector, but drives down relative wages when the

industry is publicly owned. The later effect is large — for a given level of regulation the

  41 In   addition, Martins, Scarpetta and Pilat (1996) note that manufacturing markups are often lower
in homogeneous industries, characterized by low R&D spending, than differentiated industries where such
spending is higher, and this difference may reflect the return to innovation. Simple calculations suggest that
the markup for homogeneous manufacturing industries is about 11 percent in the United States compared
with 19 percent in the euro area, with little impact on the economy-wide markups quoted above.
  42 Germany    is not included in the study. Spain is also excluded, as mentioned in the text, as the high use
of part-time workers reduces the reliability of the results.



                                                      27
coefficient changes from 0.2 to minus 0.35 — possibly reflecting underlying inefficiencies

associated with public ownership of commercial industries. This implies that the wage

premiums due to high levels of regulation and hence low levels of competition may be

larger than these numbers suggest for the euro area (the numbers for the United States are

essentially unaffected, given the low level of public ownership). Calculating the bias requires

assumptions about the degree of regulatory impediments in the euro area and level of public

ownership. Back of the envelope calculations suggest, however, that it is probably of the

order of 0.06, a number we adopt.43

    Based on these results, the wage markup was set at 16 percent for the United States

and 30 percent for the euro area, and the price markup at 23 percent for the United States

and 35 percent for the euro area (see Table 4). As a further check, we also looked at the

estimates of overall differentials for a large number of disaggregated manufactured goods

across countries reported in Bradford and Lawrence (2003). Their empirical results yielded

an estimate of the overall gap between marginal costs and prices of 15-20 percent in the

United States and 50 percent or so in the euro area. These numbers are broadly consistent

with our assumed values of wage and price mark-ups. Other parameters are set at their

baseline levels.

    The long-term effects, summarized in Table 5, are that if the euro area increased com-

petitiveness in both labor and product markets to U.S. levels real output would rise by

12 12 percent, with the capital stock increasing by over double that of hours worked (over 20

percent compared to 10 percent). The output and labor input spillovers to the rest of the

world are relatively muted (under 1 percent), so that the rise in relative output represents

over half of the gap in per capita GDP and labor utilization between the two regions (see

  43 Assume   that the average regulatory burden in the public sector in the euro area is larger than the
economy as a whole by around 1 1/2 (see Figure 1 in Jean and Nicoletti (2002)) and that such activity
makes up 5-10 percent of the euro area economy. The bias is equal to (1 1/2 (additional regulatory burden)
times (0.2+0.35) (bias in the coefficient on regulation) times 0.05 or 0.1 (proportion of activity in public
sector) divided by 0.95 or 0.9 (proportion of activity not in public sector), which given a range of 0.04-0.09.

OECD (2003), Figure 1.1). The effects on consumption are more evenly spread, with an

increase in consumption of over 8 percent in the euro area and 1 14 percent in the United

States, reflecting the real depreciation of the euro of some 5 percent. There is also a fall of

about one-third in the sacrifice ratio, from 2 to 1.4 (see Table 6).44 In short, an analysis of

these conventional macroeconomic indicators would suggest that greater competition in the

euro area will be felt in both the euro area and the rest of the world.

    Tables 5 and 6 also report results when the product and wage markups are changed

separately. Greater product market competition has larger effects on activity than reducing

labor market rigidities, with these differences being much starker for investment, output,

and international spillovers than for consumption or labor effort. In the case of the sacrifice

ratio, the impact of product and labor market reforms are the same, reflecting the relatively

large effect on domestic nominal rigidities discussed above.

    An important advantage of a choice-theoretic model with explicit microfoundations is

that the costs and benefits of a change in competition can be evaluated directly by com-

puting the change in consumer welfare, measured in consumption equivalents.45                               More

competition-friendly policies have two effects on welfare: a positive one stemming from

higher consumption, and an offsetting reduction attributable to higher levels of labor effort.

This is obviously important in the simulation above, as both consumption and labor effort

in the euro area rise by the same amount (8.3 percent). However, as shown in Table 5 the

net effect on welfare is positive (2.4 percent in terms of consumption equivalents) because

  44 This   remains above the 0.9 estimate for the United States, as the euro area has higher costs of adjust-
ment.
  45 Denoting   C and ` as the baseline levels for consumption and labor effort, and Cnew and `new as the
new steady-state levels after the markup change, the consumption equivalent Ceq is defined implicitly by
W (Ceq , `) = W (Cnew , `new ), that is a measure of the permanent change in consumption required to achieve
the new level of utility holding labor effort constant at its original (baseline) steady-state value. Note that our
model specification implies that the marginal utility (disutility) of consumption (labor effort) is independent
of habit persistence parameters bc and b` . When we compute the long-term effects of a change in markups
on consumer welfare, the utility metrics also abstracts from habit persistence in either consumption or labor
effort.




                                                        29
the rise in utility associated with additional consumption is higher than the disutility from

additional labor effort. From this welfare perspective, it can be seen that spillover benefits

of reforms are about one half of the magnitude in the rest of the world (1.2 percent increase

in welfare), as the effect of the increase in consumption is not significantly offset by the

much smaller increase in hours worked (0.2). It can also be seen in the Table that about 3/4

of these increases in welfare are attributable to product market reforms, and the remainder

to more competitive labor markets.



5     Conclusion

This paper has examined the benefits from greater competition in product and labor markets

using a choice-theoretic, general-equilibrium model of the global economy. Lower levels of

competition are associated with significantly reduced output and consumption at home and

abroad, with the spillovers in consumption being larger than those in output due to an

appreciation in the domestic real exchange rate. In addition, lower levels of competition

affect macroeconomic policies by increasing nominal inertia in the model. This reduces the

flexibility of domestic monetary policy, making it more difficult for the central bank to

stabilize the economy in the face of disturbances.

    Our simulations produce plausible empirical estimates of the effects of structural polices

to improve competition. Changes in goods and wage markups have significantly different

effects on the economy. Greater competition across firms leads to a more marked rise in the

capital stock and output, and larger benefits to the rest of the world. Indeed, in our base

case parameterization, the rise in foreign consumption is some 20 percent of that at home.

Greater competition in labor markets results in a more marked increase in hours worked,

nominal flexibility, and somewhat smaller international spillovers. Experiments varying the

value of key elasticities indicate that the impact on the home country are relatively robust,

while the size of the international spillovers is more sensitive to the parameterization of the




                                              30
rest of the model.

   Applying the model to the euro area, structural polices that increase competition toward

U.S. levels (based on empirically estimated markups in both regions) are found to increase

output in the euro area by some 12 12 percent, and that in the United States by 1 percent.

The implied change in relative output represents around half of the current difference in per

capita GDP. The gains in consumption are more evenly spread, with euro area consumption

rising by 8 percent and U.S. consumption up 1 41 percent, in part because the euro depreciates

against the dollar by some 5 percent. In both countries the net effect on welfare is positive,

as gains from higher consumption more than offset losses from higher labor effort. Equally

importantly, these policies also benefits European policymakers by reducing the distortions

associated with nominal rigidities, thereby making monetary policies more effective. Indeed,

the sacrifice ratio (defined here as the cumulative output cost of reducing inflation by one

percentage point) falls by a third.

   While structural policies are being viewed increasingly as a source of differences across

countries, empirical estimates of their macroeconomic effects have to date been extremely

limited. This paper represents a preliminary attempt to bridge the gap, by providing an

explicit theoretical and empirical methodology to calculate the impact of more competition-

friendly reforms. At the same time, it should be emphasized that our exercise represents but

an initial experiment. More work will have to be done to examine how robust our results

are to varying structures and assumptions. For instance, the role of tax asymmetries could

be analyzed in light of the results by Prescott (2003). In addition, one can think of many

more structural policies whose effects could be examined along similar lines, for example

trade liberalization. An ambitious and exciting agenda lies ahead.
