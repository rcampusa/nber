                                            ABSTRACT

Using a large sample of institutional investors’ private equity investments in venture and buyout
funds, we estimate the extent to which investors’ skill affects returns from private equity
investments. We first consider whether investors have differential skill by comparing the
distribution of investors’ returns relative to the bootstrapped distribution that would occur if funds
were randomly distributed across investors. We find that the variance of actual performance is
higher than the bootstrapped distribution, suggesting that higher and lower skilled investors
consistently outperform and underperform. We then use a Bayesian approach developed by
Korteweg and Sorensen (2015) to estimate the incremental effect of skill on performance. The
results imply that a one standard deviation increase in skill leads to about a three percentage point
increase in returns, suggesting that variation in institutional investors’ skill is an important driver
of their returns.

1.   Introduction

        Institutional investors have become the most important investors in the U.S. economy, controlling

more than 70% of the publicly traded equity, much of the debt, and virtually all of the private equity.

Their investment decisions have far reaching consequences for their beneficiaries: universities’ spending

decisions, pension plan funding levels and consequent funding decisions by states and corporations, as

well as the ability of foundations to support charitable endeavors all depend crucially on the returns they

receive on their investments. For this reason, the highest paid individuals in these organizations are often

their investment officers. This high level of pay is often controversial, and it is not clear from existing

evidence whether these compensation decisions are optimal.1 If investment performance is random, then

it is hard to justify this high level of pay; however, if higher quality investment officers lead to better

returns, then it potentially makes sense to pay high salaries to attract them.

        One place where investment officers’ skill is potentially important is their ability to select private

equity funds. The private equity industry has experienced dramatic growth since the 1990s, bringing the

total assets under management to more than $3.4 trillion in June 2013 (Preqin). Most of the money in this

industry comes from institutional investors, and private equity investments represent a substantial portion

of their portfolios. Moreover, the variation in returns across private equity funds is large; the difference

between top quartile and bottom quartile returns has averaged approximately nineteen percentage points.

Evaluating private equity partnerships, especially new ones, requires substantial judgment from potential

investors, who much assess a partnership’s strategy, talents, experience, and even how the various

partners interact with one another. Consequently, the ability to select high quality partnerships is one

place where an institutional investor’s talent is likely to be particularly important. However, it is not

known whether different institutional investors on average receive different returns. Moreover, it is not

 For example, Harvard University pays its top 5 endowment officers more than $100m annually, a pay package that
has generated much negative attention recently (see Bloomberg, August 27, 2014).

clear whether any differences in returns across investors reflect the investors’ skill, their access to better

private equity groups, or just random luck.

        In this paper, we consider a large sample of limited partners’ (LPs’) private equity investments in

venture and buyout funds and estimate the extent to which manager skill affects the returns from their

private equity investments. Our sample includes 12,043 investments made by 630 unique LPs, each of

which have at least four private equity investments in either venture capital or buyout funds during the

1991 to 2006 period. We first test the hypothesis that skill in fund selection, in addition to luck, affects

investors’ returns. We then estimate the importance of skill in determining returns. Our results imply that

an increase of one standard deviation in skill leads to about a 3% increase in IRR. The magnitude of this

effect suggests that variation in skill is an important driver of institutional investors’ returns.

        We first perform a model-free test of whether there is differential skill in selecting private equity

investments. We use a bootstrap approach to simulate the distribution of LPs’ performance under the

assumption that all LPs are identically skilled (i.e., that there is no differential skill and all differences in

performance reflect random luck). We measure performance first in terms of the proportion of an LP’s

investments that are in the top half of the return distribution for funds of the same type in the same

vintage year, and then in terms of average returns across all of the LP’s private equity investments. The

comparison with the bootstrapped distributions suggests that more LPs do consistently well (above

median) or consistently poorly (below median) in their selection of private equity funds than what one

would expect in the absence of differential skill. Furthermore, statistical tests of the standard deviation of

LP performance shows that there is more variation in performance that what one would expect in the

absence of differential skill. These results hold when restricting the analysis to various subsamples by

time period, fund and investor type. These analyses suggest that there are more LPs who are consistently

able to earn abnormally high returns than one would expect by chance. Some LPs appear to be better than

other LPs at selecting the GPs who will subsequently earn the highest returns.



                                                            2
        To quantify the magnitude of this skill, we extend the method of Korteweg and Sorensen (KS)

(2015) to measure LP skill. The KS model assumes that the net-of-fee return on a private equity fund

consists of three main components: a firm-specific persistent effect, a firm-time random effect that applies

to each year of the fund’s life, and a fund-specific random effect, as well as other controls. We first use

this model to estimate the firm-specific component that measures the skill of each GP managing the

private equity funds in our sample. We use these estimates to strip away any idiosyncratic random effects

from the returns on each fund, thereby adjusting them so that they reflect only the skill of the GP. Then,

using Bayesian regressions, we estimate the extent to which LPs can pick high ability GPs for their

investments. The estimation is done by Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques, and allows us

to measure the extent to which more skillful LPs earn higher returns.

        The results from the extended KS model imply that a one standard deviation increase in LP skill

leads to an expected three-percentage point increase in annual IRR from their private equity investments.

The effect is even larger for venture capital investments, in which a one standard deviation increase in

skill leads to a five-percentage point increase in returns.       The large magnitude of these estimates

highlights the importance of skill in earning returns from private equity investments.

        An alternative explanation for the results we report is that LPs have different risk preferences.

Without data on individual LPs’ risk preferences, we cannot directly test how much of the difference in

returns occurs because of differing risk preferences. However, LPs within the same type are more likely to

have the same risk preferences and investment objectives. Accordingly, we divide LPs into endowments,

pension funds, and all others. Within each type, we also observe more variation in LP performance than

would be expected if LPs had no differential skill. Therefore, at least to the extent that risk preferences are

driven by investor type, differing risk preferences do not appear to be driving the observed differences in

returns across LPs.

        Another potential explanation for the differences in performance across LPs is that different LPs

have different access to funds, so that certain LPs can invest in higher quality LPs than others can. Both

                                                           3
the bootstrap and Bayesian tests we present assume that LPs are able to invest in any fund they select.

However, some of the most successful general partnerships limit investments in their funds to their

favorite LPs and do not accept capital from others. Consistent with the importance of limited access,

Sensoy, Wang, and Weisbach (2014) argue that access to better performing venture capital funds likely

explains endowments’ outperformance in 1990s.

        To evaluate the extent to which limited access explains the differential performance across

investors, we compare LPs’ average returns with bootstrapped returns using first-time funds only, because

first-time funds generally accept commitments from any investor willing to make one. If the main results

were driven by differential access as opposed to differential selection skill, we would not expect to find

any systematic differences across LPs in the performance of their investments in first-time funds.

Contrary to this explanation, we find that more LPs do consistently well or poorly in first-time venture

and buyout funds compared to hypothetical first-time investments made randomly. The standard deviation

of LPs’ average returns in first-time funds is also significantly higher than those obtained from bootstrap

simulations. In addition, estimates from the Korteweg-Sorensen (2015) model restricted to first-time

funds suggest that skill remains an important determinant of performance. Consequently, the systematic

differences in returns across LPs do not appear to occur only because those LPs have better access to the

best private equity funds. Better access does appear to help explain some of the superior performance,

such as that of endowments’ investments in venture capital during the 1990s (Lerner, Schoar, and

Wongsunwai (2005)). However, the evidence of some LPs’ systematic outperformance goes well beyond

established venture capital partnerships during this period, and appears to exist in first time funds, in

buyout funds and in other time periods as well.

        In summary, our results suggest that skill is an important factor in the performance of institutional

investors in their private equity investments. Relative to their peers, some LPs perform consistently well,

while some perform consistently poorly. This outperformance exists for these LPs’ investments in both

buyout and venture investments, and the differences are economically meaningful.

        Although there is no prior work analyzing the performance of individual institutional investors in

private equity, this paper is related to much previous work analyzing the performance of portfolio

managers. One of the classic literatures in finance, beginning with Jensen (1968), measures abnormal

performance and performance persistence of mutual funds. Recent contributions in this literature have

taken a Bayesian approach similar to that used here to evaluate the performance of hedge funds and

mutual funds.2

        In the private equity area, Kaplan and Schoar (2005) are the first to apply persistence tests to

measure ability, but the ability they measure is of the general partners who manage the funds, not the

institutional investors who choose between general partners. Korteweg and Sorensen’s (2015) estimates

suggest that there is long-term persistence at the private equity firm (GP) level, but also that past

performance is a noisy measure of GP’s skill. An implication of this result is that evaluation of GPs is

particularly difficult, consistent with our conclusion about the value of LP skill.

        These papers measure the abilities of portfolio managers, while our work measures the

performance of investors who choose between these managed portfolios. As such this work is related to

Lerner, Schoar, and Wongsunwai (2007) and Sensoy, Wang and Weisbach (2014), who study limited

partners’ investments in private equity funds. However, these papers focus on differences across classes

of investors, while our focus is on the individual LPs and their choices. Another related paper studying

LP investments is Hochberg and Rauh (2013), who find that pension fund investors overweight in local

private equity funds, which tend to underperform. The Hochberg and Rauh (2013) finding highlights the

importance of evaluating the performance of limited partners in private equity funds, as they estimate that

this one distortion costs public pension funds $1.2 billion per year.

2.1. Data Sources

        To examine LPs’ private equity investments, we construct a sample of LPs using data obtained

from two sources: VentureXpert provided by Thompson Economics and S&P’s Capital IQ. While these

two sources do not provide a complete list of LPs’ investments, we identify a large sample of 32,599

investments of LPs in private equity funds starting from 1991.

        For each investment, we match fund-level information with venture and buyout returns data from

Preqin. Funds raised after 2006 are excluded to provide sufficient time to observe the realization of the

fund’s return. Since we rely on internal rates of return (IRR) as our primary measure of LP performance,

we drop investments with missing IRR or fund size. These restrictions leave a sample containing 14,380

investments made by 1,852 LPs. In addition, we restrict our sample of LPs to those making more than 4

investments in either venture or buyout funds. Our final sample contains 12,043 investments made by 630

unique LPs in 1,195 unique funds.

        As a supplement to IRR, we also calculate an “implied public market equivalent (PME)”

generated from fund IRRs and multiples, using the method described in Harris, Jenkinson, and Kaplan

(2014).3 The PME approach is an increasingly popular method of measuring performance of illiquid

assets (see Korteweg and Nagel (2016) and Sorensen and Jagannathan (2014) for discussions of

methodological issues). The results from the tests using implied PMEs are similar to the ones discussed

below and are available from the authors on request.

2.2. Sample Characteristics

        Table 1 reports summary statistics for all funds, venture funds, and buyout funds at both the LP

level and fund level. Panel A shows the number of observations, mean, median, Q1, and Q3 values of

each LP characteristics. On average, each LP invests in 19.12 funds. Because we restrict our sample to


3
 Although Preqin reports fund IRRs and multiples, it does not report PMEs and calculating them requires the
underlying cash flow data, which we do not have. Therefore, to compute the implied PME, we rely on regression
coefficients reported by Harris, Jenkinson, Kaplan, and Stucke (2013) to impute PMEs from IRRs and multiples.
When a private equity firm raises multiple funds in a given year, we aggregate all funds in that year and compute
size-weighted PME.
                                                            6
LPs with at least 4 investments, the first quartile value for Number of investments per LP is 5 funds. The

average return of LPs’ investments shows an IRR of 10.59%. For a better comparison with the public

market, we also report the estimated implied PME for a subsample of LPs in the 1993 to 2006 period. The

implied PME of 1.29 indicates an average return that is substantially higher than that of the S&P 500. In

general, buyout funds’ returns are higher than those of venture funds. LPs’ investments in buyout funds

are also larger than those in venture funds.

        Panel B reports summary statistics of LPs’ investments at the fund level. The average IRR is

11.02% and average implied PME is higher than the benchmark S&P 500. Buyout funds have higher

returns than venture funds and are larger in size. On average, there are 10.12 LPs in each fund over the

entire sample. Since venture funds tend to be smaller than buyout funds, venture funds have fewer LPs,

with an average of 7.62 LPs for the venture funds in our sample, and 12.58 LPs for the buyout funds. The

average performance of funds in our final sample is close to that of all funds with performance

information available in Preqin, suggesting that our sample is representative of the universe of private

equity funds.

        While the sample comprises a large number of LPs and their investments, it does not necessarily

include all investments made by any particular LP, nor does it include all of the LPs in a given fund. The

coverage is better for later periods as well as for public entities, such as public pension funds and public

universities, whose investments are subject to federal and state Freedom of Information Acts. Another

drawback of the sample is the lack of commitment data, which precludes us from calculating LPs’ total

returns. Instead, we use the reported IRRs of the funds in which the LPs invest. We calculate these

returns both equally weighting the returns and weighting them by the log of the fund’s capital under

management.



3. Model-free Tests of Differential Skill in Selecting Private Equity Funds

3.1. Qualitative Assessment

                                                         7
        In this section, we evaluate whether LPs appear to have differential skill in picking private equity

investments. If LPs differ in their ability to select private equity funds, then the more able LPs should

consistently outperform, and the less able LPs should consistently underperform. This persistence in

performance should be greater than what would be expected by chance.

        Of course, such persistence could be due to differential access to top-performing GPs or

differential tolerances for risk in addition to or instead of differential skill. We take up these alternative

explanations explicitly in Section 5. The results presented there suggest that differential access or risk

tolerances are unlikely to explain the main results. Consequently, until Section 5, for brevity of exposition

we refer to evidence of differences in LP performance beyond what would be predicted by chance as

evidence of LP skill.

        While there is no literature measuring the skill of individual LPs of private equity funds, there is a

large literature measuring the skill of other portfolio managers. The conventional approach to measuring

skill in other contexts has been to estimate a regression of returns on lagged returns. This approach

measures skill by the extent to which returns from the previous fund are predictive of returns from the

next fund. Although this approach has some appeal as a simple, intuitive test, it takes a relatively narrow,

short-term view of skill, and ignores longer-term patterns of returns. For instance, an LP who makes five

outperforming investments in a row, followed by five underperforming investments, is unlikely to be

more skillful than an LP who alternates the same number of outperforming and underperforming

investments.4

        We measure skill for each LP using approaches that are not dependent on the particular timing of

the investments’ returns. We first calculate the percentage of an LP’s investments in the top half of funds

of a particular type (e.g., venture or buyout) for a given vintage year.5 We assess whether different LPs

have differential skill by examining the distribution of this measure across LPs, which we refer to as the


4
  See Korteweg and Sorensen (2016) for a critique of the merits of the regression approach.
5
  We could extend the analysis to quartiles or deciles, but a finer cutoff would make the comparisons more difficult
to interpret.
                                                             8
“distribution of LP persistence”. The more variation there is in skill among LPs, the more variance there

should be in the distribution of LP persistence.

        In the next subsection, we conduct formal tests of differential skill based on the variance of the

distribution of LP persistence. However, in boiling the distribution down to a single summary statistic,

we risk losing potentially useful information. Therefore, we begin with a qualitative comparison of the

empirical distribution of LP persistence with the hypothetical distribution that would occur if LP

investments were made randomly.

        If the only source of variation in returns were random chance, then every investment would have

a 50% chance of being in the top half of the return distribution for its year, regardless of the identity of the

LP making it. Therefore, the distribution of LP persistence would be approximately bell shaped. 6 In

contrast, the empirical distribution, shown in Figure 1, is negatively skewed with tall tails in each end.

This pattern suggests that there are more LPs with persistently good and bad performance than what one

would expect by chance.

        Figure 1 also characterizes LPs’ investments in venture capital and buyout funds separately. The

distribution of LP persistence in venture capital funds is similar to that in all investments. The figure

shows negative skewness and tall tails on both sides in the distribution of LP persistence in venture capital

funds. The distribution for buyout funds is more symmetric, and the tails are shorter compared to what we

observe for venture funds. However, the tails on both ends are still taller than what one would expect

from a bell-shaped distribution.

        In summary, Figure 1 suggests that LPs’ performance differs from what would be expected if

variation in returns were due to chance alone. There are more LPs at the top and the bottom of the

distribution of returns than what would occur if returns were randomly distributed across LPs. This

pattern appears to exist for both venture and buyout funds. While some of these LPs could have been

 The actual distribution should be a mixture of binomial distributions depending on the number of investments
made by each LP.

merely lucky (or unlucky), this pattern suggests that some of them achieved their persistence through

something other than just chance performance, such as skill.

3.2. Bootstrap Simulations of LP Persistence

        For a formal test of whether individual LPs have differential skill, we compute the standard

deviation of the distribution of LP persistence. We construct a statistical test by bootstrapping the

sampling distribution of that test statistic under the null hypothesis that there is no differential skill. An

observed standard deviation higher than what would be expected by chance (i.e., one far enough in the

right-hand tail of the sampling distribution) would suggest that there is differential skill among LPs.

        The null hypothesis is that there is no differential skill, so LPs select funds uniformly at random

from the universe of possible investments. Accordingly, in each iteration of the bootstrap iteration we

randomly assign funds to each LP, with the restriction that the fund assignments match the fund types and

vintage years of the LPs’ actual investments. So, an LP that actually invested in four venture capital funds

in 1999 receives a random assignment of four venture capital funds with that vintage year. When we

construct the bootstrapped sample, we draw from the entire distribution of funds from the Preqin

database, not just the funds that are in our sample. Using the Preqin universe instead of funds in our

actual sample gives our tests more power and does not limit the scope of analyses we run when we restrict

our actual sample to smaller subperiods and subsamples. Since small funds tend to have fewer LPs than

large funds, we weight the selection probability by fund size. In each iteration, we compute the

persistence of each LP and the standard deviation of LP persistence. Then, across 1000 iterations, we

obtain the distribution of the standard deviation of LP persistence under the assumption that each LP

chooses its private equity investments randomly (i.e., the null-hypothesis distribution). We compute the

null-hypothesis distribution separately for venture funds, buyout funds, and all funds, and also for

subperiods from 1991 to 1998, 1999 to 2006, and the full sample.

        The results from the bootstrap simulations are reported in Panel A of Table 2. The column labeled

Actual shows the standard deviation of LP persistence, while the column labeled Boot shows the mean of

                                                         10
the standard deviation of the draws from the bootstrapped distribution. The variable % > Actual is defined

as the percentage of bootstrapped samples with standard deviations greater than what we observe in the

actual sample. We perform our tests separately for the subperiods from 1991 to 1998 and from 1999 to

2006. For all of the fund types in each subperiod, we find that the standard deviation of LP persistence is

higher than the vast majority of bootstrap simulations. In other words, if LPs had chosen investments

randomly, the distribution of LP persistence would not have the tall tails observed in the actual

distribution.

        To evaluate the statistical significance of these results, we rely on the % > Actual value, which

has the same interpretation as a p-value in a classical statistical test: the likelihood that the actual results

would have occurred were the null hypothesis true and the variation in the data due to random chance. In

these results from Panel A of Table 2, for each group of funds and each time period, the % > Actual is less

than 5% and in all except the buyouts for the latter period is less than 1%. The implication of these low

values of % > Actual is that in the vast majority of the bootstrapped iterations, the actual persistence of

performance is higher than the simulated value. Therefore, it is unlikely that the fact that the actual is

higher than the average bootstrapped value occurs because of random chance.

3.3. Bootstrapping LPs’ Returns

        We next repeat the above analysis using an LP’s average returns instead of the fraction of its

investments in the top half of the return distribution. We compute the standard deviation of LPs’ average

returns, both weighted by the log of fund size and equally weighted, in the actual sample and in every

bootstrapped sample. The mean of the bootstrapped distribution of standard deviations is an estimate of

what the standard deviation would be if there were no differential skill, hence we refer to it as the

“bootstrapped estimate” of the standard deviation. We report comparisons of the actual standard deviation

and the bootstrapped estimate for log size-weighted and equally-weighted average IRR in Panels B and C

of Table 2.



                                                           11
        For the full sample period, the standard deviation of LPs’ average returns, both weighted by the

log of fund size and equally weighted, is higher than the bootstrapped estimate. However, the difference

between them is not statistically significant, since the % > Actual is around 30% for each. The difference

between the actual standard deviation and the bootstrapped estimate is significantly different for the latter

(1999-2006) subperiod but not for the earlier period, when the bootstrapped estimate of the standard

deviation is actually higher than in the actual sample.

         When we divide the sample into venture funds and buyout funds, in each case, the actual

standard deviation is greater (or equal in one case) than the bootstrapped estimate for the full sample

period. For the later subperiod, the actual standard deviation is statistically significantly higher than the

bootstrapped estimate for venture funds but not for buyout funds. Neither is significantly higher for the

earlier subperiod, however. The lack of significance for most of the subgroups and subperiods could be an

indication that skill is not a particularly important driver of returns, or it could be the result of noise in

returns reducing the power of this test. We address this issue later by using the Korteweg and Sorensen

(2015) Bayesian approach with year fixed effects and firm-time random effects.

3.4. The Distribution of LPs’ Returns

        An alternative to looking at the standard deviation of returns is to consider the details of the

distribution more carefully. The standard deviation of LP returns, while informative, is not sufficient for

evaluating whether certain LPs systematically outperform others, especially given that the distribution of

private equity returns is highly skewed. For example, the larger standard deviation in the actual

distribution could be due to a few investors doing exceptionally well, or a few doing exceptionally poorly,

or both (i.e., fat tails). It could also be due to the majority of investors doing either moderately well or

moderately poorly, but few performing near average (i.e., a bimodal distribution). This distinction speaks

in turn to the nature of differential skill and how it affects returns. It could be that there is a small number

of highly skilled institutional investors who vastly outperform the field, or there could be subgroups of

slightly more- and slightly less-skilled institutional investors.

                                                           12
        For this reason, instead of looking at a uni-dimensional measure of the spread of the distribution,

we examine exactly where the distribution of LP returns differs from the bootstrapped distributions. We

construct a frequency distribution of LPs’ average returns by aggregating returns into evenly spaced bins.

Bins in the full sample and the later subsample period are based on increments of five percentage points,

while bins in the earlier subsample period are based on increments of ten percentage points because a

large number of funds, especially venture funds, had unusually high returns during that period.

        For each bin we count the number of LPs whose average returns fall in that bin. We do this for

the actual sample, and for each bootstrapped sample, using both equal-weighted and log(size)-weighted

returns. Table 3 presents the frequency of LPs in each bin for the actual sample, as well as the tenth and

ninetieth percentiles of the frequencies in the bootstrapped samples. Figures 2 and 3 correspond to the

size- and equal-weighted average IRR results presented in Table 3, respectively. In each figure, the bars

represent the actual count of LPs in each bin, and the horizontal lines represent the cutoffs for top and

bottom 10th percentile of the bootstrapped samples. In interpreting these results, it is useful to focus on

venture and buyout funds in different subperiods separately, since their returns were very different from

one another in different subperiods, with venture doing better in the 1991-1998 period and buyouts better

in the 1999-2006 period.

        The magnitude of differential returns across LPs is particularly evident for venture funds in the

early sample period (middle row, middle column of Figures 2 and 3). In this subsample, relative to

bootstrap expectations, there are far fewer LPs with an average IRR in the middle range (e.g., between

20% and 50%), and far more in the right tail (e.g., greater than 70%) and left tail (between -10% and

+20%). Relative to venture funds, returns from buyout funds in the early sample period (middle row,

right column of Figures 2 and 3) are lower and much more homogeneous. The vast majority of LPs

obtained an average IRR between 0% and 20% in both the actual sample and the bootstrap, and we do not

observe the same tall tails that were so apparent in the distribution for venture funds. Nevertheless, a

similar pattern holds for buyouts as for venture funds, in that there were fewer LPs with an average IRR

                                                        13
in the middle range (between 0% and 20%) than the bootstrap expectations. The frequency of LPs with

an average IRR greater than 30% exceeded the bootstrap expectations, but the only bin that exceeds the

90th percentile of expectations is from 30% to 40%. Even the most skilled LPs could not obtain the

spectacular returns on buyout funds that were possible with venture funds during this period.

        In the later sample period (bottom row of Figures 2 and 3), average returns are much more

homogenous than in the early sample period. As a result, the distributions for both venture and buyout

funds are heavily concentrated around their modes (between -5% and 0% for venture funds and between

0% and 5% for buyout funds) with little sign of the fat tails found in the early sample period. However,

the bootstrapped estimates are also heavily concentrated around the mode, especially for venture funds.

In the case of venture funds, the number of LPs in the modal class (between -5% and 0%) is below the

10th percentile of the bootstrapped estimate, and the number of LPs in the tails meets or exceeds the 90th

percentile of the bootstrapped estimates for the majority of bins (see the bottom panel of Table 3 for

details). In the case of buyout funds, we actually see the opposite pattern: more LPs than expected near

the mode and fewer in the tails. This could be interpreted as evidence against differential skill for buyout

funds in the later sample period, but it does not rule it out. This pattern could result from negative

correlation between skill and luck for these investors in that time period, or simply from type-2 error due

to a small effect size and a small sample size. We revisit this issue with the parametric analysis in the

next section.

        The analysis so far quantifies differential skill in terms of greater standard deviation in the actual

distribution of LP average returns compared to bootstrapped distributions. However, one could also

quantify the impact of skill in terms of how much an LP’s average returns would increase by being more

skilled relative other LPs in the population (e.g., moving up one standard deviation in the distribution of

skill). The bootstrap comparisons show evidence of differential skill with stronger evidence in the later

sample period than in the early sample period. However, average returns are more homogenous in the



                                                         14
later sample period than in the early sample period, suggesting that the impact of skill is actually lower in

the later sample period. We explore these issues as well in the parametric analysis that follows.



4. Parametric Estimates of LP Skill

         The bootstrap analyses of LP performance in the previous sections show that the distribution of

LP performance is significantly different than what one would expect if LPs drew their returns from an

identical distribution, suggesting that there is an LP-specific factor in determining returns. The bootstrap

analysis has the advantage that it is a model-free procedure that imposes no structure on the data.7 The

disadvantages of the bootstrap are that model-free estimates are less powerful than those that parameterize

the data, cannot quantify the magnitude of differences across LPs, and cannot identify the LPs that

consistently earn the highest returns either because of greater skill or access.

         To address these issues, we extend the model of Korteweg and Sorensen (KS, 2015) to

incorporate limited partner investments. The KS model is designed to measure the differential skill of

private equity firms, i.e. general partners (GPs). The idea of the KS model is to think of the net-of-fee

return on fund u managed by firm i, yiu, as consisting of three components (conditional on appropriate

controls): a firm-specific persistent (fixed) effect γi, a firm-time random effect ηit that applies to each year

of the fund’s life, and a fund-specific random effect εiu. We use the KS model to decompose the variance

of fund returns into three variance components, one for each of these three effects. The part of the

variation due to the firm-specific effects γi measures the extent of persistent heterogeneity in PE firm skill.

When there is greater variation in γi, there should be greater differences in skill between firms. The firm-

time random effects adjust for, among other things, the fact that a given private equity firm could be

managing multiple funds at the same time. We use the version of the model presented by KS that includes

fund vintage year fixed effects. These fixed effects perform a full risk-adjustment with respect to any set


7
 The bootstrap analyses model the assumption of identical skill in two ways: first by giving every LP an identical
probability of being in the top half of returns for each investment, and then by computing the distribution of returns
based on uniform random assignment of funds to each LP. The data reject both of these models.
                                                              15
of observed or unobserved risk factors, such as a market or liquidity factor, under the assumption that the

relevant risk loadings are common to all funds of a given type (venture capital or buyout) and vintage

year.

        Although the KS model is designed to measure GP skill, we extend it to measure an LP’s ability

to invest in high-skill GPs. We extend the model by first using the KS model to decompose the returns

from each fund as described above, and then subtracting the random components to isolate the portion of

returns that can be attributed to the skill of the GP. We then estimate a Bayesian regression of the

adjusted fund returns on LP-specific fixed effects. Since differences in the adjusted fund returns can be

attributed to differences in GP skill, the LP-specific fixed effects defined in this way capture differences

in an LP’s ability to invest in high-skill GPs. We also modify this procedure to allow the LP-specific

fixed effects to also incorporate the fund-specific random component of returns. In doing so, the LP fixed

effects measure both the LP’s ability to invest in high-skill GPs and the LP’s ability to select the higher-

performing funds of a given GP. In the next subsection we describe the KS model and our extension of it

in more detail.

4.1. Model

        Under the simplifying assumption that all private equity funds have 10-year lives, the total log

return of fund u of firm i is given by:

                               𝑦𝑖𝑢 = 10 ∗ 𝑙𝑛(1 + 𝐼𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑢 ).                  (1)

        As described above, KS model this return as:
                                              𝑡𝑖𝑢 +9
                               𝑦𝑖𝑢 = 𝑋𝑖𝑢 𝛽 + ∑𝜏=  𝑡𝑖𝑢(𝛾𝑖 + 𝜂𝑖𝜏 ) + 𝜀𝑖𝑢 ,   (2)


where Xiu is a vector of vintage year fixed effects,  represents the coefficients on them, and other

parameters are as described above.

        Following KS, we estimate the model using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)

techniques. Although Equation (2) can in principle be estimated using classical techniques such as

                                                          16
maximum likelihood, the Bayesian approach offers several advantages for our purpose. It avoids

assumptions about the homoscedasticity and normality of the error term that are especially likely to be

violated given the skewness of private equity returns. It also avoids small-sample bias in estimation of the

fixed effects that are key to the model. Moreover, the Bayesian approach is well suited to estimating the

variances in the model of key theoretical importance from relatively small samples, such as that of the GP

fixed effects, while incorporating reasonable prior beliefs about these paramaters. Korteweg and Sorensen

(2015) elaborate further on the advantages of the Bayesian approach to estimating models like this one.

        The estimation is in two steps. For each MCMC cycle g, the first step is to obtain a parameter

draw for the distribution of firm fixed effects γi and the idiosyncratic errors 𝜀𝑖𝑢 . To do so, we estimate the

KS model by following the procedure described in sections A1 to A5 of their appendix.8 We use priors

and starting values described in section A7 of the KS appendix. In this step, we use all funds available in

Preqin, not only those in which the LPs in our sample have invested.

         At the end of the first step, we adjust each fund’s total return to control for the firm-time random

effects and the vintage year fixed effects sampled from the posterior distribution following the KS

appendix.

                                 𝑦̂
                                  𝑖𝑢
                                     (𝑔) = 𝑦 − 𝑋 𝛽 (𝑔) − ∑𝑡𝑖𝑢 +9 𝜂 (𝑔) (3)
                                            𝑖𝑢  𝑖𝑢        𝜏= 𝑡𝑖𝑢 𝑖𝜏


Because some LPs tend to invest in subsequent funds of a given PE firm, subtracting the firm-year

random effects is important to control for overlap. These random effects will tend to be positive

(negative) for funds that have a lot of overlap with other funds that have relatively high (low) returns. The

adjusted returns obtained in this way are equal to a parameter draw from the posterior distribution for

each firm fixed effect (times ten) plus the fund-specific error. Keeping the fund-specific error allows our

estimates to appropriately credit LPs who invest in the more successful funds of a given GP, that is,



8 In KS, the random effects ηit are redefined so that their mean is the firm effect γi. We instead leave them as mean
zero to ease interpretation of the second step of our estimation.


                                                             17
display within-GP selection ability. For completeness, we also present estimates in which Equation (3)

also adjusts for the fund-specific error. Comparing the two allows us to infer how much of LPs’

differential skill stems from selection between GPs and how much from selection among the funds of a

given GP.

        The second step, still within the same MCMC cycle g, consists of estimating a Bayesian

regression of the adjusted fund returns on LP-specific fixed effects and a set of constants, which consists

of either a single intercept for all LPs or a set of LP-type (endowment, pension fund, etc.) fixed effects.

The regression can be estimated using BO and VC data together or separately, and for endowments,

pension funds and others together or separately.

        Specifically, the regression is:

                                   𝑖𝑢𝑗 = 𝑋𝐿𝑃𝑗 𝛽𝐿𝑃 + 10𝜆𝑗 + 𝜋𝑖𝑢𝑗 ,
                                  𝑦̂                                     (4)

where j indexes LPs and we suppress the MCMC index g. Because all LPs in a fund earn the same return,

𝑦̂
 𝑖𝑢𝑗 = 𝑦
       ̂𝑖𝑢 for all LPs j. In equation (4), 𝑋𝐿𝑃𝑗 is the appropriate constant term, consisting of either a single


“intercept” for all LPs or LP-type fixed effects, 𝜆𝑗 is the LP-specific fixed effect, and 𝜋𝑖𝑢𝑗 is a fund-LP

specific random effect. Each of these parameters has an intuitive interpretation. In regressions in which

the constant term is a common intercept for all LPs, it captures the extent to which the sample LPs (for

which we have investment data) outperform or underperform the universe of LPs investing in Preqin

funds. In other words, the common intercept captures the average ability of the sample’s LPs

(endowments, pension funds and other LPs) to select funds in the Preqin universe. In regressions in which

the constant terms are LP-type fixed effects, the omitted category serves this function of controlling for

selection “bias” in the LP sample and the other fixed effects estimate the extent to which some types of

sample LPs (e.g., endowments) outperform other types.

        Regarding the LP-specific fixed effects, LPs whose investments are more frequently in funds

whose GPs have high firm fixed effects will have higher LP fixed effects. In this sense, the LP-specific

fixed effects capture differences in LP skill, where LP skill is thought of as the ability to invest in high-
                                                          18
skill GPs. Part of such skill may in fact stem from differences in access to top-tier PE firms, a possibility

we investigate further below. The fund-LP-specific random effects account for the adding up constraint

that results from the fact that all LPs in the fund receive the same return. For instance, if an LP with a

high LP-specific fixed effect and one with a low LP-specific fixed effect both invest in the same fund, the

former fund-LP-specific random effect must be low and the latter high. For each MCMC cycle g, the

Appendix describes how we sample from the posterior distribution of the parameters in equation (4) and

their variances. A key parameter is σλ, the standard deviation of the LP effects. A high σλ means that there

is evidence of persistent long-term heterogeneity in the true ability of LPs to invest with skilled GPs. As

in KS, each MCMC cycle g yields a draw of the parameters in equations (2) and (4). The sequence of

draws over a large number of cycles forms a Markov chain, the stationary distribution of which is the

posterior distribution, from which the marginal posterior distribution of parameters of interest can be

obtained.

           Each MCMC cycle g yields a vector of estimated LP effects that has a certain variance. The

overall estimated variance of the LP effects is the average of the estimated variances in each of the

100,000 MCMC cycles. This is the model’s estimate of the extent of variation in LP skill.

4.2. Bayesian Estimates of LP Ability

           The main results are displayed in Table 4. Panel A displays results for the full sample of funds

raised between 1991 and 2006, while Panels B and C focus on funds raised 1991-1998 and 1999-2006,

respectively. Several patterns emerge from the table.

           First, the standard deviation of the LP effects, σλ, is highly statistically and economically

significant,9 averaging about three percentage points of IRR for the full sample period and for buyout and

venture capital funds taken together (columns (1) and (2) of Panel A). This result means that an LP that is

one standard deviation more skilled than average earns about 3 percentage points higher IRR on its

private equity investments.

9
    Statistical significance in this context means more than two standard errors from zero.

                                                                19
        Second, consistent with the greater variability of returns to venture capital funds compared to

buyout, there is evidence of stronger LP skill in venture capital investments. The standard deviation of the

LP effects for buyout funds is 2.7 to 3.2 percentage points of IRR, compared to 3.5 to 5.0 percentage

points when considering VC funds only.

        Finally, consistent with prior work (Lerner, Schoar, and Wongsunwai, 2007; Sensoy, Wang, and

Weisbach, 2014), endowments perform significantly better than other LP types, but this result is driven by

investments in venture capital funds raised in the 1991-1998 period. In this period, the standard deviation

of LP effects in venture capital investment is very high: eleven percentage points of IRR without adjusting

for fund-specific error and four percentage points with the adjustment. The discrepancy between the two

estimates indicates that much of the skill during this period was in selecting the most talented GPs rather

than choosing between talented GPs’ funds.

        In the later 1999-2006 period, endowments perform similarly to other LP types, and the standard

deviation of LP effects for VC funds drops to just over three percentage points of IRR, with or without the

adjustment for fund-specific error. In their investments in buyout funds, endowments do not outperform

in any sample period, with estimated coefficients similar to those of pension funds and other LP types.

The standard deviation of LP effects is likewise stable for buyout funds at just below three percentage

points of IRR for both sample periods.

        Overall, estimates from the Bayesian KS model are consistent with the tests using the

nonparametric bootstrap approach. The ability of LPs to pick GPs is not random, and better LPs

outperform less talented LPs. The magnitude of the performance difference is substantial, amounting to

about additional three percentage points of IRR per year for a change in one standard deviation of ability.

The magnitude of performance difference was even greater in the earlier sample period, driven mostly by

the spectacular performance of endowments’ investments in venture funds.

4.3. Estimates of Individual LP Abilities

        The estimates presented so far suggest that there are systematic differences across LPs in the

                                                        20
quality of funds in which they invest. However, they do not provide any guidance into the skill of any

particular LP. The measure of an individual LP’s skill in this estimation procedure is given in 𝜆𝑗 , the LP-

specific fixed effect. We present the  for each LP in our sample in Appendix 2.10 Since we estimate

equation (4) in logarithmic form, we convert each  so that it measures the LP’s abnormal return.

Consequently, if an LP’s  is estimated to be .01, then the model predicts that the LP’s private equity

investments have 1% higher IRR than a typical LP.

         Figure 4 presents a histogram that summarizes the estimated  for a number of prominent LPs.

The number of LPs in each IRR bin is shown on top of the bars. The figure is hump-shaped because of the

assumption built into our estimation that the ’s are distributed normally. On this figure, we highlight the

s of 20 prominent LPs. Fifteen of these LPs are the largest investors in private equity and the other 5 are

the largest endowments as of 2015.11 Of these 20 LPs, the one with the highest estimated  is MIT, with a

 of 4.79%, and the lowest is CALPERS, with a  of -2.07%.

         Table 5 presents the identities and estimated s of the 10 top and bottom LPs for three categories

of LPs: foundations/endowments, pension funds, and other investors. We emphasize that these estimates

are relatively noisy, with an average Bayesian standard error of approximately 2.5%. For this reason, we

cannot draw sharp conclusions about the relative rankings of LPs. It does appear, however, that the LPs

we identify as being in the top group do have noticeably better performance than those in the bottom

group.



5. Interpreting Differences in LP Performance

5.1. Differences in Risk Preferences between LPs


10
   We focus our discussion here on the ’s from Model 1, which does not adjust for fund-specific effects, and so
measures the ability to choose between alternative GPs, but not the ability to pick between funds offered by a given
GP. A number of prominent LPs have the strategy of investing in all of a GPs’ funds to maintain their relationships.
A model that incorporates the ability to distinguish between funds of a given GP would obscure the skill of such
LPs.
11
   We identify these LPs based on Private Equity International (PEI) magazine’s publication of LP ranking in 2015.
                                                             21
        The preceding analysis suggests that there are substantial and statistically significant differences

in average returns across LPs. This finding is consistent with the notion that LPs differ in their skill at

selecting private equity funds. An alternative explanation is that LPs could have different risk tolerances,

so that LPs with higher risk tolerance tend to select funds that have both higher risk and higher expected

returns. It is difficult to test this explanation directly since LP risk preferences are unobservable. The

notorious difficulty in estimating fund-level measures of systematic risk in private equity makes the issue

doubly difficult.

        However, to shed some light on this issue, we repeat our main tests separately for different classes

of LPs, specifically endowments, pension funds, and all other types. To the extent that LPs of a given type

have similar investment objectives and are benchmarked against one another, risk preferences should be

similar across LPs of a given type. If differential skill were the primary explanation for our main results,

we should still see evidence of tall tails and significant LP fixed effects within LP types. If instead the

main results were due to differences in risk-taking across classes of LPs, we would not expect to find such

evidence within LP types.

        Table 6 shows results for the persistence of LP performance (recall, defined as the percentage of

an LP’s fund investments that perform above median among a fund type and vintage year), broken down

by LP type. For each LP type and fund type, the variability of persistence is significantly higher than what

we expect by chance for each LP type. Moreover, the estimates of variability are similar for all LP types,

inconsistent with different risk preferences even across LP types.

5.2. Differences in Access to Funds

        One surprising result from the preceding analysis is the extent to which the bottom half of LPs in

venture funds underperform relative to the bootstrapped samples (i.e., they do worse than would be

expected if investments were selected at random). One possible explanation for this underperformance, in

addition to differential skill, is that different LPs have access to a different set of funds from one another.

The most successful partnerships in private equity industry often limit the quantity of capital they will

                                                          22
take in a particular fund, resulting in oversubscription of many funds (i.e., limited access). Some of the

most successful LPs have policies of reinvesting in all funds of GPs they like to retain access to the GPs’

future funds. 12 Sensoy, Wang, and Weisbach (2014) provide evidence suggesting that access to the

highest quality venture funds was an important factor contributing to endowments’ outperformance in the

1990s.

         To evaluate the extent to which differential access explains the observed differences in LPs’

performance, we repeat our analysis using only first-time funds. First-time funds are generally considered

to be extremely difficult to raise, and typically take commitments from any LPs willing to invest (see

Lerner, Hardymon and Leamon (2011)). Consequently, access is unlikely to play much of a role in any

potential differential LP performance in investments in first-time funds.

         To perform the bootstrap analysis on first time funds, we take LPs who invested in first-time

funds more than once during the sample period and simulate their investments using all first-time funds in

Preqin.13 We compute the standard deviations of LPs’ return persistence as well as each LP’s average IRR

and compare them to the distributions of the same statistics in the bootstrap simulations, as before.

However, because of the sample of investments in first time funds is much smaller than the entire of

sample of LP investments, we only present the results for the full sample period since there are not

enough observations in each of the subperiods to perform meaningful comparisons.

         These bootstrap analyses are presented in Table 7. The results in this table are noisier than those

in Table 2 because of the smaller sample size. Nevertheless, as before with the full sample, LPs in first

time venture and buyout funds separately have significantly higher-than-expected persistence. In addition,

there is a sharp disparity between the standard deviations for LPs’ average returns in first-time venture

funds and first-time buyout funds. With first-time venture funds, as with the full sample, the actual


12
   See Lerner and Leamon (2011).
13
   We also restrict our sample to LPs with three or more investments in first-time funds, and we rerun the same
simulation using these LPs. Results (untabulated) are similar to those using LPs’ with two or more investments in
first-time funds. We have also replicated the analysis comparing decile values for the subsample of first time funds,
with similar results to those reported in Table 3.

standard deviation is significantly higher than those from bootstrap simulations.14 With first-time buyout

funds, on the other hand, there is no statistical difference between the standard deviations of the actual

and bootstrapped samples.

        We also estimate the extended KS Bayesian analysis for first-time funds. The estimates are

presented in Table 8.    Even among first-time funds, the standard deviation of LP fixed effects is

statistically significant, whether estimated on the full sample that pools all funds together, and for the

venture and buyout subsamples separately. Moreover, the estimate of skill is of approximately the same

magnitude as the results for all funds shown in Table 4, with a standard deviation increase in ability

leading to about a three percentage-point difference in expected fund IRR. This evidence suggests that

differential access is the not main factor leading to systematic differences in returns across LPs. Instead,

the persistent differences in performance across LPs seem most likely to be a consequence of differential

LP skill in selecting GPs, and in identifying the funds of a particular GP that are most likely to perform

well.

5.3. Limitations of the Analysis

        This paper provides the first estimates of the ability of institutional investors to choose between

private equity funds. The estimates we present suggest that investor skill is an important factor affecting

the returns LPs receive from their private equity investments. However, we emphasize that there are a

number of limitations of the analysis.

        First, our data on institutional investors’ portfolios are incomplete. Our knowledge of LPs’

private equity investments is limited to those investments reported by VentureXpert and Capital IQ. These

sources contain a large number of investments for each LP, but not the entire portfolio, especially for

private LPs not subject to FOIA.

        Second, we do not have any data on the amount of capital each LP commits to each fund.

Therefore, we must make an assumption about the amount each LP contributes to each fund, typically that



                                                        24
they contribution the same amount to each fund or that they do so in proportion to the fund size or the log

of fund size.

        Third, we assume that LPs buy each fund at origination and hold it for the fund’s life. In fact,

there is now an active secondary market for buying and selling funds (see Nadauld et al. 2016). Therefore,

the returns an LP receives on any particular investment could differ from that reported in Preqin. Our

estimates of an LPs’ skill could be affected if they transact in this market frequently. For example,

OPERs, the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, had a policy of buying funds at substantial

discounts in the secondary market during our sample period. Since our analysis assumes that they their

private equity investments for their entire life, the reported estimated  of -1.9% for OPERs could be

misleading and understate the true ability of OPERs’ managers, since a portion of their returns come from

purchasing funds at a discount.



6. Conclusion

        Pension plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments and other institutional investors all

depend crucially on their investment income to fund their activities. Consequently, the investment

manager is typically one of the most important and highly paid employees in these organizations. Yet,

there has been surprisingly little work devoted to evaluating the performance of these managers, or even

measuring the extent to which there is meaningful variation in their skill. This paper evaluates the extent

to which institutions’ investment officer skill systematically leads institutional investors to have higher

returns, using a large database of LPs’ investments in private equity.

        Our results suggest that some LPs consistently invest in the top half of funds while some are

consistently in the bottom half of funds. There are more LPs with this persistent performance than one

would expect by chance, since the standard deviation of the number of investments in the top half of the

return distribution is significantly higher than those in bootstrapped samples. This result holds in different

time periods for all funds, as well as for venture and buyout funds separately. This consistent performance

                                                         25
suggests that there is some LP-specific attribute that is an important driver of private equity returns. This

LP-specific attribute potentially reflects LPs’ differential skill at picking private equity funds.

        We adapt the Bayesian method of Korteweg and Sorensen (2015) to quantify the effect of skill on

LP returns. This approach assumes that there is an underlying unobservable skill level that affects an

LP’s ability to pick quality GPs and uses the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to estimate the level of

skill for each LP. The estimates suggest that the variance in skill is substantial, and that a one standard

deviation in LP skill leads to about a three-percentage point difference in annual IRR on the LP’s private

equity investments. The effect is even larger for investments in venture capital funds, with a one standard

deviation difference in ability leading to a five-percentage point difference in the annual IRR they earn.

        We consider alternative explanations why returns could differ systematically across LPs. One

possibility is that some LPs have higher risk tolerance than others and the higher returns represent

compensation for this risk bearing. However, the differences across LPs within different classes of LPs

appear to be similar to those in the full sample. Since differences in risk preferences are likely to be more

present across different types of LPs than within particular types, this pattern suggests that different risk

preferences are unlikely to be the main factor leading to differences in returns across LPs.

        Another possibility is that some LPs have better access to the funds of higher quality GPs, and the

higher return they receive results from this superior access. To evaluate this possibility, we repeat our

analysis on the sample of first time funds, which generally do not limit their access. Our results suggest

that higher quality LPs tend to outperform in first time funds by about the same amount as they do in their

investments in funds from established partnerships. Consequently, it does not appear that superior access

is the major reason why some LPs earn higher returns than others.

        Overall, the results suggest the performance of LPs’ private equity investments is not random, and

that the ability to choose private equity partnerships is an important skill of institutional investors.

Therefore, it makes sense for institutional investors to bid to acquire the best investment officers, and that

high quality investment officers can more than earn their relatively high salaries. While the results in this

                                                           26
paper concern only private equity investments, it seems likely that such skill affects managers’ other

investments as well. However, since the variance in performance in other asset classes is much smaller

than in private equity, it is likely that the return to skill is smaller as well.

         Given the prevalence of institutional investors in the economy and the effect that their

performance has on so many different organizations, understanding this investment process seems

relatively understudied. How prevalent are differences in skill across institutional investors? Does it vary

across different types of institutions and across investment in different asset classes? Does the

compensation structure of different investment managers across organizations efficiently sort the better

managers into the higher paying positions? How much do differences in pay translate to higher

investment performance? Does the structure of investment officers’ compensation affect investment

performance directly through the incentives they provide? This paper studies some of these issues. While

the analysis here is suggestive that skill differences are important, much more work is needed to

understand their implications more fully. Given the importance of institutional investors’ performance,

such research seems like a task worth pursuing.

The figures show the distribution of the frequency of LPs’ investments in top half performing
funds given their vintage years. For each LP, we calculate the percentage of times the LP’s
investments are in the top half of funds given the vintage years of the funds. Then we count the
number of LPs in each percentage group. The percentage groups are divided to increments of
five. The x-axis shows the percentage groups, and the y-axis shows the number of LPs in each
group for all funds, venture funds, and buyout funds.

           Table 2. Tests of Differential Skill based on Persistence and Average Returns

This table shows comparisons of the distributions of LPs’ return persistence and their average
returns between the actual and bootstrapped samples. Panel A shows tests for differential skill
based on the standard deviation of persistence, measured as the percentages of times LPs’
investments fall in top half of funds. For each LP in the actual sample, we calculate the
percentage of times the LP’s investments are in the top half of funds given the vintage years fund
types. Then we compute the standard deviation of those percentages. We do the same for each
bootstrapped sample. Column Actual shows statistics from the actual sample. Column Boot
reports the mean values of the same test statistics across 1,000 bootstrapped samples. Column %
> Actual shows the percentage of bootstrapped samples with test statistics greater than those in
the actual sample. Panels B shows tests of the standard deviations of LPs’ average IRR weighted
by the logarithm of fund size, and Panel C reports the same tests based on equal-weighted
average IRR. Results are reported for the full sample (1991-2006) and two subsample periods:
1991-1998 and 1999-2006. Statistically significant numbers are highlighted in bold. Results are
considered as statistically significant if % > Actual is less than 10% or greater than 90%.

                                       Table 3. Frequency Distribution of LPs' Average IRR

The table shows the frequency distributions of LPs’ average size- and equal-weighted IRR for all funds, venture funds, and buyout
funds. Size-weighted average IRR is computed by weighing each IRR by the logarithm of fund size. Equal-weighted average IRR
assigns equal weights to each IRR. LPs in the actual and every bootstrapped sample are divided to 10 groups based on their average
IRR (Avg IRR). Column Actual represents the number of LPs in each Avg IRR group from the actual sample. Columns 10% Boot and
90% Boot show the bottom 10% and top 90% of the bootstrapped frequencies, respectively. For the full sample period 1991-2006 and
1999-2006 subsample period, Avg IRR groups are based on increments of 5%. Avg IRR groups in the 1991-1998 subperiod are based
on increments of 10% due to higher returns from this period.

                                  Figure 2. Frequency Distribution of Average Size-Weighted IRR

The figures show the frequency distributions of LPs’ average IRR weighed by the logarithm of fund size for all funds, venture funds,
and buyout funds. LPs in the actual and every bootstrapped sample are divided to 10 groups based on their average IRR (Avg IRR).
Each column in the figures represents the number of LPs in each Avg IRR group from the actual sample. The horizontal lines for each
column show the 10% and 90% of the bootstrapped frequencies for the same group. For the full sample and 1999-2006 subsample
period, Avg IRR groups are based on increments of 5%. Due to higher returns from the earlier period, Avg IRR groups in the 1991-
1998 subperiod are based on increments of 10%.

in the actual and every bootstrapped sample are divided to 10 groups based on their average IRR (Avg IRR). Each column in the

                      Table 4. Bayesian Model Estimates of Differences in LP Skill

This table displays the results of the Bayesian model described in Section IV. Panel A shows
results for the full sample period, Panel B includes only funds with vintage years between 1991
and 1998, and Panel C includes only funds with vintage years between 1999 and 2006. Odd-
numbered columns do not adjust for fund-specific errors in Equation (3) and so are estimates
inclusive of any LP ability to select funds within a GP family. Even-numbered columns do
perform this adjustment. σλ is the estimated standard deviation of LP fixed effects, our measure
of differential LP skill. σπ is the estimated standard deviation of the fund-LP random effects. βLP
(all) is   the estimated common constant term for all LPs. This parameter measures the difference in
performance between the funds invested by our sample LPs and the Preqin universe. βLP (endow),
βLP (pension), and βLP (other) are the estimated constant terms for endowments, pension funds, and all
other LPs, respectively. These parameters are estimated in a separate Bayesian regression from
the other listed parameters. All estimates are IRRs with Bayesian standard errors reported below
the estimates in parentheses.

                                               Figure 4. IRR Contribution of Estimated Skill
The figure shows the distribution of estimated skill contribution to IRR. For each LP, we obtain a Bayesian estimate of λ and compute
the IRR equivalent (i.e. the skill contribution to IRR). We divide LPs to bins based on their average skill contribution to IRR and count
the number of LPs in each bin. The upper limit of each bin is shown on the x-axis. The frequency count for each bin is shown on top
of each bar. We highlight 20 LPs in the figure below. These are the largest LPs that we have data for and largest university
endowments in 2015. The average Bayesian standard error for the highlighted LPs is approximately 2.5% IRR. Returns are adjusted
for vintage-year fixed effects and firm-time random effects.

The table shows IRR contribution of estimated 𝜆𝑗 of the top and bottom 10 LPs by type. Column 𝜆 shows the average 𝜆𝑗 of all MCMC cycles.
Column Standard Error represents the Bayesian standard error for each 𝜆𝑗 . Returns are adjusted for vintage-year fixed effects and firm-time random
effects.

                     Table 6. Tests of Persistence within Different LP Types

This table shows tests of the standard deviation of persistence within different LP types. LPs are
divided to endowments, pensions, and all other LPs. For each LP type, standard deviations are
computed for the actual sample and all bootstrapped samples. Column Actual reports the
standard deviation from the actual sample. Column Boot reports the average standard deviation
across 1,000 bootstrapped samples. Column % > Actual shows the percentage of bootstrapped
samples with standard deviations greater than that of the actual sample. Statistically significant
numbers are highlighted in bold. Results are considered statistically significant if % > Actual is
less than 10% or greater than 90%.

     Table 7. Actual vs. Bootstrapped Persistence and Average Returns for First-Time Funds

This table shows comparisons of the distributions of LPs’ return persistence and their average
returns between the actual and bootstrapped samples for first-time funds only. Column Standard
Deviation of Persistence reports the standard deviations of LP persistence, measured as the
percentages of times LPs’ returns fall in the top half of funds given their vintage years and fund
types. Column Standard Deviation of Size-Weighted IRR reports the standard deviations of LPs’
averaged returns weighed by the logarithm of fund size, and Column Standard Deviation of
Equal-Weighted IRR shows the same standard deviations when each fund return is weighed
equally. Due to the smaller sample size, tests are only performed for the full sample period from
1991 to 2006. All other variables are the same as those described in Table 2. Bold numbers
indicate that the actual and bootstrapped samples are significantly different, with % > Actual
either smaller than 10% or greater than 90%.

             Table 8. Bayesian Model Estimates of Differential Skill Using First-Time Funds

This table displays the results of the Bayesian estimates of differences in LP skill using their
investments in first-time funds in the full sample (1991-2006). The estimation follows the
Bayesian model described in Section IV. All variables are defined in Table 4. Odd-numbered
columns do not adjust for fund-specific errors in Equation (3). Even-numbered columns do
perform this adjustment. βLP (endow), βLP (pension), and βLP (other) are estimated in a separate Bayesian
regression from the other listed parameters. All estimates are IRRs with Bayesian standard errors
reported below the estimates in parentheses.

Definitions
The parameter vector we want to estimate is 𝜃 𝐿𝑃 ≡ (𝛽𝐿𝑃 , 𝜎𝜆2 , 𝜎𝜋2 ).
Let 𝑈𝑗𝐿𝑃 be the number of PE investments made by Limited Partner j, let 𝑈 𝐿𝑃 = ∑𝑗 𝑈𝑗𝐿𝑃 , and let
𝑁 𝐿𝑃 be the number of LPs in the sample.
𝑋 𝐿𝑃 is a𝑈 𝐿𝑃 × 1 vector or a 𝑈 𝐿𝑃 × 3 matrix that contain either a single intercept or a LP
category (endowment, pension fund, other) indicator, respectively.
𝐿 is a 𝑈 𝐿𝑃 × 𝑁 𝐿𝑃 matrix where each row represent a LP-fund return pair and each column
represents a LP. Each row contains an indicator which is equal to 10 in the column of the
corresponding LP.


A1 LP (random) effects
We sample the LP effects, 𝜆𝑗 ,using a Bayesian regression. The prior is
                                            𝜆𝑗 ~ 𝒩(0, 𝜎𝜆2 )
The posterior from which we sample is
                                             𝐿𝑃                2 −1

                                𝜆𝑗 |{𝑦̂
where
                                              𝜎𝜋2
                                         𝐵=       𝕀 𝐿𝑃 + 𝐿′𝐿
                                              𝜎𝜆2 𝑁
                                     𝜇𝜆 = 𝐵 −1 (𝐿′ (𝑌̂ − 𝑋𝐿𝑃 𝛽𝐿𝑃 ))


A2 Variance of error term and βLP coefficient
In this step we condition on the latent variables {𝜆𝑗 } sampled in the previous step. With the
conjugate prior

the posterior distribution is

A3 Variance of LP effects
Using the inverse gamma prior
                                           𝜎𝜆2 ~ 𝐼𝒢(𝑙0 , 𝑚0 )
the posterior distribution from which we sample is
                                      𝜎𝜆2 |{𝜆𝑗 }, 𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎 ~ 𝐼𝒢(𝑙, 𝑚)
where
                                             𝑙 = 𝑙0 + 𝑁 𝐿𝑃
                                            𝑚 = 𝑚0 + 𝜆′𝜆


A4 Priors and starting values
We use diffuse priors for all the parameters in the LP model. For the variance of the error term,
we set 𝑜0 = 2.1 and 𝑝0 = 1. For the variance of the LP effects, we set 𝑙0 = 2.1 and 𝑚0 = 0.152 .
For the beta coefficients, we set Σ𝐿𝑃0 equal to the identity matrix and 𝜇𝐿𝑃0 equal to 0 (or to a
zero-valued vector for the case of LP category β). We initialize all the variables at their prior
means. We do not need starting values for the LP effects since they are the first variables we
simulate. The choice of the priors is in the spirit of section A7 in the KS appendix.

The table shows the IRR equivalent of estimated 𝜆𝑗 for each LP. Results are adjusted for vintage-year fixed effects and firm-time random effects.
Bayesian estimates of 𝜆𝑗 are transformed to IRR using 𝑒 𝜆𝑗 − 1. For each LP, Column λ shows the IRR equivalent of the average λ across all MCMC
cycles. Column Standard Error is the IRR equivalent of Bayesian standard error for 𝜆𝑗 . LP names are shortened or abbreviated to save space.
