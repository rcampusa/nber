                                           ABSTRACT
This paper studies the cross-country pattern of U.S. overseas assembly activities between 1980 and
2000 to examine how outsourcing decisions are affected by changes in country and competitor costs.
A number of interesting regularities emerge. When a country's costs rise, the share of U.S. overseas
assembly activities in that location decline. Conversely, a country's share of U.S. overseas assembly
activities grows when competitor country costs increase. While own and competitor country costs
affect overseas assembly in all countries, the magnitude of these effects is larger for developing
countries than it is for developed countries. In many cases, the measured responses to cost changes
appear to correspond with outsourcing theories that are based on search and customization costs.

        Production and trade increasingly involves the flow of intermediate goods from

one county to the next as multiple countries complete successive steps in a globally

integrated production process.1 As outsourcing activities grow in importance, they fuel

public concern that firms will immediately relocate their production facilities whenever

wages and costs in the current location rise above those available elsewhere. However,

more nuanced treatments of outsourcing decisions recognize that location decisions

require more than a simple cross country comparison of wages. As recent work by

Grossman and Helpman (2002) demonstrates, a high wage country may continue to

attract outsourcing firms if it offers better infrastructure, partners who are skilled in

adapting their capabilities to the needs of the outsourcing firms, or highly effective legal

protections that secure outsourcing relationships.               Nonetheless, while it is well

understood that the location of outsourcing production should reflect differences in

country costs, there is little known about actual outsourcing decisions.2

        To examine how costs affect outsourcing decisions, I study U.S. outsourcing

conducted between 1980 and 2000 through the provisions of the offshore assembly

program (OAP) which is known as 9802 in the current U.S. tariff code. The benefit of

studying the OAP program is that it presents a direct view of one portion of outsourcing

activities, since the program was specifically designed to provide tariff benefits to firms

whose exports to the U.S. contain U.S.-produced parts or materials. In particular, when

such products enter the U.S., tariffs are due on the foreign portion of value added, but not

     Hummels, Ishii & Yi’s (2001) calculations suggest that vertical specialization now accounts for 30
percent of all trade flows. See Feenstra (1998) for a survey and description of trends in international
outsourcing.
2
  Gorg’s (2000) study of US outsourcing in the EU is one exception. In related work, Swenson (1999),
Feenstra, Hanson and Swenson (2000), and Hanson, Mataloni and Slaughter (2003) examine how the share
of parent inputs in outsourcing production is affected by costs.


                                                  1
on the U.S. parts and components that are contained in the assembled good. As a result,

the administration of OAP activities creates a data trail that allows one to examine how

cross-country sourcing patterns respond to changes in country cost conditions.             The data

from this program are very rich, as OAP outsourcing involved almost 400 four-digit SIC

industries, and more than 60 countries who frequently provided assembly services.

Further, while imports entering through the OAP program do not include all outsourcing

activities related to the U.S., they do represent a non-trivial portion of U.S. trade.3

Another benefit of studying outsourcing activities conducted through OAP is that use of

OAP data enable one to construct detailed cost measures by country and industry that

account for production techniques, as well as country, tariff and transportation costs.

        By studying evolution of OAP outsourcing patterns over time, this paper analyzes

how cost conditions affect outsourcing. The results show that the share of any industry

OAP outsourcing conducted in a country is responsive to that country’s costs as well as

changes in their competitors’ costs.          The share of OAP imports purchased from a

particular country in a given industry declines when the country’s costs increase, and

grows when competitor country costs for that industry rise.

        More important, by showing how country or industry characteristics condition the

degree of cost responsiveness I provide evidence that is consistent with outsourcing

theories that are based on information search, or development costs. In this regard

country development, is highlighted for a number of reasons.             First, if more developed

countries produce goods that are more highly differentiated than those originating from

developing countries, cost changes may exert a greater influence on decisions about the


3
 OAP imports constituted 9.6 percent of U.S. goods imports during the sample period, 1980-2000. OAP
imports were 11.7% of U.S. goods imports between 1980 and 1990, and 8.3% for 1991-2000.


                                                  2
more homogenous products assembled in developing countries. Further, higher skill

levels in developed countries may also provide better insulation from cost-based

production shifts. To the extent that lower skilled workers are more interchangeable,

there may be fewer frictions that prevent the movement of simple assembly operations

from one low wage developing country to the next, such as the search costs that are

highlighted in Grossman and Helpman(2004).           The empirical analysis confirms the

importance of development differences, showing that developing countries are more

adversely affected by increases in their own costs, or declines in competitor costs than are

developed countries.      Of industry characteristics, capital intensity figures most

prominently.    Here, the allocation of outsourcing activities in less capital intense

industries responds more vigorously to cost changes than outsourcing activities in more

capital intense industries, further suggesting that outsourcing theories based on search

costs and tailoring of the production process are consistent with the data.

       The rest of the paper is organized as follows. To motivate the regression analysis,

section two describes recent models of outsourcing, highlighting the role of country or

industry characteristics in enhancing or reducing the overall sensitivity of outsourcing to

costs. Section two also describes the OAP data that are the basis for this project. Section

three provides a model of outsourcing production decisions, which is then estimated in

Section four. A brief conclusion follows in section five.




                                             3
2. Outsourcing and Trade Background

        Cross country factor cost differences may create an incentive to engage in

outsourcing, as firms decide where to complete the different production stages – design,

materials extraction, parts production, and assembly - that are required for the creation of

a final product. As with trade in final products, comparative advantage determines the

ideal country placement for each production stage. 4

        However, while one expects outsourcing decisions to respond to country cost

conditions, it is not obvious that outsourcing production will respond quickly or

substantially to all cost changes. As Rauch (1999) highlights, information appears to

play a large role in determining trade volumes, especially for differentiated products. As

a result, even when country costs change, firms may not be sufficiently well informed

about other markets to quickly change the location of their international sourcing.

Grossman and Helpman's (2004) recent work on international outsourcing includes just

such an informational feature; when Northern firms seek partners they must expend

resources on information gathering as they search for potential partners who match their

production requirements. In this context, Northern firms may be dissuaded from seeking

outsourcing partners in the low wage South if the fixed costs of information gathering are

high in those locations. Similarly, if a firm is hit by a cost shock in one country where it

operates, it may only seek information on alternative outsourcing partners if the shock is

sufficiently large to warrant the expenditures involved in finding a new partner.5




4
  As Deardorff(2001) shows outsourcing may facilitate factor price equalization in settings where ordinary
goods trade would not suffice.
5
  This would be consistent with hysteresis, as described by Baldwin (1988), Baldwin and Krugman (1989),
Dixit (1989), Krugman (1989), or Tybout and Roberts (1999).


                                                    4
        Since there dramatic differences in skill levels by country development it seems

very likely that the search costs Grossman and Helpman (2004) feature in their models

will be much higher for developed country projects than they are for developing country

outsourcing projects. If developing country outsourcing assembly is typified by low-skill

assembly activities performed by low wage workers, it may not be difficult for firms to

compare their options across developing country locations.                      If this is true, then

developing country outsourcing decisions should respond more vigorously to cost

changes, since the fixed costs of search are proportionately smaller than they are in cases

where highly skilled, and highly specialized assembly facilities are required.

        This same argument may distinguish the difficulty of relocating a highly detailed

production processes versus those that are less differentiated and complex. Search costs,

and the costs of relationship-specific investments described by Grossman and Helpman

(2004) are likely to be higher for more complicated assembly tasks. If capital intense

projects have higher search costs, and entail more tailoring of production to meet the

outsourcing firm’s production requirements, capital intense industries are likely to exhibit

a smaller responsiveness to cost changes. 6 To explore this possibility, I test whether less

capital intense industries are more cost sensitive than those that have highly capital

intensive production processes.




6
  In a related vein, Qui and Spencer (2002) show how trade policy loses its potency when relationship-
specific investments cause firms to purchase intermediate inputs from affiliates rather than unrelated
parties.

2.1 A Description of OAP and Outsourcing Trends

         The data for this project track U.S. outsourcing conducted through the OAP

program between the years 1980 and 2000. While it is now referred to as 9802 in the

U.S. tariff code, the U.S. Overseas Assembly Program originated with the Tariff Act of

1930.7    The OAP program provides tariff benefits for producers whose products were

assembled abroad using U.S.-origin parts, components or materials. When OAP products

arrive in the U.S., tariffs are levied only on the value-added that was generated abroad,

while the product value attributable to U.S. parts and components is exempt.8 Since

administration of the OAP program requires importers to provide information about the

composition of their products, and whether the value of the product is attributable to

dutiable OAP import or non-dutiable U.S.-origin components, its operation creates an

opportunity to directly observe one component of U.S. outsourcing activities.

         Figure 1 displays the broad expansion of OAP imports between 1971 and 2000.

Over this period the real value of OAP imports grew more than 400 percent in value.

While this represents a substantial growth rate, OAP outsourcing did not grow as quickly

as outsourcing measured in Hummels, Ishii and Yi (2001), possibly since the desirability

of OAP assembly was inhibited by the requirement of using U.S. inputs which were

likely to be relatively expensive, even after the tariff preference. There is one large spike

in OAP imports in the late 1980's that disappears by the early 1990's.                    Further

examination of the data at a more disaggregated level shows that the spike is driven by a

surge in OAP auto imports from all major partners in the late 1980's. If auto activities are

U.S. moved to the Harmonized System in 1989.

removed from the series, the time pattern of OAP imports exhibits a smooth, though

slower sustained growth during the late 1980's and beginning of the 1990's.9

          Figure 1 also displays the breakdown of total OAP imports between dutiable

OAP import value and non-dutiable U.S. materials and components. In all years, the

value of dutiable foreign-source OAP activities exceeded the value of the U.S. inputs

contained in OAP products.



2.2 The OAP data sample

        In this project, the unit of analysis is the 4-digit SIC OAP imports by country.

Due to concordance and data limitations, the data set is divided into two data panels, the

first for 1980-1990 which is analyzed using 1972-definition SIC codes, and the second

for 1991 to 2000 which is based on 1987-definition SIC codes. Each of the data panels

includes almost 400 4-digit SIC industries, and OAP imports from more than 60

countries. Appendix 1 lists the countries that are included in the analysis.10 Notably,

OAP imports originated not just from low income locations that are known for their

assembly operations, but also from a full array of richer countries.

        Since this paper seeks to show how competitive pressures affect the location of

sourcing activities, it is important to characterize which countries were in competition

with each other.       As Grossman and Helpman (2002, 2004) demonstrate, it is not

reasonable to assume that all low wage countries are viable outsourcing candidates based

on their low costs alone. In particular, a low wage country can lose its attractiveness as

    The spike in program usage does not influence the general findings presented later. If transportation
(SIC 37) or automobiles (SIC 371) are removed from the sample the general results do not change.
10
    Countries were included in the sample if they had 10 or more positive OAP shipment observations in
the panel.


                                                   7
an outsourcing location if its wage advantage is more than offset by an absence of

suitable facilities, legal protections, infrastructure or worker skills.                       In addition,

transportation costs may also remove the country from consideration as a potential

supplier.

         To create a manageable definition of competition, countries are defined as a

potential supplier, or competitor for a particular 4-digit SIC industry if the country

exported OAP products in that 4-digit SIC during any of the years in the sample period.

While this definition excludes countries that were considered but never selected, the

advantage of defining competitors more narrowly is that it prevents the false inclusion of

countries that never exerted competitive pressures in the industry.11

         Using this definition, Table 1 summarizes the variation in the number of

competitor countries by industry for both the early 1980-1990 and late 1991-2000 data

panels. When the data are organized by 2-digit industry, cross industry differences in

competition become apparent. As might be expected, the largest number of competing

countries was present in Textiles and Apparel. Within textiles and apparel, the typical 4-

digit SIC industry received OAP imports from 41 countries in the early years, and 39

countries in the later panel. The presence of competitors in the 2-digit industries is very

consistent across the two time periods.




11
  This approach is similar to that of Goldberg and Knetter (1999), which defines competitors as countries
that also export a product and have a reasonably large market share. Further, if the panels were instead
created by following all SIC industries, for all countries in the sample period, fewer than 10 percent of the
country-industry-year import observations would be non-zero.
   Other authors including Schott (2002) or Bernard and Jensen (2002) focus on low wage competition.
However, this study is unable to exploit Schott’s definition of low wage competitors since very few OAP
imports were purchased from Schott’s sample of especially “low wage” countries.



                                                      8
3. A Model of OAP Outsourcing

           In order to estimate how costs affect the location of OAP activities it is necessary

to specify a model of outsourcing decisions. To do this, I begin with a simple reduced

form model that is sufficiently flexible to include the economic variables of interest, and

to assess whether the allocation of OAP production across countries is consistent with

predictions from the outsourcing literature.

           The simple equation relates the share of OAP imports SHRict purchased in

industry i from country c in year t to the number of potential providers ni, and to

economic factors Xict that are discussed in the literature on outsourcing and international

trade.12



(1)        SHRict = γ[1/ni] + βXict + εict,



As discussed in Section 2, the number of competitor countries ni is defined as the number

of countries during the sample period that ever provided U.S. OAP imports in a particular

4-digit industry. In any given year the number of potential providers ni is almost always

larger than the actual number of providers since most country-industry OAP producers

experienced at least a few years for which their OAP exports were zero. If OAP products

are differentiated by country of assembly, and consumer utility is characterized by a love

of variety, then we would expect that each provider would ship an equal share, [1/ni], if

all economic factors were equal, and all potential providers were in the market.

           However, OAP production opportunities do differ in a number of fundamental



12
     The dependent variable is constructed as SHRict = (OAP Customs Value ict)/∑c (OAP Customs Value ict).


                                                      9
ways which are captured by the explanatory variables in Xict. These include regressors,

such as country GDP, GDP per capita, and distance from the U.S. that are commonly

included in gravity or other reduced form estimates of trade volumes. The vector of

explanatory variables also includes detailed measures of production costs that account for

production techniques, transportation costs, and the tariff treatment of OAP products

from a country. The set of explanatory variables also includes a measure of competitor

country costs. As predicted by all outsourcing theories, a rise in own costs in country c,

should depress the share of outsourcing activities conducted in that location. In contrast,

a country is expected to benefit from the ability to sell a greater share of OAP products

when the costs of its competitors rise. The final components of Xict include a full set of

country and industry dummy variables. The general equation is first run using Tobit

techniques, since there are many observations where the country share of industry i is

zero and a small handful where the share is one.13

        To better account for heterogeneity across industries and countries, such as the

more subtle variation resulting from industry comparative advantage by country, most of

the regressions rely on random effects Tobit estimation instead, where the error term

takes the form:

(2)     εict = θic + ηict

which includes a country-industry effect θic as well as an iid disturbance ηict. A primary

benefit of these techniques is that the country-industry effect can help to control for

factors that condition the suitability of a country for provision of OAP products in

industry i that are otherwise unobservable.


13
   In studying U.S. import data at the product level, Besedes and Prusa (2001) document the prevalence of
zero trade flows due to the intensity of entry in to and out of importing generally.


                                                   10
3.1 Cost Measurement

        Before the share equation can be estimated it is important to generate measures of

own and competitor country costs. I exploit the details of the OAP program, to create

highly detailed cost measures that relate to production techniques, production costs,

transportation costs, and tariffs. I then combine these measures with my earlier definition

of competition to create competitor cost measures.

        The literature on vertical integration traditionally begins with a Leontieff

production function.14 In modeling the structure of OAP costs, I assume that OAP

production requires producers to complete a series of mi tasks that must be performed in

order beginning at task 0 and ending with task mi which is the final assembly task. A

fraction of those tasks, which is represented by the activities from 0 to αus, involves the

production of parts and materials in the U.S. The remaining activities from αus to mi are

performed in a foreign location. The fact that a producer is using the OAP program

implies that the U.S. has comparative advantage in the early stage tasks, while the foreign

country has comparative advantage final assembly, and possibly some other late stage

tasks as well. The actual position of αus will differ by country and industry, taking a

value αus,ic that reflects the relative productivity of the U.S. versus the foreign country in

the industry, as well as tariffs and the transportation costs for the country-industry pair.




14
   See Greenhut and Ohta (1979), or Mendez (1993) for an application to OAP. Yi (2003) creates a more
elaborate three stage production structure.

If a project requires Li units of labor, and each of the mi tasks in the project requires Li/mi

units of labor, the total production cost for the product will be:15


(3)        Production Costic = [αus,ic*wus + (1- αus,ic)*wc)]* Li

where the αus,ic U.S. tasks require U.S. labor which costs wus per unit, while the cost of

foreign labor for the (1-αus,ic) tasks performed abroad is wc.

           Completing OAP products involves two further costs.                        First, an ad valorem

transportation cost gic applies not only to the shipment of the final product to the U.S., but

also to the shipment of the αus,ic U.S. intermediate inputs to the assembly location.

Second, the foreign value added (1- αus,ic) is subject to U.S. import tariffs at a rate τi.

Adding these elements to the underlying production cost yields the total cost of OAP

sourcing:

(4)        Cic = [αus,ic*wus + (1- αus,ic)*wc)]* Li * [1+gic (1+ αus,ic)+ (1- αus,ic)*τi]

The cost measure is created by following this formula, using the data that are described in

         To quantify competitive pressures exerted by competitor countries, Competitor

Cost creates the weighted average of competitor country costs, where weights are based

on the real value of OAP imports Vci for all countries c producing in industry i. The

competitor cost measure for country c' in year t is defined as:

                                         Vci                  

                                         ∑ c ≠ c ' Vci        

         Costs for each country c, Cic, are measured using the cost formula given by (4).

The competitor cost measure is computed using 1980 and 1990 value weights in the first

panel, and 1991 to 2000 value weights in the second panel. An increase in the Competitor

Cost variable indicates that competitor country costs have risen.




16
  I assume that the cost of transporting inputs in industry i is the same as the cost of transporting final
goods in industry i, since I do not have detailed information on composition of input trade that would
enable me to use transportation costs for the U.S. inputs that are shipped abroad for foreign assembly. To
proxy country costs, I used the Penn World Table, P, which is the price level of gross domestic product.
Since I assume that the labor needed to produce a product, Li, is the same for all locations, it should be
viewed as a scaling factor that will not influence country shares. It is removed from equation (4) since
there is no good measure by industry. Finally, to complete the cost calculation I use the average value of
αus,ic for an industry-country over the sample period. While the magnitude of αus,ic does vary with the
relative cost of sourcing in country c compared to the cost of production in the U.S., the economic effects
of these shifts, as in Swenson (1999) are small.

4.0 Results

       The primary estimating equation relates the share of U.S. OAP imports from

different countries to cost and economic conditions that influence the attractiveness of

outsourcing in different locations. After exploring the effects in the full sample, the

effects by development, industry and country are investigated.

       The consistent message of the analysis is that costs do influence the location of

outsourcing. As Table 2 shows, a country’s share of OAP outsourcing falls if the

country’s costs increase and the country’s share grows when its competitors’ costs rise.

The results emerge in both the early 1980-1990 panel and the late 1991-2000 panel,

whether the estimates are done by Tobit with full sets of country and industry dummies,

as displayed in columns (1) and (2), or by random effects Tobit.

       While the first columns of Table 2 provide a baseline Tobit for comparison, my

preferred method of estimation is random effects Tobit.          One reason for including

country-industry effects is to capture unobservable features, the most notable of which

includes comparative advantage at the country-industry level that influences the

desirability of assembling industry i goods in country c. Another benefit of using random

effects Tobit is that it enables me to estimate the effect of time-invariant economic factors

that influence outsourcing, such as distance, whose effects are otherwise subsumed in the

country controls.

       Since changes in outsourcing are likely to require time, to enable firms to search

for new partners and write new contracts or to build new assembly facilities, the

regressions are based on own and competitor cost measures that are lagged two periods.




                                             14
However, the decision to lag the cost measures two periods is not critical, as the results

for a one period lag are almost identical.17

         The own cost coefficients imply that a ten percent increase in own costs would

have reduced the outsourcing share by 1.7 percent in the 1980-1990 interval, or by 0.8

percent in the later panel. While these numbers may not seem large, they are relatively

large when compared with the average share provided by countries, which was 4.6% for

1980-1990, and 5.6 for 1991-2000.18

         Columns (3) and (4) of Table 2 show that high GDP per capita is found to reduce

a country’s share of OAP activity.                However, one might be concerned that GDP

measures, because they contain information on country costs, will influence the estimated

magnitude of the own country cost measures. To investigate this possibility, the GDP

measures are removed from the regressions displayed in columns (5) and (6). The

magnitudes of the estimated cost coefficients all rise slightly as compared with the

regression results shown in columns (3) and (4). However the fit of the regressions also

falls. For that reason, the GDP measures are included in the remaining regressions,

though it should be recognized that their inclusion seems to reduce the estimated

magnitude of the cost coefficients by a small amount.

         Notably, even though the measures of cost explicitly include the cost of

transporting items in industry i from country c to the U.S., as well as the cost of moving


17
    For example, if I re-estimate the specifications shown in columns (3) and (4) of Table 2 using costs that
are lagged only a single period, the values for own cost and competitor cost are -.177(.011) and .169(.008)
in a revised column (3), and -.078(.012) and .295(.007) in a revised column (4). However, the log-
likelihoods of the revised regressions, -17,614 and -14,563 imply that the fit of the two lag specification is
better than the single lag specification. Further, if cost measures for one and two lags are included in a
single specification, the magnitude and significance of the coefficients on the two lag measures exceeds
that of the coefficients on the single lag measures.
18
    The average share provided, if zero observations are excluded, is 13.7% in the early years, and 13.5% in
the late years.


                                                     15
intermediate inputs to the assembly country, distance is found to further reduce a

country’s share of OAP assembly.                 These results are consistent with recent work

suggesting that distance reduces trade not only due to the cost of moving items, but also

due to the time disadvantage of being located far from customers.19 It is also worth

noting that the coefficient on distance is smaller in the later panel than it is for the earlier

years, as might be the case if communications improvements over time reduced the

delays associated with more distant outsourcing partners.

         To control for the number of potential partners, and to gauge the range of

substitution opportunities, I use the term (1/# of Competitors), which is based on the

number of countries who provided goods in the same 4-digit industry over the sample

periods. The results show that country shares of OAP activity are higher for supplier

countries who face fewer competitors. Partner density can alternatively be measured by

the count of contemporaneous competitors supplying the industry. However, the choice

of competitor count measure does not seem to affect the estimated magnitude or

significance of the primary coefficients of interest.

         Finally, it is interesting to note that controls for industry capital intensity,

measured by the capital intensity of the U.S. industry, have significantly different

coefficients depending on whether the OAP activity is conducted in a developed or

developing country.20 This evidence is consistent with Head and Ries’s (2002) findings




19
    See Hummels(2001) and Evans and Harrigan(2003).
20
    I make the assumption that the capital intensity of outsourcing operations is positively correlated with
the capital intensity of the U.S. industry. While it would be desirable to have direct measures of capital
intensity in outsourcing operations, no such measures exist.
    The coefficients on the developed country and developing country capital intensity coefficients are
almost always statistically distinct. Allowing for separate coefficients improves the regression fit
compared with a baseline that has a single capital intensity regressor for all countries.


                                                      16
that suggest that Japanese firms hire less skilled workers in low income locations, and

higher skilled workers in high income countries.

        The initial regression specification assumes that the regression coefficients are the

same for all sourcing relationships, with the exception of the coefficients on capital

intensity, which are allowed to differ for developed and developing countries. However,

as section 2 notes, there are a many reasons why outsourcing may react differently to cost

changes or other economic factors, depending on whether the overseas assembly is

located in a developed or a developing country.

        To examine the issue further, the effects of development on sourcing choices are

explored in Tables 3 and 4, which consider 1980-1990 and 1991-2000 OAP outsourcing

in turn. I use two alternative definitions of development. The first defines a country as

“developed” if it was a member of the OECD in 1985. The second definition classifies

countries as developed if the average education of the adult population exceeded 6

years.21

        What is interesting are the systematic differences between the estimated

coefficients for developing and developed countries. As in the full sample, the new

results suggest that own cost increases reduce the share of the market provided by a

country, while competitor cost increases boost the country’s share. However, in all cases

the effect of own cost changes is more pronounced for developing countries than it is for

developed countries, implying that cost rises are more harmful to developing country

shares of OAP than they are for developed country shares. In addition, the results also



21
  The classification was based on educational attainment in 1990 in Barro and Lee, for adults 25 or older. I
adopt Riker and Brainard's (1997) use of 6 or more years education as the definition of a high education
country, which I define as “developed” countries.


                                                    17
suggest that developing countries are more strongly benefited by increases in competitor

costs. 22 Another dichotomy that is interesting is the fact that the detrimental effect of

distance on OAP share is stronger for developing countries in three of the four

regressions.

        I now use distinct measures of competitor numbers for developed and developing

countries to reflect differential substitution opportunities. In particular, if workers in

developed countries are more skilled, it is likely that they perform activities that are more

complexly tailored, and their particular skills may not be replaceable in developing

locations. To reflect these differences, for developed country observations competition is

measured by the number of developed country competitors in the industry. Similarly,

competition for developing country observations is measured by the count of developing

country competitors in industry. As with the other variables, the competitor counts are

based on the definition of development. In the first set of regressions, the competitor

counts are based on the OECD definition, while the counts are based on the 6 year

education threshold in the second set of regressions. The results in Tables 3 and 4

support the idea that the pool of competitors has a differential effect on developing and

developed countries. However, while the effects are statistically distinct, the measured

effects differ with the definition of development.

        Industry capital intensity may also condition the flexibility of outsourcing

movements across countries. If components produced for more capital intense industries

are generally more differentiated, specialized or complex, firms will have to conduct


22
  The one perverse coefficient is the negative sign on competitor cost, for OECD countries providing OAP
products between 1991 and 2000. If the GDP terms are eliminated from the regression, the competitor
costs are as expected, taking a value of .291(.011) for the OECD and .351(.011) for the non-OECD, while
the own cost coefficients are -.038(.025) for the OECD and -.166(.013) for the non-OECD.


                                                   18
more involved searches to identify partners who are capable of assembling these

components into final products. In addition, since partner searches in more capital

intense industries are likely to cost more, the high cost of such searches is likely to reduce

the cost responsiveness of those sectors. To test this idea, Table 5 adds new regressors

that interact industry capital intensity with the own and competitor cost measures.23 The

coefficients on the cost interactions for 1980-1990 indicate that all cost responses are

attenuated in more capital intense industries. The results imply that the cost response for

overseas assembly in the least capital intense industries is 30 percent larger than cost

responses for the most capital intense industries.24 The results for 1991-2000 also imply

that own cost responses were smaller in more capital intense industries, though the

interaction term is not statistically significant.

         Market thickness in partners is another element that may influence the relative

attractiveness of searching for partners in new countries.25 One way of thinking about

market thickness in the context of OAP imports, is to examine how many countries

produced products in a particular 4-digit industry during the period examined, and to see

whether the effects of cost changes were more or less pronounced for industries that were

characterized by “thick markets” for partners. I do this by adding regressors that interact

the cost terms with counts of potential suppliers, where potential competitors are defined

23
   While it would be desirable to use capital intensity measures that characterize the capital intensity of the
foreign assembly operations, no such measures exist. The average capital intensity for the U.S. industry
during the sample period is used instead. If U.S. industries achieve high capital intensity by outsourcing
low intensity activities, the interaction terms will underestimate the effect of capital intensity on cost
responses.
24
    The implied cost response for firms whose capital intensity is in 10th percentile is -.202, while the cost
response for those in the 90th percentile is -.155.
25
   Market thickness facilitates outsourcing in both McLaren’s (2000) and Grossman and Helpman’s
(2002b) models. In McLaren’s model which has multiple equilibria, market thickness increases
outsourcing through "arm's length" arrangements. In Grossman and Helpman the degree of outsourcing is
influenced by firm's likelihood of finding a suitable outsourcing partner, which is enhanced by market
thickness. In both models, the degree of market thickness is endogenous.


                                                      19
as in Table 1. In these regressions I expect that the detrimental effect of own cost

increases, and the beneficial effect of competitor cost increases will be magnified when

there are more competitors. The results displayed in the third and fourth columns of

Table 5 support this view.               The results for1980 to 1990 imply that outsourcing

combinations that were in the bottom 10th percentile, as defined by competition, had an

own cost effect that was only sixty percent as large the own cost effect for outsourcing

combinations in the 90th percentile.26



Robustness Checks

           To investigate the robustness of the results, the regressions were performed on

sub-groups of the data. The first set of results is performed for the 2-digit SIC industries

that were the most frequent suppliers of the OAP program – Textiles and Apparel in SIC

23, Non-Electrical Machinery in SIC 35, and Electrical Machinery in SIC 36. These

results are contained in Tables 6 and 7, and are notable in echoing the cost findings from

the full data set. The coefficients on competitor costs for the Machinery and Electrical

machinery industries, which are thought to be especially footloose, are particularly large.

In contrast, the fact that the competitor cost coefficient is smaller for the Textile and

Apparel industry may reflect rigidities that relate to the quotas imposed by the multi fibre

agreement rather than a small response to competitor costs.

           As a further check on the robustness of the results, the regression was run

separately for countries that were the most frequent suppliers of the OAP program. The

cost coefficients from these regressions are reported in Table 8. In the country sub-



26
     The implied own cost coefficient for the 10th percentile was -.131, and -.223 for the 90th percentile.


                                                       20
samples, the coefficient on own cost is generally negative as expected, though many are

not statistically significant.    In contrast, the results for competitor cost are almost all

positive and significant, confirming the benefit OAP suppliers experience when their

competitors’ costs rise. The magnitudes of the competitor cost coefficients by country

appear to reflect the industry mix of the products they provide.          For example, the

competitor cost response is always high for Singapore, a country that produced many

items in the machinery categories.         The cross-country variation in competitor cost

coefficients also appears to have a weak correlation with market shares. Most notably,

the response to competitor costs is smaller for Canada and Mexico, which generally

supply a higher than average share of the market. However, when I tested whether

market shares had a direct effect of cost responsiveness, by adding interactions for own

and competitor cost with (average share)ci, the estimated coefficients on the interaction

terms were not significant. Finally I tested whether the implementation of the Canada-

US Free Trade Agreement in 1989, or the implementation of the North American Free

Trade Agreement in 1994 affected Canada or Mexico’s country shares by adding a FTA

dummy for the years where a free trade agreements was in force. However, explicit

treatment of the free trade years does not generally change the cost results for Canada or

Mexico.



5.0 Conclusion

        This paper analyzes the cost responsiveness of U.S. OAP outsourcing imports

between 1980 and 2000.           The results demonstrate that a country’s share of OAP

outsourcing grows when its own costs fall, or when its competitors’ costs rise. For the




                                               21
1990’s, the results imply that a 10 percent increase in a country’s costs would reduce its

share by 0.8%, which is relatively large compared with the average share which was

5.6%.      One implication of the results is that tariff reductions offered by U.S. trade

preference programs, such as the Andean Trade Pact, the US-Caribbean Basin Trade

Partnership Act, or the African Growth and Opportunity Act, have probably elevated the

share of U.S. trade originating from partner countries.

        The magnitude of cost responses varies on a number of interesting dimensions.

First, cost changes are found to exert a much larger influence on the OAP import shares

of developing countries than on the OAP import shares of developed countries. In

addition, cost responses of less capital intense industries are generally larger than those

for more capital intense sectors. In both cases, the differential responses by country or

industry are consistent with the predictions of outsourcing models that feature fixed costs

of search or product development. Nonetheless, the general own and competitor cost

results seem to apply broadly across countries and industries.

        Since the OAP program facilitates the use of U.S. materials and components in

overseas assembly, it is important to remember that it captures only one element of U.S.

outsourcing activities. In particular, if OAP assembly tasks are generally less complex,

and therefore more easily matched and coordinated than are other types of outsourcing

operations, then the frictions emphasized by Grossman and Helpman (2004) may inhibit

outsourcing flexibility in other sectors to a greater degree than is found in the OAP

context. Further research focusing other outsourcing venues would help complete the

picture.

Data Appendix

OAP Imports
The import data are taken from United States International Trade Commission (USITC) reports
on 806/807 and 9082 imports. The data on OAP import values between 1980 and 1988 originate
from information on 806/807 imports in the Tariff Schedule of the United States, while the import
data for 1989 to 2000 were registered under the provisions of 9802 in the Harmonized System for
the years. The data for the years 1980 to 1988 were scanned from hard copies of the trade data,
while the later years were available electronically. Due to poor quality of the hard copy originals,
it was not possible to include data from the years 1982 or 1988. The data from these programs
were aggregated to the 4-digit SIC industry level to facilitate comparison with U.S. industry data.
Robert Feenstra’s concordance at the National Bureau of Economic Research, at
http://www.nber.org/data_index.html was used to categorize U.S. imports to 1972 four-digit
industries, while Peter Schott’s http://www.som.yale.edu/faculty/pks4/sub_international.htm
concordance facilitated creation of 1987-based SIC information. The 1980-2000 panel was
divided into a 1980-1990 panel which was based on 1974 4-digit SIC codes, while the data for
1991-2000 were based on 1987 4-digit industry classifications. Computing costs using equation
(4) requires a measure of αus,ic which describes the fraction of inputs that are U.S.-origin. This
was computed by [(Total Customs Value)ic – (Dutiable Value)ic]/ (Total Customs Value)ic.

Industry Characteristics
Data on U.S. industry characteristics were collected from the NBER Manufacturing Database,
which is available from the National Bureau of Economic Research data site, at
http://www.nber.org/data_index.html, as constructed by Bartlesman, Becker and Gray. Capital
intensity was measured by dividing industry capital stock variable by industry shipments, and
taking the average value for the time period, 1980-1990 in the first panel, and 1991 to 1996 in the
second panel, since the industry data end in 1996.

Tariffs and Transportation Costs
Transportation costs were constructed from Robert C. Feenstra’s data “U.S. Imports and Exports
by 4-digit SIC Industry, 1958-94” which are posted and described at
http://data.econ.ucdavis.edu/international/usixd/usixd4sic.html. Tariff data for 1980-1988 were
available Chris Magee’s “U.S. Tariffs at the SIC Level, 1974-1988, at
data.econ.ucdavis.edu/international/ustariff.html. Tariff and transportation cost data for the later
panel were taken from Peter Schott’s web site cited above.

Macroeconomic and Country Variables
Country price and macroeconomic information were taken from Alan Heston, Robert Summers
and Bettina Aten, Penn World Table Version 6.1, Center for International Comparisons at the
University of Pennsylvania (CICUP), October 2002, available at http://pwt.econ.upenn.edu/.
Exchange rates were collected from were collected from the International Monetary Fund's
International Financial Statistics. Distance information was collected from Jon Haveman’s site,
http://www.macalester.edu/research/economics/PAGE/HAVEMAN/Trade.Resources/Gravity/Dis
t.txt.

Education Variables
Data on country education was collected from Barro and Lee’s data, available from the National
Bureau of Economic Research, at http://www.nber.org/data_index.html.

The regressions are based on the log form of all continuous independent variables.
