                 Tax Changes and Capital Allocation in the 1980s




                                        ABSTRACT



       The paper begins with presentation of
                                               a methodology for computing rental
 costs of capital under any tax regime.    Tax law over the 1980—84 period is
 specified and the provisions of the Treasury and Administration tax reform

proposals and HR 3838 are described. A model is then constructed to allow

calculation of the impact of changes in tax
                                               regimes and/or expected inflation on
interest rates and the allocation of real
                                             capital. The model allocates a fixed
private capital stock among various classes of nonresidential and residential

capital, depending upon the rental costs for the
                                                    capital components, the price
elasticities of demand with respect to the rental costs, and the elasticities of

homeownership with respect to the cost of owning versus renting. The interest

rate adjusts in response to tax/inflation changes so as to maintain the

aggregate demand for capital at this initial level.    The model is employed to
deduce the efficiency of the allocation of real capital under various tax

regimes at different inflation rates.

        Three tax bills were enacted in the first half of the 1980s: the

  Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility
                                                                              Act
  of 1982, and the Deficit Reduction
                                       Act of 1984. Moreover-, major tax reform
 proposals, most notably the Noventher 1984 Treasury plan and the May 1985

 Administration plan, have been advanced for implementation in the second half

 of this decade and the U.S. House
                                     of Representatives passed a reform bill in
 December 1985. The passed or
                                proposed tax changes have altered or would
 significantly affect both the overall taxation
                                                   of capital and taxation in
 different uses. As a result, changes in interest rates, homeownership,
                                                                        and
 investment in various types of capital have or would probably be induced.
                                                                                The
 nture and extent of these changes are the subjects of this
                                                            paper.
       The method of analysis is the
                                       construction and manipulation of a
 relatively small simulation model. The principal features of the model are the

dependencies of the demands for various
                                           types of capital on their gross (of
depreciation) user costs of capital and of the user costs on tax parameters and

interest rates. Special emphasis is placed on the housing sector where

households at six different income levels make tenure and quantity_demanded

decisions. Finally, the level of taxable interest rates is determined
                                                                      by
equality between the total 'demand for
                                         capital and the existing capital stock.
      The model is first used to simulate the 1981—82 tax changes.1 The

implied effects of the tax legislation
                                         on interest rates, homeownership, and
capital allocation are then compared with
                                            observed changes in the 1981—84
period. The model implications are at
                                         least roughly consistent with observed
                                                  —2—

events. The model is then employed to simulate the impacts of the Treasury and

Administration tax proposals and the House bill. The proposals are analyzed in

a five percent inflation world; the inflation neutrality of current law and

the reform proposals ar.e compared; and efficiency losses due to misallocation

of capital are computed for the various tax regimes.



                      I. Investment Hurdle Rates or User Costs

General Considerations

         As is well known (Hall and Jorgenson, 1967) ,          the decision to invest
depends on whether the present value of the expected revenue from investment

exceeds the supply price of capital, and on marginal investments the two will

be equal. After allowance for taxation, the equilibrium condition for

investment is

                                     (r+d+r ITi) (l—k—tz)
                             —                              ,
                                          —                                    (1)

where      is the business tax rate, p is the gross marginal product of capital,

r is the real after—tax financing rate, d is the economic depreciation rate,

T   is   the concurrent equivalent tax rate on inflationary gains, ir is the

expected inflation rate, and k is the investment tax credit.2 In general, z

the present value of the streaii of tax depreciation allowances,
                                                                             TAXDEPt.
obtained by discounting the stream of depreciation allowances by the required

nominal after—tax financing rate; taking into account the reduction in

depreciable basis if the investment tax credit is claimed:

  where N is the depreciation period of the
                                            asset. The right side of equation
   (1) is the "investment hurdle rate or rental user cost for a particular asset.

  The lower the user cost, the
                                 greater will be production of the asset, and the
  lower will be the productivity of the
                                                marginal investment (p)

        In a neutral' tax system, the net user and thus net marginal

  productivities (p — d) would be the same for all equally—risky
                                                                 assets. This
  can be achieved in a variety of ways. For example, with k =                      = 0 and
                                                                            0,
  either z = 1 —— expensing ——   or      =   0, then p — d =     r.    If the r's were equal
  for all assets, the tax system would be neutral across them. Alternatively,

 with k =   0,   = 0 and z =   d/(r   + d) ——      tax   depreciation equal to economic
 depreciation, then p — d =    r/(l—t).       If the r's and the r's were the same for

 all assets, then the system would also be neutral. Because the I'S are zero

 for owner—occupied housing, expensing for depreciable assets (and the

 nondeductibility of property taxes on owner—occupied housing) would lead to tax

 ndutraiity —— assuming equal r's ——         but setting tax depreciation equal to
 economic depreciation would not.3

       Assuming that firms use a fixed fraction of debt, b, for financing all

 investments, the real after—tax financing rate can be expressed as



                   r =   [b(l—8t)i    + (1—b) (l—yT)e —      i]/(l÷)   ,         (3)


where 8 and y, respectively, are the portions of interest and equity returns

that are deductible at the business level, and e is the required nominal return

to investors. (Currently 6 = 1 and y =          0.)      Firms will choose the b at which
the marginal costs of debt and
                                 equity, including contracting and bankruptcy
costs, are equal. (Because this marginal cost is
                                                             unknown, average values of i
and e are used in the calculation of r.)

 Portfolio equilibrium of investors requires that



                                   (l—T )e = (1—x)i + 6,                                             (4)
                                         e




 where T is the rate at which equity returns are taxed at the personal level,

 x is the relevant tax rate for taxable interest (the lower of the personal tax

 rate and that implicit in tax—exempt yields) , and 6 is the risk premium

 required on equity investments. For all investments except owner—occupied

 housing of low and middle income households, x is the tax rate implicit in

 tax—exempt yields x. Substituting (4) into (3) ,                          the real after—tax financing
 rate for capital other than owner—occupied housing is:



                                                         (l—x )i + 6
                                                              e
          r =   [b(l—i)i       + (1—b) (l—yT)
                                                          1—i e
                                                                           —   uJ/(l+).              (3')




If ly were equal to i          (which would be true if y =                     T       = 0) and x = 6T, r
                         e     •                                                   e            e

would equal I   (l—t)i   —         + 6(1—b) ]/(l+) for all assets. Further, if all

interest expense were deductible at the same rate and all investments were

equally risky, all r's would be equal.

      For corporations, T depends on the taxation of dividends and capital

gains and the division of equity raised between new issues and retained

earnings (Auerbach, 1979) .             More generally,

                                                                  cg
                                                                       ,                         (5)


where n is the proportion of equity funds raised by new issues, and Td. and

Tcg respectively, are the effective tax rates on dividends and equity capital

gains. In general, T
                         div
                                   =   r.im/2   and -t        =   (l—exclu)t.im/4,        where r.     is the

  capital gains exclusion. The divisions by 2 and 4 allow for tax deferral and

  avoidance activities. An n of 0.1 is assumed; as a result,
                                                                      is relatively
  low (O.l4T. under current law).
                                      For noncorporate businesses (including
  households investing in owner—occupied housing), T equals 0.

         Empirically, the tax rate implicit in
                                                  tax—exempt yields varies with the
  maturity of the security. For short—term tax exempts, the ratio of prime grade

  tax—exempt to risk—free taxable yields has not
                                                    deviated far from unity less the
  corporate tax rate or roughly U.S. For
                                             ten—year bonds, which are more relevant
  for the long—term investments
                                  being analyzed, the ratio has been closer to 0.7.
 The implicit tax rate of 0.3, rather than the federal tax rate of 0.46
                                                                        (the
 State and local tax rate is not relevant
                                              if corporations invest in their own
 jurisdictions), reflects a number of factors, but the most important is likely

 the tax saving from optimally
                                  trading bonds (e.g., taking capital losses and
 deferring capital gains).4 This is especially important because high

 tiansactions costs virtually eliminate any gains from trading municipal bonds.

 The tax rate implicit in long—term
                                      tax—exempt yields is assumed to be given by:



                          Xe =
                                 (O.3)Tfr                              (6)


where      is the federal corporate tax rate and the 0.3 measures the gains from

optimal trading.

        All interest expense is not deductible at the same rate, the clearest

example being owner_occupij housing. Because this asset is held by households

with a wide range of income subject to the full array of marginal
                                                                  personal tax
rates, the tax rates at which interest is
                                              deductible (and at which equity the
owner has in the house would have been taxed had the household rented)
                                                                       vary
across households.5 More generally, the real
                                                  after—tax financing rate for the
jth household is

The tax rate applicable to own equity investment, x.. is defined as the minimum

of the tax rate paid on the last dollar of taxable interest earned, ST., or

that implicit in tax—exempt yields, Xe•

      For all investments other than real estate, b =      1/3.    For real estate

investments other than owner—occupied housing, b =      2/3.    This assumption is

consistent with available data on large—scale (over 50 unit) rental projects,

which probably accounted for over two—thirds of the rental units constructed in

the 1970s.6 The data in Table 1 indicate that ownership of these properties

has shifted sharply from corporations to partnerships over the past two decades

(the vast majority of additions to the stock have certainly been owned by

partnerships) , most of these properties have mortgages (97 percent of those

owned by partnerships in 1980), and the initial loan—to—value ratio on the 81

prcent of properties with a first mortgage at time of purchase is 87 percent.

In 1970, the median loan—to—value ratio was 67 percent. The median was only 53

percent in early 1981, when mortgage rates were at historic highs and terms had

been quite unfavorable for refinancing for three years. The two—thirds ratio

is a reasonable approximation for a present—value, weighted average loan—to—

value ratio in normal times.

      For owner—occupied housing, we vary b. depending on the relative

attractiveness of debt and equity financing. More specifically,

                               (0.667 if x.
                          b.
                               (o.85 if x. <   i.                        (8)




By our definitions, x. cannot exceed 1.. While these ratios far exceed the

0.33 to 0.4 average economy—wide ratio observed for owner—occupied housing,

the observed ratio is heavily influenced by older owning households who have

repaid their mortgages and are relatively insensitive to housing rental costs
                                              —8—

           The 1981 Tax Act also cut the maximum federal tax rates, from 0.48 to

 0.46 for corporations and from 0.7 to 0.5 for households. We assume that the

 marginal noncorporate investor was in the 54 percent bracket in 1980 (at

 roughly the same real income level at which the 49 percent tax rate applied in

 1985) .     The income tax rates in Table 3 presume a 0.06 state and local tax rate

 deductible at the federal level.

           The personal tax rates on real corporate equity returns follow from

 equation (5) and the surrounding discussion, given a capital gains exclusion of

 0.6 (0.0 under the Treasury plan, 0.5 under the Administration plan and 0.42 in

 the House bill) .    The tax rate implicit in tax—exempt yields follows from

 equation (6). Finally, the inflation tax, ,          is   0.7t on inventories because

 FIFO accounting is used for 70 percent of inventories and is effectively zero

 for other assets.

       The Treasury plan attempted to neutralize the tax system for inflation by

 iYidexing everything. Only real capital gains, including those on inventories,

would be taxed (r = 0)     ;   depreciation   would be on a replacement, rather than

historic, cost basis; and only the "real" part of interest expense would be

taxed and could be deducted)0 The Treasury plan also attempted to tax all

assets and business forms (except owner—occupied housing) equally. To this

end, tax depreciation for each depreciable asset would equal the Treasury's

best estimate of true economic depreciation; the investment tax credit would

be dropped; real capital gains would be taxed at the regular income tax rate;

and half of corporate dividends would be deductible at the corporate level.

The indexation of inventory gains, the removal of the tax credit, and the

proposed tax depreciation treatment would result in p—d equaling r/(l—T) for

all properties except owner—occupied housing, and the partial dividend

exclusion would reduce discrepancies between the r's for corporate and

noncorporate investments.

 (see below)] Households under forty use far more debt (the average loan—to—

value ratio for first—time homebuyers in 1984 was 87 percent) and often make

quite long—term housing decisions. It is the decisions of such households that

we are attempting to model, and their present—value, weighted—average, loan—

to—value ratio is probably near two—thirds.

      Based upon Ibbotson—Sinquefield calculations, we assume        for corporate

equities is 0.075, and thus the risk premium for corporate assets, which have a

one—third loan—to—value ratio, is (l—b)J         0.05. The risk premium for

depreciable real estate investors in properties with roughly 0.80 initial

loan—to—value ratios is also about 0.075.8 Because these real—estate assets

have a mean loan—to—value ratio of two—thirds (initial ratio of near 80

percent) ,   their   risk premium is only 0.025. For owner—occupied housing, a

premium of 0.01 is assumed. This relatively low premium is consistent with

owners having certainty with regard to their "vacancy" and "breakage" rates

afid thus greater certainty with respect to their net operating incomes than is

the case with rental properties.

Tax Parameters

      Tables 2 and 3 list the important business tax parameters under the laws

existing in 1980 and 1981—85, in the proposed Treasury and Administration tax

plans and in H.R. 3838 passed in December 1985. The 1981 Tax Act roughly

halved depreciation tax lives and lowered the percentage of straight line for

equipment and utility and residential structures, raised the percentage for

industrial structures, and 'maintained straight—line for commercial real estate

(straight—line is preferred over accelerated methods due to more onerous

recapture provisions upon sale).9 The 1981 Actpromised more accelerated

methods in 1985, but the 1982 Tax Act reneged on the promise and reduced the

depreciable base for equipment by one—half the investment tax credit. The 1984

Act raised the tax life for structures, other than public utilities, back to 18

years and this was raised further to 19 years in late 1985.
                                        —9—

        The Administration plan retreated from these principles in significant

  respects: all interest would continue to be deductible; investors in

  nondepreciable assets would have the option of paying taxes on- nominal capital

 gains at one—half of th regular income tax rate; tax depreciation would

 exceed economic depreciation; only one—tenth of dividends would be deductible;

 and, in order to make the plan revenue neutral, the indexatjon of inventory

 gains is dropped. Tax depreciation would be especially generous for equipment

 that continues to be classified as 3 or 5 years and for public utility

 structures; allowable depreciation would exceed that under current law even at

 zero inflation. However, most 5—year equipment would be reclassified as 6,7

 and even 10—year equipment. For industrial structures, tax depreciation would

 be more favorable only at inflation rates of roughly 5 percent or greater. The

 House bill has double declining balance depreciation
                                                        for equipment and public

 utility structures, but longer depreciation tax lives than the Administration

 p'an and Only partial indexation of the depreciable base (half of the inflation

above 5 percent) results in significantly less favorable overall depreciation.

      The partial dividend exclusion is of little import in our model because

Only 10 percent of equity financing is assumed to be from new share issues on

which dividends are paid. (Dividends are saved initially by the retention of

earnings, offsetting the future payment of dividends.) Thus y in the model is

only 0.05 under the Treasury plan and 0.01 under the Administration plan, 10

percent of the 50 and 10 percent exclusions,
                                                respectively.
      In our analysis of owner—occupied housing, we consider households at five

different income levels in order to deduce the tax rates that are

representative of households in five income ranges. The ranges for 1980 are

listed in the top panel of Table 4; the 1985 ranges, which exceed those from

1980 by a third to two—fifths to reflect the growth in nominal incomes per

household, are listed in the lower panel.     (The exact income levels for which

the tax rate calculations were performed are listed in parentheses.) The

                        II. The Capital Allocation Model'3

An Overview

      The basic model allocates a fixed private capital stock among various

classes of nonresidential and residential capital. The allocation depends on

the rental or user costs for the capital components, the price elasticities of

demand with respect to the rental costs, and the elasticities of homeownership

with respect to the cost of owning versus renting. The interest rate adjusts

in response to tax changes so as to maintain the aggregate demand for capital

at its initial level. The fixed capital stock assumption implies zero interest

elasticity of saving.

      Table 5 lists the distribution of the U.S. capital stock at the end of

1984 by type. A number of simplifying assumptions are made in the construction

of the model. Because well over 90 percent of inventories are held by

corporations and nearly 90 percent of rental housing is held by noncorporate

business, we assume that each of these assets is held totally by corporate and
                                           —11—

  noncorporate business, respectively. While equipment is depreciable over 3 or

  5 years, about 95 percent of it is classified as S—year. We treat all

  equipment as 5—year. Because public utility structures (which are virtually

  all corporate) are depreciated over a shorter life that other Structures and

  are eligible for the investment tax credit, they are treated separately. With

  these assumptions and distinctions, the capital shares in 1980 and 1984 are

 those listed in the percent share columns.       The last column indicates that a

 reallocation of capital toward equipment and commercial real estate occurred

 between 1980 and 1984.

           Current law treats owner—occupied housing
                                                       differently depending upon the
 tax position of the owner, with higher income households paying a lower rental

 cost owing to their lower after—tax financing rate. Thus it is necessary to

 distribute the housing stock across households at different income levels. The

 distribution depends upon the number of owners within each income range as well

 a the income range and the rental costs for each of the ranges.

           For all assets except rental housing, the demand for the asset is

 determined by the investor in the asset, be it a corporation, unincorporated

business or a household. For rental housing, demand is determined by renters,

based upon their incomes and the market rent level. Thus, the total quantity

of rental housing, like the total quantity of owner housing, is built up as the

sum   of   the demands by households in different income brackets.

       Table 6 indicates divisions of the demand for housing across the same

five income classes listed,.jn Table 4, with a lower income class of all renters

added. The first three columns contain the income classes selected, the

division of 80 million households across these classes, and the assumed

ownership rates for these classes. Columns 4 and 5 give the distribution of

the income of owners and renters
                                     across these classes. Column 4 is the product
of the first three columns divided
                                       by the sum of the products. In the column 5

calculation, the fraction of households owning is replaced by the fraction
                                                  —12—

 renting. Columns 6 and 7          give     the distribution of the owned and rented stocks.

 These distributions and the ownership rates were calculated from model

 equations described below. Based upon 1980 data, the equations imply an

 aggregate Ownership rate of 0.59, slightly below that existing then.

 Model Equations

       The model explains 13 rental costs: seven for the different types of

 nonresidential capital, five for owner—occupied housing of households in our

 five income ranges, and one for rental housing. As discussed in the previous

 section, these costs depend on numerous provisions of the tax law, the

depreciation rate of the asset, the expected inflation rate and the level of

 interest rates in the economy. Moreover, rental costs for household tenure

choice decisions (s.)     differ       from those for quantity demanded decisions (p.)

because the tax rates relevant to the after—tax financing rates differ (see

Table 4) .   We   summarize the rental cost equations as



                                   =
                                       pk(taxk,d.,7T,i)
                                   = p.(tax.,d.rr,i)
                           p.
                               J        J      J3                             (8)—(12)

                           p       = p(tax,d,TT,i)                            (13)


                               J
                                   =
                                       .(ta,,d,Tr,j).
                                        3    33                               (14)—(18)




      There are seven demand equations for nonresidential capital (NK)
corporate inventories, corporate and noncorporate 5—year equipment, 10— and
15—year public utility structures, and other corporate             (industrial) and

noncorporate (commercial) structures. Assuming that production functions are

Cobb—Douglass fBerndt(1976)], these demand equations can be            written as
                                          —13—

                                      =
                                          Zk/pk,                          (19)—(25)




 where the Zk are Constants (depending on given outputs) and the k are the

 rental costs.

       The housing demand and tenure choice equations come from the

 specification of a translog indirect utility function for households (King,

 1980) and the empirical application of it to the ownership decision

 (Hendershott and Shilling, 1982). The estimated odds of owning equation was



                 =
       log           —3.846log[./(p/.9)] — .383[(1ogj2   —   (log   p1.9)2).




The division by 0.9 reflects the fact that those renting have to pay more than

the user cost to offset the revenues lost from vacancies.      Taking antilogs and

solving, the Ownership rates for the five highest income classes are



                                0. = e L.j/(l—e L.
                                                 j),                     (26)—(30)



where the L. equal the right—hand side of the log [o./(l—o.)] expression. The

ownership rate for the lowest income class is assumed to be zero.

      There are also five demand equations for owner housing and six for rental

housing based on our six income classes, the lowest of which consists solely of

renters. These demands ar the products of the demands per owning/renting

household and the number of owning/renting households. The specific form of

the equations comes from application of Roys identity to the indirect utility

function and substitution from the estimated odds of owning equation. For

owner housing (OH), the demand equations are
                                           —14—

            OHj =                    + .766 log p.)/p.,                    (31)—(35)
                    oHHZ(3.846

where o. is the ownership rate for the jth class, l-IH. is the number of

households in the jth class, and the Z. are constants which are proportional to

the incomes of representative households in the classes. For rental households

 (RH), the equations are



            RH. =   (l—o.)HH.Z.(3.846 + .766 log p/.9)/(p/.9).             (36)—(41)
              3        J   JJ


where p/.9 is the rental price facing all renting households.

      Lastly, equality between the sum of the demands and the existing capital

stock determines the level 0       interest    rates in the economy:



                        NKk +       ZOH.   +    RB.       K.               (42)
                                       j             j



      Given a specific tax regime and assumed levels of the interest and

expected inflation rates, the k'                 ,   and p can be computed. The NKk were

listed in Table 5, and the OH. and RH. are products of the total residential
                               3           J
structures share reported in Table 5 and the fractions of those shares listed

in Table 6. The o. and iiH. were also listed in Table 6. The Z can be
                 j       j                                   k
calculated from equations (l9)—(25); the Z. are proportional to the incomes of

the representative households in the classes and are scaled such that the sum

of the demands for owner and rental housing (as proportions of the total

capital stock) equals the existing housing stock (as a proportion of total

capital)

      A number of simplifying assumptions of the model should be noted. These

include, but are not limited to,, constant risk premia and infinite real supply

price elasticities (zero transactions costs) and thus constant real asset

prices. Simulated changes in the allocation of capital are thus meant to
                                     —15—

indicate how the composition of net investment would be altered by tax (and

inflation) changes, not precisely what the new capital allocation will be five

or ten years following a change in tax regime or inflation rate.



           III. The Changing Tax and Inflation Environment, 1980—85

      In this section we deduce the impact of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of

1981 on interest rates, the homeownership rate, and the allocation of real

capital. Because over four years have now passed since the passage of ERTA, we

can also "test" the underlying simulation model by comparing the simulated

impact of the Act with observed events. This requires analyzing all major

disturbances that have occurred since early 1981, not just the passage of ERTA.

The first part of this section simulates the impacts of ERTA alone and of ERTA

combined with a decline in the inflation rate. The second part compares the

simulated impacts with observed changes in recent years.

E1TA and Disinflation

      The disturbance of major interest to us is the passage of the Economic

Recovery Tax Act of 1981. As documented in Section I, this Act substantially

enhanced tax depreciation allowances and lowered personal tax rates. A second

major phenomenon in the early 1980s was a reduction in the inflation rate. In

1980, inflation was proceeding at a 10 percent rate; by 1984 and 1985, the

rate was slightly below 4 percent. We presume that the decline in the long—run

expected inflation rate was a smaller drop from 8 to 5 percent, the 10 percent

reflecting temporarily surging energy prices and declining value of the dollar

and the 4 percent rate reflecting the reverse.

      The first column of Table 7 lists the assumed 1980 interest and inflation

rates, the model simulated homeownership rate, and the 1980 distribution of the

capital stock listed in Table 5. The second column contains the model

simulation results for these variables (except for the assumed constant

inflation rate) based upon enactment of ERTA. The third column reflects ERTA
                                          —16—

  (and the 1982 reduction in the depreciation base by half of the investment tax

 credit) plus a decline in the inflation rate to 5 percent. These simulations

 are discussed in turn.

       Comparing the second and first columns, the more favorable tax treatment

 of depreciable property provided by ERTA raises the demand for such capital at

 Pre—ERTA interest rates. While the cut in personal tax rates lowers the demand

 for owner—occupied housing ——     the after—tax financing rate and opportunity cost
 of owner equity rise ——   the   decline is not nearly sufficient to offset the

 increased demand for other capital, so interest rates rise.'4 The computed

 increase is just over a percentage point.

       In spite of this increase, the hurdle rates for equipment, industrial

 structures and public utilities decline by 2½, 1½ and 1 percentage points,

 respectively. Those for depreciable real estate are roughly unchanged (the

interest rate increase and more generous depreciation roughly offsetting),

wciiie those for inventories and owner—occupied housing increase by just over a

percentage point. The homeownership rate declines by 4½ percentage points. On

net, the capital stock is shifted sharply from residential to nonresidential

uses, with the aggregate housing stock declining by 9½ percent. Of the

nonresidential components, the increases are roughly 10 percent for equipment

and industrial structures and about 5 percent for public utilities and

commercial real estate. Inventories decline by one percent.

      Incorporating a 3 percentage point decline in the inflation rate sharply

alters the results. Becau the interest rate declines by roughly a point and

a half for each point decline in inflation, disinflation is good for owner—

occupied housing; the real after—tax financing rate will decline for

households in tax brackets below 33 percent. Thus we see a 4 percentage point

increase in the homeownership rate relative to the case of no decline in

inflation. The total housing stock is roughly unchanged, however; the

increase in owner—occupied housing is about offset by the decline in rental
                                        —17—

housing. The disinflation also induces a shift in the composition of

structures, with corporate structures rising and highly—levered noncorporate

structures declining (the advantages of debt are reduced at lower interest

rates)

A Comparison with Observed Chan9es

         Model simulations should not be expected to track observed economic

changes closely. Simulations provide an estimate of where an economy in full

equilibrium at the initial parameter values will eventually move in response to

a specified disturbance (change in model parameters, Structure or state of

world) .    However, even if the model accurately characterizes the economy, the

observed economic changes may differ from those implied by the model for two

reasons. First, the economy may have been a significant distance from full

equilibrium when the disturbance occurred. If the tendency toward this

equilibrium differs significantly from the tendency created by the specified

disturbance, the observed changes in the economy may not resemble the simulated

changes. Second, disturbances other than those specified may have occurred.

If these have impacts that correlate negatively in some respects from the

specified disturbances, again the simulated changes may differ significantly

from the actual changes. Nonetheless, simulations of the major disturbances to

an economy should trace out the broad contours of subsequent economic events.

      The principal phenomena that the model simulations would lead us to

expect are:

(1)   an increase in long—term interest rates until the decline in long—run
      expected inflation sets in,

(2)   a shift from owning to renting, until the impact of the decline in long—
      run expected inflation is felt, and

(3)   a shift from residential (and inventory) to nonresidential uses,
      especially equipment investment early on.

The correspondence of observed events with each of these expectations is

discussed in turn.
                                        —18—

        Table 8 contains data on the corporate bond rate and two measures of the

December—to—December changes in the CPI: all items less food, energy and home

purchase and finance and the new CPI X—I, which became the official CPI after

1982. The major difference between the inflation series is the exclusion of

food and energy from the former; these components rose particularly rapidly in

the late 1970s and 1980 and slowly in the 1982—84 period. The bond rate

certainly jumped in 1981 and 1982. The rate exceeded 14 percent for the entire

July 1981—July 1982 period (was over 15 percent in September—October 1981 and

January—February 1982) before plummeting by year end 1982. The one—year

inflation rate also plummeted in 1982 and has continued to drift downward since

then.    A lagged response of long—run expected inflation to short—run observed
inflation would suggest a gradual decline in the       former throughout the 1983—85

period. In    general, we would anticipate that the     1981—84 data changes would

largely reflect the ERTA simulation, with post—1984 data gradually reflecting

the ERTA plus disinflation simulation.

        The correspondence between simulations of the homeownership rate and

observed changes is especially tenuous because the changes are quite Sensitive

to shifts in the age composition of the population. To illustrate, the

aggregate rate rose by only 3½ percentage points between 1960 and 1979, even

though ownership rates of every age cohort rose by close to 10 percentage

points. The reason for this discrepancy was a surge in young households (under

25)   who tend to rent and a relative decline in older households (over 34) who
predominantly   own. The dat,a   in Table 8   illustrate the dependency of ownership

on age. Old households tend to be less mobile, have higher incomes, and be

wealthier, characteristics that lower the effective cost of owning.

        The data in Table 9 refer to married couples only in order to abstract

from other demographic effects, but the results would be roughly comparable for

all households. As can be seen, a shift to homeownership occurred for all age

groups between 1974 and 1980 and even continued after 1980 for households over
                                       —19—

age 54. For younger more mobile households who are more likely to be making

tenure decisions based upon current economic conditions, 1980 was a watershed

for ownership. In just three years, the ownership rate for those under 40

declined by 4 to 6½ percentage points, just as would be anticipated under the

ERTA scenario. Whether the offsetting disinflation impact will be observed in

later data is uncertain.

      The ERTA simulation suggests a large decline in residential structures

and an increase in equipment. These shifts are reflected in the 1984 data (see

Table 4) with the equipment share already up by half the predicted 11 percent

increase and residential structures down by one—quarter of the estimated 9½

percent decline. Much of the observed decline is certainly due to the changed

behavior of younger households. If this change were allowed to work its way

through to older households in a long—run adjustment, the decline in

residential structures would approach the large simulated decline.

      The observed reallocation of nonresidential structures does not

correspond nearly as well with the hypothesized partial movement to the

simulated new equilibrium. Commercial structures have already increased in

share by more than the simulated amount, while public utility structures have

declined significantly as a share of the total capital stock (not increased as

the simulation predicts) and industrial Structures have risen little. Even

here, plausible explanations are available. The expansion of the

rehabilitation tax credit in ERTA, which is not reflected in the simulations,

must have significantly inoreased the value of commercial structures;

moreover, high vacancy rates suggest that commercial structures have been over

built ——   the new equilibrium could entail a less than four percent increase in
this share. As for the relative decline in public utility structures, energy

conservation in response to the sharp run up in real energy prices in the

1979—81 period and the well—publicized problems of the nuclear power industry

are likely causes. Dwelling on such explanations is probably not worthwhile;
                                      —20—

the important fact is that observed data, on the whole, are not inconsistent

with the ERTA model simulationJ5 Thus, the simulation model appears to be a

reasonable vehicle for analyzing the impact of proposed tax reforms.



       IV.   Capital Allocation Under Current Law and Proposed Tax Reforms

      The likely impacts of the Treasury and Administration tax reform proposals

and the House bill on the level of interest rates, rental user costs, capital

shares, and the homeownership rate are calculated in this section. We begin

with a comparison of the risk—adjusted net user costs and interest rates under

current law and the reforms and then turn to the capital stock effects. The

analysis presumes 5 percent inflation. The sensitivity to inflation of various

tax regimes is then examined, and efficiency losses from the misallocation of

capital under the regimes are calculated.

Five Percent Inflation: Net Rental Costs

      The risk—adjusted net (of depreciation) rental costs for alternative

investments are reported in Table 10 for current law and three reforms.                 (The

risk adjustment is 0.04 for nonreal estate assets and 0.015 for depreciable real

estate.) The interest rate (risk—free) under current law is presumed to be 10

percent (slightly above the 9½ percent model simulation of a 5 percent inflation

world with ERTA tax law). The first numbers (those not in parentheses) given

for the reforms are based upon the listed model—computed interest rates; the

numbers in parentheses presume an unchanged 10 percent interest rate.

      Under a neutral tax system, the risk—adjusted net hurdle rates would be

the same for all assets. As can be seen, this is far from true under current

law. The tax—favored assets are housing of high—income owners and noncorporate

equipment. The tax—penalized assets are corporate structures, especially

industrial structures that receive no tax credit, and inventories, whose

inflationary gains are not indexed (with r   =   O.7t,   t   = 0.5   and 11   = 0.05,   the

inflation tax raises the user cost by 0.035) .   More generally, corporate
                                       —21—

investments are penalized relative to noncorporate; less—leveraged investments

are penalized relative to more—leveraged investments; and risky assets are

penalized relative to less risky assets (Bulow and Summers, 1984) .   The over

three and a half percentage point difference in net hurdle rates for industrial

and rental structures reflects all three penalties. The largest penalty is the

difference in asset risk, 0.05 for nonreal estate versus 0.025 for real estate,

which accounts for 2 of the 3½ points. The corporate (double taxation) penalty

is the smallest, accounting for only    of the 3½ points because the taxation of

corporate equity at the personal level is relatively light under the new view of

corporate financing.

      The Treasury plan greatly reduces the difference in risk—adjusted net

hurdle rates among corporate assets by eliminating the inventory tax and the

investment tax credit. All hurdle rates move toward that for industrial

structures. The gross hurdle rate (net plus depreciation rate plus 0.04) for

equipment rises by 14 percent and that for public utility structures rises by 8

percent, while that for inventories (with their 100 percent depreciation) falls

by 3 percent. However, the plan increases the advantages of real estate. While

the hurdle rates for depreciable properties are roughly unchanged (at 3 points

below those for corporate assets), those for owner—occupied housing decline

significantly; the 2.6 percentage point fall in the level of interest rates

swamps the loss of the property tax deduction and the reduction in rates at

which interest is deductible.

      The increased advantage of owner—occupied housing stems from two factors:

removal of tax advantages for business capital (especially the investment tax

credit) and the introduction of an additional advantage for owner—occupied

housing (the nonindexation of mortgage interest expense) .   The data in the third

column of Table 10 are calculations assuming the Treasury plan were amended to

include indexation of home mortgage interest expense. As can be seen, full

indexation lowers the interest rate by another 30 basis points and the hurdle
                                     —22—

rates for business investments by 40 basis points. In contrast, the declines in

the hurdle rates for middle—income owner—occupied housing are reduced by 25

basis points, and high—income owner—occupied housing faces a 50 basis point rise

in hurdle rate.

      The Administration plan drops interest indexation (and thus the new

advantage for owner—occupied housing) ,   deletes   inventory indexation (in the

revisions needed to achieve revenue neutrality) , and "gives back" part of the

investment tax credit by accelerating depreciation deductions for equipment and

public utilities relative to economic depreciation; the present value of a

dollar of depreciation on 5—year equipment increases from 76 to 85 cents, while

that for 15—year public utilities rises from 50 to 76 cents or by over 50

percent. The latter change is so generous that the investment hurdle rate

actually declines in spite of the loss of the ITC. With these changes, the

level of interest rates falls by only 60 basis points, and the net result is a

tax system that is less tilted toward high—income owner—occupied housing than

current law.

      The House bill postpones depreciation deductions, except on equipment,

even more than the Treasury plan and does not index depreciation deductions

unless inflation exceeds 5 percent. As a result of these changes and the

removal of the investment tax credit, the aggregate demand for capital falls

sharply and a 125 basis point decline in the level of interest rates occurs, a

decline which significantly lowers the cost of owner—occupied housing at all

except the very highest income levels. Like the Treasury plan, the House bill

would tend to equalize net user costs across corporate investments.

      As discussed, the model computes the level of interest rates that would

maintain the aggregate demand for capital (net investment in a growth context)

at its prereform level. However, a decline in U.S. interest rates would

represent a decline in after—tax returns to foreigners unless foreign countries

cut their marginal tax rates on interest income or move their interest rates
                                     —23—

pan pu with those in the U.S. As a result capital would flow out of the

U.S. and domestic interest rates would not need to fall as much to bring the

demand and supply of capital in the U.S. into balance. In the extreme case of

no adjustment in foreign taxes or interest rates and prefectly elastic

international capital flows, U.S. interest rates would not fall at all but the

U.S. capital stock would, the fall being greater the larger is the decline in

interest rates computed from the fixed—capital stock model.'6 A more balanced

view would incorporate less than perfectly elastic capital flows and significant

changes in foreign interest rates in response to movements in U.S. rates. Thus

a fall in foreign demand for U.S. capital would tend to dampen the decline in

U.S. rates, but not eliminate it.

      To indicate the sensitivity of the relationships among the adjusted net

rental costs to the Computed interest rate declines, rental costs based upon no

rate decline have been computed and are listed in parentheses in Table 10. With

higher (than the model—computed) interest rates, the rental costs are higher.

For the Administration and House reforms, the relationships among the costs are

little affected. For the Treasury plan, the already strong bias toward owner—

occupied housing is magnified because all home mortgage interest is deductible

whereas only the real component of interest financing other investments is.

Five Percent Inflation: Capital Stock Impacts

      The data in Table 11 suggest how the capital stock would be reallocated

under the various reforms. These reallocations follow fairly directly from the

realignment of investment hurdle rates just discussed. Removal of the inflation

tax raises inventories, while the loss of the investment tax credit tends to

shrink equipment and utilities, although utilities would actually rise in

response to the far more generous depreciation allowances of the Administration

plan. The Treasury and Administration reforms have sharply different impacts on

the three types of structures. Under the Treasury plan, residential structures

rise by 8 percent, while industrial and commercial structures are unaffected.
                                        —24—

Under the Administration plan, the reverse is true; residential structures are

roughly unchanged while industrial and commercial structures rise by 8 percent.

Moreover, the homeownership rate rises by 6 percentage points under the Treasury

plan, but falls by 4 points under the Administration plan. The reallocations

under the House bill are close to those of the Treasury plan, although the

increase in the homeownership rate is only 2½ percentage points.

      In general, an across the board cut in tax rates would be expected to have

a negative impact on owner—occupied housing, the income from which is not taxed.

This impact would be reinforced by a loss of the deductibility of property taxes

on primary residences. Thus, the homeownership rate would decline, as would the

share of structures in residential use. The simulated effect of the

Administration plan corresponds to these expectations. The inverted effect of

the Treasury plan follows from its interest indexation provision and the sharp

decline in interest rates (largely in response to the indexation). A decline in

interest rates is more beneficial to investors in low tax brackets than to those

in high brackets because the investor receives more of the rate decline (and the

Treasury receives less) .    Thus a sharp decline in interest rates is particularly

beneficial to housing demanded by low and middle income owners. This factor is

exaggerated in the Treasury plan by the exemption of home mortgage interest

expense from the interest indexation feature. Thus housing of owners at all

income levels (but especially at lower incomes) increases, and the homeownership

rate jumps. The demand for owner—occupied housing would also rise under the

House bill. This reflects the absence of a cut in the tax rates relevant to the

quantity—demanded decision of owners with incomes under $100,000 (see Table 4),

the continued deductibility of property taxes, and the sharp 125 basis point

decline in interest rates.
                                          —25—

Inflation Neutrality

      Next we consider the impact of inflation under the various tax regimes by

simulating an increase in inflation from zero to 10 percent. Inflation is quite

negative for owner—occupied housing under current law because the average tax

rate at which expenses are deductible is significantly less for owner housing

(except for owners with very high incomes) than for other capital. Thus, the

real after—tax interest rate paid by owners tends to rise, while that for other

capital falls (see Titman, 1982 and Follain, l986).17 On the other hand,

inflation is very positive for depreciable real estate because the advantages of

debt are magnified at higher interest rate levels. Thus the increase in

inflation lowers the homeownership rate by 11 percentage points (the first

column of Table 12), and raises the demand for both rental and commercial

structures, the latter by 19 percent. The total housing stock increases because

the stimulus to renter housing outweighs the negative impact on owner housing.

With real estate expanding, the other capital components must decline. As can

be seen, di/dir =   1.46,   midway between the nontax (unity) and tax [di/dil =   1/(l—
T)"-21 Fisherian values.

      The Treasury plan makes a serious attempt at achieving inflation

neutrality by setting tax depreciation equal to economic depreciation and

indexing capital gains, depreciation allowances and interest. Unfortunately,

the plan fails badly. To understand the failure, it is best to consider first

the impact of an increase in inflation in a fully—indexed variant of the

Treasury plan, i.e., one in-which home mortgage interest expense is also

indexed. The data in the second column of Table 12 show this impact. Increases

in inflation are generally favorable for the sector with the highest tax rate

(noncorporate business has a tax rate of 0.41 versus 0.37 for the corporate

sector) because the after—tax interest rate rises least. The aggregate

homeownership rate declines because the negative impact on lower income (tax)

households outweighs the positive impact on high income households. The
                                     —26—

interest rate rises by more than the increase in inflation because of imperfect

indexation; under our assumptions, only a third of interest is real at 5

percent inflation [ (7.42—5)/7.421, but the Treasury indexation formula would

treat six—elevenths as real (see note 10) .   With   some inflationary interest

being taxed, the interest rate responds more than one—for—one to inflation.

Nonetheless, the fully—indexed variant of the Treasury plan is significantly

less sensitive to inflation than current law; more specifically the sharp tilt

toward depreciable real estate is greatly dampened.

      Exclusion of home mortgage interest from the indexation provision changes

the impact of inflation enormously. Homeownership and the demand for owner—

occupied housing are greatly stimulated by inflation because the real—after tax

financing rate for even our lowest income owning households declines. The surge

in housing is matched by declines in all other capital types. The actual

Treasury plan proposed is even less inflation neutral than current law.

      The next to the last column in Table 12 shows the impact of inflation on

capital allocation under the Administration tax plan. Just as under current

law, the homeownership rate would be significantly lowered by inflation.

However, the stimulation for depreciable real estate and constriction of

nonresidential capital would be far less. The Administration plan is thus

significantly more inflation neutral than current law. The last column suggests

that the House bill would be marginally more neutral than current law.

Efficiency Losses

      The differences in the risk—adjusted net rental costs in Table 10 provide

a general indication of the misallocation of capital under the various tax laws.

A single efficiency loss number for each tax regime is computed from the

Harberger equation:
                                        —27—

                    LOSS =              — ADJp.) (CAP. — EFFCAP.),
                               J               J    J         J




where the ADJ0.'s   are   the risk—adjusted net user costs listed in Table 10,

EFFADJp is the single risk—adjusted net user cost (0.0406) that when used to

obtain gross user costs equates the sum of the demands for capital to the

aggregate stock, the CAPj are the likely percentage capital stocks under a given

tax law (listed in Table 13), and the EFFCAP. are the percentage allocations

when the gross user costs are based on EFFADJp. The efficient allocation of

capital is listed in the first column of Table 13.

      The efficiency loss under current law, listed at the bottom of Table 13,

is roughly 0.12 percent of the capital stock or about 0.25 percent of GNP.18

The major source of the loss is 10 percent too much residential capital (largely

offset by 24 percent too few industrial structures and 12 percent too few

utility structures).19 The widely—cited overinvestment is equipment is only 3

percent; while substantial overinvestment in equipment exists relative to

corporate structures, overinvestment relative to capital generally is minor. Of

the three reforms, only the Administration plan reduces the efficiency loss, and

the reduction is a sharp 50 percent. This is achieved by both a better

allocation between residential and nonresidential capital (the overinvestment in

residential capital is reduced from 10 to 8 percent) and better allocations

within the residential and nonresidential sectors. The difference between the

net user costs for the highest and lowest income owning households is reduced

from 0.029 to 0.018, and the large underinvestment in corporate structures is

reduced significantly.

      The Treasury plan and the House bill would increase the efficiency loss by

53 and 36 percent, respectively, the principal reason being the further

overinvestment in residential capital (18 and 17 percent versus the current 10

percent) .   Not only do these bills remove the investment tax credit for
equipment and utilities, but they reduce the value of depreciation deductions.
                                     —28—

The greater efficienty loss under the Treasury plan relative to the House bill

is attributable to a substantial increase in the existing bias in favor of

owning over renting. This, in turn, is due to the great advantage of debt

financing of owner—occupied housing given by the partial taxation of interest

income but full deduction of home mortgage interest expense. The fully—indexed

Treasury variant (only real mortgage interest expense is deductible) leads to a

smaller increase in residential capital, a better allocation within residential,

and thus a negligible 6 percent increase in the efficiency loss.

      Efficiency losses have also been calculated at different inflation rates.

The losses under all tax regimes are lower at a zero inflation rate and greater

at 10 percent inflation. For current law, the loss is 12 percent less at zero

inflation and 37 percent greater at 10 percent inflation. The efficiency loss

under the Administration plan is roughly half that of current law over the

entire inflation range examined. At zero inflation, the losses under the

Tteasury plan and House bill are virtually identical to those under current law.

At higher inflation rates the losses, especially under the Treasury plan,

increase relative to current law; at 10 percent inflation the loss under the

Treasury plan is nearly double that under current law. Such is not the case

with the fully—indexed Treasury variant; its loss at 10 percent inflation is

slightly less than that of current law.



                                  V. Summary

      The paper begins with- presentation of a methodology for computing annual

rental costs of capital or investment hurdle rates under any tax regime. Tax

law over the 1980—84 period is specified and the provisions of the Treasury and

Administration tax reform proposals and HR 3838 are described. A model is then

constructed to allow calculation of the impact of changes in tax regimes and/or

expected inflation on interest rates and the allocation of real capital. The

model allocates a fixed private capital stock among various classes of
                                     —29—

nonresidential and residential capital, depending upon the rental costs for the

capital components, the price elasticities of demand with respect to the rental

costs, and the elasticities of homeownership with respect to the cost of owning

versus renting. The interest rate adjusts in response to tax/inflation changes

so as to maintain the aggregate demand for capital at this initial level.

      Simulation of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 suggests an increase

in interest rates, a decrease in homeownership, and a shift in capital from

residential to nonresidential uses, especially equipment. Data since 1980 are

consistent with these "forecasts" when one abstracts from the impact of the

decline in inflation on interest rates after the middle of 1982. The decline in

ownership is restricted to younger (under 40) households who are likely to be

making tenure decisions based upon current economic conditions. The general

correspondence between these simulations and recent economic events suggests

that the simulation model is appropriate for analyzing the impact of proposed

tax reforms.

      Under a neutral tax system, the risk—adjusted net (of depreciation)

investment hurdle rates would be the same for all assets. This is far from true

under current law. The tax—favored assets are housing of high—income owners and

noncorporate equipment. The most tax—penalized asset is inventories, whose

inflationary gains are not indexed. Corporate structures are also penalized,

especially industrial structures that receive no tax credit. More generally,

corporate investments are penalized relative to noncorporate; less—leveraged

investments are penalized relative to more—leveraged investments; and risky

assets are penalized relative to less risky assets.

      The Treasury plan greatly reduces the difference in risk—adjusted net

hurdle rates among corporate assets by eliminating the inventory tax and the

investment tax credit. However, the plan increases the advantages of real

estate. While the hurdle rates for equipment and uti1ities rise to that for

industrial structures, those for owner—occupied housing decline significantly in
                                     —30—

response to a 2.6 percentage point decline in interest rates (and the

nonindexation of home mortgage interest expense) .   The Administration plan drops

interest indexation and accelerates depreciation deductions for equipment and,

especially, public utilities relative to economic depreciation. With these

changes, the level of interest rates falls by only 0.6 percentage points, and

the demand for owner—occupied housing by middle and high income households

declines. In contrast, the House bill has even less general depreciation

allowances than current law, Consequently, hurdle rates for equipment and

utilities rise sharply, while the 125 basis point decline in interest rates

lowers hurdle rates for owner—Occupied housing. The basic results are the same

in the absence of interest—rate declines; hurdle rates decline relatively for

owner—occupied housing under the Treasury plan and House bill, but not under the

Administration plan. That is, whether rates decline or not the former two

roposals would tilt the playing field toward owner—occupied housing, the most

tx formed asset under current law.

      Reallocation of the capital stock follows fairly directly from the

realignment of investment hurdle rates. Removal of the inflation tax raises

inventories, while the loss of the investment tax credit tends to shrink

equipment and utilities, although utilities would actually rise in response to

the far more generous depreciation allowances of the Administration plan. While

the specific provisions of the Treasury plan and the House bill differ widely,

these two reforms should be expected to have remarkably similar impacts on

capital allocation. In contrast, the Administration plan would have a sharply

different impact on the three types of structures. Under the Treasury and House

plans, residential structures rise by 8 percent, while industrial and commercial

structures are largely unaffected. Under the Administration plan, the reverse

is true. Moreover, the homeownership rate rises significantly under the

Treasury and House plans, but falls by 4 points under the Administration plan.
                                           —31—

         Inflation is quite negative for
                                            owner—occupied housing under current law
   because the average tax rate at which expenses are deductible
                                                                 is significantly
   less for owner housing than for
                                   other capital. Thus, the real after—tax
   interest rate paid by owners tends to rise with an increase
                                                                  in inflation, while
   that for other capital falls.
                                 On the other hand, inflation is very positive for
  depreciable real estate because the
                                      advantages of debt are magnified at higher
  interest rate levels. While
                                  an increase in inflation lowers the
                                                                        homeownership
  rate, commercial structures increase
                                         sharply. Moreover, total housing increases
  because the stimulus to
                            renter housing outweighs the negative impact on owner
  housing. With real estate expanding, the other capital
                                                         components decline.
        The Treasury plan makes a Serious attempt at achieving
                                                               inflation
  neutrality by setting tax depreciation
                                           equal to economic depreciation and

                                                                    Unfortunately,
 the plan fails badly. While
                                 a fully—indexed variant of the Treasury plan would
 b less Sensitive to inflation than current law,
                                                 exclusion of home mortgage
 interest expense from the indexation
                                        provision of the Treasury plan reverses
 this result. Honleownership
                               and the demand for
                                                    owner_occupied housing are
 strongly stimulated because the
                                   real—aftet tax financing rate for even low
 income owning households declines.
                                       The surge in housing is matched by declines
 in all Other capital types.

      Just as under current law, the
                                        homeownership rate would be significantly
lowered by inflation if the
                               Administration plan or House bill were in place.
However, the Stimulation of—depreciable
                                           real estate and the constriction of
nonresidential capital would be far less under the Admini5tration
                                                                  plan. The
Administration plan is thus
                            significantly more inflation neutral than current
law; the House bill would be
                                mildly more neutral.
      Of the three plans,
                          only that proposed by the Administration would lead to
a more efficient allocation of
                               capital, i.e., one that is less biased toward
high—income housing and away from corporate structures. The
                                                             current efficiency
                                     —32—

loss would be roughly halved. The Treasury plan, while equating hurdle rates

across corporate assets, would greatly increase the current efficiency loss at

positive inflation rates by stimulating additional overinvestment in housing.

The increases in the loss would be roughly 50 percent at 5 percent inflation and

nearly 100 percent at 10 percent inflation. The House bill, too, would increase

the efficiency loss, and for the same reason, but the increase would be a

smaller 25 to 40 percent at inflation rates between 3 and 10 percent.

  and Shilling (1982)



  2. We do not consider the impact of
                                        imperfect loss offsets. For an analysis of
  these and other details of corporate taxation, see Auerbach (1983)



  3. Because property taxes on
                                 owner—occupied housing are deductible, the tax
 saving from these taxes on a dollar of housing
                                                        (assuming a property tax rate of
 0.012) is subtracted from the right side of     (1)




 4. Optimal bond trading is discussed in Constantjnjdes and Ingersoll (1984).

 Other sources of the low implicit
                                     yield in longer—term tax exempts are the
 greater risk of losses due to default and call
                                                       on municipals relative to
 Treasuries and the 80 percent limitation of
                                                 the portion of interest on
 indebtedness used to carry tax exempts that commercial banks can deduct.



 5. While the explicit and implicit tax rates relevant to the quantity_demanded

decision are marginal rates, those relevant to the decision of whether to own

or rent depend on the average rates at which interest for the entire house

purchase is deducted and on which the entire
                                                 owner—equity investment would have
been taxed (Hendershott and Slemrod, 1983).



6. One million of the 1—4 unit properties in 1980 were no more than a decade

old, as were 77,500 of the 5—49 unit properties and 22,700 of the over—50 unit

properties. With 1.3, 11 and 160,
                                     respectively, as the average nunther of units
in each of these three classes of
                                    properties, 63 percent of the total units no
more than a decade old were in properties with 50
                                                         or more units. Because a
                                         -*
significant    number of the 1—4 unit properties were originally built for

ownership, two—thirds to three—quarters of the newly—constructed rental units

were probably in properties with 50 or more units.



7. Sixty percent of owning households with incomes under $15,000 in 1983 had

house—to—income ratios exceeding 4, suggesting that the households were retired

and did not have a mortgage. In contrast, eighty percent of owning households

with incomes over $25,000 had mortgages and only five percent with incomes

above $25,000 had house—to—income ratios above 4.



8. The National Association of Homebuilders (1985, p.51) assumes a 14 percent

value for e when t    is   six percent. This inflation rate translates into a tax—

exempt rate just above 8 percent in our model and thus a risk premium of about

6 percent. Price—Waterhouse has used an e of 16 percent in their calculations.



9. The 1981 act also expanded the investment tax credit slightly. Both this

expansion and the more generous depreciation deductions were effective January

1, 1981.



10. The Treasury would assume a real interest rate of 6 percent and allow the

deduction of (or would tax) Only 6/(6+n) of interest paid (or earned), where it

is   the actual inflation rate in a tax year. Thus if inflation were 5 percent,

only 55 percent of interest would be taxed and deducted. With zero inflation,

all interest would be taxed and deducted; with 10% inflation only 38 percent

would.     (However, mortgage interest outlays on one's principal residence would

be fully deductible.)
                                           -.35—


  11. Because only 55%/38% of nominal interest income would be taxed in
                                                                        a

  five/ten percent inflation world, the tax rate relevant to own equity financing

  would be 55%/38% of the marginal rates shown in Table 2 or the tax—exempt
                                                                            rate,
  whichever is less.



  12. The methodology for
                            computing these tax rates is discussed in Hendershott
  and Ling (1986).



 13. The model is both an extension
                                       and simplification of that used by

 Hendershott and Shilling (1982) to analyze the Economic Recovery Tax Act of

 1981. The extension is a more detailed treatment of nonresidential capital;

 the simplification is an exogenous specification of risk premia. Gravelle

 (1985) uses a somewhat similar model to
                                             analyze the Treasury plan. Fullerton
 (1985) analyzes the impact of the Treasury plan on effective tax rates.



 14. Higher interest rates pulled in
                                       foreign capital, but the dampening effect
 of this inflow on rising interest
                                     rates is assumed to have been offset by
 increased Federal deficits.



15. Boswortj- (1985) makes the
                                 Somewhat contrary argument that business
investment in recent years is not consistent with the passage of ERTA.



16. In simulations where the   aggregate   capital stock was determined endogenously
as that consistent with the imposed 10
                                           percent interest rate, the total capital
stock falls by 15 percent in the Treasury simulation, 8 percent in the House—

Bill simulation, and 3 percent for the Administration plan.
                                     —36—

17. This statement would seem to be at variance with the sharp shift to

homeownership in the 1970s. The latter occurred because interest rates did not

fully reflect expected general inflation and expected house price inflation

likely exceeded expected general inflation by 2 to 3 percentage points.



18. This is an understatement of the loss because it does not take into account

inefficiencies created by industry specific tax provisions or by tax—exempt

financing of private purpose activities. Moreover, the gains from removing

such inefficiences by, say, the Treasury plan are understated.



19. The loss is independent of the presumed risk premium associated with

owner—occupied housing (p—d— is independent of ) and is largely independent

of its presumed loan—to—value ratio (under current law an advantage of debt

financing exists only for high—income owners)
