The Role of Output Stabilization in the Conduct of Monetary Policy
Frederic S. Mishkin
NBER Working Paper No. 9291
October 2002
JEL No. E5
                                            ABSTRACT


       This paper examines the role of output stabilization in the conduct of monetary policy. It

argues that activist monetary policy in which the monetary authorities focus on output fluctuations

in the setting of their policy instrument and in policy statements is likely to produce worse outcomes

for output and inflation fluctuations, both because it will lead to suboptimal monetary policy, but

also because it complicates monetary authorities' communication strategy and can weaken the

credibility of the central bank. In contrast, conducting monetary policy with a flexible inflation

target rule is likely to produce better outcomes. A flexible inflation target rule also allows the

monetary authorities to effectively communicate to the public that they do care about output

fluctuations, but makes it less likely that they will be encouraged to try to exploit the short-run

tradeoff between output and inflation.
