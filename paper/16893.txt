                                               ABSTRACT

Historically, periods of high indebtedness have been associated with a rising incidence of default or
restructuring of public and private debts. A subtle type of debt restructuring takes the form of “financial
repression.” Financial repression includes directed lending to government by captive domestic audiences
(such as pension funds), explicit or implicit caps on interest rates, regulation of cross-border capital
movements, and (generally) a tighter connection between government and banks. In the heavily regulated
financial markets of the Bretton Woods system, several restrictions facilitated a sharp and rapid reduction
in public debt/GDP ratios from the late 1940s to the 1970s. Low nominal interest rates help reduce
debt servicing costs while a high incidence of negative real interest rates liquidates or erodes the realYDOXH
of government debt. Thus, financial repression is most successful in liquidating debts when accompanied
by a steady dose of inflation. Inflation need not take market participants entirely by surprise and, in
effect, it need not be very high (by historic standards). For the advanced economies in our sample,
real interest rates were negative roughly ½ of the time during 1945-1980. For the United States and
the United Kingdom our estimates of the annual liquidation of debt via negative real interest rates
amounted on average from 3 to 4 percent of GDP a year. For Australia and Italy, which recorded higher
inflation rates, the liquidation effect was larger (around 5 percent per annum). We describe some ofWKH
regulatory measures and policy actions that characterized the heyday of the financial repressionera.

         The decade that preceded the outbreak of the subprime crisis in the summer of

2007 produced a record surge in private debt in many advanced economies, including the

United States. The period prior to the 2001 burst of the “tech bubble” was associated

with a marked rise in the leverage of nonfinancial corporate business; in the years 2001-

2007, the debts of the financial industry and households reached unprecedented heights.1

The decade following the crisis may yet mark a record surge in public debt during

peacetime, at least for the advanced economies. It is not surprising that debt reduction, of

one form or another, is a topic that is receiving substantial attention in academic and

policy circles alike.2

          Throughout history, debt/GDP ratios have been reduced by (i) economic growth;

(ii) a substantive fiscal adjustment/austerity plans; (iii) explicit default or restructuring of

private and/or public debt; (iv) a sudden surprise burst in inflation; and (v) a steady

1
  The surge in private debt is manifest in both the gross external debt figures of the private sector (see Lane
and Milesi-Ferretti, 2010, for careful and extensive historical documentation since 1970 and Reinhart
http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~creinhar/ for a splicing of their data with the latest IMF/World Bank figures)
and domestic bank credit (as documented in Reinhart, 2010). Relative to GDP, these debt measures
reached unprecented heights during 2007-2010 in many advanced economies.
2
  Among recent studies, see for example, Alesina and Ardagna (2009), IMF (2010), Lilico, Holmes and
Sabeen (2009) on debt reduction via fiscal adjustment and Sturzenegger and Zettlemeyer (2006), Reinhart
and Rogoff (2009) and sources cited therein on debt reduction through default and restructuring.

         1
dosage of financial repression that is accompanied by an equally steady dosage of

inflation. (Financial repression is defined in Box 1) It is critical to clarify that options

(iv) and (v) are only viable for domestic-currency debts. Since these debt-reduction

channels are not necessarily mutually exclusive, historical episodes of debt reduction

have owed to a combination of more than one of these channels.3

         Hoping that substantial public and private debt overhangs are resolved by growth

may be uplifting but it is not particularly practical from a policy standpoint. The

evidence, at any rate, is not particularly encouraging, as high levels of public debt appear

to be associated with lower growth.4 The effectiveness of fiscal adjustment/austerity in

reducing public debt and, particularly, their growth consequences, (which are the subject

of some considerable debate) is beyond the scope of this paper. The incidence of explicit

default or debt restructuring (or forcible debt conversions) among advanced economies

(through and including World War II episodes) and emerging markets as well as

hyperinflation as debt-reduction mechanisms is analyzed in Reinhart and Rogoff (2009

and 2011).

         The aim of this paper is to document the more subtle and gradual form of debt

restructuring or “taxation” that has ocurred via financial repression (as defined in Box 1).

We show that such repression helped reduce lofty mountains of public debt in many of

the advanced economies in the decades following World War II and subsequently in

emerging markets, where financial liberalization is of more recent vintage.5 We find that



3
  For instance, in analyzing external debt reduction episodes in emerging markets, Reinhart, Rogoff, and
Savastano (2003) suggest that default and debt/restructuring played a leading role in most of the episodes
they identify. However, in numerous cases the debt restructurings (often under the umbrella of IMF
programs) were accompanied by debt repayments associated with some degree of fiscal adjustment.
4
  See Checherita and Rother (2010), Kumar and Woo (2010), and Reinhart and Rogoff (2010).
5
  In a recent paper, Aizenman and Marion (2010) stress the important role played by inflation in reducing
U.S. World War II debts and develop a framework to highlight how the government may be tempted to

         2
financial repression in combination with inflation played an important role in reducing

debts. Inflation need not take market participants entirely by surprise and, in effect, it

need not be very high (by historic standards). In effect, financial repression via controlled

interest rates, directed credit and persistent, positive inflation rates is still an effective

way of reducing domestic government debts in the world’s second largest economy--

China.6

          Prior to the 2007 crisis, it was deemed unlikely that advanced economies could

experience financial meltdowns of a severity to match those of the pre-World War II era;

the prospect of a sovereign default in wealthy economies was similarly unthinkable.7

Repeating that pattern, the ongoing discussion of how public debts have been reduced in

the past has focused on the role played by fiscal adjustment. It thus appears that it has

also been collectively “forgotten” that the widespread system of financial repression that

prevailed for several decades (1945-1980s) worldwide played an instrumental role in

reducing or “liquidating” the massive stocks of debt accumulated during World War II in

many of the advanced countries, United States inclusive. 8 We document this

phenomenon.

          The next section discusses how previous “debt-overhang” episodes have been

resolved since 1900. There is a brief sketch of the numerous defaults, restructurings,


follow that route in the near future. However, the critical role played by financial repression (regulation) in
keeping nominal interest rates low and producing negative real interest rates was not part of their analysis.
6
  Bai et. al. (1999), for example, present a framework that provides a general rationale for financial
repression as an implicit taxation of savings. They argue that when effective income-tax rates are very
uneven, as common in developing countries, raising some government revenue through mild financial
repression can be more efficient than collecting income tax only.
7
  The literature and public discussion surrounding “the great moderation” attests to this benign view of the
state of the macroeconomy in the advanced economies. See, for example, McConnell and Perez-Quiros
(2000).
8
  For the political economy of this point see the analysis presented in Alesina, Grilli, and Milesi Ferretti
(1993). They present a framework and stylized evidence to support it that strong governments coupled with
weak central banks may impose capital controls so as to enable them to raise more seigniorage and keep
interest rates artificially low—facilitating domestic debt reduction..

          3
conversions (forcible and “voluntary”) that dealt with the debts of World War I and the

Great Depression. This narrative, which follows Reinhart and Rogoff (2009 and 2011),

primarily serves to highlight the substantially different route taken after World War II to

deal with the legacy of high war debts.

       Section III provides a short description of the types of financial sector policies

that facilitated the liquidation of public debt. Hence, our analysis focuses importantly on

regulations affecting interest rates (with the explicit intent on keeping these low) and on

policies creating “captive” domestic audiences that would hold public debts (in part

achieved through capital controls, directed lending, and an enhanced role for

nomarketable public debts).

       We also focus on the evolution of real interest rates during the era of financial

repression (1945-1980s). We show that real interest rates were significantly lower during

1945-1980 than in the freer capital markets before World War II and after financial

liberalization. This is the case irrespective of the interest rate used--whether central bank

discount, treasury bills, deposit, or lending rates and whether for advanced or emerging

markets. For the advanced economies, real ex-post interest rates were negative in about

half of the years of the financial repression era compared to less than 15 percent of time

since the early 1980s.

       In Section IV, we provide a basic conceptual framework for calculating the

“financial repression tax,” or more specifically, the annual “liquidation rate” of

government debt. Alternative measures are also discussed. These exercises use a detailed

data base on a country’s public debt profile (coupon rates, maturities, composition, etc.)

from 1945 to 1980 constructed by Sbrancia (2011). This “synthetic” public debt portfolio

reflects the actual shares of debts across the different spectrum of maturities as well as


       4
the shares of marketable versus nonmarketable debt (the latter involving both securitized

debt as well as direct bank loans).

       Section V presents the central findings of the paper, which are estimates of the

annual “liquidation tax” as well as the incidence of liquidation years for ten countries

(Argentina, Australia, Belgium, India, Ireland, Italy, South Africa, Sweden, the United

Kingdom, and the United States). For the United States and the United Kingdom, the

annual liquidation of debt via negative real interest rates amounted to 3 to 4 percent of

GDP on average per year. Such annual deficit reduction quickly accumulates (even

without any compounding) to a 30-40 percent of GDP debt reduction in the course of a

decade. For other countries, which recorded higher inflation rates the liquidation effect

was even larger. As to the incidence of liquidation years, Argentina sets the record with

negative real rates recorded every single year from 1945 to 1980.

       Section VI examines the question of whether inflation rates were systematically

higher during periods of debt reduction in the context of a broader 28-country sample that

spans both the heyday of financial repression as well as the periods before and after. We

describe the algorithm used to identify the largest debt reduction episodes on a country-

by-country basis and, show that in 21 of the 28 countries inflation was higher during the

larger debt reduction periods.

       Finally, we discuss some of the implications of our analysis for the current debt

overhang and highlight areas for further research. There are detailed appendices which:

(i) compare our methodology to other approaches in the literature that have been used to

measure the extent of financial repression or calculate the financial repression tax; (ii)

provide country-specific details on the behavior of real interest rates across regimes; and

(iii) describe the coverage and extensive sources for the data compiled for this study.

                 “Financialandrepression”
                                Financial Repression

         The term financial repression was introduced in the literature by the works of
 Shaw (1973) and Ronald McKinnon (1973). Subsequently, the term became a way of
 describing emerging market financial systems prior to the widespread financial
 liberalization that began in the 1980 (see Agenor and Montiel, 2008, for an excellent
 discussion of the role of inflation and Giovannini and de Melo, 1993 and Easterly, 1989
 for country-specific estimates). However, as we document in this paper, financial
 repression was also the norm for advanced economies during the post World War II
 and in varying degrees up through the 1980s. We describe here some of its main
 features.

          (i) Explicit or indirect caps or ceilings on interest rates, particularly (but not
 exclusively) those on government debts. These interest rate ceilings could be effected
 through various means including: (a) explicit government regulation (for instance,
 Regulation Q in the United States prohibited banks from paying interest on demand
 deposits and capped interest rates on saving deposits). (b) In many cases ceilings on
 banks’ lending rates were a direct subsidy to the government in cases where the
 government borrowed directly from the banks (via loans rather than securitized debt);
 (c) the interest rate cap could be in the context of fixed coupon rate nonmarketable
 debt; (d) or it could be maintained through central bank interest rate targets (often at the
 directive of the Treasury or Ministry of Finance when central bank independence was
 limited or nonexistent). Metzler’s (2003) monumental history of the Federal Reserve
 (Volume I) documents the US experience in this regard; Cukierman’s (1992) classic on
 central bank independence provides a broader international context.

          (ii) Creation and maintenance of a captive domestic audience that facilitated
 directed credit to the government. This was achieved through multiple layers of
 regulations from very blunt to more subtle measures. (a) Capital account restrictions
 and exchange controls orchestrated a “forced home bias” in the portfolio of financial
 institutions and individuals under the Bretton Woods arrangements. (b) High reserve
 requirements (usually non-remunerated) as a tax levy on banks (see Brock, 1989, for an
 insightful international comparison). (c) Among more subtle measures, “prudential”
 regulatory measures requiring that institutions (almost exclusively domestic ones) hold
 government debts in their portfolios (pension funds have historically been a primary
 target); and (d) transaction taxes on equities (see Campbell and Froot, 1994) also act to
 direct investors toward government (and other) types of debt instruments. (e)
 prohibitions on gold transactions.

          (iii) Other common measures associated with financial repression aside from
 the ones discussed above are, direct ownership (China or India) of banks or extensive
 management of banks and other financial institutions (i.e. Japan). Restrictions of entry
 to the financial industry and directing credit to certain industries are also features of
 repressed financial markets (see Beim and Calomiris, 2000).

                                  Highlights from 1920s-1950s

       Peaks and troughs in public debt/GDP are seldom synchronized across many

countries’ historical paths. There are, however, a few historical episodes where global

(or nearly global) developments, be it a war or a severe financial and economic crisis,

produces a synchronized surge in public debt, such as the one recorded for advanced

economies since 2008. Using the Reinhart and Rogoff (2011) database for 70 countries,

Figure 1 provides central government debt/GDP for the advanced economy and emerging

market subgroups since 1900. It is a simple arithmetic average that does not assign

weight according to country size.



1. Global debt surges and their resolution

       An examination of these two series identifies a total of five peaks in world

indebtedness. Three episodes (World War I, World War II, and the Second Great

Contraction, 2008-present) are almost exclusively advanced economy debt peaks; one is

unique to emerging markets (1980s debt crisis followed by the transition economies’

collapses); and the Great Depression of the 1930s is common to both groups. World War

I and Depression debts were importantly resolved by widespread default and explicit

restructurings or predominantly forcible conversions of domestic and external debts in

both the now-advanced economies, as well as the emerging markets. Notorious

hyperinflations in Germany, Hungary and other parts of Europe violently liquidated

domestic-currency debts. Table 1 and the associated discussion provide a chronology of

these debt resolution episodes. As Reinhart and Rogoff (2009 and 2011) document, debt

reduction via default or restructuring has historically been associated with substantial

declines in output in the run-up to as well as during the credit event and in its immediate

aftermath.

Notes: Listed in parentheses below each debt-surge episode are the main mechanisms for debt resolution
besides fiscal austerity programs which were not implemented in any discernible synchronous pattern
across countries in any given episode. Specific default/restructuring years by country are provided in the
Reinhart-Rogoff database and a richer level of detail for 1920s-1950s (including various conversions are
listed in Table 1). The “typical” forms of financial repression measures are discussed in Box 1 and greater
detail for the core countries are provided in Table 2.

           The World War II debt overhang was importantly liquidated via the combination

of financial repression and inflation, as we shall document. This was possible because

debts were predominantly domestic and denominated in domestic currencies. The robust

post-war growth also contributed importantly to debt reduction in a way that was a

marked contrast to the 1930s, during which the combined effects of deflation and output

           8
collapses worked worsen the debt/GDP balance in the way stressed by Irving Fisher

(1931).

          The resolution of the emerging market debt crisis involved a combination of

default or restructuring of external debts, explicit default or financial repression on

domestic debt. In several episodes, notably in Latin America, hyperinflations in the mid-

to-late 1980s and early 1990s completed the job of significantly liquidating (at least for a

brief interlude) the remaining stock of domestic currency debt (even when such debts

were indexed, as was the case of Brazil). 9



2. Default, restructurings and forcible conversions in the 1930s

          Table 1 lists the known “domestic credit events” of the Depression. Default on or

restructuring of external debt (see the extensive notes to the table) also often

accompanied the restructuring or default of the domestic debt. All the Allied

governments, with the exception of Finland, defaulted on (and remained in default

through 1939 and never repaid) their World War I debts to the United States as economic

conditions deteriorated worldwide during the 1930s.10

          Thus, the high debts of the First World War and the subsequent debts associated

with the Depression of the 1930s were resolved primarily through default and

restructuring. Neither economic growth nor inflation contributed much. In effect, for all

21 now-advanced economies, the median annual inflation rate for 1930-1939 was barely

above zero (0.4 percent). 11 Real interest rates remained high through significant

stretches of the decade.

           It is important to stress that during the period after WWI the gold standard was

still in place in many countries, which meant that monetary policy was subordinated to

keep a given gold parity. In those cases, inflation was not a policy variable available to

policymakers in the same way that it was after the adoption of fiat currencies.

                                                        settled in 1936 when the US paid the agreed amount

                                                        This domestic debt conversion was apparently
                                                        voluntary. However, some of the WWI debts to the

  See Schedvin (1970) and Prichard (1970), for accounts of the Australian and New Zealand conversions,
respectively, during the Depression. Michael Reddell kindly alerted us to these episodes and references.
Alex Pollock pointed out the relevance of widespread restrictions on gold holdings in the United States and
elsewhere during the financial repression era.
Notes: We have made significant further progress in sorting out the defaults on World War I debts to the
United States, notably by European countries. In all cases these episodes are classified as a default on
external debts. However, in some case –such as the UK--some of the WWI debts to the US were also issued
under the domestic law and, as such, would also qualify as a domestic default. The external defaults on
June 15, 1934 included: Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Estonia, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy,
Latvia, Poland, United Kingdom. Only Finland made payments. See New York Times, June 15, 1934.


          III. Financial Repression: policies and evidence from real interest rates



1. Selected financial regulation measures during the “era of financial repression”

One salient characteristic of financial repression is its pervasive lack of transparency.

The reams of regulations applying to domestic and cross-border financial transactions

and directives cannot be summarized by a brief description. Table 2 makes this clear by

providing a broad sense of the kinds of regulations on interest rates and cross-border and

foreign exchange transactions and how long these lasted since the end of the war in 1945.

A common element across countries “financial architecture” not brought out in Table 2 is


          12
that domestic government debt played a dominant role in domestic institutions asset

holdings--notably that of pension funds. High reserve requirements, relative to the

current practice in advanced economies and many emerging markets, were also a

common way of taxing the banks not captured in our minimalist description. The

interested reader is referred to Brock (1989) and Agenor and Montiel (2008), who focus

on the role of reserve requirements and their link to inflation (see also Appendix Table

A.1.2 and accompanying discussion.)

2. Real Interest Rates


       One of the main goals of financial repression is to keep nominal interest rates

lower than would otherwise prevail. This effect, other things equal, reduces the

governments’ interest expenses for a given stock of debt and contributes to deficit

reduction. However, when financial repression produces negative real interest rates, this

also reduces or liquidates existing debts. It is a transfer from creditors (savers) to

borrowers (in the historical episode under study here--the government).


       The financial repression tax has some interesting political-economy properties.

Unlike income, consumption, or sales taxes, the “repression” tax rate (or rates) are

determined by financial regulations and inflation performance that are opaque to the

highly politicized realm of fiscal measures. Given that deficit reduction usually involves

highly unpopular expenditure reductions and (or) tax increases of one form or another,

the relatively “stealthier” financial repression tax may be a more politically palatable

alternative to authorities faced with the need to reduce outstanding debts. As discussed in

Obstfeld and Taylor (2004) and others, liberal capital- market regulations (the

accompanying market-determined interest rates) and international capital mobility

reached their heyday prior to World War I under the umbrella of the gold standard.

World War I and the suspension of convertibility and international gold shipments it

brought, and, more generally, a variety of restrictions on cross border transactions were

the first blows to the globalization of capital. Global capital markets recovered partially

during the roaring twenties, but the Great Depression, followed by World War II, put the

final nails in the coffin of laissez faire banking. It was in this environment that the

Bretton Woods arrangement of fixed exchange rates and tightly controlled domestic and

       19
international capital markets was conceived. 13 In that context, and taking into account

the major economic dislocations, scarcities, etc. which prevailed at the closure of the

second great war, we witness a combination of very low nominal interest rates and

inflationary spurts of varying degrees across the advanced economies. The obvious

result, were real interest rates--whether on treasury bills (Figure 2), central bank discount

rates (Figure 3), deposits (Figure 4) or loans (not shown)—that were markedly negative

during 1945-1946.


         For the next 35 years or so, real interest rates in both advanced and emerging

economies would remain consistently lower than the eras of freer capital mobility before

and after the financial repression era. In effect, real interest rates (Figures 2-4) were, on

average negative.14 Binding interest rate ceilings on deposits (which kept real ex-post

deposit rates even more negative than real ex-post rates on treasury bills, as shown in

Figures 2 and 4) “induced” domestic savers to hold government bonds. What delayed the

emergence of leakages in the search for higher yields (apart from prevailing capital

controls) was that the incidence of negative returns on government bonds and on deposits

was (more or less) a universal phenomenon at this time15. The frequency distributions of

real rates for the period of financial repression (1945-1980) and the years following

financial liberalization (roughly 1981-2009 for the advanced economies) shown in the

three panels of Figure 5, highlight the universality of lower real interest rates prior to the

1980s and the high incidence of negative real interest rates.

13
   In a framework where there are both tax collection costs and a large stock of domestic government,
Aizenman and Guidotti, (1994) show how a government can resort to capital controls (which lower
domestic interest rates relative to foreign interest rates) to reduce the costs of servicing the domestic debt.
14
   Note that real interest rates were lower in a high-economic-growth period of 1945 to 1980 than in the
lower growth period 1981-2009; this is exactly the opposite of the prediction of a basic growth model and
therefore indicative of significant impediments to financial trade.
15
   A comparison of the return on government bonds to that of equity during this period and its connection to
“the equity premium puzzle” can be found in Sbrancia (2011).

         20
                Such negative (or low) real interest rates were consistently and substantially

below the real rate of growth of GDP, this is consistent with the observation of

Elmendorf and Mankiw (1999) when they state “An important factor behind the dramatic

drop (in US public debt) between 1945 and 1975 is that the growth rate of GNP exceeded

the interest rate on government debt for most of that period.” They fail to explain why

this configuration should persist over three decades in so many countries.

               Real interest rates on deposits were negative in about 60 percent of the

observations. In effect, real ex-post deposit rates were below one percent about 83

percent of the time. Appendix Table A1.1, which shows for each country average real

            The preceding analysis sets the general tone of what to expect, in terms of real

rates of return on a portfolio of government debt, during the era of financial repression.

For the United States, for example, Homer and Sylla (1963) describe 1946-1981 as the

second (and longest) bear bond market in US history. 16 To reiterate the point that the

low real interest rates of the financial repression era were exceptionally low not only in

relation to the post-liberalization period but also to the more liberal financial environment

of pre-World War II, Figure 6 plots the frequency distribution of real interest rates on

deposits for the United Kingdom over three subperiods, 1880-193917, 1945-1980, 1981-

         The    preceding analysis of real interest rates despite being qualitatively suggestive

falls short of providing estimates of the magnitude of the debt-servicing savings and

outright debt liquidation that accrued to governments during this extended period. To fill

in that gap the next section outlines the methodological approach we follow to quantify

the financial repression tax, while Section V presents the main results.




         26
        IV. The Liquidation of Government Debt: Conceptual and Data Issues

        This section discusses the data and methodology we develop to arrive at estimates

of how much debt was liquidated via a combination of low nominal interest rates and

higher inflation rates, or what we term “the liquidation effect.”18

        Data requirements. Reliable estimates of the liquidation effect require

considerable data, most of which is not readily available from even the most

comprehensive electronic databases. Indeed, most of the data used in these exercises

comes from a broad variety of historical government publications, many which are quite

obscure, as detailed in the Data Appendix. The calculation of the “liquidation effect” is a

clear illustration of a case where the devil lies in the details, as the structure of

government debt varies enormously across countries and within countries over time.

Differences in coupon rates, maturity and the distribution of marketable and

nonmarketable debt, securitized debt versus loans from financial institutions, importantly

shape the overall cost of debt financing for the government. There is no “single”

government interest rate (such as a 3-month t-bill or a 10-year bond) that is appropriate

to apply to a hybrid debt stock. The starting point to come up with a measure that reflects

the true cost of debt financing is a reconstruction of the government’s debt profile over

time.

        Sample. We employ two samples in our empirical analysis. We use the database

from Sbrancia (2011) of the government’s debt profiles for 10 countries (Argentina,

Australia, Belgium, India, Ireland, Italy, South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and

the United States). These were constructed from primary sources over the period 1945-

1990 where possible or over shorter intervals (determined by data availability) for a

18
  Table A.1.2 and its accompanying discussion also examines other approaches to quantifying the financial
repression tax .

        27
subset of the sample. For the benchmark or basic calculations (described below), this

involves data on a detailed composition of debt, including maturity, coupon rate, and

outstanding amounts by instrument. For a more comprehensive measure, which takes into

account capital gains or losses of holding government debt, bond price data are also

required. In all cases, we also use official estimates of consumer price inflation, which

at various points in history may significantly understate the true inflation rates. 19 Data on

Nominal GDP and government tax revenues are used to express the estimates of the

liquidation effect as ratios that are comparable across time and countries.

         For our broader analysis of the behavior of inflation during major debt reduction

episodes, which has far less demanding data requirements (domestic public debt

outstanding/GDP and inflation rates) our sample broadens to 28 countries from all

regions for 1790-2010 (or subsamples therein). The countries and their respective

coverage are listed in Appendix Table A.1.3.



     1. Benchmark basic estimates of the “liquidation effect”

         The debt portfolio. We construct a “synthetic portfolio” 20 for the government’s

total debt stock at the beginning of the year (fiscal or calendar, as noted). This portfolio

reflects the actual shares of debts across the different spectrum of maturities as well as

the shares of marketable versus nonmarketable debt.




19
   This is primarily due to the existence of price controls which were mainly imposed during WWII and
remained for several years after the end of the conflict. See Friedman and Schwartz (1963) for estimates of
the actual price level in the US and UK, and Wiles (1952) for post-WII U.K,
20
   The term “synthetic” is used in the sense that a hypothetical investor holds the total portfolio of
government debt at the beginning of the period, which is defined as either the beginning of the calendar
year or the fiscal year, depending on how the debt data is reported by the particular country. Country
specifics are detailed in the data appendix. The weights in this hypothetical portfolio are given by the
actual shares of each component of debt in the total domestic debt of the government.

         28
         Interest rate on the portfolio. The “aggregate” nominal interest rate for a

particular year is the coupon rate on a particular type of debt instrument weighted by that

instrument’s share in the total stock of debt. 21 We then aggregate across all debt

instruments. The real rate of interest,

                                                           it −1 − π t
                                                    rt =
                                                            1+ π t

(where i and π are nominal interest and inflation rates, respectively) is calculated on an

ex-post basis using CPI inflation for the corresponding one-year period. It is a before-tax

real rate of return (excluding capital gains or losses). 22

         A definition of debt “liquidation years.” Our benchmark calculations define a

liquidation year, as one in which the real rate of interest (as defined above) is negative

(below zero). This is a conservative definition of liquidation year; a more comprehensive

definition would include periods where the real interest rate on government debt was

below a “market” real rate.23

         Savings to the government during liquidation years. This concept captures the

savings (in interest costs) to the government from having a negative real interest rate on

government debt. (As noted it is a lower bound on saving of interest costs, if the

benchmark used assumed, for example a positive real rate of, say, two or three percent.)

These savings can be thought of as having “a revenue-equivalent” for the government,

which like regular budgetary revenues can be expressed as a share of GDP or as a share


21
   Giovannini and de Melo (1993) state “the choice of a "representative" interest rate on domestic liabilities
an almost impossible task and because there are no reliable breakdowns of domestic and foreign liabilities
by type of loan and interest rate charged.” This is precisely the almost impossible task we undertake here.
Their alternative methodology is described in appendix Table A.2.
22
   Some of the observations on inflation are sufficiently high to make the more familiar linear version of the
Fisher equation a poor approximation.
23
   However, determining what such a market rate would be in periods of pervasive financial repression
requires assumptions about whether real interest rates during that period would have comparable to the real
interest that prevailed in period when market were liberalized and prices were market determined.

         29
of recorded tax revenues to provide standard measures of the “liquidation effect” across

countries and over time. The saving (or “revenue”) to the government or the “liquidation

effect” or the “financial repression tax” is the real (negative) interest rate times the “tax

base,” which is the stock of domestic government debt outstanding.



2. An alternative measure of the liquidation effect based on total returns

       Thus far, our measure of the liquidation affect has been confined to savings to the

government by way of annual interest costs. However, capital losses (if bond prices fall)

may also contribute importantly to the calculus of debt liquidation over time. This is the

case because the market value of the debt will actually be lower than its face value. The

market value of government debt obviously matters for investors’ wealth but also

measures the true capitalized value of future coupon and interest payments. Moreover, a

government (or its central bank) buying back existing debt could directly and

immediately lower the par value of existing obligations. Once we take into account

potential price changes, the total nominal return or holding period return (HPR) for each

instrument is given by:

                                                ( Pt − Pt −1 ) + Ct
                                       HPRt =
                                                       Pt −1

where Pt and Pt −1 are the prices of the bond at time t and t − 1 respectively, and C t is

the annual interest payment (i.e., the nominal coupon rate).

       We use this total return measure as a supplement rather than as our core or

benchmark “liquidation measure” (despite the fact that it incorporates more information

on the performance of the bond portfolio). Bond price data are only available for a subset

of the securities that constitute the government portfolio and, more generally, consistent


       30
time series price data are more difficult to get for some of the countries in our sample. It

is also worth noting that while price movements for different bonds are generally in the

same direction during a particular year, there are significant differences in the magnitudes

of the price changes. This cross-bond variation in price performance makes it difficult to

infer what the price of nonmarketable debt (for which there is no price data altogether), as

well as marketable bonds for which there is no price data. As before, we define

“liquidation years” as those periods in which the real return of the portfolio is negative. 24



3. The role of inflation and currency depreciation

         The idea of governments using inflation to liquidate debt is hardly a new one

since the widespread adoption of fiat currency, as discussed earlier.25 It is obvious that

for any given nominal interest rate a higher inflation rate reduces the real interest rate on

the debt, thus increasing the odds that real interest rates become negative and the year is

classified as a “liquidation year.” Furthermore, it is also evident that for any year that is

classified as a liquidation year the higher the inflation rate (for a given coupon rate) the

higher the saving to the government.

         Our approach helps to pinpoint periods (and countries) when inflation played a

systematically larger role in eroding the debts of the government. In addition, we can

disentangle to what extent this was done via relatively short-lived “inflation surprises”

(unanticipated inflation) or through a steady and chronic dose of moderate inflation over

extended time horizons. Because we do not have a direct measure of inflation

24
   As described in Appendix 2, we also calculate an alternative definition of “liquidation years” by
comparing the real return of the government debt portfolio to the real return in the equity market.
According to this definition, a given year is considered a “liquidation year” if the return in a given year for
the government portfolio is below the return in the stock market; we use the most comprehensive stock
market index available for each country
25
   See for example, Calvo’s (1989) framework which highlights the role of inflation in debt liquidation
even in the presence of short-term debt.

         31
expectations for much of the sample, we define inflation bursts or “surprises” in a more

mechanical, ex-post manner. Specifically, we calculate a ten-year moving average for

inflation and classify those years in which inflation was more than two-standard

deviations above the 10-year average as an “inflation burst/surprise year”. As the 10-year

window may be arbitrarily too backward looking, we also perform the comparable

exercise using a five-year moving average.



                V. The Liquidation of Government Debt: Empirical Estimates


           This section presents estimates of the “liquidation effect” for ten advanced and

emerging economies for most of the post-World War II period. Our main interest lies in

the period prior to the process of financial liberalization that took hold during the

1980s—that is, the era of financial repression. However, as noted, this three-plus decade-

long stretch is by no means uniform. The decade immediately following World War II

was characterized by a very high public debt overhang—legacy of the war, a higher

incidence of inflation, and often multiple currency practices (with huge black market

exchange rate premiums) in many advanced economies.26 The next decade (1960s) was

the heyday of the Bretton Woods system with heavily regulated domestic and foreign

exchange markets and more stable inflation rates in the advanced economies (as well as

more moderate public debt levels). The 1970s was quite distinct from the prior decades,

as leakages in financial regulations proliferated, the fixed exchange rate arrangements

under Bretton Woods among the advanced economies broke down, and inflation began to

resurface in the wake of the global oil shock and accommodative monetary policies in the



26
     See De Vries (1969), Horsefield (1969), Reinhart and Rogoff (2003).

           32
United States and elsewhere. To this end, we also provide estimates of the liquidation of

government debt for relevant subperiods.


1. Incidence and magnitude of the “liquidation tax”

        Table 4 provides information on a country-by-country basis for the period under

study; the incidence of debt liquidation years (as defined in the preceding section); the

listing of the liquidation years; the average (negative) real interest rate during the

liquidation years; and the minimum real interest rate recorded (and the year in which that

minimum was reached). Given its notorious high and chronic inflation history coupled

with heavy-handed domestic financial regulation and capital controls during 1944-1974,

it is not surprising that Argentina tops the list. Almost all the years (97 percent) were

recorded as liquidation years, as the Argentine real ex-post interest rates were negative in

every single year during 1944-1974 except for 1953 (a just deflationary year). For India,

that share was 53 percent (slightly more than one half of the 1949-1980 observations

recorded negative real interest rates). Before reaching the conclusion that this debt

liquidation through financial repression was predominantly an emerging market

phenomenon, it is worth noting that for the United Kingdom the share of liquidation

years was about 48 percent during 1945-1980. For the United States, the world’s

financial center, a quarter of the years during that same period Treasury debt had negative

real interest rates.


        As to the magnitudes of the financial repression tax (Table 4), real interest rates

were most negative for Argentina (reaching a minimum of -53 percent in 1959). The

share of domestic government debt in Argentina (and other Latin American countries) in

total (domestic plus external) public debt was substantial during 1900-1950s; it is not


        33
surprising that in light of these real rates the domestic debt market all but disappeared and

capital flight marched upwards (capital controls notwithstanding). By the late 1970s

Argentina and many other chronic inflation countries were predominantly relying on

external debt.27 Italian real interest rates right after World War II were as negative as 47

percent (in 1945). For the Unites States real rates were -8 to -9 percent during 1945-1947

on average the US had -3.5 percent real rates during the liquidation years).

    In 1944, the negative real return was 82.3 percent.




           There are two distinct patterns in the ten-country sample evident from an

inspection of the timing of the incidence and magnitude of the negative real rates. The

first of these is the cases where the negative real rates (financial repression tax) were

most pronounced in the years following World War II (as war debts were importantly

inflated away). This pattern is most evident in Australia, the United Kingdom and the

United States, although negative real rates re-emerge following the breakdown of Bretton

Woods in 1974-1975. Then there are the cases where there is a more persistent or chronic

reliance on financial repression throughout the sample as a way of funding government

deficits and/or eroding existing government debts. The cases of Argentina and India in

the emerging markets and Ireland and Italy in the advanced economies stand out in this

regard.

           The preceding analysis, as noted, adopts a very narrow, conservative calculation

of both the incidence of the “liquidation effect” or the financial repression tax. Much of

the literature on growth, as well as standard calibration exercises involving subjective

rates of time preference assume benchmark real interest rates of three percent per annum

and even higher. Thus, a threshold that only examines periods where real interest rates

were actually negative is bound to underestimate the incidence of “abnormally low” real

interest rates during the era of financial repression (approximately taken to be 1945-

1980). To assess the incidence of more broadly defined low real interest rates, Table 5

presents for the 10 core countries the share of years where real returns on a portfolio of




           35
government debt (as defined earlier) were below zero (as in Table 4), one, two, and three

percent, respectively.28


         In the era of financial repression that we examine here, real ex post interest rates

on government debt did not reach three percent in a single year in the United States; in

effect in nearly 2/3 of the years real interest rates were below one percent. The incidence

of “abnormally low” real interest rates is comparable for the United Kingdom and

Australia—both countries which had sharp and relatively rapid declines in public debt to

GDP following World War II. 29 Even in countries with substantial economic and

financial volatility during this period (including Ireland, Italy and South Africa), real

interest rates on government debt above three percent were relatively rare (accounting for

only about 20-23 percent of the observations.




28
   An alternative strategy would be to use a growth model to calibrate the relationship between the real
interest rate and output growth for the counterfactual of free markets. That, however, would make the
results model specific.

2. Estimates of the Liquidation Effect

          Having documented the high incidence of “liquidation years” (even by

conservative estimates), we now calculate the magnitude of the savings to the

government (financial repression tax or liquidation effect). These estimates take “the tax

rate” (the negative real interest rate) and multiplies it by the “tax base” or the stock of

debt, Table 6 reports these estimates for each country.

          The magnitudes are in all cases non-trivial, irrespective of whether we use the

benchmark measure that is exclusively based on interest rate (coupon yields) or the

alternative measure that includes capital gains (or losses) for the cases where the bond

price data is available.

          For the United States and the United Kingdom the annual liquidation of debt via

negative real interest rates amounted on average from to 3 to 4 percent of GDP a year.

Obviously, annual deficit reduction of 3 to 4 percent of GDP quickly accumulates (even

without any compounding) to a 30 to 40 percent of GDP debt reduction in the course of a

decade. For Australia and Italy, which recorded higher inflation rates, the liquidation

effect was larger (around 5 percent per annum). Interestingly (but not entirely

surprising), the average annual magnitude of the liquidation effect for Argentina is about

the same as that of the US, despite the fact that the average real interest rate averaged

          38
about -3.5 percent for the US and nearly -16 percent for Argentina during liquidation

years in the 1945-1980 repression era. Just as money holdings secularly shrink during

periods of high and chronic inflation, so does the domestic debt market. 30 Argentina’

“tax base” (domestic public debt) shrank steadily during this period; at the end of World

War II nearly all public debt was domestic and by the early 1980s domestic debt

accounted for less than ½ of total public debt. Without the means to liquidate external

debts, Argentina defaulted on its external obligations in 1982.

        Countries like Ireland, India, Sweden and South Africa that did not experience a

massive public debt build-up during World War II recorded more modest annual savings

(but still substantive) during the heyday of financial repression.31




30
  These issues are examined in Reinhart and Rogoff (2011).
31
  It is important to note that while financial repression wound down in most of the advanced economies in
the sample by the mid 1980s, it has persisted in varying degrees in India through the present (with its
system of state-owned banks and widespread capital controls) and in Argentina (except for the years of the
“Convertibility Plan,” April 1991-December 2001).

Notes: The peaks in debt/GDP were: Italy 129.0 in 1943; United Kingdom 247.5 in 1946; United States
121.3 in 1946. An alternative interpretation of the financial repression revenue is simply as savings in
interest service on the debt.



                                          VI. Inflation and Debt Reduction

          We have argued that inflation is most effective in liquidating government debts

(or debts in general), when interest rates are not able to respond to the rise in inflation and

in inflation expectations.32 This disconnect between nominal interest rates and inflation

can occur if: (i) the setting is one where interest rates are either administered or

predetermined (via financial repression, as described); (ii) all government debts are fixed-

rate and long maturities and the government has no new financing needs (even if there is

no financial repression the long maturities avoid rising interest costs that would otherwise



          32
               That is, the coefficient in the Fisher equation is less than one.

          40
prevail if short maturity debts needed to be rolled over); and (iii) all (or nearly all) debt is

liquidated in one “surprise” inflation spike.


         Our attention thus far has been confined to the first on that list, the financial

repression environment. The second scenario, where governments only have long-term,

fixed-rate debt outstanding and have no new financing needs (deficits) remain to be

identified (however, these authors have a sense such episodes are relatively rare). This

leaves the third case where debts are swiftly liquidated via an inflation spike (or perhaps

more appropriately surge). To attempt to identify potential episodes of the latter, we

conduct two simple exercises.


         In the first exercise, we identify inflation “surprises” for the core ten-country

sample. In order to identify inflation surprises we calculate a 10-year moving average

inflation, and count a year as an “inflation surprise” year if the inflation during that year

is two standard deviations above the corresponding 10-year average.33 Table 8 presents

the results. The second column shows the share of years which are “inflation surprises”

during the sample period while the third shows the share of years which are both an

“inflation surprise” and a “liquidation year”.


         As Table 8 highlights, there is not much overlap between debt liquidation years

and inflation surprises, as defined here. Averaging across the 10 countries, only 18

percent of the liquidation years coincide with an “inflation surprise.” In the case of South

Africa, for instance, none of the liquidation years overlap with inflation surprises. The

high incidence of inflation surprises years during the early 1970s at the time of the surge


33
  The pertinent 10-year average for determining whether year t is an inflation surprise or not is calculated
over the interval t-10 to t-1.

         41
in oil and commodity prices, suggests our crude methodology to identify “inflation

surprises (or spikes)” may be a reasonable approximation to the real thing. More to the

point, this exercise suggests that the role of inflation in the liquidation of debt is

predominantly of the more chronic variety coupled with financially-repressed nominal

interest rates.

*Shown in italics are “inflation surprise” years which do not coincide with liquidation years.




            Our algorithm for the second exercise begins by identifying debt-reduction

episodes and then focusing on the largest of these. Any decline in debt/GDP over a three

year window classifies as a debt-reduction episode. . For this pool of debt-reduction

episodes, we construct their frequency distribution (for each country) and focus on the

lower (ten percent) tail of the distribution to identify the “largest” three-year debt

          42
reduction episodes. This algorithm biases our selection of episodes toward the more

sudden (or abrupt) ones (even if these are later reversed) which might a priori be

attributable to some combination of a booming economy, a substantive fiscal austerity

plan, or a burst in inflation/liquidation, or explicit default or restructuring. A milder but

steady debt reduction process that lasts over many years would be identified as a series of

episodes—but if the decline in debt over any particular three-year window is modest it

may not be large enough to fall in the lower ten percent of all the observations.


       This exercise helps flag episodes where inflation is likely to have played a

significant role in public debt reduction but does not provide estimates of how much debt

was liquidated (as in the preceding analysis). Because we only require information on

domestic public debt/GDP and inflation, we expand our coverage to 28 countries

predominantly (but not exclusively) over 1900-2009. Thus, we are not exclusively

focusing on the period of financial repression but examining more broadly into the role of

inflation and debt reduction in the countries’ histories.

        Table 9 lists the largest debt reduction episodes by country, the last year of the 3-

year episode is shown and for each country; the year that appears in italics represents the

largest single-episode of debt reduction. The next two columns of the table are devoted

to the average and median inflation performance during the debt reduction episodes listed

in the second column in comparison to the inflation performance (average and median)

for the full sample (the coverage, which varies by country, is shown in Table A.2). In 22

of 28 countries, inflation is significantly higher in the episodes of debt reduction than for

the full sample. In the extreme cases, it is the wholesale liquidation of domestic debt,

such as during the German hyperinflation of the early 1920s and the long-lasting

Brazilian and Argentine hyperinflations of the early 1990s. Even without these extreme

cases, the inflation differentials between the debt reduction episodes and the full sample

are suggestive of the use of inflation (intentionally or because it became unmanageable)

to reduce (or liquidate) government debts even in periods outside the era of heavy

financial repressions. The evidence is only suggestive of this interpretation, as no

explicit causal pattern is tested.

*A debt reduction episode is defined as a decline in the domestic public debt/GDP ratio over a three-year
window. The dates shown are for the largest three-year declines recorded during the full sample period as
shown in Table A.2.
Notes: The largest annual (single-year) decline recorded in debt/GDP is shown year shown in italics under
the Dates column. For example, for Germany this was the hyperinflation year 1923; for the United States it
was 1952, the year following a substantial debt conversion (see Table 2).

Concluding Remarks

        The substantial tax on financial savings imposed by the financial repression that

characterized 1945-1980 was a major factor explaining the relatively rapid reduction of

public debt in a number of the advanced economies. This fact has been largely

overlooked in the literature and discussion on debt reduction. The UK’s history offers a

pertinent illustration. Following the Napoleonic Wars, the UK’s public debt was a

staggering 260 percent of GDP; it took over 40 years to bring it down to about 100

percent (a massive reduction in an era of price stability and high capital mobility

anchored by the gold standard). Following World War II, the UK’s public debt ratio was

reduced by a comparable amount in 20 years. 34


         The financial repression route taken at the creation of the Bretton Woods system

was facilitated by initial conditions after the war, which had left a legacy of pervasive

domestic and financial restrictions. Indeed, even before the outbreak of World War II,

the pendulum had begun to swing away from laissez-faire financial markets toward

heavier-handed regulation in response to the widespread financial crises of 1929-1931.

But one cannot help thinking that part of the design principle of the Bretton Woods

system was to make it easier to work down massive debt burdens. The legacy of

financial crisis made it easier to package those policies as prudential.


        To deal with the current debt overhang, similar policies to those documented here

may re-emerge in the guise of prudential regulation rather than under the politically

incorrect label of financial repression. Moreover, the process where debts are being

34
 Peak debt/GDP was 260.6 in 1819 and 237.9 percent in 1947. Real GDP growth was about the same
during the two debt reduction periods (1819-1859) and (1947-1967), averaging about 2.5 percent per
annum (the comparison is not exact as continuous GDP data begins in 1830). As such, higher growth
cannot obviously account for the by far faster debt reduction following World War II.

        46
“placed” at below market interest rates in pension funds and other more captive domestic

financial institutions is already under way in several countries in Europe. There are many

bankrupt (or nearly so) pension plans at the state level in the United States that bear

scrutiny (in addition to the substantive unfunded liabilities at the federal level).


       Markets for government bonds are increasingly populated by nonmarket players,

notably central banks of the United States, Europe and many of the largest emerging

markets, calling into question what the information content of bond prices are relatively

to their underlying risk profile. This decoupling between interest rates and risk is a

common feature of financially repressed systems. With public and private external debts

at record highs, many advanced economies are increasingly looking inward for public

debt placements.


        While to state that initial conditions on the extent of global integration are vastly

different at the outset of Bretton Woods in 1946 and today is an understatement, the

direction of regulatory changes have many common features. The incentives to reduce

the debt overhang are more compelling today than about half a century ago. After World

War II, the overhang was limited to public debt (as the private sector had painfully

deleveraged through the 1930s and the war); at present, the debt overhang many

advanced economies face encompasses (in varying degrees) households, firms, financial

institutions and governments.

         Table A1.2 sketches the approach, sample and findings of six papers that have in

different ways attempted to quantify some of the dimensions of financial repression.

While Beim and Calomiris (2001) primarily aim to rank a cross section of countries at a

point (or two) in time to link the measures extent of financial repression to growth and

development, the remaining papers do attempt to quantify some of the financial

repression “revenue” equivalents. For instance, the papers dealing with reserve

requirements capture the tax on financial institutions. Ultimately, (as Reinhart and

Reinhart, 1999 document) the banks pass this tax on to depositors (via lower deposit

rates), non-government borrowers (via higher lending rates) or both, depending who has

the most access to alternatives. If households are barred from holding foreign assets

and/or gold (see Table 2), lower deposits are tolerated more readily. If domestic banks

are the only game in town for the firms—they will have to live with the higher lending

rates.

         The Giovannini and deMelo (1993) paper is closest in spirit to our fundamental

two-part intertwined question (i) what is the annual saving on interest payments domestic

debt? (ii) what the magnitude of the erosion or liquidation on the existing stock of debt

         55
due to negative real interest rates. Giovannini and de Melo (1993) compare “effective

interest rates” on external debt to the potentially repressed “effective interest rates on

domestic debt” (See Table A1.2). This is a natural exercise for emerging markets (the

focus of their analysis) for the period that they consider (1974-1987), as emerging market

governments were funding themselves through both domestic and external borrowing (in

varying degrees), as documented by Reinhart and Rogoff (2011). The market-determined

interest rate on external debt is a logical benchmark under such circumstances. However,

there are two compelling reasons why this approach is neither feasible nor desirable for

our purposes. First, some countries (like the United States and the Netherlands) do not

have and have not had historically external debt.35 All government debts are issued under

domestic law and in the domestic currency, irrespective of whether the holders of the

debt are domestic pension funds or foreign central banks. Second, most emerging

markets had little or no external debt during the heyday of the financial repression era

during Bretton Woods (1945-1973); the depression of the 1930s and the subsequent

world war had all but eradicated global debt markets.
