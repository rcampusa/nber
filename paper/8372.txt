1. Introduction
        One of the most widely-discussed public policy issues in the United States and many

other industrial countries is the decline in the wages of less-skilled workers during the 1980’s

and 1990’s, both in real terms and relative to the wages of more-skilled workers. The question

is, what factors account for this change? One obvious explanation that comes to mind is

increased competition from low-wage countries. Surprisingly, many economists researching this

issue have come to the conclusion that trade is not the dominant – or even an important –

explanation for the shift in wages. They have instead looked to the massive influx of computers

into the workplace, and other forms of technological change, as the explanation.

        In this survey, we present a contrary point of view, and argue that international trade is

indeed an important explanation for the increase in the wage gap. Our argument rests on the idea

that an increasing amount of international trade takes the form of trade in intermediate inputs.

This is sometimes called “production sharing” by the companies involved, or simply

“outsourcing.”1 Trade of this type affects labor demand in import-competing industries, but

also affects labor demand in the industries using the inputs. For this reason, trade in intermediate

inputs can have an impact on wages and employment that is much greater than for trade in final

consumer goods. As we shall argue, trade in inputs has much the same impact on labor demand

as does skill-biased technical change: both of these will shift demand away from low-skilled




1 Alternatively referred to as outsourcing (Katz and Murphy, 1992, Feenstra and Hanson, 1996), de-localization
(Leamer, 1998), fragmentation (Deardorff, 2001; Jones and Keirzkowski, 1997, Arndt and Kierzkowski, 2000),
intra-product specialization (Arndt, 1997 and 1998a,b), intra-mediate trade (Antweiler and Trefler, 1997), vertical
specialization (Hummels, Ishii, and Yi, 2001), and slicing the value chain (Krugman, 1995), this phenomena refers
to the geographic separation of activities involved in producing a good (or service) across two or more countries.
The term “production sharing” was coined by management consultant Peter Drucker (“The Rise of Production
Sharing,” The Wall Street Journal, March 15, 1977), as we have adopted in our title.
                                                        2

activities, while raising relative demand and wages of the higher skilled. Thus, distinguishing

whether the change in wages is due to international trade, or technological change, is

fundamentally an empirical rather than a theoretical question.

        In the next section, we review the basic evidence that has been used to conclude that

trade has not been a significant cause of U.S. wage changes. We argue that this evidence still

leaves room for trade to be important, especially trade in intermediate inputs. Empirically, a

good deal of trade is in intermediate inputs, and the impact of this on wages and other factor

prices is quite different from that obtained with just trade in final goods. This is shown in

section 3, where we present a simple model of trade in intermediate inputs. In section 4 we

discuss various methods of estimating this model, and summarize the evidence for the U.S. and

other countries. Conclusions and directions for further research are given in section 5.


2. Changes in Wages and Employment

        The basic facts concerning wage movements in the United States are fairly well

understood.2 For full-time U.S. workers between 1979 and 1995, the real wages of those with 12

years of education fell by 13.4% and the real wages of those with less than 12 years of education

fell by 20.2%. During the same period, the real wages of workers with 16 or more years of

education rose by 3.4%, so that the wage gap between less-skilled and more-skilled workers

increased dramatically.3 To illustrate these trends, we can use data from the U.S. manufacturing

sector for “nonproduction” and “production” workers. The former are often used as a proxy for



2 For a detailed discussion, see Katz and Autor (1999), whose wage figures we report below.
3 Only the highly skilled have had large real-wage gains. For the 1979-1995 period, real wages for those with 18
or more years of education rose by 14.0% and for those with 16 to 17 years of education rose by only 1.0%.
                                                         3

more-skilled workers, and the latter as a proxy for less-skilled workers.4 These trends are shown

in Figure 1, which graphs the relative annual earnings of nonproduction/production workers in

U.S. manufacturing, and Figure 2, which graphs their relative annual employment.

         In Figure 1, we see that earnings of nonproduction relative to production workers in the

U.S. moved erratically during the 1960’s and 1970’s, but then increased substantially during the

1980’s and 1990’s. Turning to Figure 2, we see that there has been a steady increase in the ratio

of nonproduction to production workers used in U.S. manufacturing, with some leveling off

recently. This increase in the supply of workers can account for the reduction in the relative

wage of nonproduction workers from 1970 to the early 1980s, as shown in Figure 1, but is at

odds with the increase in the relative nonproduction wage after that (Katz and Murphy, 1992).

The rising relative wage should have led to a shift in employment away from skilled workers,

along a demand curve, but it has not. Thus, the only explanation consistent with the facts is that

there has been an outward shift in the demand for more-skilled workers since the mid-1980s,

leading to an increase in their relative employment and wages (Katz and Autor, 1999).

         The same decline in the relative wages of blue-collar workers during the 1980’s and into

the 1990’s can be found for Australia, Canada, Japan, Sweden, and the United Kingdom

(Freeman and Katz, 1994; Katz and Autor, 1999), 5 and also for Hong Kong and Mexico (Cragg




4 The breakdown of workers according to whether or not they are engaged in production activity is made in the
U.S. Annual Survey of Manufactures, and is used as a proxy for the occupational-class or skill-level of workers.
While there are problems with using the production-nonproduction classification as a proxy for skill, there is
evidence that in practice the classification shows similar trends as using skill categories (Berman, Bound and
Griliches, 1994; Berman, Bound and Machin, 1998; Sachs and Shatz, 1994). The increase in the nonproduction-
production relative wage is only a small part of the total increase in wage inequality between more- and less-skilled
workers that occurred during the 1980s. See Katz and Murphy (1992) and Katz and Autor (1999) for a discussion.
5 Rising wage inequality has been relatively modest in Australia, Canada, Japan, and Sweden. Among advanced
countries, only the United Kingdom has had relative wage changes comparable to the United States (Machin, 1996).

and Epelbaum, 1996; Hanson and Harrison, 1999; Hsieh and Woo, 1999). What factors account

for these changes? Most widely cited are international competition from low-wage countries and

skilled-biased technological change due to the increased use of computers, with the latter

considered as the most important.6 There are at least three reasons why trade is thought to have

played a rather minor role, and these are reviewed in the next sections.


2.1 The Magnitude of Trade

     First, it is often noted that the magnitude of trade flows to and from the United States,

especially with developing countries, is too small to lead to the observed wage changes. Indeed,

for many industrial countries, the ratio of trade to GDP in 1970 was no higher than it was just

before World War I.7 In the U.S., for example, the value of trade (an average of imports and

exports) was 6.1% of GDP in 1913, but only 4.1% in 1970, rising to 8.8% in 1980. Other

industrial countries have higher levels of trade, but many (including France, Germany, Italy, and

Sweden) show the same time-pattern as in the U.S. A few other countries, such as Australia,

Denmark, Japan and the United Kingdom, still have not reached the trade/GDP ratio that they

had in 1913. Krugman (1995, p. 331) uses these observations to conclude that: “it would be

hard to argue that the sheer volume of trade is now at a level that marks a qualitative difference

from previous experience.” 8




6 See the surveys by Freeman (1995), Johnson and Stafford (1999), Richardson (1995), Wood (1995), and Feenstra
(1998) and the volumes by Bhagwati and Kosters (1994) and Collins (1998).
7 Data on the ratio of trade to GDP is provided in Feenstra (1998), who also computes the ratios of merchandise
trade to merchandise value-added, as discussed below.
8 Krugman (1995, 2000) provide the theoretical argument for why a small share of trade in the U.S. makes it
unlikely that trade can account for the change in wages. For an alternative views, see Deardorff (2000), Leamer
(2000), and Panagariya (2000).
                                                5

       But the ratio of trade to GDP does not tell the whole story. All industrial countries have

had increasing shares of their economies devoted to services rather than merchandise (i.e.,

manufacturing, mining and agriculture). To make a better comparison of trade with overall

production, we should measure merchandise goods in both the numerator and the denominator –

i.e., compare merchandise trade to merchandise value-added. When this is done, there are still

two countries for which this ratio was larger in 1913 than in 1990 (Japan and the United

Kingdom) and one other for which this ratio changed little (Australia). But all other industrial

countries have experienced substantial growth in trade relative to merchandise value-added

between 1913 and 1990: this ratio has increased by about one-third for Denmark and Norway;

by three-quarters for Canada; has doubled for France, Germany, Italy, and Sweden; and has

nearly tripled for the United States, rising from 13.2% in 1913 to 35.8% in 1990. We conclude

that merchandise trade has indeed grown substantially relative to the production of these

commodities in many advanced countries.

       Has the composition of merchandise trade changed over time? Various evidence

indicates that intermediate goods play an increasingly important role in trade. One approach is

to look at “processing trade,” which is defined by customs offices as the import of intermediate

inputs for processing, and subsequent re-export of the final product. This activity has grown

enormously in China, for example, for which Hong Kong often serves as an intermediary. For

example, between 1988 and 1998, processing exports grew from $12.4 billion to $97.2 billion, or

from about one-third to over one-half of total Chinese exports (Feenstra and Hanson, 2001,

Table 1). This outward processing serves newly industrialized countries in Asia, but also

developed countries such as the U.S., Japan and Europe. Between the industrialized countries,

too, there has been an increase in processing trade. Görg (2000, Table 1) reports on the increase
                                                         6

in U.S. processing trade with the European Union between 1988 and 1994. He finds that U.S.

processing imports into these countries (as a share of their total U.S. imports) increased slightly

from 17.7% to 19.8%, but this same ratio increased more significantly from 13.7% to 23.7% for

the “periphery” countries of Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain.

        In addition to processing trade, the total amount of imported intermediate inputs can be

estimated by using the purchases of each type of input, and multiplying this by the economy-

wide import share for that input. Summing this over all inputs used within each industry, we

obtain estimated imported inputs, which can then be expressed relative to total intermediate input

purchases. Feenstra and Hanson (1999) perform this calculation for U.S. manufacturing

industries, and find that imported inputs have increased from 6.5% of total intermediate

purchases in 1972 to 8.5 % in 1979, and 11.6% in 1990.

        Campa and Goldberg (1997) make the same calculation for Canada, Japan, the United

Kingdom, and the United States, and their results are shown in Table 1.9 The United States

shows a doubling of the share of imported inputs between 1975 and 1995 for all manufacturing,

though it is still at a low level compared to Canada and the United Kingdom, where over 20% of

inputs were purchased from abroad in 1993. The United Kingdom, especially, shows a large

absolute increase in foreign outsourcing. For individual industries, the chemical industry has a

lower share of imported inputs than overall, whereas machinery (non-electric and electric) and

transportation equipment have higher shares in these three countries. The machinery and

transportation industries have especially rapid growth in imported inputs, with the shares




9 Imported intermediate inputs have also been computed for nine OECD countries by Hummels, Ishii, and Yi (2001).
They find that 30% of OECD exports are attributable to imported intermediate inputs used in their production.
                                                          7

doubling or even tripling between 1974 and 1993. The exception to these observations is Japan,

where the share of imports in these heavy industries is lower than in overall manufacturing, and

has generally been falling. With this single exception, the increased use of imported inputs is a

characteristic feature of many industrial countries over the past two decades.


2.2 Changes in Import Prices

         The second reason why some authors have argued that international trade is not a

significant factor in explaining the movement in wages has to do with the behavior of import and

export prices. In widely cited work, Lawrence and Slaughter (1993) have shown that the

movement of prices across industries seems to contradict the movement of relative wages.10 In

order for international competition to be the cause of the fall in the relative wage of less-skilled

workers, we should see that prices of the least-skill-intensive goods – such as apparel – have

fallen relative to other goods. While relative prices for apparel goods fell in the 1970’s, they

were stable in the 1980’s (Leamer, 1998). Prices for other less-skilled-intensive goods actually

rose in the 1980’s.

         This can been seen from Table 2, which is taken from the work of Lawrence and

Slaughter (1993) and Lawrence (1994). For each country, the first row is a weighted average of

the change in manufacturing prices over the 1980s, where the weights are the industry’s share of

total manufacturing employment of nonproduction workers. The second row is again the

weighted average of the change in prices over the 1980s, but now using the industry’s share of

employment of production workers. For U.S. import prices, for example, we can see that when



10 See Slaughter (2000a) for a discussion of literature on relative-price changes.
                                                 8

industries are weighted by their production workers, the average price increase is higher than

when we weight by non-production workers. The same pattern can be seen by comparing the

rows for other industrial countries. This means that some of the industries that use the most

production – or less-skilled – workers are those with the highest price increases. This finding led

Lawrence and Slaughter (1993) to conclude that the price movements, due to international

competition, could not explain the wage movements.

       However, if we accept that industries are engaged in importing intermediate inputs, then

this suggests a different way to look at the price data. Rather that comparing prices across

different industries, depending on their skill-intensity, it now makes sense to compare import and

domestic prices within each industry. The types of goods being imported within each industry

(e.g., auto parts) are not the same as those being sold domestically (e.g., finished autos). Indeed,

as U.S. firms find imported inputs at increasingly lower prices – through outsourcing activities

that they used to do at home – we would expect to see that U.S. prices within each industry

should be rising relative to import prices. In terms of Table 2, we should be comparing the price

changes across columns rather than across rows. We see that for the United States during the

1980s it is indeed the case that domestic prices rose faster than import prices, and the same is

true for Japan and Germany. These price movements are entirely consistent with a model of

foreign outsourcing, whereby the United States and other industrial countries are continually

seeking lower-cost sources of supply. Based on this logic, there is no “contradiction” at all

between the movement of prices and relative wages.


2.3 Employment Changes Within and Between Industries

       The third piece of empirical evidence comes from decomposing the shifts in the relative

employment of less-skilled workers into those occurring within industries, and those occurring
                                                 9

between industries. According to this line of reasoning, international trade should have the effect

of moving workers between sectors, as industries expand or contract in response to foreign

competition. In contrast, new technology, such as the increased use of computers, would change

the ratio of more-skilled to less-skilled workers employed within each sector. Some evidence on

this within versus between industry distinction in contained in Table 3, which is taken from

Berman, Bound and Griliches (1994), and Bernard and Jensen (1997).

       Part A of Table 3 decomposes the change in the relative employment and relative wages

of nonproduction workers into those that occurred within and between industries. We can see

that in the period 1979-1987, the relative employment of nonproduction workers increased by

slightly more than one-half of one percent per year (0.546%), with about two-thirds of that

(0.362%) explained by within industry movements. On the wages side, the relative annual

earnings of nonproduction workers increased by about seven-tenths of a percentage point per

year (0.719%), with more than half of that change (0.410%) explained by within industry

movements. The conclusion suggested by Berman, Bound and Griliches (1994) is that trade

cannot be a dominant explanation for the wage and employment shifts, because the between

industries movements are smaller than the within industry movements.

       However, that conclusion raises the question of what is occurring within these industries,

and whether that shift could itself be related to international trade. Bernard and Jensen (1997)

have obtained some suggestive evidence on this point, by doing the same decomposition but

using plant-level data rather than industry-level data. This is shown in Part B of Table 3.

Looking again at the period 1979-1987, we can see that nearly one-half of the relative increase in

the employment of non-production workers (0.392%) occurred due to shifts between plants

(0.177%) , and more than one-half of the increase in the relative wage of non-production
                                                 10

workers (0.536%) is also explained by movements between manufacturing plants (0.315%).

Furthermore, Bernard and Jensen have found that the plants experiencing the greatest increase in

relative nonproduction employment and earnings are precisely those that are engaged in export

activity.

        The results of Bernard and Jensen provide prima facie evidence that trade has had an

impact on factor demand and wages. In order to understand what these linkages are, we present

in the next section a simple model of outsourcing, that builds upon the key insight of their

empirical work: the heterogeneity of production activities within industries.


3. A Simple Model of Outsourcing

        Of the many activities that take place within any industry, let us identify just three: the

production of an unskilled-labor intensive input, denoted by y1 ; the production of a skilled-labor

intensive input, denoted by y2, and the “bundling together” of these two goods into a finished

product. The two intermediate inputs are produced at home and also traded internationally; by

including such trade in intermediate inputs, our model therefore incorporates outsourcing or

“production sharing.” We shall simplify the analysis, however, by assuming that the production

of these two inputs and the “bundling” activity are always performed at home; thus, we are

ruling out corner solutions where one of these activities is done entirely abroad. In reality,

corner solutions such as this are very common. For example, many U.S. firms export

intermediate inputs to the maquiladora plants in Mexico, where assembly of the inputs and other
                                                        11


production activities take place there rather than in the U.S.11 A model of production sharing

that emphasizes the movement of entire activities across countries is developed by Feenstra and

Hanson (1996). Our theoretical treatment in this survey is simplified by only examining the

marginal movement of production across countries, as induced by changes in prices. Despite

this simplification, we will be able to motivate much of the empirical work in this area.

        We note that theoretical models of production sharing are only starting to take hold

within international economics: in addition to Feenstra and Hanson (1996), examples include

the papers gathered in Arndt and Keirzkowski (2001), as well as Kim and Mieszkowski (1995),

Leamer (1996), Xu (2000), Yi (2000), and Marjit and Acharyya (forthcoming).12 This concept is

also used in economic sociology (Gereffi and Korzeniewicz, 1994), geography (Dicken et al,

2001; Yeung, 2001) and other social sciences, where production sharing is referred to by the

more general name “commodity chains.” A commodity chain consists of the sequence of

activities involved in the manufacture of a product, from initial development through to

production, marketing and sales, especially as these activities cross international boundaries. In

these disciplines, commodity chains are seen as an integral part of the development process for

countries that are still industrializing, i.e. a country’s position in the commodity chain will

impact its standard of living. While we will be taking a less grand view, it will still be the case

in our simplified model that production sharing has a substantial impact on wages.



11 For a discussion of the Mexican maquiladora, see Feenstra and Hanson (1997). The export of inputs from the
U.S. for assembly overseas also occurs in other countries under the U.S. “offshore assembly” program: see
Feenstra, Hanson and Swenson (2000).
12 Other models that emphasize the movement of production activities across countries in a product-cycle
framework, and the effect on wages, include Dinopoulos and Segerstrom (1999), Glass and Saggi (2001) and Zhu
(2000a), with corresponding empirical work by Zhu (2000b). The reader is also referred to the collection of papers
in the June 2001 issue of the Journal of International Economics, 54(1).
                                                  12

       We will suppose that the two inputs yi, i=1,2, are each produced using unskilled labor

(Li), skilled labor (Hi), and capital (Ki), with concave and linearly homogeneous production

functions,

                                       yi = fi(Li, Hi, Ki),   i=1,2.                           (1)


For example, the unskilled-labor intensive input y1 might represent the activities done within a

factory, while the skilled-labor intensive input y2 might represent the research and development

activities within the industry, as well as marketing and after-sales service. These are both

needed to produce the final manufacturing product. But some of the activities done within the

factory can instead be outsourced, i.e. imported from abroad; and conversely, the services

associated with research, development and marketing can be exported to support production

activities abroad. We therefore let x1 < 0 denote the imports of input 1, and x2 > 0 denote the

exports of input 2. For convenience, we choose the exported intermediate input as the

numeraire, so we will hold this price fixed (at unity), and let p denote the price of the imported

input x1.

       The production of the final manufacturing good is given by ym = fm(y1-x1, y2-x2), where

this production function “bundles together” the amounts of goods 1 and 2 available, and is also

concave and linearly homogeneous. We ignore any additional labor and capital inputs used in

this bundling activity, so that the total factor usage in the manufacturing industry is,


                       L1+L2 = Lm,     H1+H2 = Hm, K1+K2 = Km .                                (2)
                                                         13

       We can now solve for the optimal output in the industry, which includes the three

activities. With perfect competition, the value of output from the final good, plus net trade, will

be maximized subject to the resource constraints:


                                        max
       Fm(Lm, Hm, Km, pm, p) ≡                         pmfm(y1-x1, y2-x2) + px1 + x2 ,   (3)
                                 x i , Li , H i ,K i

                                                       subject to (1), (2),


where pm is the price of the final good, and p is the price of the imported intermediate input.

Note that the optimization problem in (3) does not require that trade is balanced on an industry-

by-industry basis, i.e. we do not require that px1 + x2 = 0. Of course, there will be some balance

of trade constraint for the economy overall, but we ignore that here. The value of the industry

production function in (3) can be thought of as value-added for the industry, i.e. nominal output

including exports x2 less the value of intermediate inputs px1.

       Problem (3) can be easily illustrated, as in Figure 3, where we show the production

possibility frontier between inputs 1 and 2, and several isoquants of the final good ym. For the

purpose of illustration we now add the extra condition that trade in the inputs is balanced (px1 +

x2 = 0), so that the output of the final good is maximized on the isoquant that is tangent to the

balanced trade line. At initial prices, for example, the industry produces inputs at A, and then

trades to B. With a drop in the relative price of the imported input, the industry shifts production

towards the skilled-labor intensive activity at A’, and then trades to B’, obtaining a higher output

ym. All this will look very familiar to most readers: the only special feature of Figure 3 is that

we think of these activities taking place within a single manufacturing industry.
                                                              14

        The function Fm(Lm, Hm, Km, pm, p) is linearly homogeneous in prices, so we can

alternatively write it as pmFm(Lm, Hm, Km, 1, p/ pm). Thus, a natural measure of real value-added

or real output is,


                               Ym ≡ Fm(Lm, Hm, Km, 1, p/pm) .                                  (4)


This measure of output is nearly the same as ym, except it now includes net exports. Provided

that the underlying production functions fi, i=1,2,m, are increasing and concave, then the

function Fm will also be increasing and concave in (Lm, Hm, Km). We can think of Fm as an

“aggregate production function” for the industry.

        The difficulty with using this “aggregate production function” for any empirical or

theoretical work is that it implicitly holds fixed the level of labor and capital used in the industry,

i.e. at those levels given by the constraints in (2). Instead, we would like to think of labor, and

possibly capital too, as being optimally adjusted in response to changes in factor prices. To

reflect this, we make use of the cost function that is dual to (4). First, we can define a short-run

cost function, obtained when the level of capital and output are fixed:


                                                     min
                Cm(w, q, Km, Ym, p/pm) ≡                      wLm + qHm , subject to (4),      (5)
                                                   L m ,H m



where w is the wage of unskilled labor and q is the wage of skilled labor. Alternatively, we can

define a long-run cost function, obtained when labor and capital are both chosen optimally:


                                        min
        Cm(w, q, r, Ym, p/pm) ≡                    wLm + qHm + rKm, subject to (4).            (6)
                                    L m ,H m K m



where r is the rental on capital.
                                                            15

        Both of these cost functions have been used empirically, as we discuss in the following

sections. Before turning to this material, however, it is well worth exploring a few theoretical

properties. In particular, if we add the condition that marginal cost equals product prices, and

then allow prices to change, what will be the impact on factor prices? In Figure 3, for example,

we showed how a fall in the relative price of imports p would raise final output ym, but what is

the corresponding impact on factor prices? In the remainder of this section we explore this

question theoretically, making use of the long-run version of the cost function.

        If both types of labor and capital are being optimally chosen for the industry overall, as in

(6), then they must also be optimally chosen within each of the activities i=1,2. So consistent

with (6), we can also define the long-run cost functions for the disaggregate activities within the

industry:

                                       min
                Ci(w, q, r, Yi) ≡                   wLi + qHi + rKi , subject to (1), for i=1,2.   (7)
                                    Li ,H i , K i



Since the activity production functions in (1) are assumed to be linearly homogeneous, then the

activity-level cost functions in (7) will be homogeneous of degree one in Yi. This implies they

can be written as Ci(w, q, r, Yi) = Yi ci(w, q, r), where ci(w, q, r) is the unit-cost function (equal

to marginal cost or average cost).

        Then the zero-profit conditions for activities 1 and 2 can be written as:

                        p = c1(w, q, r),                  1 = c2(w, q, r),                         (8)


These conditions must hold in order for the locally produced inputs yi, i=1,2, to be competitive

with those available from abroad, at the prices p and unity, respectively. Totally differentiating
                                                          16

(8) using the familiar Jones’ (1963) algebra, we can express the percentage change in factor

prices ŵ , q̂, and r̂ as functions of the percentage change in the import price p̂ :


                 p̂ = θ1L ŵ + θ1H q̂ + θ1K r̂ ,       0 = θ 2 L ŵ + θ 2 H q̂ + θ 2 K r̂ ,     (9)


where θij is the cost-share of factor j in activity i, with ∑j θij = 1. Treating the change in the

import price p̂ as exogenous, (9) gives two equations with which to determine three unknown

factor prices changes – ŵ , q̂, and r̂ . In general, these factor price changes will be difficult to pin

down with only two equations. In terms of Figure 3, when production shifts towards the skilled

labor intensive activity, from A to A’, we do not know in general how factor prices are affected.

But there are some simplifying assumptions we can make which allow us to determine these.


Case 1 – Equal Cost Shares of Capital

        As in Feenstra and Hanson (1996), we can assume that capital has equal cost shares in

the two industries, so that θ1K = θ2K. Using this, we take the difference between the two

equations in (9) to obtain,

                 p̂ = (θ1L − θ 2 L ) ŵ + (θ1H − θ 2 H ) q̂ = (θ1L − θ 2 L )( ŵ − q̂ ) ,       (10)


where the second equality follows since with equal cost shares of capital, the total cost shares of

labor are also equal, so that (θ1L + θ1H) = (θ2L + θ2H) ⇒ (θ1L - θ2L) = -(θ1H - θ2H). With activity

1 assumed to be unskilled-labor intensive, we have that (θ1L - θ2L) > 0. Thus, (10) says that a

decrease in the price of imported intermediate input, p̂ < 0 , leads to a decrease in the relative

wage of unskilled labor, ( ŵ − q̂ ) = p̂ /(θ1L − θ 2 L ) < 0.
                                                   17

        These results are illustrated in Figure 4, where we graph the iso-curves of p = c1(w,q,r)

and 1 = c2(w, q, r). With the wages of unskilled and skilled labor labeled on the axis, we are

implicitly holding fixed the rental on capital, r. Now suppose that there is a fall in the price p of

activity 1, which is unskilled labor intensive. In Figure 4, this will shift inwards the iso-cost line

of that activity, and as shown, will lead to a fall in the relative wage of unskilled labor (from A to

B). There will be some additional change in the rental on capital, but under our assumption of

equal cost share of capital in the two industries, this will lead to an equi-proportional shift in the

two iso-cost curves and therefore have no further effect on the relative wage. Thus, the drop in

the price of the imported inputs leads to a fall in the relative wage (w/q) of unskilled labor.

        We can also ask what happens to the price of the final good pm. Let cm(p, 1) denote the

unit-cost function that is dual to fm(y1, y2), where recall that the price of activity 2 is unity. Then

the price of the final good satisfies pm = cm(p, 1), so that p̂ m = θ m1p̂ , where θm1 is the cost-share

of input 1 in the final product. Thus, with a fall in the price of imported inputs, p̂ < 0 , the price

of the final good also falls but by less, p̂ < p̂ m < 0. Stated differently, the price of the final good

relative to imported inputs rises, p̂ m − p̂ > 0. This in fact is what happened in the U.S. and other

industrial countries, as shown in Table 2, where the change in domestic prices exceeds the

change in import prices over 1980-1990. Our theoretical model therefore confirms that this price

movement is consistent with the fall in the relative wage of unskilled labor.


Case 2 – The Unskilled-Labor Intensive Activity is also Capital Intensive

        A second case, emphasized by Sachs and Shatz (1998), is where activity 1 uses more

unskilled labor, (θ1L - θ2L) > 0, and also more capital, (θ1K - θ2K) > 0; think of factory production,

for example. They suppose that the price of the imported input is constant, p̂ = 0, but that the
                                                            18


rental price on capital increases, r̂ > 0, because capital is leaving the country. In Figure 5, this

will lead to an inward shift in both iso-cost curves, but since activity 1 uses more capital, a

larger shift in that curve. Thus, the factor-price equilibrium will shift from A to B in Figure 5,

where the wage of unskilled labor has fallen. We are not sure whether the wage of skilled labor

rises or falls, but in any case, we obtain a fall in the relative wage (w/q) of unskilled labor.13

Intuitively, because activity 1 uses both unskilled labor and capital intensively, when capital

leaves it is then unskilled labor that suffers. In this case, the cause of the change in wages is an

outflow of capital from the country.14

         Notice that the change in relative wages occurs without any change in the price of the

imported input or the final good. We might expect, though, that there will be some impact on the

price of a nontraded good. Denoting the zero-profit condition for a nontraded good by pn =

cn(w,q), we can totally differentiate this expression to obtain:


                                      p̂ n = θ nL ŵ + θ nH q̂ ,                                                 (11)

where θnj is the cost-share of factor j=L,K. For simplicity, we assume the nontraded good uses

no capital in production. In terms of Figure 5, the nontraded good would have an additional iso-

cost line (not drawn) that goes through both points A and B. The question we wish to determine




13 To verify this, use p̂ = 0 in (9) and then solve for ŵ and q̂ as: ŵ = − r̂ (θ2Hθ1K - θ1Hθ2K)/(θ1Lθ2H - θ1Hθ2L), and

q̂ = r̂ (θ2Lθ1K - θ1Lθ2K)/( θ1Lθ2H - θ1Hθ2L). Combining these, we readily obtain ŵ - q̂ = − r̂ (θ1K - θ2K)/(θ1Lθ2H -
θ1Hθ2L) , which is negative when r̂ > 0 under our assumptions that activity 1 is intensive in both unskilled labor and
capital.
14 Sachs and Shatz (1998, pp. 220-221) emphasize that this capital outflow need not be foreign direct investment,
in which a domestic firms takes ownership of capital abroad. Rather, the domestic capital could simply be sold to a
foreign firm (which would not show up as foreign direct investment).
                                                   19

is whether the change in factor prices from A to B implies an increase or a decrease in the price

of the nontraded good.

        To answer this, let us consider two extreme cases: where the non-traded good uses only

unskilled labor, or only skilled labor. In the first case, the iso-cost line for the nontraded good

would be vertical in Figure 5, i.e. each level of the unskilled wage w would correspond to a

unique value for costs cn(w). In that case, the movement of the factor-price equilibrium from A

to B would require a shift in the iso-cost line of the non-traded good to the left, and a

corresponding fall in the price of the nontraded good (exactly like the fall in unskilled wages).

Alternatively, if the nontraded good uses only skilled labor, then its iso-cost line would be

horizontal in Figure 5, so that each level of the skilled wage q corresponds to a unique value for

costs cn(q). In this case, we are unsure whether the movement of the equilibrium from A to B

implies a rise or fall in the price of the nontraded good. If the iso-cost line of activity 1 shifts

down sufficiently more (i.e. activity 1 is much more capital intensive than activity 2), then it is

visually apparent that point B would imply a higher wage for skilled labor, and a higher price for

the nontraded good if it uses enough of this factor. In fact, Sachs and Shatz (1998) argue for the

U.S. that nontraded goods are indeed skilled-labor intensive relative to manufacturing overall. In

that case, the exit of capital, and increase in the relative wage of skilled labor, can be expected to

lead to a rise in the price of the nontraded good. Conversely, if the nontraded good is more

unskilled-labor intensive, then its price will fall.

        The evidence for the U.S. is that skilled-labor intensive nontradables experienced a rise

in price during the 1980s, whereas unskilled-labor intensive nontradables experienced a fall in

prices, consistent with these theoretical predictions. As we shall discuss in section 4.3, Harrigan

and Balaban (1999) and Harrigan (2000) find that these changes in nontradables prices are
                                                 20

highly correlated with change in relative wages, but this leaves open the question of causality:

are the prices of nontradables driving the relative wages or, as we have suggested here, are the

relative wages driving the prices of nontradables? We have shown that the exit of capital in an

open economy can quite plausibly have the effect of raising both the relative wage of skilled

labor and the price of skill-intensive nontradables, and lowering both the relative wage of

unskilled labor and the price of unskilled-intensive nontradables, which is consistent with

evidence for the U.S. during the 1980s.


4. Results from Empirical Studies

       Summarizing our argument so far, the decision of companies to purchase intermediate

inputs from overseas will most certainly affect their employment at home, and can be expected

to differentially affect skilled versus unskilled workers. With firms in industrial countries facing

a higher relative wage for unskilled labor than that found abroad, the activities that are

outsourced would be those that use a large amount of unskilled labor, such as assembly of

components and other repetitive tasks. Moving these activities overseas will reduce the relative

demand for unskilled labor in the industrial country, in much the same way as replacing these

workers with automated production. This means that outsourcing has a qualitatively similar

effect on reducing the relative demand for unskilled labor within an industry as does skilled-

biased technological change, such as the increased use of computers. Thus, determining which

of these is most important is an empirical question. We will examine three methods that have

been used to estimate the effects of trade versus technological change on wages and

employment.
                                                              21


4.1 Estimation of Demand for Skilled Labor

       The first empirical method estimates industry production functions, such as (4), and

attempts to determine which factors affect the relative demand for skilled labor. The starting

point is to consider the short-run cost function that is dual to the industry production function,

Cm(w, q, Km, Ym, p/pm), as derived in (5). Notice that we have included the relative price of

imported inputs in this cost function, since it also appears in the production function (4). More

generally, any structural variables that shift the production function and therefore affect costs

should be included as arguments. We will denote these variables by the vector z; in addition to

the price of imported inputs, this can include expenditures on computers and other new types of

capital equipment. We therefore rewrite the cost function in (5) as Cm(w, q, Km, Ym, z).

       The next step is to choose a functional form for costs. A convenient choice is the

translog cost function, which was introduced by Diewert (1974, p. 139) and initially used in the

international trade literature by Kohli (1978, 1991). This function is written in a general notation

as,

                             I                          K                    I    I

where wi denotes the wages of the optimally chosen inputs i=1,…,I, and xk denotes either the

quantities of the fixed inputs or outputs k=1,…,K, or any other shift parameters. In terms of the

cost function in (11), there are just two optimally chosen factors – skilled and unskilled labor –
                                                         22

while capital and output are treated as fixed in the short run. In order to ensure that the cost

function in (12) is linearly homogeneous in wages, we impose the requirements,15


                            I                    I            I
                           ∑ αi = 1     and     ∑ γ ij = ∑ γ ij = 0.                                        (13)
                           i =1                 i =1        j=1



         The usefulness of the translog function comes from computing its first derivatives,

∂lnC/∂lnwi = (∂C/∂wi)(wi/C). Because ∂C/∂wi equals the demand for the chosen input i, it

follows that (∂C/∂wi)(wi/C) equals the payments to factor i relative to total costs, which we

denote by the cost-shares si. Thus, differentiating (12) with respect to ln wi , we obtain,


                                        I               K
                           s i = α i + ∑ γ ij ln w j + ∑ φ ik ln x k , i=1,…,I.                             (14)
                                       j=1             k =1



Given annual data on factor cost shares, wages, and fixed inputs and outputs, this set of linear

equations can be estimated over time for a given industry to obtain the coefficients γij and φik.16

Alternatively, the equations can be estimated for a single year, or the change between two years,

by pooling data across industries. In the latter case, we are assuming that the same cost function

applies across the industries. Despite this strong assumption, the cross-industry approach is

popular and we shall follow it here.




15 Without loss of generality, we also impose the symmetry restrictions γij = γji and δjk = δkj.
16 Generally, the dependent variables in the system (14) sum to unity, which means that one of the equations can be
derived from the others. Under these conditions, one of the equations is dropped before the system (14) is
estimated. In addition, the cross-equation symmetry restrictions γij = γji , and homogeneity restrictions Σj γij =0,
should be tested, and imposed if accepted. Additional tests can be used to check that the estimated cost function is
concave in wages.

       Returning now to the notation Cm(w, q, Km, Ym, z), we have two chosen inputs – skilled

and unskilled labor. Focusing on the share equation for skilled labor, it will depend on wages for

both types of labor, as well capital, output, and all other structural variables, z. When (14) is

estimated by pooling data across industries, as in Berman, Bound and Griliches (1994) for

example, it is felt the cross-industry variation in wages has little information: wages differ

across industries principally due to quality-variation of workers, so we do not expect high-wage

industries to economize on those (high-quality) workers. Accordingly, the wage terms are

typically dropped from the right of (14) when pooling data across industries. This leaves just

fixed capital, output, and other structural variables. Taking the difference between two years, the

estimation equation for the wage-share of skilled labor (sHm) in industries m=1,…,M becomes:


                ∆s Hm = φ0 + φ K ∆ ln K m + φ Y ∆ ln Ym + φz ' ∆z m , m=1,…,M,               (15)


where zm denotes the vector of structural variables that shift costs, and φm is the corresponding

vector of coefficients. In particular, when the wage-share of skilled labor is increasing, we are

interested in determining how much of that increase is due to changes in capital, output, and the

structural variables.

       Estimates of (15) for 447 industries within the U.S. manufacturing sector, over 1979-

1990, are shown in Table 4. The data are from the NBER Productivity Database (Bartelsman

and Gray, 1996, which is available at http://www.nber.org/nberces/). In these regressions we use

nonproduction labor as a proxy for skilled labor, so the dependent variable is the change in the

share of nonproduction labor in total wages within each industry. Over all manufacturing

industries, the nonproduction wage share increased from 35.4% to 42.4% between 1979 and

1990, for an annual growth of 0.4% per year.
                                                           24

         The specifications in Table 4 are similar to those in Berman, Bound and Griliches (1994),

Autor, Katz and Krueger (1998), and Feenstra and Hanson (1999). They include as regressors

the shipments of each industry (as a proxy for output), the capital/shipments ratio, foreign

outsourcing (imported intermediate inputs as a share of total materials purchases), the shares of

computers and other high-tech capital in the total capital stock, and the share of expenditures on

computers in total investment. The share of computers and other high-tech capital in the total capital

stock is constructed using either ex post rental prices, or ex ante rental prices.17 In contrast, the share

of computer spending in investment is obtained from the Census of Manufactures, which simply

asked firms to report what percentage of new investment was devoted to computers. This variable

has been used previously by Berman, Bound and Griliches (1994) and Autor, Katz and Krueger

(1998). We feel that measuring computers as a share of the total capital stock is preferable. All

variables are at the industry level and all, except the computer investment share, are measured as

annual changes. All regressions are weighted by the industry share of the total manufacturing wage

bill.

         In column (1) of Table 4, we report the mean values of the dependent and independent

variables for 1979-1990, and, following this, the regression coefficients in columns (2)-(4).

Each regression uses alternative measures of the computer and other high-technology shares. In

all the regressions, we see that outsourcing has a positive impact on the nonproduction share of




17 Multiplying the ex post rental price of each capital asset in an industry times the stock of that asset, and
summing over all types of capital, equals observed payments to capital (i.e. value of shipments less payments to
labor and materials). The share of computers in the capital stock is measured by taking the computer stock times its
rental price, divided by the sum over all assets of each asset stock times its rental price. The ex ante rental prices are
constructed by omitting capital gains on each asset, and using a “safe” rate of return. See Feenstra and Hanson
(1999) for further details on these rental prices and the computer and other high-tech shares.
                                                         25

the wage bill, as does the computer share. By multiplying the regression coefficients by the

mean values for the change in each variable, we obtain the contributions of each to the total

change in the nonproduction wage share, shown in column (5). We see that outsourcing

accounts for 15-24% of the shift towards nonproduction labor.18

         The results for computers depend on the specification. Measuring computer services and

other high-tech capital as a share of the capital stock, using ex post rental prices, we see they

account for 13% of the shift towards nonproduction labor. Measuring these shares using ex ante

rental prices, we see that that computers and other high-tech capital explain only 8% of this shift.

In both cases, the contribution of computers and other high-tech capital is less than the

contribution of outsourcing. In contrast, when computers are measured by their share of

investment (and the high-technology capital share is also included), we see that these variables

account for 31% of the shift toward nonproduction labor, which exceeds the contribution of

outsourcing. Thus, whether outsourcing is more or less important than computers depends of

whether the latter are measured as a share of the capital stock, or as a share of investment. It is

fair to conclude that both these variables are important explanations of the shift towards

nonproduction labor, with their exact magnitudes depending on how they are measured.

         In related work, Morrison Paul and Siegel (2000) find a negative correlation between the

demand for less-educated labor and high-tech capital, R&D investment, imports (as a share of

output), and service purchases (i.e., domestic outsourcing), and a positive correlation between




18 Autor, Katz, and Krueger (1998) obtain smaller estimates for the impact of outsourcing on the nonproduction
wage share. This appears to be due to the fact that they also include as regressors industry measures of imports and
exports, which are highly correlated with imported intermediate inputs.
                                                26

the demand for more-educated labor and high-tech capital, R&D investment, and imports. Their

estimated impact of high-tech capital and R&D investment on skill upgrading is greater than that

for imports or domestic outsourcing of services.

       From these results, it appears that foreign outsourcing from U.S. manufacturing is

associated with the increased relative demand for skilled labor, as predicted by the theory

outlined in section 3. One important question is what form this outsourcing takes. It may occur

through foreign direction investment (FDI), as multinationals move production of parts and

components or product assembly abroad, or it may occur through a shift in contracting practices,

in which firms replace domestic production of intermediate inputs with imports purchased from

arms-length suppliers located abroad. The first case appears to be consistent with what has

occurred in the U.S. automobile and semiconductor industries, while the second case appears to

be consistent with what has occurred in the U.S. footwear and personal-computer industries.

       Slaughter (2000b) finds that during the 1980’s FDI was not an important channel for

moving U.S. jobs abroad or for skill upgrading at home. Between 1977 and 1989, employment

in majority-owned affiliates of U.S. multinational enterprises (MNEs) fell, as it did in the U.S.

parents of these plants. Similar to U.S. manufacturing plants, affiliates of U.S. MNEs spent the

1980’s shifting employment towards nonproduction workers and raising the capital intensity of

production. Slaughter estimates a specification similar to (15), in which he includes as

regressors shipments, the capital/shipments ratio, and the ratio of economic activity in foreign

affiliates of U.S. MNEs to economic activity in U.S. manufacturing plants. The last variable

captures the extent to which U.S. MNEs are transferring production abroad. For several

measures of economic activity in foreign affiliates, there is a weak negative correlation between

the change in the nonproduction wage share and the change in foreign production transfer by
                                                        27

U.S. MNEs. Combined with the results in Feenstra and Hanson (1999), these results suggest that

FDI is not the means through which outsourcing has induced skill upgrading in U.S.

manufacturing.19 In related work, Blonigen and Slaughter (1999) find that inward FDI in U.S.

manufacturing during the 1980’s, such as the construction of Japanese auto plants and other

facilities, also did not contribute to skill upgrading in U.S. manufacturing industries.20

        The United States is by no means the only country that engages in outsourcing. Many

European nations are outsourcing, as well as industrialized Asian countries including Japan,

Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan (Ng and Yeats, 1999). In one study for the United Kingdom,

Anderton and Brenton (1997) measure outsourcing by imports from low-wage countries. They

find that such imports can account for about 40% of the rise in the wage bill of skilled workers

of 1970-83, and approximately one-third of their increase in relative employment.

        Over the last several decades, Japan has steadily moved production activities abroad,

investing in both low-income and high-income countries. For firms in the Japanese electronics

industry, overseas employment now greatly exceeds employment in Japan. These production

shifts have coincided with skill upgrading at home. Since the early 1970’s Japanese

manufacturing industries have had a steady increase in the relative employment and relative total

compensation of more-educated workers. Applying a specification similar to (15) to data on

Japanese manufacturing plants over the period 1965-1990, Head and Ries (2000) find a strong



19 This finding may be driven by the fact that through the 1980’s U.S. MNEs continued to concentrate their foreign
operations in OECD countries, where their production activities are similar to those in U.S. manufacturing plants.
During the 1990’s, this pattern began to change, as FDI by U.S. MNEs shifted towards emerging economies.
Future foreign production transfer by U.S. MNEs may then be associated with skill upgrading in the United States.
See Blomstrom, Fors, and Lipsey (1997) and Lipsey (1999).
20 See also Brainard and Riker (1997) and Riker and Brainard (1997). Lipsey (1994) and Feliciano and Lipsey
(1999) discusses employment and compensation practices of foreign MNEs in the United States.

positive correlation between the change in a firm’s nonproduction wage share and the change in

a firm’s share of employment in low-income countries. This suggests that as Japanese

manufacturing firms move production to low-wage countries they raise the skill intensity and the

demand for skilled labor at home. The correlation between the nonproduction wage share and

the employment share in high-income countries, in contrast, is statistically insignificant in most

cases.21

        During the 1960’s and 1970’s, Hong Kong produced and exported labor-intensive

manufactures, such as apparel, textiles, footwear, toys, and consumer electronics. Since China

began to open its economy to foreign trade and investment in the late 1970’s, Hong Kong has

begun to specialize in business services related to trade and investment in China. Over the last

two decades, many Hong Kong manufacturing firms have moved their production facilities to

China, and to the neighboring province of Guandong in particular, which they manage from

headquarters in Hong Kong (Sung, 1997). Hong Kong firms typically supply plants in China

with raw materials and often ship the goods through Hong Kong for final processing before

exporting them to a final destination. As Hong Kong has shifted production to China,

manufacturing has become a less important part of the Hong Kong economy, declining from

24% of GDP in 1980 to 7% of GDP in 1996 (Enright et al., 1997).

        Hsieh and Woo (1999) find that outsourcing from Hong Kong to China has been

associated with an increase in the relative demand for skilled labor in Hong Kong. Between



21 Head and Ries also find that when Japanese firms move production to low-income countries they raise input
purchases from these countries, but when they move production to high-income countries they do not. One
interpretation of these results is that when Japanese firms move production to low-wage countries they mainly
outsource low-skill tasks, which raises skill intensity at home, but when they move production to high-wage
                                                       29

1981 and 1996, both the relative wage and relative supply of more-educated workers rose in

Hong Kong, which suggests that there was an increase in the relative demand for skilled labor.

The extent of skill upgrading in Hong Kong manufacturing was dramatic. The share of

nonproduction workers in Hong Kong manufacturing employment rose from 13.1% in 1976 to

47.0% in 1996. Outsourcing to China appears to be an important contributing factor to this

employment shift. Using a regression similar to (15), Hsieh and Woo find a strong positive

correlation between the nonproduction wage share and imports from China (expressed as the

ratio of industry imports from China to either industry absorption or total materials purchases)

for Hong Kong industries. Over the period 1976-1996, outsourcing to China can account for 45-

60% of the increase in the nonproduction wage share in Hong Kong manufacturing.

        Outsourcing may also raise the relative demand for skilled labor in the country to which

production is transferred. In Feenstra and Hanson (1996), firms in the skill-abundant North use

firms in the nonskill-abundant South to produce intermediate inputs. Assuming wages differ

between nations, the North specializes in high-skill tasks and the South specializes in low-skill

tasks. If Northern firms outsource production to the South, they will choose to move the least

skill-intensive activities that they perform. By moving these activities to the South, the average

skill intensity of production rises in the North. The same also happens in the South, since the

South initially specializes in the most low-skill tasks. Thus, outsourcing from the North to the

South raises the relative demand and so the relative earnings of high-skilled workers in both

countries, contributing to a global increase in wage inequality.




countries they tend to replicate production activities done at home, which may lower employment in Japan but does
not change skill intensity.

         During the 1980’s Mexico, liberalized foreign investment and trade and experienced an

increase in the relative wage of skilled labor (Hanson and Harrison, 1999). In the period

following reform, FDI in Mexico was concentrated in foreign assembly plants, known as

maquiladoras, most of which are located in Mexican states along the U.S. border. These

assembly plants are created, in most cases, by U.S. firms outsourcing unskilled-labor intensive

production activities to Mexico. Feenstra and Hanson (1997) find that for the period 1975-1988

the shift in Mexican manufacturing towards foreign assembly plants can account for 45% of the

observed increase in the country’s nonproduction wage share.22

         Outsourcing changes the relative wage by inducing an outward shift in the relative

demand for skilled labor. An alternative view is that international trade changes factor prices by

flattening labor demand curves, making them more elastic. Leamer (1998) presents an extreme

version of this story, in which the transition of an economy from autarky to trade transforms an

economy’s labor demand curve from being downward sloping to being horizontal, at least over

sections that correspond to diversified production. Extending this logic, Rodrik (1997) identifies

several mechanism through which greater economic integration between countries may make

labor demand curves flatter. In one of the few attempts to test this hypothesis, Slaughter (2001)

estimates the own-price elasticity of labor demand for production and nonproduction workers in

two-digit U.S. manufacturing industries over the period 1960-1991. Over the entire sample,

demand became more elastic for production labor, but not for nonproduction labor. The sectors




22 Their estimation equation is based on Feenstra and Hanson (1996), and differs somewhat from that in (15). In
this specification, the level of foreign assembly activities is treated as an endogenous variable.
                                                     31

with the largest increase in elasticities were food and tobacco, apparel and textiles, wood and

paper, and primary and fabricated metals, which include some of the least-skill intensive

manufacturing industries. The demand for production labor became more elastic in industries

with more outsourcing, more investment in computers, and more investment in high-tech capital

overall. These results are robust to controls for industry fixed effects but not time fixed effects,

suggesting that changes in labor-demand elasticities are dominated by a trend component.


4.2 Estimation of Zero-Profit Conditions

       In the second empirical method, we drop the short-run framework that was used above,

and instead suppose that capital can be adjusted along with skilled and unskilled labor. The

industry cost function is then written as in (6), which is re-expressed as:


                                        min
       Cm(wm, qm, rm, Ym, p/pm) ≡                  wmLm + qmHm + rmKm, subject to (4).        (16)
                                    L m ,H m K m



Notice that in (16) we have allowed the factor prices wm, qm, and rm to differ across the industries

m=1,…,M. This reflects the empirical fact that factor prices, and wages in particular, do differ

across industries (Krueger and Summers, 1988); this will turn out to be important in what

follows. As before, the relative price of imported inputs enters this cost function because it also

appears in the production function (4); we will replace this by the vector zm, which includes

other structural variables. Since the production function (4) is linearly homogeneous in inputs,

then we can rewrite the cost function in (16) as,


                       Cm(wm, qm, rm, Ym, zm) = Ym cm(wm, qm, rm, zm) ,                       (16’)


where cm(wm, qm, rm, zm) denotes the unit-cost function.
                                                         32

         The zero-profit conditions in the industries are therefore expressed as,


                           pm = cm(wm, qm, rm, zm) ,           m=1,…,M .                                    (17)


In our theoretical model of section 3, we examined how changes in product prices would affect

factor prices. Now, however, the presence of the structural variables zm mean that the changes in

prices reflect more than just changes in factor prices. Indeed, taking the difference between

these, we can define total factor productivity in the industry as,


                           TFPm ≡ ( θ mL ŵ m + θ mH q̂ m + θ mK r̂m ) − p̂ m ,                             (18)


where the cost-shares of the three factors sum to unity, θmL + θmH + θmK = 1. Productivity

improvements mean that factor prices can rise more than product prices (or conversely, that

product prices can fall further). Note that (18) is the “dual” definition of productivity, and

empirically it is very close to the “primal” definition, which is the growth in output minus a

weighted average of the growth in inputs. In either case, we should think of changes in the

structural variables zm as the underlying cause of changes in productivity.23

         Shuffling the terms in (18) slightly, and replacing the instantaneous change in prices with

discrete changes like ∆ln pm, we obtain the equation,




23 We convert (18) to a discrete-time formula by replacing the instantaneous changes by the change in log prices
between two years. In that case, we need to be specific about the year in which the factor shares are measured. A
preferred method is to use the arithmetic average of the factor cost-shares in the two years, and this formulation is
called the Tornqvist index of productivity. Caves, Christensen and Diewert (1982a,b) show that the Tornqvist index
is a valid measure of Hicks-neutral or factor-biased productivity change – i.e., it is valid even when the shift
parameters in the translog production or cost function have a non-neutral impact on factor demands.
                                                 33



        ∆ ln p m = −TFPm + θ mL ∆ ln w m + θ mH ∆ ln q m + θ mK ∆ ln rm , m=1,…,M.          (19)


We consider estimating (19) as a linear regression across industries, where the data are the

change in log prices, productivity, and the factor cost-shares, while the change in factor-prices

are estimated as regression coefficients. That is, we estimate the implied change in factor-prices

ωL, ωH, and ωK from the regression:


               ∆ ln p m = −TFPm + θ mL ω L + θ mH ω H + θ mK ω K + ε m , m=1,…,M.           (20)


where εm is an error term, specified more fully below. We interpret the coefficients ωL, ωH, and

ωK as the change in factor prices that are mandated by the change in product prices, which is the

dependent variable in (19). Baldwin and Hilton (1984) were among the first to estimate a price

regression like (20). Recent applications include Sachs and Shatz (1994), Baldwin and Cain

(1997), Krueger (1997), Leamer (1998), Feenstra and Hanson (1999), and Slaughter (2000b).

       Estimates of (20) for 447 U.S. manufacturing industries, over 1979-1990, are provided in

Table 5. The dependent variable is the log change in the industry output price over the period,

divided by the number of sample years to obtain an annualized difference. We use the primal

measure of TFP, expressed as an annualized difference. The other independent variables are the

average cost-shares (over the first and last year for the period) for production labor,

nonproduction labor, and capital; the materials cost share times the log change in materials

prices; and the energy cost share times the log change in energy prices.

       In columns (1) and (2), we constrain the coefficients on the materials share times the

materials price and the energy share times the energy price to be unity, which transforms the

dependent variable to be the log change in value-added prices. This approximates the
                                                   34

specification in Leamer (1998). In column (1), the coefficients on the labor shares imply a

decrease in the nonproduction-production wage gap, since the nonproduction-production relative

wages is mandated to change by 2.30%-3.06% = -0.76% per year, which is consistent with the

results in Leamer (1998). In fact, the nonproduction-production wage gap rose by 0.74% per

year (actual annual average changes in factor prices are shown in column (5) of Table 5). In

column (2), we follow Sachs and Shatz (1994) and drop the office-equipment industry (SIC

3573), which reverses the predicted change in wage inequality. Now, nonproduction wages are

mandated to rise by 1.5% per year more than production wages. In column (3), we approximate

Krueger’s (1997) specification by dropping TFP as a regressor, while estimating coefficients on

materials and energy. There is again a mandated rise in the nonproduction-production wage gap,

but one that is much larger than the actual increase in relative wages.

        The estimates in Table 5 are troubling because they show that slight changes in the data,

such as dropping the office-equipment industry, have a dramatic effects on the results. While it

is true that office equipment is an outlier, the sensitivity of the results to the specification

suggests that something more basic is going on. To address this, let us ask: why do the

estimates of ωL, ωH, and ωK from (20) differ at all from the actual average change in

manufacturing wages (shown in column (5)), which we denote by ∆ ln w, ∆ ln q, and ∆ ln r ?

The overbar indicates that we are averaging the change in factor-prices over all manufacturing

industries. By just comparing (19) and (20), it seems that there should be some close

connection between the estimates ωL, ωH, and ωK and these average actual factor price changes,

but we need to uncover what this connection is.

        To achieve this, let us make the transition from (19) to an estimating equation more

carefully. First, notice that we can rewrite (19) as,
                                                       35



                 ∆ ln p m = −TFPm + θmL ∆ ln w + θmH ∆ ln q + θ mK ∆ ln r + ε m                        (19’)
where,

         ε m ≡ θ mL ( ∆ ln w − ∆ ln w m ) + θ mH ( ∆ ln q − ∆ ln q m ) + θ mK ( ∆ ln r − ∆ ln rm ) .   (20’)


Thus, we replace the industry wage changes on the right of (19) by the average wage changes,

and incorporate the difference between these two into an error term. In economic terms, εm

reflects interindustry wage differentials – i.e., the difference between wages paid in each industry

and the manufacturing average. It is well known that these wage differentials vary

systematically across industries (with capital-intensive industries paying higher wages), and are

fairly stable over time (Krueger and Summers, 1988).

         We can estimate (19’) as the regression (20), where now we have been careful to derive

the error term εm. But this derivation is enough to answer the question we posed above: the

estimates of ωL, ωH, and ωK obtained from (20) will be unbiased estimates of the average actual

factor price-changes in (19’) if and only if the error term εm in (20’) is uncorrelated with the

cost-shares θmL, θmH, θmK. This result follows directly from the properties of ordinary least-

squares, whereby the independent variables need to be uncorrelated with the error term to obtain

unbiased estimates. But this property is unlikely to be true in our data. Industries such as office

equipment have both a high share of nonproduction labor (e.g., engineers), and probably the

fastest growing industry wage differential, as these workers have had very rapid wage gains.

This means that the error term εm is negative for office equipment, resulting in a negative

correlation with the cost-share of nonproduction labor. Indeed, this negative correlation may

explain why the estimated change in nonproduction wages is lower in column (1) than in column
                                                    36

(2) of Table 5 (and why both estimates are lower than the actual change in nonproduction wages

in column (5)).

       To correct this problem, we can simply include the error term εm as an additional

regressor in the equation, reflecting the change in interindustry wage differentials. It is

convenient to combine εm with TFPm, obtaining a measure of “effective” TFP:


                  ETFPm ≡ TFPm − ε m

                         = (θ mL ∆ ln w + θ mH ∆ ln q + θ mK ∆ ln r ) − ∆ ln p m   .          (21)


Thus, this measure of effective productivity shows how the average manufacturing factor-price

changes, weighted using the cost-share in each industry, differ from the change in product price

of that industry. Making use of (21), the regression in (20) is written once again as,


                  ∆ ln p m = − ETFPm + θ mL ωL + θ mH ωH + θ mK ωK , m=1,…,M.                 (22)


Now, there is no error term at all in this regression, so it ought to provide a perfect fit when

estimated. This will not be true exactly in our data, since we are using the primal rather than the

dual measure of TFP to construct effective TFP in (21). These priors are confirmed in columns

(4) and (5) of Table 5. In column (4), the dependent variable is the log change in value-added

prices; in column (5), it is the log change in output prices, since we allow the coefficients on the

materials and energy shares to differ from unity. In either specification, the coefficients on the

labor and capital shares are extremely close to the actual average annual percentage changes in

factor prices, which are 4.71 for production labor, 5.44 for nonproduction labor, and 3.95 for

capital. Thus, when we properly estimate (20), we end up with an identity!
                                                  37

       Summarizing our results so far, we started with the goal of estimating the zero-profit

conditions, to obtain “mandated” changes in factor prices that are consistent with the change in

product prices. A number of researchers have estimated an equation like (20), without much

attention to the error term in this regression. When we carefully derive the error term, as in

(20’), we then realize that it may well be correlated with the factor cost-shares, which are the

independent variables. To correct for this we can include the error term as data, by incorporating

it into “effective” total factor productivity, as in (22). But now we encounter another problem:

this gives essentially a perfect fit, just reproducing the actual change in factor prices. That

means the regression does not provide us with any new information at all! This is a discouraging

finding, and calls into question the whole approach.

       To make further progress, Feenstra and Hanson (1999) propose a two-step estimation

procedure. In the first step, we combine the variables ∆ ln p m + ETFPm that appear in (22), and

regress these on the structural variables zm. Supposing that there are only two structural

variables, z1m and z2m, we therefore run the regression:


                ∆ ln p m + ETFPm = η0 + η1∆z1m + η2 ∆z 2 m , m=1,…,M.                            (23)


We then take the estimated coefficients ηˆ 1 and ηˆ 2 , and use these to construct the dependent

variables for the second-step regressions,


                ηˆ 1∆z1m = θ mL ω1L + θ mH ω1H + θ mK ω1K ,                                      (24a)

                ηˆ 2 ∆z 2 m = θ mL ω2 L + θ mH ω2 H + θ mK ω2 K , m=1,…,M.                       (24a)


That is, we use the estimated coefficients ηˆ 1 and ηˆ 2 times each structural variable as the

dependent variables in (24), and regress these on the factor cost-shares. The coefficients
                                                         38


obtained from the second-stage regression, ω1L, ω1H, ω1K and ω2L, ω2H, ω2K, are interpreted as the

portion of the total change in factor-prices that are explained by that structural variable. In this

way, we are taking the total change in factor-prices, and decomposing it into parts that are

explained by each structural variable.

         In the estimation of (23) for U.S. manufacturing industries over the period 1979-1990,

Feenstra and Hanson (1999) find positive and statistically significant correlations between TFP-

adjusted value-added prices and foreign outsourcing, the computer share of the capital stock, and

the computer share of investment (but not with the high-tech capital share). This is consistent

with these structural variables having positive effects on productivity, as expected, and on value-

added prices.24 The latter effect arises from the non-neutral impact that the structural variables

have on industry productivity – outsourcing and capital upgrading both induce shifts away from

production labor and towards nonproduction labor – which then leads to changes in relative

product prices (in particular, raising value-added prices for skill-intensive goods). Over the

period 1979-1990, the structural variables account for 11% to 23% of the variation in TFP-

adjusted value-added prices in U.S. manufacturing.

         The second stage of this technique is to decompose the change in TFP-adjusted value-

added prices into portions attributable to each structural variable and then, following (24),

regress these decomposed product-price changes on the factor-cost shares to obtain mandated

changes in factor prices. The results suggest that both outsourcing and capital upgrading




24 Feenstra and Hanson (1999) verify that the structural variables affect both TFP and value-added prices directly.
Were the structural variables to affect just TFP, they would affect value-added prices indirectly, through the pass-
through of productivity changes to product-price changes. Feenstra and Hanson find that the structural variables
affect value-added prices over and above their impact on productivity.
                                                 39

contributed to rising wage inequality in the 1980’s. Over the 1979-1990 period, outsourcing

accounts for 15% of the increase in the relative wage of nonproduction workers, and computers

measured using ex post rental prices account for 35% of this increase; thus, computers are twice

as important as outsourcing. When instead the computer share of the capital stock is measured

using ex ante rental prices, then outsourcing explains about 25% while computers explain about

20% of the increase in the nonproduction/production wage. Finally, when the computer share of

the capital stock is replaced with the computer share of investment, then the contribution of

outsourcing falls to about 10%, while the contribution of computers rises so much that it explains

the entire increase in the relative wage. Thus, as in Table 4 where we examined the change in

the nonproduction labor share, when we now consider the factors influencing the relative wage,

we find that both outsourcing and computer expenditure are important with their exact

magnitudes depending on how these variables are measured.

       Economic integration between countries may, of course, also contribute directly to

changes in factor prices, as lower tariffs or transportation costs lead to changes in product prices

which would then affect factor prices in standard Stolper-Samuelson (1941) fashion. In

principle, one could uncover the impact of changing tariffs and transportation costs on product

prices and productivity, following (23), and use these results to estimate their impact on factor

prices, following (24). Haskel and Slaughter (2000) show that in the 1970’s U.S. manufacturing

industries with higher tariffs and higher transportation costs tended to have lower relative

employment of nonproduction workers, and that over the period 1974-1988 reductions in tariffs

and transportation costs were larger in less-skill-intensive industries. This is suggestive evidence

that falling trade costs may have contributed to rising wage inequality. But other evidence is

missing: changes in tariffs and transportation costs do poorly in explaining changes in product
                                                      40

prices across U.S. industries over the 1974-1988 period. Robertson (2000) finds stronger results

for Mexico: over 1987-1993, when Mexico’s skilled-unskilled wage gap rose, tariffs fell more in

less-skill-intensive industries, and over 1993-1998, when Mexico’s skilled-unskilled wage gap

fell, tariffs fell more in skill-intensive sectors.

        The United Kingdom is another country that has experienced rising wage inequality of

the same magnitude as the United States. Haskel and Slaughter (2001) apply the two-stage

estimation procedure of Feenstra and Hanson (1999) to data on U.K. manufacturing industries

over the period 1960-1990, using as structural variables union density (the share of union

workers in industry employment), industry concentration (share of sales by the five largest

firms), innovations per industry, import prices, and computerization (share of firms in the

industry using computers). They find that TFP growth is higher in industries with more

innovations, lower initial union density, lower initial sales concentration, and larger reductions in

import prices (but is unrelated with computerization). Product price changes are lower in

industries with smaller changes in import prices. During the 1980’s, when U.K. wage inequality

rose, the structural variable that appears to have contributed most to the increase in the skilled-

unskilled wage gap is industry innovation. The contribution of import prices is comparatively

small. This contrasts with research (Anderton and Brenton, 1997) showing that rising imports

over 1970-83 is a significant determinant of the nonproduction labor share in the U.K.


4.3 Estimation of Economy-wide GDP Function

        The third empirical method we shall discuss takes the longest-run view of the economy,

in which capital and all other factors fully adjust to their equilibrium levels across industries.

Rather than focusing on each industry, we now look at the economy overall, and consider how
                                                              41

gross domestic product (GDP) is produced from the total factor endowments, given the prices of

domestic and traded goods. Letting (Lm, Hm, Km) denote the factor demands within each

industry m=1,…,M, the sum of these cannot exceed the endowments (L, H, K):


                        M                        M                       M
                        ∑ L m ≤ L,             ∑ H m ≤ H,          and   ∑ Km ≤ K .                   (25)
                       m =1                    m =1                      m =1


Using the production functions in (3) for each industry, the GDP function for the economy is

defined as:

                                             M
                                            ∑
                              max
        G(L, H, K, P) ≡                              Fm(Lm, Hm, Km, pm, p), subject to (25),          (26)
                          L m ,H m K m
                                            m =1



where P=(p1,…,pM, p) denotes the vector of all product prices pm as well the prices p of all

imported intermediate imports. Let us say there are N > M prices in total, so that P=(p1,…,pN).

Within the list of M industries, we are including both manufacturing and services, whether these

products are traded or not.

       In order to estimate (26) we need to choose a functional form, and as in our discussion of

the cost function, a convenient choice is the translog function. This is written in a general

notation as,

                               N                        K                     N    N
                              ∑ α m ln p m + ∑ β k ln v k +                  ∑ ∑ γ mn ln p m ln p n
                                                                         1
               ln G = α 0 +
                                                                         2
                              m =1                     k =1                  m =1 n =1
                                                                                                      (27)
                                           K       K                         N K
                                           ∑ ∑ δ kl ln v k ln v l + ∑ ∑ φ mk ln p m ln v k
                                       1
                                   +
                                       2
                                           k =1 l =1                     m =1 k =1



where pm denotes the prices of the outputs and imported inputs, m=1,…,N, while vk denotes the

endowments of the factors of production, k=1,…,K. For the GDP function in (26), there are just
                                                         42

three endowments – skilled and unskilled labor, and capital. In order to ensure that the GDP

function is linearly homogeneous in prices, we impose the requirements,25


                            N                     N               N
                           ∑ αn = 1     and      ∑ γ mn = ∑ γ mn = 0.                              (28)
                           n =1                 m =1            n =1


        As usual, we can differentiate the GDP function with respect to factor endowments to

obtain factor prices, ∂G/∂vk = wk. It follows that the derivative of the log of GDP with respect to

the log of endowments, ∂lnG/∂lnvk = wkvk/G, equals the share of GDP paid to each factor, which

we denote by sk, k=1,…,K. Computing this for the GDP function in (27), we obtain:


                                        K                 N
                           s k = β k + ∑ δ kl ln v l +   ∑ φ mk ln p m ,    k=1,…,K.               (29)
                                       l =1              m =1



In addition, differentiating the GDP function with respect to a product price yields output of that

good (inclusive of exports), and differentiating with respect to an import price yields the

negative of imports. Therefore, the derivative of the log of GDP with respect to the log of a

price equals the share of GDP obtained from that output, which we denote by sn, n=1,…,N. Note

that for imported inputs, these shares are negative. Computing these from (27):


                                         N                    K
                           sm = αm +    ∑ γ mn ln p n +    ∑ φmk ln v k ,    m=1,…,N.              (30)
                                        n =1               k =1




25 Without loss of generality, we also impose the symmetry restrictions γmn = γnm and δmk = δkm.
                                                       43

        Thus, given annual data on product prices and quantities, along with factor prices and

endowments, we can estimate (29) and (30) as a system of linear equations. This will allow us to

determine the effect of product prices on factor shares – measured by φmk. Notice that these

coefficients enter both the factor-share equations in (29), and the product-share equations in (30),

so that estimating these simultaneously allows us to test the restriction that φmk estimated from

(29) and (30) are equal. If this hypothesis is accepted, then the restriction can be imposed, and

this allows the estimates of φmk to become more precise. An advantage of this system approach

is that the number of years (say T) is multiplied by the number of equations, (N-1) for products

plus (K-1) for factors, to obtain the total number of observations T(N+K-2).26 Thus, even

though the number of parameters being estimated is large, we can obtain reasonable estimates

even if we only have annual data for one or two decades.

        Estimates of the GDP function have been made by a number of authors for various

countries, including the United States. The reader is referred to Kohli (1991) for the most

comprehensive treatment. For the purposes of this survey, we are interested in applications that

distinguish skilled versus unskilled labor. Tombazos (1999) attempts to make this distinction by

identifying industries that are intensive in skilled or unskilled labor, and then forming aggregate

wages and employment indexes over each group of industries; these indexes are then used as a

proxy for the price and quantity of skilled and unskilled labor. Imports are treated as an input

into the production process, just as they are in the GDP function (26). Tombazos incorporates

skilled labor, unskilled labor, capital and imports into the estimation of an aggregate cost

function for the U.S., over 1967-1994, with a single aggregate output (including exports). His



26 Because the shares sum to unity, one product-share and one factor-share equation must be dropped.
                                                 44

major conclusion is that a drop in the import price reduces the demand for unskilled labor, but

raises the demand for skilled labor in the U.S. This is highly consistent our theoretical model of

section 3. According to Tombazos, an effect like this holds for the U.S. economy in the

aggregate. Missing from his analysis, though, is a discussion of how much import prices have

fallen, and therefore, how much of the shift towards skilled labor can be explained by this

channel of influence.

       This shortcoming does not appear in the work of Harrigan and Balaban (1999) and

Harrigan (2000). Harrigan and Balaban estimate the system of equations in (29) and (30) for the

United States over the period 1963-1991 using data on four factors (high-school dropouts, high-

school graduates, college graduates, capital), and four sectors (skill-intensive traded goods,

unskilled-intensive traded goods, skill-intensive nontraded goods, and unskilled-intensive

nontraded goods). Thus, imports are not explicitly identified. In contrast, Harrigan (2000) has

two categories of outputs (skill-intensive and unskilled-intensive final output), and seven factors

including imports (oil imports, two other groups of imports, and the three types of labor and

capital). It turns out that changes in the import prices have been quite small in comparison with

other prices changes, especially in nontraded goods, so that changes in import prices are not an

important explanation for changes in wages. We therefore focus below on the results of

Harrigan and Balaban, which except for imports, are similar to those of Harrigan.

       With the estimated coefficients from the share equations (29) and (30) in hand, Harrigan

and Balaban calculate wage elasticities with respect to factor quantities and product prices. As

expected, the own-quantity elasticity of each factor price is negative. Increasing the supply of

capital raise wages for all workers, but these elasticities are increasing in education levels, such

that a 10% increase in the capital stock would increase the college/high-school graduate relative
                                                 45

wage by about 3.5%, and the college/high-school dropout relative wage by about 8%. The wage

elasticities of traded goods prices are imprecisely estimated, while those for nontraded goods are

somewhat surprising. Increases in prices of skill-intensive nontraded goods raises wages for

college graduates and high-school dropouts, but lowers wages for high-school graduates, and

increases in prices of unskilled-intensive nontraded goods has a large positive effect on high-

school-graduate wages, a moderate positive effect on college wages, and a negative effect on

high-school-dropout wages.

       Putting the estimated wage elasticities together with observed changes in factor supplies

and product prices, we can decompose the contribution of different variables to the observed

change in factor prices. While capital accumulation contributed to an increase in the relative

wage of college graduates, this effect was largely offset by increases in the supply of college

graduates. The big changes during the latter part of the sample period were an increase in the

relative price of skill-intensive nontraded goods, such as finance, insurance and real estate. This

had the largest impact on raising the college/high-school-graduate relative wage. Conversely,

there was a decrease in the relative price of unskilled-intensive nontraded goods, such as

wholesale and retail trade, which had the largest impact on reducing the relative wage of high-

school dropouts. In short, the increase in the relative wage of skilled labor, in the 1980s and

beyond, is highly correlated with the rise in the price of nontraded goods that use skilled labor,

and similarly for unskilled labor where both the relative wage and price fell.

       These correlations beg the questions of whether the change in nontraded prices caused

the change in wages, or conversely. We provided a theoretical example in section 3.3 of a case

where capital leaves the country, increasing the relative wage of skilled labor, and therefore

raising the price of skill-intensive nontradables and lowering the price of unskilled-intensive
                                                 46

nontradables. This story would be consistent with the estimates of Harrigan and Balaban. We

cannot rule out, however, the idea that the nontradables prices are changing due to some other

reason (e.g. rising incomes and demand leading to an increase in the price of skill-intensive

nontradables), which is therefore the proximate cause of the change in wages. As Harrigan

(2000, p. 186) puts it: “To my knowledge, there are no scholarly studies of relative price

determination in the United States that might shed light on the causes of the changes

shown…and until we understand the cause of these price changes we cannot rule out an

important role for import competition.”


5. Conclusions

       There is an emerging view in the literature on wage inequality in the United States and

other advanced countries that technological change matters for changes in the wage structure but

international trade does not (Katz and Autor, 1999). The research we survey in this chapter fails

to support this conclusion. While there is abundant evidence of skill-biased technological

change, it also appears that international trade, in the form of foreign outsourcing, contributes to

skill upgrading and increases in the skilled-unskilled wage gap.

       The argument against trade is based, in part, on a misreading of the data. Stable trade to

GDP ratios, an apparent increase in the relative price of skill-intensive goods, and employment

shifts towards skilled workers that occur mainly within, rather than between, industries are all

cited as evidence that trade cannot have contributed to rising wage inequality. This line of

reasoning emphasizes trade in final goods and ignores the globalization of production and recent

dramatic increases in trade in intermediate inputs. Much recent growth in trade has resulted

from firms breaking industries apart by locating low-skill activities in low-wage countries and

high-skill activities in high-wage countries. When trade takes this form, its impact on relative
                                                  47

prices and factor allocation can be much different than that predicted by standard models of trade

in final goods. Recent literature shows that trade to merchandise GDP ratios have risen sharply

in recent years, with much of the growth in trade attributable to intermediate inputs, that changes

in the relative prices of domestic versus imported goods are consistent with trade shifting out the

relative demand for skilled labor, and that trade in intermediate inputs is consistent with skill

upgrading being a within-industry phenomenon.

         Beyond the prima facie case that trade raises wage inequality, there is evidence of a

direct link. Using data on changes in industry behavior over time, we see that foreign

outsourcing is associated with increases in the share of wages paid to skilled workers in the

United States, Japan, Hong Kong, and Mexico. In several of these cases, outsourcing can

account for half or move of the observed skill upgrading. For the United States, there is

evidence that during the 1980’s and 1990’s outsourcing contributed to changes in industry

productivity and product prices that in turn mandated increases in the relative wage of skilled

labor.

         Existing literature has just begun to scratch the surface of how the globalization of

production changes industry structure and factor demand in advanced and emerging economies.

There is as of yet little research on foreign outsourcing in Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia

(Cheng and Kierzkowski, 2001), or Central America and the Caribbean (Feenstra, Hanson and

Swenson, 2000), though anecdotal evidence suggests that it is an important mechanism through

which countries in these regions integrate themselves into the world economy. There are clearly

rich opportunities for research in this area.

         Global production sharing and trade in intermediate inputs matter more generally for how

we apply trade models to data. In tests of the Heckscher-Ohlin model, it is standard to assume
                                                 48

that exports are produced entirely by combining domestic factors of production with

domestically-produced intermediate inputs. We now know that this assumption is wrong.

Antweiler and Trefler (2000), Davis and Weinstein (2000) and Trefler and Zhu (2000) show that

trade in intermediate inputs can help resolve the mystery of the missing trade (Trefler, 1995), in

which the estimated factor content of trade is near zero, and that existing tests of trade theory

may produce severely biased estimates of the factor content of trade if they fail to account for

global production. While we can easily address this problem by adopting more general trade

models in which trade occurs in both final and intermediate goods, the literature has yet to take

this necessary step.

Note: The averages shown weigh each industry’s price change by that industry’s share of total
manufacturing employment or nonproduction and non-manual workers, or production and
manual workers. Industries are defined at the 3-digit SIC level for the U.S., and generally
correspond to the 2-digit level for Japan and Germany.

Note: The mean of the dependent variable equals 0.389. Standard errors (in parentheses) are robust to
heteroskedasticity and correlation in the errors within two-digit industries. The first column shows mean
values of the dependent and independent variables for 1979-1990. All regressions and means are
computed over 447 four-digit SIC industries and are weighted by the average industry share of the
manufacturing wage bill. ∆ln(K/Y) is the average annual change in the log capital-shipments ratio and ∆ln(Y)
is the average annual change in log real shipments. The outsourcing variables and the computer and high-
technology shares are in annual changes.

Note: Standard errors are in parentheses. All regressions omit three industries with missing data on
materials purchases or prices (SIC 2067, 2794, 3483) and are weighted by the industry share of total
manufacturing shipments, averaged over the first and last period.

In columns (1)-(3) and (5), the dependent variable is the log change in the gross industry price, and the
factor cost shares sum to one across all factors. The materials cost share is multiplied by the log change
in the materials price; the energy cost share is treated similarly. In column (4), the dependent variable is
the log change in the industry value-added price and factor cost shares sum to one across primary factors.
Column (1) uses primal TFP as a regressor; column (2) drops the computer industry (SIC 3573) from the
sample; column (3) also drops TFP as a regressor; and column (5) uses effective TFP as a regressor,
where effective TFP equals primal TFP minus the change in wage differentials.

* These coefficients are constrained at unity.
