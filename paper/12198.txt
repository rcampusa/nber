Stabilization of Effective Exchange Rates Under Common Currency Basket Systems

April 2006
JEL No. E6, F3, F4

                                           ABSTRACT

We investigate the extent to which a common currency basket peg would stabilize effective
exchange rates of East Asian currencies. We use an AMU (Asian Monetary Unit), which is a
weighted average of ASEAN10 plus 3 (Japan, China, and Korea) currencies, as a common currency
basket to investigate the stabilization effects. We compare our results with another result on
stabilization effects of the common G3 currency (the US dollar, the Japanese yen, and the euro)
basket in the East Asian countries (Williamson (2005)). We obtained the following results: first, the
AMU peg system would be more effective in reducing fluctuations of the effective exchange rates
as more countries applied the AMU peg system in East Asia. Second, the AMU peg system would
more effectively stabilize the effective exchange rates than a common G-3 currency basket peg
system for four (Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea and Thailand) of the seven countries. The
results suggest that the AMU basket peg would be useful for the East Asian countries whose trade
weights on Japan are relatively higher than others.

1. Introduction


       A variety of exchange rate systems are found in East Asian countries. The

monetary authorities of Japan and Korea are adopting a flexible exchange rate

system. On one hand, those of China and Malaysia have been keeping a de facto

dollar peg system as shown in Ogawa and Sakane (2006) even though they

announced the change in their own exchange rate systems into a managed floating

exchange rate system with references with a currency basket on July 21, 2005. East

Asian currencies make asymmetric responses to the US dollar depreciation under

the variety of exchange rate systems. Moreover, some of the East Asian countries

are facing coordination failure in choosing their own exchange rate systems (Ogawa

and Ito (2002)) as shown in the fact that the monetary authority of Malaysia

followed the announcement of exchange rate system reform by that of China. It is

supposed that all of the monetary authorities should adopt the same exchange rate

policy, for example, a common currency basket system in order to solve both the

asymmetric responses to the US dollar depreciation and the coordination failure

among East Asian countries.

       If the common currency basket systems are adopted in East Asian countries

who have a different structure of trade with the rest of world, effective exchange

rates might be more unstable due to different weights on each of foreign currencies

between the common currency basket and the effective exchange rate for each of the

East Asian currencies. For the reason, it is important to investigate stabilization of

effective exchange rate under a common currency basket system because effective

exchange rates should have effects on exports and imports, and in turn trade



                                          2
balances. In this paper, we suppose an AMU (Asian Monetary Unit), which is a

weighted average of ASEAN10 1 plus 3 (Japan, China, and Korea) currencies

(Ogawa and Shimizu (2005, 2006)), as a common currency basket to investigate the

stabilization effects of an AMU peg system on East Asian currencies.

         The reminder of this paper consists of the following sections. Section 2

classifies some types of currency basket systems and overviews previous researches

about the currency basket system in East Asian countries. Section 3 explains a

theoretical model of exchange rate system choice within the regional economies to

show that the monetary authorities of East Asian countries should adopt the

common currency basket system. In section 4, we briefly describe our method to

calculate the AMU as a common currency basket for East Asian countries. Section 5

investigates the stabilization effects of the AMU peg system on effective exchange

rates and compares our analytical results with those of Williamson (2005), who

showed the effectiveness of the G3 currency (the US dollar, the Japanese yen, and

the euro) basket in the East Asian countries. The final section offers concluding

remarks.




2. Currency basket system in East Asia


2-1. Objectives of a common currency basket peg in East Asia


          At first, we discuss about objectives of adopting a currency basket peg in

East Asian countries. Intra-regional financial cooperation has been developing in


1   ASEAN10 includes Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
    Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.


                                           3
East Asia since the Asian currency crisis in 1997. In response to closer trade and

economic relationships among East Asian countries, it is objectives of regional

financial cooperation to prevent another future currency crisis and to strengthen

financial systems within the region. Under these circumstances, it is becoming more

and more important to coordinate exchange rate policies among the East Asian

countries. Currently, many researchers advocate that the monetary authorities of

East Asian countries should adopt a currency basket system. This appears to be an

appropriate choice after the announcement about its exchange rate system reform

made by the Chinese Government on July 21, 2005.

          In contrast, previous researches have obtained mixed results about effectiveness

of the currency basket peg system for its objectives. Frankel (1999) listed nine

currency arrangements, including a currency basket system, and discussed the

advantages and disadvantages for each of the arrangements. He concluded that

what is an optimal exchange rate system depends on circumstances of a particular

country and time and that no single currency regime is the best for all time. He

pointed out that there are two advantages of fixing the exchange rate for any

country: the first is to reduce foreign exchange transaction costs and foreign

exchange rate risks which can discourage international trade and foreign direct

investments. The second is to provide a credible nominal anchor for monetary policy.

23   For the first advantage, there is an argument that foreign exchange rate risks


2    Frankel (1999) indicated that another advantage is to prevent competitive
     depreciation or competitive appreciation.
3   Apparently, it is an advantage of a floating exchange rate system that the monetary
     authorities can conduct an independent monetary policy under the system. However,
     we do not discuss about it because we focus on exchange rate policy in this paper.


                                                 4
can be hedged by using forward exchange transaction and other instruments. There

are costs for hedging, both in terms of bid-ask spread and in terms of a possible

exchange risk premium although these are, in general, regarded to be small.

Against this view, Rose (2000) argued that it might be much more difficult to hedge

foreign exchange rate risks in emerging countries than commonly believed. Rather,

a common currency could induce greater financial integration, which then leads to

increases in international trade in goods and services. 4

         On the other hand, Yoshino, Kaji and Suzuki (2004) considered three

exchange rate regimes, which include the floating, dollar peg, and currency basket

peg system, and, on one hand, three policy objectives, which include GDP stability,

current account stability, and the exchange rate stability. They defined a loss

function for each of the policy objectives to choose the optimal exchange rate system

that could minimize the loss function in an economy with exogenous shocks. They

concluded that it would not be in general an optimal choice to adopt a currency

basket peg with trade weights. 5

         However, it is more important to stabilize exchange rates among the

intra-regional currencies because East Asian country economies have closer

economic relationships with each other in recent years. Fluctuations of exchange

rates of East Asian currencies in terms of major international currencies might

cause a large fluctuation of effective exchange rates of the East Asian currencies.

4   Rose (2000) discussed that a monetary union such as the EMU (Economic and
    Monetary Union) in the EU (European Union) may lead to a large increase in
    international trade (due to the results of empirical analysis by using gravity model
    with 186 countries for 5 years spanning 1970 through 1990).
5   In their empirical study, they found that the optimal currency basket weights vary,
    depending on the policy objectives.


                                            5
The fluctuations of effective exchange rates should give a bias to relative

competitiveness of the different countries of East Asia and, in turn, disrupt the East

Asian economy as a whole. Williamson (2005) proposed a common currency basket

composed with three major currencies (G3 currency basket) for East Asian countries.

He indicated that a G3 common currency basket peg could prevent the fluctuations

in the exchange rates of the East Asian currencies in terms of the major

international currencies.

         On the other hand, Ogawa and Shimizu (2005, 2006) proposed an Asian

Monetary Unit (AMU), as a weighted average of thirteen East Asian (ASEAN10

plus 3) currencies, as a common currency basket in East Asia. In addition, we

proposed AMU Deviation Indicators which show a deviation measurement of each

East Asian currency from its benchmark level in terms of the AMU. 6 The AMU

Deviation Indicators explicitly shows the current condition of misalignments among

the East Asian currencies. We suggested that the deviation measurements are

useful as an indicator for surveillance at the ASEAN+3 Finance Deputy Ministers

Meeting. 7




6   The AMU and AMU Deviation Indicators are a joint project of the 21st century COE
    (Center of Excellence) project of Hitotsubashi University and RIETI (Research
    Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry). They are updated and uploaded on the
    website of RIETI (http://www.rieti.go.jp/users/amu/index.html) on a weekly basis. The
    AMU deviation indicators measure the degree of each currency’s exchange rate
    deviation from the regional average (AMU).
7   Williamson (2005) also suggests a common currency basket as a numeraire. He
    explains that one of the advantages of a currency basket peg is that it is consistent
    with a wide range of alternative exchange-rate systems.


                                            6
2-2. Classification of the types of currency basket


       Some researchers have advocated desirability of a currency basket system

for East Asian countries since the Asian currency crisis. We can find that there are

several types of currency basket in their discussion. In this section, we refer the

previous researches about the currency basket systems recommended in East Asian

countries.

       At first, we classify two different types of currency basket. One is a currency

basket composed of regional currencies. Their basket weights would reflect the

relative economic importance of the countries in the region just like the ECU

(European Currency Unit) under the EMS (European Monetary System) during a

period from 1979 to 1998. Such a currency basket in East Asia might be called an

ACU (Asian Currency Unit) or the AMU. The former is being prepared to create by

the ADB (Asian Development Bank) while Ogawa and Shimizu (2005, 2006) created

the latter.

       The other is a currency basket composed of outside currencies which include

the US dollar and the euro.   Williamson (1999), Kawai and Takagi (2000), Ogawa

and Ito (2002) and others have suggested a G3 currency basket composed of three

major currencies, which include the US dollar, the Japanese yen, and the euro. In

Kawai and Takagi (2000), they recommend that a G3 currency basket system

preserves both flexibility and stability in order to promote international trade,

foreign direct investments, and economic developments.

       An advantage of a common G3 currency basket system is to reduce

fluctuations of intra-regional exchange rates as well as fluctuations of exchange

rates against the outside currencies. However, there is a view that a currency


                                          7
basket system based on the G3 currencies is asymmetric between Japan and the

other East Asian countries. Wang (2002) suggests that a more symmetric approach

such as the crusade of a single Asian currency is more appropriate to promote the

regional monetary cooperation in East Asia. From a standpoint of a regional

monetary cooperation, we propose a currency basket that consists of regional

currencies which include the Japanese yen.

       There is another issue concerning the composition of the currency basket.

The monetary authority can choose a desirable currency basket system between a

common currency basket and an individual currency basket. The latter is based on

own trade pattern and the former is based on common currency basket weights

within the region. Williamson (2005) compared the stabilizing effect on effective

exchange rates under both the common currency basket system and the individual

currency basket system. He found that the common currency basket was more

effective in stabilizing effective exchange rates of East Asian currencies. Rajan

(2002) pointed out that the common currency basket system might be favorable

because the possibility of a competitive devaluation would exist if the monetary

authorities can choose their own individual currency basket.

       On   one   hand,   Mori,   Kinukawa,   Nukaya,    and   Hashimoto   (2002)

recommended a two-step approach. The first step is that each of the countries

should adopt an individual currency basket system by each country. And then, the

second step is that they should move on to a common currency basket. Ngiam and

Yuen (2002) recommended a similar approach that is called “Cluster Approach.”

They pointed out that some different clusters should adopt a common currency at

first, and then expand the clusters. Finally, it might be possible to unify those



                                        8
clusters so as to have one regional currency.




2-3. Current situation in East Asian countries


       Here, we overview current situation of East Asian currencies and bilateral

trade relationships in the region. Figure 1 shows the daily movements of nominal

exchange rates of the East Asian currencies vis-à-vis the US dollar during a period

from January 2000 to October 2005. We express nominal exchange rates in terms of

an index that is equal to 100 on January 3, 2000. It shows that exchange rates of the

dollar pegging currencies such as the Chinese yuan and the Malaysian ringgit were

stable around 100 while the Indonesian rupiah and the Philippine peso were

vulnerable throughout the period. On one hand, figure 2 shows the daily movement

of nominal exchange rates of East Asian currencies vis-à-vis the Japanese yen in the

same period. It shows that exchange rates of all the East Asian currencies were

unstable vis-à-vis the Japanese yen throughout the period.

       Table 1 shows standard deviations of the daily nominal exchange rates of

East Asian currencies vis-à-vis both the US dollar and the Japanese yen during the

period from January 2000 to October 2005. The standard deviations of exchange

rates of the dollar pegging currencies were smaller than a unity while those of the

Singapore dollar and the Brunei dollar were also around 3.3. On one hand, the

standard deviations of all East Asian currencies vis-à-vis the Japanese yen were

larger than 4. Especially, the standard deviations of the dollar pegging currencies

vis-à-vis the Japanese yen were larger than 5. These results indicate that the dollar

peg system might not be so appropriate from the viewpoint of the stability of their




                                          9
exchange rates vis-à-vis the Japanese yen.

         Tables 2, 3, and 4 show East Asian countries’ bilateral trade weights of

imports, exports, and a sum of imports and exports in 2000 and 2004, respectively.

Table 4 indicates that the average of intra-regional trade weights (in term of a sum

of imports plus exports) of the East Asian countries increased from 48.7 percent in

2000 to 51.0 percent in 2004. Especially, the average of intra-regional import

weights has steadily increased to 57.9 percent. Japan was the region’s largest trade

partner for most of the East Asian countries. However, the trade weights with

China have increased recently. Some East Asian countries, such as South Korea and

Singapore, had stronger trade relationship with China than Japan in 2004.

Furthermore, the average of trade weights of the East Asian countries with the

United States was decreased to 12.5 percent, which was even lower than with EU in

2004.

         Tables 5 and 6 indicate the latest actual weights on the three major

currencies for each of the East Asian currencies in 2004 and 2005 (until November 11,

2005). We estimated the weights on the US dollar, the euro, and the Japanese yen in

a possible currency basket for each of the East Asian countries according to a

method of Frankel and Wei (1994). 8 As a result, we can divide twelve East Asian

currencies into the following two groups: a group of the currencies who have still

kept a strong linkage with the US dollar and the other group of the currencies who

have increased their weights on the Japanese yen recently.

8   The log differences of exchange rates of each East Asian currency in terms of the
    Swiss franc were regressed on log differences of three major currencies in terms of the
    Swiss franc. This method was conducted by Kawai and Akiyama (2000), Ogawa
    (2002), and others.


                                             10
         The former is a group of the dollar pegging currencies. Coefficients on the US

dollar were almost unity in the cases of the Chinese yuan and the Malaysian ringgit.

In the cases of other minor currencies, such as the Cambodia riel, the Las kip, the

Myanmar kyat, and the Vietnamese dong, coefficients on the US dollar were close to

unity in 2004. Their weights on the US dollar were still close to unity but have

slightly decreased in 2005 due to the announcement of Chinese government’s

changing its exchange rate system on July 21, 2005. These results indicate that

they have still kept their de facto dollar peg system in 2005.

         The latter is a group of the currencies who seem to adopt a currency basket

system. We obtained the following results of estimated weights in a possible

currency basket. In the case of Singapore, their weights on the US dollar, the euro,

and the Japanese yen were 0.5787, 0.1603, and 0.2729, respectively in 2004, and

they have changed to 0.5021, 0.1707, and 0.3926, respectively in 2005. 9 In the case

of Thailand, the weights on the US dollar, the euro, and the Japanese yen were

0.7272, 0.1920, and 0.1923, respectively in 2004, and they have changed to 0.6172,

0.1301 (insignificant), and 0.3124, respectively in 2005. We can find the similar

movements in the cases of South Korea, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Even in the

case of the Chinese yuan, the weight on the Japanese yen has become significant

(0.0935) in 2005.

         Accordingly, we obtained the results that the actual exchange rate systems

adopted by East Asian countries have basically changed from the dollar peg system

or the de facto dollar peg system to more flexible exchange rate systems. However,

9   We can find the almost same movements with the Singapore dollar in the case of
    Brunei dollar because the monetary authority of Brunei adopts a currency board
    where the Brunei dollar is pegged to the Singapore dollar.


                                            11
the monetary authorities have still the overwhelming weight on the US dollar in a

half of the East Asian countries. It is important to consider what factors forced the

East Asian currencies to keep the strong linkages with the US dollar. We can point

out some factors, which include the US dollar as a nominal anchor, appreciation of

the Japanese yen against the US dollar, and coordination failure in choosing

exchange rate system under intra-regional trade competition. We will focus on the

coordination failure among the factors and discuss in the next section.




3. Common currency basket as a solution for coordination failure in
   choosing exchange rate systems


         Ogawa and Ito (2002) pointed out that the monetary authorities of Eat Asian

countries might have been forced to keep a de facto dollar peg system instead of

adopting a desirable exchange rate system such as a currency basket system, even if

they find that they would be better-off by adopting it rather than a dollar peg

system, 10 according to lessons they learned from the Asian currency crisis in 1997.

The situation can be described as a kind of coordination failure. Suppose that all

East Asian countries have been adopting the de facto dollar peg system at the

present time and that each of them knows that it should adopt an optimal currency

basket system, for example, to stabilize fluctuations of its trade balances with an

internationally diversified trading structure.

         Suppose that one country switches from the dollar peg system to a currency

basket system while the others keep the dollar peg system. The country with a


10   Bénassy-Quéré (1999) and Ohno (1999) analyzed that East Asian currencies were
 pegged to the US dollar as a coordination failure in choosing exchange rate policies.


                                          12
currency basket system, say, country A, might be faced with an increase in

fluctuations in trade balances. If the US dollar depreciates against the Japanese

yen, the real effective appreciation of country A’s currency against the other

currencies that are pegged to the US dollar worsens the price competitiveness of

exporting firms of country A. On the other hand, if the US dollar appreciates

against the Japanese yen, the real effective depreciation of country A’s currency

against the other currencies improves the price competitiveness of exporting firms

of country A. Thus, the country that adopted a currency basket system alone is

faced with an increase in the degree of fluctuations of trade balances. Therefore, the

monetary authorities of country A are induced to keep the dollar peg system.

Similarly, each of the monetary authorities rationally keeps the dollar peg system if

they cannot make a coordinated decision but a sequential unilateral decision.

       Thus, each of the monetary authorities will keep pegging their home

currencies to the US dollar if their trade balances fluctuate more widely in the case

of unilaterally pegging its currency to an optimal currency basket peg. When this is

the case, they are faced with coordination failure in that they are forced to adopt the

dollar peg even though the optimal currency basket peg, if jointly adopted, will

minimize the fluctuations in trade balances. Only when both monetary authorities

coordinated with each other to adopt the optimal currency basket peg

simultaneously can they peg their home currencies to the optimal currency basket.

       Suppose that risk-averse monetary authorities choose their exchange rate

system under uncertainty; then the monetary authorities are more likely to be faced

with coordination failure. Risk-averse monetary authorities, who have a usual

utility function with diminishing marginal utility, place a heavier weight on



                                          13
increase in their utility of loss caused by exchange rate fluctuations than on

decrease in their utility of loss even though they expect that the expected losses are

the same. Suppose that the risk-averse monetary authorities of one country shift

from the de facto dollar peg system to an optimal currency basket system while the

monetary authorities of other countries keep the de facto dollar peg system. The

currency would appreciate against the neighbors’ currencies if the US dollar

depreciated against the Japanese yen, while it would depreciate against the

neighbors’ currencies if the US dollar appreciated against the Japanese yen.

Because risk-averse monetary authorities place a heavier weight on increases in

loss caused by shifting their exchange rate system, they tend to hesitate to shift to

the optimal currency basket system. Therefore, under such uncertainty, risk-averse

monetary authorities tend to take the strategy of wait and see vis-à-vis behavior of

the other.

       If all of the monetary authorities are risk averse, they cannot help but choose

to keep the dollar peg system, which is Nash equilibrium, although they should

know that there is a cooperative solution that is superior to a Nash equilibrium.

Coordination among some of the monetary authorities of the East Asian countries is

necessary for shifting from a situation of the Nash equilibrium to a cooperative

solution. The monetary authorities should implement regional coordination for

exchange rate arrangements or exchange rate policies.

       One way to implement regional coordination is by making all the monetary

authorities in the region agree on an arrangement to create a common currency unit

that consists of a currency basket. They might make a commitment to follow the

common currency value in conducting their exchange rate policy. It is necessary to



                                         14
create a common currency basket as a common currency unit that monetary

authorities of East Asian countries should refer to when they conduct their

exchange rate policies with regional coordination.

       Such regional currency arrangements would help to prevent competitive

devaluation among the related currencies in a region as well as to solve

coordination failure. If the monetary authorities of a country devalue its home

currency, the devaluation worsens the price competitiveness of products made in

neighboring countries. For that reason, the monetary authorities of the other

countries would find it attractive to devalue their home currency, following the first

country’s devaluation. The regional currency arrangements under which the

monetary authorities in the region make a commitment to a coordinated exchange

rate policy would prevent a possible competitive devaluation as well as the inertia

problem that causes coordination failure.

       In addition, regional currency arrangements to keep the exchange rate

linked to a common currency basket will help prevent competitive devaluation

among the currencies in a region because the monetary authorities have a

commitment to the arrangements.

       Under a common currency basket system, the monetary authorities in the

region should peg or target their home currencies to a common basket currency. In a

rigid system where the monetary authorities peg their home currencies to a

common basket currency, the currencies in the region are pegged with each other. In

a more flexible system where they target their home currencies within a band

around a central parity rate vis-à-vis the common basket currency, the currencies

are linked to each other within a band. Thus, if they adopted a common basket



                                         15
currency system, their currencies would be linked with each other at a parity rate or

within a band around a central parity rate.

         It is more tractable for the monetary authorities to link their home

currencies to a common currency unit that is equivalent to the common basket

currency. A common currency unit should be composed of major trader partners on

which major weight is placed in calculating an effective exchange rate. They should

include the US dollar and the euro as well as the intra-regional currencies which

include the Japanese yen from the viewpoint of international trade. 11

         The EU countries adopted the EMS where their home currencies were linked

to a common currency unit, the ECU, during the period 1979–1998. The ECU was

composed of only the currencies of the EMS member countries. Their currencies

were linked to the ECU with a band while the ECU was floating against the other

currencies that included the US dollar and the Japanese yen. The monetary

authorities had the obligation to intervene in the foreign exchange markets to keep

the exchange rates of the currency in the region against the other EMS currencies

within a band.

         One method to adopt a common basket currency system is for the monetary

authorities to create a common currency unit, which consists of currencies of the

member countries like the ECU, and link their currencies to the common currency

unit. Moreover, also a value of the common currency unit against the US dollar and

the euro might be stable if they make coordination to try to stabilize their own home

currencies to the two currencies.


11   Kim, Ryou, and Wang (2000) suggested that the Asian currency unit was composed of
 only the East Asian currencies including the Japanese yen.

4. Calculating the value of the AMU


          In this section, we explain our method to calculate the AMU. 12 We calculate

the AMU as a weighted average of East Asian currencies following the method that

was used to calculate the ECU. We use the ASEAN10 plus 3 currencies to calculate

the AMU. 13 14 As we showed in Section 2, Japan is the region’s largest trade partner

for most of the East Asian countries and the exchange rates vis-à-vis the Japanese

yen have a large impact on their trade accounts. Furthermore, Japan should play

an important role to enhance the coordinated exchange rate policies under recent

movements of regional economic cooperation in East Asia. Accordingly, we suppose

that the Japanese yen should be included in the composition currency of the AMU.

          The weight of each currency in the basket is based on an arithmetical

average of share in regional GDP measured at PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) and

trade volume share (the sum of exports and imports) in the last three years in order

to reflect the latest trade relationships and economic size of the thirteen East Asian

12   The CMI (Chiang Mai Initiative) calls on the region’s monetary authorities to develop
     effective regional surveillance capabilities in order to enhance ASEAN+3 economic
     surveillance. We suggest the importance to monitor the exchange rate and propose a
     possible way of calculating an AMU and AMU Deviation Indicators as a surveillance
     indicator. These should help to coordinate exchange rate policies in East Asia,
     thereby enhancing the monetary authorities’ surveillance capabilities. Please see the
     details about AMU deviation Indicators in Ogawa and Shimizu (2005, 2006).
13   See the details of methodology to calculate the AMU to Ogawa and Shimizu (2005).
14   It is controversial whether Japan should be included or not into the AMU. Kawasaki
     and Ogawa (2006) analyzed the Optimum Currency Area (OCA) in East Asia
     empirically to conclude that it is difficult for all of the East Asian countries which
     include Japan to make OCA for the moment.


                                             17
countries for calculation of the AMU. 15 We quote the value of the AMU in terms of a

trade weighted average of the US dollar and the euro (US$-euro) because both the

United States and the euro area countries are important trading partners for East

Asia. We use a weight of 65% for the US dollar and of 35% for the euro. 16

          Then we choose a benchmark period in order to calculate the AMU Deviation

Indicators based on the following criterion: the total trade balance of member

countries, the total trade balance of member countries (excluding Japan) with

Japan, and the total trade balance of member countries with the rest of world

should be close to zero. Table 7, which shows the trade accounts of the thirteen East

Asian countries from 1990 to 2003, indicates that the trade accounts were closest to

balance in 2001. Assuming a one-year time lag before changes in exchange rates

affect trade volumes, we should choose two years of 2000 and 2001 as the

benchmark period. 17 We define the exchange rate of each East Asian currency in

terms of the AMU during the benchmark period as the benchmark exchange rate.

Table 8 shows the AMU weights as well as trade volumes, GDP measured at PPP,

15   We should consider not only the trade accounts but also capital accounts, especially
     foreign direct investments (FDI) to choose the currency basket weights. However, it is
     for the moment unnecessary to take into account capital accounts in choosing the
     currency basket weights because some East Asian countries have still strict capital
     controls. On the other hand, Ogawa and Shimizu (2005) tried to use international
     reserve as an indicator of basket weights to calculate the AMU based on the basket
     weights of International reserve. In this case, the weights of the Japanese yen and the
     Chinese yuan in the currency basket are 39.59 percent and 27.41 percent,
     respectively.
16
     These weights were calculated by the average trade volume share of all sampled East
     Asian countries vis-à-vis the US and the euro area for 2001-2003.
17   For the benchmark period, the exchange rate of the AMU in terms of the US$-euro is
     set at unity.


                                              18
arithmetical average of shares, and the benchmark exchange rates. By using the

AMU weights, we calculate the nominal exchange rate of the AMU in terms of the

US$-euro as the weighted sum of each country's US$-euro exchange rate.

          Figure 3 shows the daily movements of the AMU in terms of the US$-euro.

For reference, we add the daily movements of the AMU in terms of the US dollar

and the euro. Figure 4 shows daily movements in exchange rates of the East Asian

currencies vis-à-vis the AMU. 18 In the next section, we will use these exchange

rates to simulate the nominal effective exchange rates of East Asian countries.




5. The stabilization effects on the effective exchange rates under the AMU


          In this section, we investigate the stabilization effects of the AMU peg

system on the effective exchange rates of the East Asian currencies. We compare the

stability of the Ease Asian currencies in terms of nominal effective exchange rates

under several currency peg systems because we regard that the stability of nominal

effective exchange rate leads to the stability of real effective exchange rate in most

of the East Asian countries except for some high-inflation countries such as

Indonesia. 19



18   We set the exchange rate indexes equal to 100 in January 3, 2000.
19   Williamson (2005) also used the nominal effective exchange rate. He explained that
     the difference between a nominal and a real effective exchange rate is simply the
     weighted average inflation rate in the countries whose currencies are in the effective
     exchange rate and that there are no major countries with high inflation rates at the
     present time. However, Kawai and Takagi (2000) indicated that stability of the real
     effective exchange rate is important for macroeconomic stability in the East Asian
     countries.


                                             19
        As McKinnon (2002) emphasized, a major objective of adopting a common

currency peg within a region is an insulation effect of the trading relationship of the

region from the disturbances of outside currencies. In other words, a common

currency peg guarantees that any changes in exchange rates against third-countries

such as the US dollar and the euro would never disturb the trading relationships

among the East Asian countries themselves. However, Williamson (2005) examined

whether use of a common currency basket would provide adequate stability of

effective exchange rate of the participating country currencies. Furthermore, he

examined two different types of currency basket peg. One is the currency basket

which is composed by all major trading partners and other is the currency basket

which is composed by currencies of the outside trading partners. In practice, the

former type includes other East Asian currencies and based on its own trade

pattern. On one hand, the latter type uses a common currency basket of outside

currencies, such as the US dollar, the euro, and the Japanese yen. We call the latter

type of currency basket as a common G3 currency basket in order to distinguish it

from the AMU. Alternatives of currency basket weights are shown in table 9.

       According to the empirical analysis in Williamson (2005), we simulate how

the effective exchange rates would have moved under the alternative exchange rate

systems by using the daily exchange rate changes during a past period. Williamson

applied two exchange rate systems, which include an individual currency basket

peg system and a common G3 currency basket peg system. In addition to his results,

we simulate the effective exchange rates under the AMU peg system by using

exchange rates of the East Asian currencies vis-à-vis the AMU.

       Furthermore, we suppose three different cases under the AMU peg system in



                                          20
the region. 20 The first is the case where only one country adopts the AMU peg

system. The second is the case where ASEAN countries adopt the AMU peg system.

The third is the case where all of the AMU participating countries adopt the AMU

peg system. In order to compare the results with each other, we choose the same

East Asian currencies and use the same basket weights as Williamson (2005)

calculated each nominal effective exchange rate in his analysis.

          Table 10 shows the analytical results. The first column shows the standard

deviation of nominal effective exchange rates of the seven East Asian currencies

calculated from the actual historical data. These were calculated by the standard

deviations of period end monthly nominal effective exchange rates from the

International Financial Statistics of the IMF. 21 The second column shows the

results under an individual country basket peg system. 22 The third column shows

the results under a common G3 currency basket peg system. 23 The forth column,


20   As Williamson (2005) noted, we assume that countries have a rigid peg to their
     basket so that the exchange rates of participating currencies were always equal to
     their central rates in order to make these simulation.
21   By way of exception, effective exchange rate data for Indonesia are from Thomson
     Datastream Series JPMIDNB. Data for South Korea and Thailand real effective
     exchange rates are from the Citibank CTERI database (Williamson, 2005).
22   Nominal effective exchange rates with individual-country pegs are calculated as
     follows: The weights shown in table 9, column 1, were used to calculate what the US
     dollar exchange rate (local currency/US dollar) would have been. Actual exchange
     rates against the US dollar were used to derive other hypothetical rates. These were
     combined with the trade weights to estimate a hypothetical time path for the nominal
     effective exchange rates (Williamson (2005)).
23   Common basket pegs composed by G3 currencies are calculated using 1999 as the
     base year (1US dollar=0.9363euro and 1US dollar =113.91yen), with the weights of
     dollar, euro and yen composition of 40.2, 31.6, and 28.2 respectively. From these, the


                                             21
which is added to the results of Williamson (2005), shows the results under the

AMU peg system. 24

          As a whole, the AMU peg system would have stabilized the effective

exchange rates in all of the sampled countries. The results indicate that the AMU

peg system can reduce fluctuations of their effective exchange rates by reducing

instability of intra-regional exchange rates. Furthermore, the AMU peg system

would be more effective in reducing the instability of effective exchange rates as the

number of country who applies the AMU peg system increases. On one hand,

comparing the common G3 currency basket peg system, the AMU peg system would

have led to more stability than a common G3 currency basket peg system in four

(Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea and Thailand) of the seven cases. We

suppose that the AMU peg system is effective in stabilizing home currencies for the

countries whose trade weights on Japan are relatively higher.




6. Conclusion


          We investigated the stabilizing effects of a common currency basket system

on effective exchange rates of the East Asian currencies. In this paper, we suppose

the AMU as a common currency basket to investigate whether the AMU peg system


     local currency/US dollar, euro, and yen implied by the basket composition and
     dollar/euro/yen exchange rates are calculated. These are weighted by the
     individual-country trade weights to yield the nominal effective exchange rates with
     the common basket peg (Williamson (2005)).
24   We calculate each country’s nominal effective exchange rates by using the exchange
     rate data of the US dollar, the euro, and the East Asian currencies vis-à-vis the AMU
     with the same weights of own basket in table 9, column 1.


                                             22
would provide the stability of their effective exchange rates.

       As we overviewed in Section 2, we found that the actual exchange rate

systems adopted by East Asian countries have basically changed from the US dollar

peg to more flexible exchange rate system. The movements make a variety of

exchange rate systems among East Asian countries. However, the East Asian

currencies have still an overwhelming weight on the US dollar. A common currency

basket peg would contribute to stability of the intra-regional exchange rates. As

many previous researches showed, there are several types of currency basket, such

as a currency basket composed by outsiders’ currencies (the US dollar and the euro)

and a currency basket composed by intra-regional currencies (AMU).

       In this paper, we investigate the stabilization effects of an AMU peg system

on East Asian currencies. We compare our analytical results with stabilization

effects of a common G3 currency basket peg system, which shown in Williamson

(2005). We obtained the following results. First, the AMU peg system is more

effective in reducing fluctuations of the effective exchange rates of East Asian

currencies as a number of East Asian countries adopted the AMU peg system

increases. Second, the AMU peg system stabilizes the effective exchange rates more

effectively for Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand than a

common G3 currency basket peg system. These results suggest that the AMU peg

system is effective in stabilizing home currencies for the countries whose trade

weights on Japan are relatively higher.

       In order to simulate the effective exchange rates, we assume that the

monetary authorities of the East Asian countries have a rigid peg to their currency

baskets so that the exchange rates of participating currencies were always equal to



                                          23
their central rate. More practically, we can assume more flexible system where the

monetary authorities adopt a common currency peg with a band. We will resolve

this point in our further research.

       In addition, it is difficult for us to deny that our analysis about the effect of a

common currency basket peg is backward-looking in a sense that we used the

historical data to simulate the effect of the common currency basket systems on the

effective exchange rates. Macroeconomic variables might be changed in the

presence of a common currency basket system comparing with the current exchange

rate systems. Furthermore, the monetary authorities might change their monetary

policy if they adopted a common currency basket peg. If monetary policy is used to

maintain the currency within the band of BBC (Basket, Band, and Crawling), GDP

and other macro economic variables may change. We will take into account any

effects of a common currency basket peg on a convergence of interest rates within

the region, macro economic variables, and the monetary policy operation in the near

future in order to a possible total effect of a common currency basket.

DOTS (IMF).
**: GDP measured at PPP is the average of GDP measured at PPP in 2001, 2002 and 2003 from the World
Development Report, World Bank. For Brunei and Myanmar, we use same share of trade volume since there are no
GDP data for Brunei and Myanmar.

The results of (1)(2)(3) are from Williamson (2005) and (4) are calculated by authors.
(1) Standard deviations of period end monthly nominal effective exchange rates are from IFS, May 2005 (IMF). Data for Indonesia are from Thomson Datastream Series
JPMIDNB. Data for South Korea and Thailand real effective exchange rates are from the Citibank CTERI database (January 2000=100).
(2) Nominal effective exchange rates(NEER) with individual-country pegs are calculated as follows: The weights shown in table9, column 1,were used to calculate what the
dollar exchange rate (LCU/$) would have been. Actual exchange rates against the dollar were used to derive other hypothetical rates. These were combined with the trade
weights to estimate a hypothetical time path for the NEER. The standard deviation of that path is reported in the table. All bilateral exchange rates are set at January
2000=100.
(3) Common basket pegs composed by G3 currencies are calculated using 1999 as the base year($1=0.9363euro and $1 =113.91), with the weights of dollar, euro and yen
composition of 40.2, 31.6, and 28.2 respectively. From these, the LCU/$, euro, and \ implied by the basket composition and dollar/euro/yen exchange rates are calculated.
These are weighted by the individual-country trade weights to yield the NEERs with the common basket peg. All bilateral exchange rates are set at January 2000=100.
(4) Common basket pegs (AMU) composed by ASEAN+3 currencies are calculated using 2000 and 2001 as the base year. From these, the US $, euro, \ and East Asian
currencies in terms of AMU are calculated. These are weighted by the individual-country trade weights to yield the NEERs with the AMU peg. There are three different
types of AMU peg. First is the case in which own country only applies the AMU peg. Second is the case in which AMU pegs are applied within ASEAN countries. Third is
the case in which the AMU pegs are applied within ASEAN +3 countries. All bilateral exchange rates are set at January 2000=100.
