            THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR MASTER FILE:   1959-1987


                                ABSTRACT

     This document describes the panel of publicly traded United
States manufacturing firms which was created and updated at the
National Bureau of Economic Research from 1978 through 1990
                                                            within
the Productivity Program. The panel consists of 2726 large
manufacturing firms with one to twenty-nine years of data each; the
period covered by the sampling frame was 1976 through 1987, with
data back to 1959 where possible. There are about 90 variables for
each firm-year of data: the variables give the complete income
statement, balance sheet, statement of changes, and data on the
market value f the common stock.

     The firms on the file are identified both by their CUSIP
number and by name, making it feasible to match this data to other
sources. A special feature of this data file is that all exits
from the file between 1976 and 1987 have been identified and the
reasons for exit have been tabulated in a diskette file. This file
is described in Appendix A of this document.

 1.   Introduction

      The Manufacturing Sector Master File is based on the Compustat Annual

 Industrial and Over-the-Counter Files for 1978 through 1987. Ic consists of

 90 variables per year for each of approximately 2700 firms in the

manufacturing sector (SIC codes 2000 through 3999) for as many years as data

are available. The firms in question must have been on the files and in

existence some time between 1976 and 1987; there are up to 30 years of data

per firm. This document describes how the sample was constructed and

defines the variables which are available for each firm-year observation

(49,225 observations in all).

      The final dataset is on one file: RNDPANSISASDEc89 or

RNDPAN87.MASTER DEC89   Table 2.1 shows the number of firms and the

distribution of these firms across beginning and ending years for the



 I am grateful to Kevin Hassett, Steven Kaplan, and Martha Schary for
generously supplying me with their acquisition lists for cross checking
mine, and to Matthew C. Nagler and Hortencja Nevarrez, who spent long hours
in the library looking up much of this information. Some of the data
construction work descibed here was based on earlier work described in
Hall, Cummins, Laderman, and Mundy (1988). The computer work for the
current project was supported by the National Bureau of Economic Research
and the National Science Foundation (grant no. SES-8908521) and the
research effort by the Committee on Research, University of California at
Berkeley.

 dataset. The fixed format ASCII (or EBCDIC) version of this file has the

 following characteristics:

      DSNAME—RNDPAN87 .MASTER. DEC89

     VOL—SER—volune ID

     DCB—(RECFM—FB , LRECL'-13l6 BLKSIZE—26320)
                                ,




The format is integer, floating point, and four character string variables.

In Fortran, this would be

     (2A4, 2A4, 7A4, 7A4, 715, 93F13.5)

and in SAS,

     ($8. $8. $28. $28. 7*5.0 93*13.5)

There also exists a SAS dataset on tape called RNDFAN87 (dataset name

RNDPAN87.SAs.DEc89) containing these variables, which is preferred if you

plan to use SAS to read the data. The missing value code on both the fixed

format version of the file and on the SAS dataset is the usual SAS code

(period or dot).

     In Table 2.2(a) I show an alphabetical list of the variables on the

file with a short description of each one. The table also shows the

Compustat item number if the variable came directly from that file, the

type of the variable, and its byte location on the Fortran file. Character

variables are indicated by 'CHAR.' Tables 2.2(b) and 2.2(c) show the same

list sorted by the byte location on the tape and by the location of the

variables on the original Compustat tape. Many of the variables come

directly from the Compustat files and further information can be obtained

by reference to that Codebook. Those which are computed for this dataset

are described somewhat more fully in the section following the tables. All

dollar values are in millions of current U.S. dollars.

3. Details of            Variable Construction


      This section of the documentation describes the construction of each

variable on the tape in somewhat more detail than the lists in Table 2.2.

Users who wish to know more about the variables drawn directly from the

Compustat files should consult that documentation for further information.

ADJ   -- Value   of net short-term assets, equal to current assets (CURRASST),
               less the value of inventories (BKINV), less current liabilities
               (STL1AB) plus the value of short-term debt (STDEBT). Short-term
               debt is added back in because it is treated elsewhere, and
               because it is assumed that interest is being paid on it, which is
               not the case for the other short-term liablities.

               The short-term liabilities of a firm are composed of accounts
               payable, income taxes payable, accrued expenses and costs on
               contracts, dividends declared, employee benefits, cutomer
               deposits, and the current portion of long-term debt.   This
               variable does not include unfunded pension liabilities.

               The short-term assets of a firm are cash and short-term
               investments, accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid taxes,
               estimated future tax benefits, security deposits, supplies
               and tools not in inventory, and prepaid expenses.

ADJDEP --     This year's depreciation adjusted for the effects of
               inflation. This variable is DEPREC deflated by the ratio of
               the CP deflator for fixed nonresidential investment AA (see
               NPLANT for a definition of AA, average age) years ago to the
               current GNP deflator.

ADJFACT -- Compustat data item 27, the cumulative adjustment factor for
           common stock splits, stock dividends, etc. This factor, applied
           to the per-share data, converts such data into terms of the
           share units prevailing in the last year of data. Price data
           should be divided by ADJFACT to convert to current units, while
           shares data should be multiplied by ADJFACT.

ADJFLAC -     - like   ADJFACT, but lagged one year.

ADJINV   -.     the value of the firms' inventories adjusted for the effects of
               inflation. The inventories are valued at cost (book) each year
               unless the firm has specified LIFO as one of its methods of
               inventory valuation. The use of LIFO implies that the reported
               inventory valuation will be too low and an attempt is made to


2Thjs is included in short-term debt but also exist as a separate item on
the Compustat tape. There is potentially some additional information here
on the long-term debt issued 19 years ago.




                                          13
              adjust for this, using the change in inventories from year to
              year to obtain a measure of how old the inventories are and
              inflating them accordingly.

              The process is started by setting ADJINV equal to the book value
              in the first year. Then the value of the inventories for each
              succeeding year is calculated as follows: if there is an
              increase in book inventory from last year to this, last year's
              adjusted inventories (AD.JINV) are inflated by the ratio of the
              inventory price index this year to the price index last year and
              then the increase (assumed to be in current dollars) is added.
              If there was a decrease, last year's ADJINV is inflated in the
              same way and then written down by the ratio of this year's book
              inventories to last year's. The firm uses more than one method of
              inventory valuation, the book values are combined with the
              adjusted values using proportional weights derived from the
              reported ranking of the methods. Each firm uses up to three
              inventory methods and they are ranked in order of importance on
              the tape.  I use the following rule of thumb to determine the
              weights:

                  Reported Number of        Rank of     % LIFO
                  Inventory Methods         LIFO      as weight
                        1                      1          100.0
                        2                     1            66.7
                        2                     2            33.3
                        3                     1            50.0
                        3                     2            33.3
                        3                     3            16.7

ADJTOT -.    Investments in unconsolidated subisdiaries and intangibles
             plus other investments (TOTAL) adjusted for inflation. In
             order to adjust the reported values of these items for
             inflation, we take the same approach as we did for
             inventories. In the first year, the value of ADJTOT is
             simply set equal to its book value. In each succeeding year,
             the previous year's ADJTOT is inflated by the ratio of the
             deflators for fixed residential investment in the two years
             and then the change in the book value of the investments is
             added. If there was a decrease in book, last year's inflated
             ADJTOT is multiplied by the ratio of this year's book value
             to last year's. As in the case of inventories, this
             approximation becomes more and more accurate as time goes by,
             but possibly at a slower rate, owing to the older age of the
             assets making up the TOTAL variable on average.
    -   - Compustac data item #45, advertising expense.

BKCAP -   - Net   book value of capital stock. This variable is defined as

              extraordinary items and discontinued operations.

EMPLY -- Compustat data item 29, number of employees. This is the
           number of company workers as reported to shareholders. It may be
           an average throughout the year or an end-of-year number; the
           latter is reported if both are given. It includes part-time

                                           Lb
GRATE - -    the gross rate of return to capital, defined as the ratio
              of gross cash flows to CROCAP. Cross cash flows are the sum
              of the income before extraordinary items (INCOME),
              depreciation (DEPREC), and interest income (INTRST) less an
              inventory valuation adjustment and an imputed income from
              short-term assets (the prime rate times ADJ).

GROCAP - -   the gross capital stock adjusted for inflation. This
              variable is computed as

                  GROCAP — CPLANT + ADJINV + ADJTOT.

              GPLANT is gross plant revalued as for NPLANT but with the
              gross book value of the plant as input. GPLANT itself is not
              included on the tape.

GROPLT -- Compustat data item 7, gross book value of the firm's
           physical plant.

INAME -   - the 28 character name of the 4-digit industry to which
              Compustar assigned this firm.

INCOME -- Compustat data item l8, income before extraordinary
           items and discontinued operations.

INCTAX -- Compuscat data item l6, income taxes (total, from income
           statement)

INCTAXP -- Compustat data item 7l, income taxes payable (balance sheet).

INTANC -- Compustat data item p33, intangibles.

INTRST -- Compuustat data item #15, interest expense.

INVCAP - -   Compustat data item #37, total invested capital.
INVEST - -   Compustat  data item #30, capital expenditures (gross
              investment). The amount spent for the construction and/or
              acquisition of property, plant, and equipment, including that of
              purchased companies (acquisitions).

INVMETH -- Compustat data item #59, inventory valuation method.

LCOMP - -    Compustat data item #42, labor and related expense including
              salaries, wages, profit sharing, payroll taxes, and employee
              benefits. (See DLCOMP also.)

LTDEBT - -    The value of long-term debt adjusted for its age structure.
              Long-term debt is assumed to have been financed by 20-year
              bonds. Given a matrix of bond prices in year t for a bond due
              in year s and the distribution of the firm's long-term debt by
              the year incurred, it is possible to adjust the face value of
              the debt by the bond rates in any given year. We obtain such a
              matrix of prices from the Moody's corporate BAA bond price




                                         17
             series given previously. The difficulty is to determine the age
             structure of each firms debt. In the absence of any history of
             the firm prior to 1958, the approach taken is to assume that all
             firms have an age structure of debt which is the same as the
             aggregate age structure from the 1958 Survey of Current
             Business. This distribution is shown in Table 2.4.

             After 1958, we attempt to build up each firm's own long-term
             debt distribution in the following manner: starting with the
             1958 distribution, in each successive year the amount of new
             long-term debt issued equals the change in long-term debt From
             the previous year to this plus the amount retired this year,
             which is assumed to be equal to that issued 20 years ago. There
             are two sources of error in this computation:

             a) The firm's age structure of debt may not be the same as the
             aggregate in 1958.

             b) The bonds may not always be for a twenty-year term.

             Because of these sources of error, in any year the gross new
             debt issued may be negative. If this is the case, we set this
             contribution to zero and rescale the entire tw.nty year of
             long-term debt accordingly. Given the age distribution of book
             value of long-term debt for each of the twenty-three years in
             the and the matrix of bond prices we can now compute the market
             value of debt as

                               t—1
                  (1) TL —                 BV   .
                                                    p
                             S —   t -20

             where By is the book value distribution and P      is the price in
                                                           St
             year t of a bond due twenty years from year s.

IININT -- Compustat data item #38, minority interest (balance sheet).

ETCAP - -   the   inflation adjusted net capital stock. This variable is
             computed as

              NETCAP   —   NPLANT      + ADJINV + ADJTOT

'0LCFU -- Compustat data item #52, net operating loss carry forward.

'OSHARES -- Compustat data item #25, the number of common shares
             outstanding. This variable should be multiplied by the
             adjustment factor AD.JFACT to make it comparable across the
             years.

PLANT - -   the net value of the plant adjusted for inflation. This
             quantity is obtained by multiplying the book plant value by
             the ratio of the GNP deflator for fixed nonresidential
             investment in the current year to GNP deflator AA years ago.




                                                    18
             AA is the average age of the plant and equipment for this
             firm which is deduced in the following manner: an average
             age series is obtained as the ratio of accumulated
             depreciation (gross plant minus net plant) to depreciation
             this year. This assumes straight-line depreciation.

              Then a length of life of the current plant and equipment is
              also computed as the gross plant divided by this year's
              depreciation and a five-year moving average is taken of this
              series to smooth it. This year's average age is then
              adjusted by the ratio of this year's length of life to the
              moving average. This has the effect of smoothing the age
              series slightly. If the average age exceeds nineteen years,
              it is set to nineteen years, since the deflator is only
              available back to 1939.

NRATE - -   the net rate of return to capital, defined as the ratio
              of net cash flows less the inflation adjusted value of
              depreciation (ADJDEP) divided by the net capital stock
              (NETCAP).

OPINC -   - Compustat data item l3, operating income before depreciation.
PCLOSE -- Compustat data item 24, end of calendar year stock price. This
           should be divided by ADJFACT to make it comparable to data in
           other years.

PENSPAST -- Compustat data item 9O, unfunded pension costs, past or prior
           service.

              benefits.

PHIGH -- Compustat data item #22, price of common -    high during year. This
              variable should be divided by ADJFACT to make it comparable to
              data in other years.

LQ    - - Compustat data item #23, price of common - low during year. This
              variable should be divided by ADJFACT to make it comparable to
              data in other years.

PREFD •- Compustat data item #19, dividends on preferred stock.

PREFST -- Compustat data item #10, preferred stock (liquidating value).

                                      19
                  charged to operations for the rental of space and/or
                  equipment.

RETEARN -- Compustat data item #36, retained earnings.

RND -- Cornpustat data item #46, expenditures on research and development.
           The private (company-funded) expenditures on the development of
           new products and services including software but excluding
           customer of government-sponsored expenditures, exploration,
               engineering expense, inventor royalties, and market research and
               testing. Because continuous history of this variable is needed
               for the construction of RSTOCK. when it was randomly missing for
               one year in the middle of a continuous sequence of reported R&D,
               I interpolated a value using the model described in Appendix B.
               This model assumes that the logarithm of R&D expenditures evolves
               as a random walk, which is justified by the patterns of R&D
               spending actually observed. The interpolation affected less than
               ten percent of the firms.

               Before use, this variable is generally deflated by the deflator
               shown in Table 2.3, which is a weighted average of an index of
               hourly labor compensation and the implicit price deflator in the
               non-financial corporate sector. The weights are 0.49 and 0.51
               respectively, and the methodology is patterned on Jaffe (1972).
               The underlying data is from U.S. Department of Labor,
               Productivity Costs in Nonfinancial Corporations, various issues.
     -   - This quantity is the one-period (year) rate of return to
               holding a share of the company's common stock over the
               calendar year. The definition of the one-period rate of
               return at time t is the following:

                      —


               where Pt is the price of the common stock at the end of the year
               and d are the dividends received per share during the year. Note
               that for this definition it is important to be careful that
              measures the same share of the company as Pt.

RSTOCK -    - thestock of R&D capital, constructed from the history of R&D

    -   - DNIJM, the Compustat 4-digit Industry code. This variable should be
               between 2000 and 3999. However, since some firms change industry
               in some years (this most often happens in 1980-1982, when data
               from the earlier Compustat tapes was spliced to data from the
               1980 versions), there are a few firms with SIC codes outside of
               manufacturing, at least in some years.

                errors in the industrial file we received for 1959-1978, this

4. Sample Construction

     The construction of the sample proceeded in the following way (the

peculiarities of datafile year selection are due to availability of the

tapes): the sample was defined to be all firms in the R&D Master File

constructed at the NBER in 1979-1982 and 1986-1987 (Hall et al. 1988), plus

all manufacturing firms on the Compustat Annual Industrial and OTC files for

1986 and 1987, augmented by a few non-manufacturing firms which were

formerly manufacturing firms or which acquired manufacturing firms during

the period.

     First, a list of firms to be selected was constructed by starting with

the 1985 panel and adding all manufacturing firms which were on the

Compustat Headers for the 1986, 1987 Industrial files, and the 1987 OTC file

(the 1986 OTC file was unavailable). For all firms the latest appearance of

the firm in the file was recorded; this produced a list of 2863 unique firms

called PAN87HDA.JUN89, together with the name of the file from which their

data was to be selected (IND, OTC, RES for the pre-1981 files, ID81-IND87,

OTC81-0TC87, and RES84 for the post-1981 files). This list of headers was

combined with the headers for the firms on the 1986 and 1987 Research Files

to ensure that we had selected all manufacturing firms (only a small number

of additional firms were taken from the Research files); the new list

contained 2953 firms. All firms on this list (approximately 1200) which did

not appear in one of the two current 1987 files were printed out.

     This list of about 1200 firms was called (ultimately) EXITALL.JUL89,

and it was used to investigate the reason for every exit from the panel

between 1976 and 1987. The results of this investigation are documented in




                                   26
a separate Section (AppendiX A). For the purposes of this project. :e

important fact is that it included approximately 150 firms which changed

their name or reorganized, causing a change to the CUSIP number of the firm

and thus a spurious exit. These cases needed eventually to have their data

spliced between observations under the new and old CUSIPs. To prepare for

this, the list of new CUSIPs was run against the current panel master header

(PA87HDA.JUN89), and a few firms were found which had been overlooked for

some reason (usually a change of industry). The library work involved in

identifying all the exits also identified a few problems (duplicates, etc.)

in PAN87HDA, and the ultimate cleaned list of firms to be selected contained

2897 firms.

       The next t..sk was to obtain the actual data; the goal was to maximize

both the number of years of data available for each firm and to maximize

the number of non-missing values for each variable. To do this, at least

two tapes (of different vintages) were used as sources for many of the

firms. A series of jobs (SELIND.., SELOTC. .   , and   SELRES. .)   were run to

select those observations which were to come from the Annual Industrial

1981, 1983-1987, OTC 1981, 1983-1985, 1987, and Research Industrial 1984,

1987 files. The number of observations thus selected is shown in Table

4.1.

       The output tapes from these jobs (ANNIND81-87, OTCINC81-87, and

RESIND84-87) were merged and reformatted by MKCS8187 to a single file

(CS8187.REFORNAT) which was organized one firm-year per record,

approximately 40,000 observations in all. This was done so that the data

could be updated more easily in the next step. In addition, to save space,

all firm-year observations with no data were deleted and the last 100 of the

175 variables available for each firm-year were also deleted. A few of




                                      27
these variables (locations 71, 7, 89, 90, 107-116, 127, 128, 129) were

moved to lower-valued locations (51, 54, 57, 58, 6170, 40, 55, 71), since

they would be needed later. Also, the fiscal year month (FYR) was placed

in location 50 and footnotes 1 (mergers), 3 (R&D), 22 (labor compensation),

and 25 (seasonal and parttime employees) were recoded for dummies in

location 72-75. Finally, the lagged adjustment factor was placed in

location 28. This variable is necessary to provide continuity in the per

share data when Compustat tapes of different vintages are spliced.

    A parallel selection and reformatting was constructed using the old

Compustat tapes CIND5981, CRES5978.EDIT, and COTC61S2.FIX8O with the

following difference: all firms on these tapes (those in both the primary

and secondary columns of Table 4.1) were selected by data for long-lived

firms (more than 20 years old). This yielded a total of 1379 old

industrial firms, 166 old Research firms, and 495 old OTC firms. These

files (OLDCIND, OLDCOTC, and OLDCRES) were then reformatted by MKOLDIND,

MKOLDOTC, and MKOLDRES, yielding 45,927 firm-year observations in the same

format as CS8187.REFORNAT.

     The same kind of selection and reformatting exercise was performed by

jobs SELRSIIJP, SELR84UP, SELR86UP, SELR87UP, and MKCR8187 to obtain the 735

firms in the secondary column of Table 4.1, yielding about 14700 firm-year

observations. This was done because occasionally firms exit from the main

Compuscat files before their last one or two years of data are recorded,

so that it is necessary to obtain the additional data from the Research

file, where the firm is placed after it exits. This is a very important

step if we are interested in pre- and post-acquisition behavior of firms.

     The five reformatted files OLD... .REFORMAT, CS8187.REFOPJ4AT, and

CSR8187.REFORMAT were merged by MRCCS87 to make CS87SLEP.INPUT in the




                                    28
following way: the files were sorted by firm and year; the primary file was

CS8187, which was merged with the OLD   files   so that only one firm-year was

taken for each observation, but with the most recent data (in terms of

vintage of the tape source). The file CSR8187 was then used to update this

data in such a way that no missing values were allowed to replace existing

data. This maximizes data availability for each firm.       I ended up with

about 73,000 observations, of which about 50,000 contained good data on

most of the variables. This means that there are on average about 17 years

of data per firm (out of 30 years possible at the maximum).

     This file still needed to be updated for name and CUSIP changers; this

was done (twice, since some firms changed names twice) by the jobs CSS7NCR

and CS87NCR2, which changed all the CUSIPs on the name changers to the most

recent and then merged the data. The old names were saved on the early

observations so such a splicing can still be detected. The end result was

a file called CS87SLEP.INPUT with 49,225 good observations (since some

duplicate observations were deleted after the merging). This file was

 reformatted back into a panel with 30 years of data per firm for use by the

 SLEPIAI program.3   The final yield was 2726 firms (2897 less 171 name

 changers).

      The file CS87SLEP.INPUT was processed by the SLEPIAN program in order

 to calculate the book values of the capital stock components adjusted for

 inflation, the market value of the common stock, preferred stock, and long

 term debt, and the stock of R&D capital. The list of the new variables

 created by SLEPIAN is shown in Table 4.2; the output file from this

 program (with the same 49,225 good records plus 32,795 phony records which



   This program owes its name to Arthur Slepian, a graduate student at
 Stanford University who wrote the first version for Brainard, Shoven, and
 Weiss in 1978-79.
had been added to create a balanced panel) was called SLEPIAN.OUT.

     This file was reformatted slightly by deleting the 32,795 bad records

and converting to fixed format in order to create the R&D Panel Master file

described in this document. A SAS file containing SAS missing value codes

was created at the same time.

     The number of firms shown in the primary column is the number for which
the file is the original source of the firm data; this defines the sample.
The number in the secondary column is the number of firms for which
additional years of data were obtained from that file and spliced into :he
main observation.

     The first file in each section (denoted 1978, 1980, and 1978
respectively) were actually merged versions of the older Compustat files
constructed for the earlier master file. The ones for the Industrial and
Research samples contained data for 1959 through 1981, and the one for OTC
contained data for 1960 through 1982.

                          EXITLIST Documentation:

      Exits from the Publicly Traded Hanufacturing Sector 1977-1987



    The EXITLIST dataset contains information on all the firms in the

manufacturing sector which exited from the Compustat Annual Industrial and

OTC Files between 1977 and 1987 (11 years of exits). The data which are

supplied are the reason for exit, the actual year of the exit, and the name

and CUSIP of the acquiring or other new firm if available. The data are

contained in an ASCII file on floppy diskette, one line per exit, sorted by

CUSIP number of the exiting firm. A complete listing of the variables on

the file is given on page 10.

     The file was constructed in the following way: A list of firms which

were ever in manufacturing between 1976 and 1987 was constructed by

choosing firms from the old R&D Panel (the 1985 edition; see Hall et al.

1988), and augmenting this with any other firms which were ever in SIC 2000

through 3999 and which existed on the Annual Industrial files for 1981 or

1983 through 1987. From this combined and merged list I selected any firms

which had no data in 1987 and could thus be presumed to have exited for

some reason. This yielded a list of approximately 1200 firms which existed

on the files sometime between 1976 and 1986 but were not there in 1987, our

of a total panel of approximately 3000 firms. I also retained the year in

which each of the firms last had good data, and for some of them, the year

and reason for exit which is given on the Compustat Research file.1

reasons for exit. The first source was the Directory     Obsolete

Securities (1983, 1987, 1989), followed by the Capital Changes Reporter

(various dates through 1989). Both sources are extremely good at

identifying final acquirers (rather than just offers) as well as the price

paid for common. They also record Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 filings (both

of which I treat as bankruptcy, even though the firm may emerge from

Chapter 11 a few years later and reappear on Compustat) and liquidations

(the breaking up of the assets of the firm, with the shareholders receiving

the proceeds). Finally, they give the new names when the firm changes

names (leading to a change of CUSIP, and hence an 'exit" from Compusrat),

and they describe any recapitalizations or reorganizations which may have

occurred.

     Neither of these sources clearly identifies the type of acquirer,

whether publicly traded, private, or foreign. Nor do they state clearly

whether the transaction was leveraged, although one can often tell by the

type of deal involved. To obtain this information, I used the following

strategies:

     1) I identified publicly traded firms by finding them in the Compustat

files and recording their CIJSIPs (this enables one to match data for target

and buyer later on).

     2) I identified private acquisitions from the list published by Lehn

and Poulsen (1989), and from various directories of public and private

corporations (Directory    Corporate Affiliations, Key British Enterprises,

etc.).

    3) I identified LBOs from the list supplied to me by Steven Kaplan

(Kaplan 1989) and from the Merger        Acguisition Sourcebook, which

identifies the type of transaction. This left me with quite a few

acquirers unassigned; those with PLC (the U.K.), AG (West Germany), NV

(Netherlands), AB (Sweden), SA (France or Switzerland), SpA (Italy), LTD

(the U.K. or Canada), or obvious foreign names were identified as foreign.

although if they had a CUSIP it was retained (some are traded directly or

as ADR shares on the U.S. stock exchanges and thus have data available).

then looked up the remaiuder again in various             _m    directories;

any subsidiaries were recoded to the name of the parent firm.        This   yielded

positive identification of public and foreign firms; any remaining puzzles

(very few) I coded as private. Public acquiring firms which are not on

Compustat or CRSP have a CUSIP equal to 0 on my list.

     4) Finally, I verified that all acquirers and new names which had

CUSIPs were in my sample. Some were not, mostly because the firms had

changed industries and become non-manufacturing.      I added these firms to my

sample so that data from them would be available for post-merger analysis.

and I checked that these new firms had not also exited; for those which

had, steps one through four were repeated until I had all possible

acquirers.

      The final list of exits contains 1224 firms and 6 variables. The data

 on the list are the following:


      1. CUSIP - -   The six-digit CUSIP of the firm which exited.

      2. CNAME -- The name of the firm which exited.

      3. ACQYR - - The year in which the actual acquisition, bankruptcy,
 liquidation, or name change took place. This is not necessarily the
 year in which the firm exited from the file; frequently it is later.
 There will be exits up until 89, since data may disappear much earlier
 from Cornpustat (and my sample is all firms which do not have data in




                                         37
87 and possibly earlier years)

     4. ACQRSN — A code telling why the firm exited from the file:

     M The firm was acquired by another publicly traded firm.
     P   The firm went private (or was purchased by a -rivately held firm).
     FL The firm went private in a leveraged buvout.
     F The firm was acquired by a foreign entity.
     C   The fitm is controlled by another publicly traded firm and
         has been deleted from the file by Compustat.

     B   The firm went bankrupt (no real distinction between Chapter 7
         and Chapter 11 in my data).
     L   The firm was liquidated.

     R   The firm underwent reorganization and may have later reappeared.
         (This includes some bankruptcies).
     NC The firm changed its name (and hence its CUSIF). The new name
         and CTJSIP are shown as the acquiring firm.

     NO After much investigation, no reason for exit was found and the firm
         is still in existence.
     D   The firm is still in existence and still (at least to a certain
         extent) publicly traded, but it has been delisted from an exchange
         and Compustat no longer carries its data.

     5. ACTJSIP -- The CUSIP of the acquiring or liquidating firm, or
new firm if a name changer or recapitalizer.

     6. ANAME - - The name of the acquiring, liquidating, or
reorganizing firm. Lower case entries provide other information about
the exit (or give generic purchasers, such as "employees").

                     The Construction of the R&D Stock Variable:

                         Interpolating the Missing Values of R&D



    To construct a variable that measures the stock of R&D capital

owned by a firm, we use a method due to Criliches (1981; Criliches and

Mairesse 1981, Griliches and Hall 1982). This method is based on a

standard perpetual inventory equation with declining balance

depreciation:

(1) Kt — (1     -
                    6)   K + Rt
                         t—1




where K is the end-of-period stock of R&D capital and R is the

(real) expenditures during the year. The depreciation rate 6 is

chosen to be 15 percent per year; Criliches and Mairesse found that

the exact choice of depreciation rate made little difference in

production function estimates. This is not surprising since, if R&D

expenditures are roughly constant in real terms, the stock of R&D

capital is



      K —           (1 -   6)S R   —
             s—O



The variation across firms will then be approximately the same,

regardless of the value of 6 and the magnitude of the coefficient will

just vary inversely with 6. This means that separate identification

of 6 and the coefficient of K in an equation will be difficult.
         i-o iA1ssing data problems must be confronted when making a stock

out of a series of flow variables: first, the problem of initial

conditions for the stock, and second, the fact that a single missing

value for R&D in one year will cause all the associated stock

variables to be missing. We solve the first problem by setting the

initial stock to the R&D expenditures in the first year divided by the

sum     of   the depreciation rate £ and a presample growth rate of new R&D

of 8 percent per year. Thus the individual stock is approximately

four times the level of R&D in the first year. The second problem is

solved as described below, by interpolation where there are only one

or two missing values in an R&D series. This procedure affects

relatively few firms.

         Assume that we observe R and R                                                   (with s>l) but not R                          ,   R

To perform this computation, I write the density of                                                     and Z as

so that the conditional density is

              Now make the more realistic assumption that r —                                           log R, the
 natural logarithm of R&D expenditures follows a random walk instead,

T    estimate a2, the variance                       of the shock, we use the method of

moments   and the observed growth rates in R:

where   the last term uses the information contained in the size of the

jump over   which we are trying to interpolate. e                                           denotes         r       -

data estimate of .                    Given an estimate of a2, we can form an unbiased

forecast of R              using all the available data:
