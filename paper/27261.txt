                                          ABSTRACT

In the wake of the global pandemic known as COVID-19, retirees, along with those hoping to
retire someday, have been shocked into a new awareness of the need for better risk management
tools to handle longevity and aging. This paper offers an assessment of the status quo prior to the
spread of the coronavirus, evaluates how retirement systems are faring in the wake of the shock.
Next we examine insurance and financial market products that may render retirement systems
more resilient for the world’s aging population. Finally, potential roles for policymakers are
evaluated.

       It would have been understandable if, on January 1 of 2020, retirement system sponsors

around the world felt at least a bit optimistic about their ability to provide retirement security to

the world’s aging population. International capital markets had largely rebounded from the 2008-

09 Global Financial Crisis (GFC), albeit with some weaknesses. Unemployment had plummeted

after the GFC, and few experts foresaw recession on the horizon. A mere five months later,

however, the COVID-19 virus changed everything. Amid the pandemic’s spread, capital market

values shuddered, healthcare systems staggered with millions of infected patients, joblessness shot

up, retirement funding shrank, government tax revenue contracted, and unprecedented government

spending had become the new normal. Still unknown is how the world will pay for the trillions in

stimulus efforts rolled out amid a massive global recession; fewer still have thought about how

global retirement systems will need to be reimagined in the wake of the global pandemic.

       This paper offers perspective about how to build more resilient retirement systems,

outlining innovative pension designs for both the public and private sectors in developed as well

as developing economics. Undoubtedly, the pandemic’s economic fallout will be far worse in

poorer nations, and the recovery slower, as their healthcare systems are ill-equipped to contain the

damages and their national budgets are more strapped. Yet the fact remains that the twin trends of

declining fertility and rising longevity will continue to spur the growth of aging populations around

the world, for whom retirement systems are going to be increasingly important as a source of old-

age income.
                                                                                                3


       In what follows, I first offer a brief synopsis of where retirement programs stood on the

eve of the pandemic. Next, I outline some of the actual and anticipated impacts of the COVID-19

shock to both the global macroeconomy and retirement systems around the world. Then I introduce

a set of ideas that could strengthen retirement programs as they help workers build assets

supportive of retirement security and help retirees manage their money during the decumulation

phase. This is followed by a discussion of how policymakers might wish to bring greater resiliency

to retirement systems, along with thoughts about efforts to support people as they plan and save

for retirement, invest, and manage their payouts.



I. Retirement Systems Pre-COVID-19

A. The Legacy of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC)

       The GFC of 2008-9 brought into sharp focus several factors threatening public and private

pension systems. For one thing, while people were living longer, very few worked sufficiently

long to offset their rising need for retirement spending (OECD 2019; see Figure 1). The fact that

the elderly are spending more years in retirement has resulted in worsening pension funding

patterns, meaning that revenues received to support payouts have fallen below those needed to

maintain solvency. Indeed, the World Economic Forum (2017: 7) estimated that “[t]he retirement

savings gap …will grow by 5% each year to ~$400 trillion by 2050. This means an additional $28

billion of deficit each day.”

Figure 1 here

       Many of the most troubled pension systems around the world are of the defined benefit

(DB) variety, where the benefit formula depends on workers’ years of service and labor earnings

(IRS, 2020). For instance, the (now frozen) General Motors unionized workers defined benefit
                                                                                                                     4


plan paid a basic monthly benefit equal to $54 multiplied by the individual’s work years if he were

to claim his benefit after 29 years of service, minus an early retirement penalty and a $771/month

supplement: his total benefit would then be $1,766/month. If he deferred claiming by just one year,

he would have received a “30 and out” supplement boosting his monthly benefit by almost 80%,

to $3,170 (United Auto Workers 2018). Most state and local government pensions, as well as

numerous national pensions, are also of the defined benefit variety, though the benefit formulas

vary widely and at least some are moving to the defined contribution model (Aubrey and Wandrei

2020). 1

           DB plans around the world have long been facing rising underfunding, in part due to an

aging population driving higher retiree benefit claims despite a shrinking working age population

on which contributions (or taxes) can be levied. Plan fiduciaries have also been accused of using

inaccurate assumptions when projecting pay increases and retiree longevity, resulting in benefit

payments exceeding what had been anticipated (and financed). 2 Still another source of DB pension

pressure is that plan sponsors frequently have failed to deposit their so-called required

contributions in the plans, leading to persistent underfunding. 3 Moreover, DB plans have tended

to invest in risky assets including equities, hedge funds, and alternative investments, none of which

were selected to defease, or match, benefit promises. This led to substantial asset meltdowns during

the GFC (and more recently as well). Prior to the COVID-19 market downturn, US public DB plan

underfunding had escalated to $4 trillion (Rauh 2017). Around the same time, Citi (2016)

  In many European nations, the pension scheme uses a points system, where workers accrue points computed by
dividing annual pay by the “cost” of a pension point. By contrast, in a notional accounts system, each worker’s pay is
multiplied by a contribution rate credited to his account using a notional interest rate. In both the latter cases, the
accrued points or notional accounts are annuitized to determine the monthly benefit (OECD 2005: 71).
2
  Here we can only mention in passing the heated arguments regarding the choice of discount rate used by DB plan
actuaries to compute their liabilities; see Gold (2015).
3
  For instance, contributions by US public pension sponsors fell short of minimum requirements by $26 billion in
2017. The minimum requirement is “the amount that would be required to keep pension debt from growing if
investment returns had equaled plans’ assumed rates” (PEW 2019: 2).
                                                                                                     5


estimated that implicit global government obligations due to public sector pension promises

amounted to $34 trillion, or double the size of explicit government debt. Matters are likely much

worse now (Comtois 2020).

       Defined contribution (DC) plans are the main alternative to DB plans. In these, what is

specified is the amount to be contributed to a retirement account (often as a percent of payroll),

frequently matched by an employer contribution. Account assets are invested as directed by

employees in U.S. 401(k) plans (and sometimes, by employers too), while in other cases

governments select the asset mix (e.g., Singapore’s Provident Fund). Workers who contribute

steadily and invest well can anticipate retirement benefits paid as a lifelong annuity (income for

life), a lump sum, or according to a phased withdrawal pattern (as in Chile). Of the total $47 trillion

in global pension assets in 2019, it was estimated that DC plans held over half the total assets under

management, surpassing global DB assets (WTW 2020).

       DC plans differ from DB plans in that, as long as required employee and employer

contributions are deposited as due in the accounts, plan assets by definition are equal to what is

owed to participants. Accordingly, employers bear no underfunding risk. DC plans also offer

employees the opportunity to hold lower-cost investment funds than many could access on their

own, and their accounts may be portable from one firm to another when workers change jobs.

Nevertheless, DC plans also transfer investment risk to employees’ shoulders, as these plans

generally do not guarantee any particular benefit level in retirement (Mitchell et al., 2011). Given

widespread global financial illiteracy as well as substantial consumer ambiguity about investments

(Lusardi and Mitchell 2014; Dimmock et al. 2016), it is difficult to expect that most people can

make well-considered account investment decisions. Accordingly, many private and public plan

sponsors have adopted so-called Target Date Funds (TDFs) as the default investments into which
                                                                                                     6


workers are automatically enrolled on joining their plans. These include offerings with portfolio

allocations described in terms of an expected year of retirement (Mitchell and Utkus 2020). DC

plan participants also bear longevity risk, perhaps running out of assets if they draw down their

accounts too quickly. This is a concern in many countries, including the U.S. and Australia, where

DC plans have traditionally not provided retirees a simple way to convert retirement assets into

insured income payouts. This problem is a growing concern, as cognitive aging problems

increasingly beset the world’s aging population (c.f., Santucci 2019; Mazzona and Peracchi, 2018;

Korniotis and Kumar 2011).

B. Other Challenges to Global Retirement Systems

        Policymakers had also identified several other factors challenging retirement saving and

retirement security before the pandemic sprang into view. One deep concern in many developing

countries has been low rates of retirement system coverage. This arises when a substantial

portion of the working population pays into no retirement system; reasons for this include labor

market informality (often driven by low wages), distrust in government and/or financial

institutions, lack of financial literacy, high discount rates, high fees, and/or the existence of self-

help groups providing a modicum of community risk sharing (OECD nd). For instance, fewer than

one-third of China’s total workforce currently pays into a retirement system of any kind (Jackson

et al. 2019).

        Low coverage rates have also spread due to the growth of non-standard or ‘gig work’ for

part-time, temporary, and self-employed persons who have no employer offering pension saving

arrangements. This is especially problematic for low-paid workers (OECD 2019). Despite a

recognition of this problem, efforts to extend coverage by mandating contributions are often

politically unpopular, including in Chile where the government sought (rather controversially) to
                                                                                                          7


require contributions to the national DC plan by self-employed workers who were not previously

covered (Joubert and Todd, 2011). Yet Israel was able to mandate pension contributions totaing

20% of pay for the self-employed, in 2011 (Wrobel 2009). Another consideration is that

sometimes, efforts to automatically enroll noncovered low-wage workers into retirement plans

results in them incurring additional debt (Beshears et al. 2019; Andersen and Hansen, 2020). This

offsets some of the positive effects of pension autoenrollment (Benartzi and Thaler 2004). Finally,

high unemployment rates and extended period of joblessness can reduce pension payouts when

old-age benefits paid by the government depend on the number of years that workers contribute to

the funds.

        A different concern regarding retirement systems around the world has been that pension

system early retirement rules, generous benefits, and high taxes on earnings have induced

people to retire earlier than they might have otherwise (OECD 2019). Moreover, such practices

fly in the face of research showing that older workers in as policy recommendations many

developed countries have the “health capacity” to work several more years (Coile et al. 2017). A

related behavioral finding pertains to how retirement benefits are “framed.” For instance, Brown

et al (2016) showed that people would elect to take their benefits more than one year earlier, when

presented with a breakeven calculation framing the decision to take Social Security benefits as a

risky bet on their own length of life, versus a presentation emphasizing the longevity insurance

aspects of the choice. 4

        These design problems have prompted half of the OECD nations to implement so-called

“parametric pension system reforms” in the last decade, by boosting contribution rates, indexing

retirement ages to longevity, lowering benefits, expanding mandatory pension coverage, and


4
  Moreover, framing the claiming decision in terms of gains generated later claiming patterns, compared to a
presentation of losses incurred by claiming benefits early.
                                                                                                               8


changing tax rules for retirees. The European Union also recently rolled out a new individual

account-based DC plan covering workers across the EU, known as the Pan-European Pension

Program (PEPP), seeking to enhance retirement saving as well as labor mobility across the region.

Nevertheless, as the OECD (2019:11) noted, such reforms can also be undone, and “[b]acktracking

on reforms that address long-term needs may leave pension systems less resilient to economic

shocks in the future and unprepared to face population ageing.” 5

        Table 1 summarizes the world pension sustainability rankings developed by Melbourne

Mercer (2019), based on that group’s assessment of each retirement system’s adequacy,

sustainability, and integrity in 2019. Denmark and the Netherlands ranked as “first class systems”

receiving a mark of A, while other European countries and Singapore clustered around a grade of

B; the US and France received a mediocre mark of C+. Scoring a barely passing mark of D were

China, Korea, Japan, India, the Philippines, and Mexico, each of which was assessed as having

major weaknesses casting pension efficacy and sustainability in doubt.

Table 1 here

        We would be remiss if we failed to mention another grave concern confronting capitalized

(funded) pensions around the world: persistently low investment returns. Even before the

COVID-19 crash, low interest rates had become a long-term reality around the world for several

years (Bernanke 2015; Lewin, 2016; Zeng, 2017). This reality has contributed to severe DB

underfunding, particularly when actual returns fall far below those assumed when computing

contribution obligations. DC plans, which are now the norm in many countries, face even more

complex challenges, since they do not have explicit funding targets yet they also suffer when

capital markets underperform. Using a life cycle dynamic optimization model, Horneff et al.


5
  For instance French President Macron recently concluded that it was necessary to withdraw his recommendation to
raise the normal retirement age from 62 to 64 (Nossiter 2020).
                                                                                                   9


(2019b) showed that, in a low interest rate environment, DC plan participants tend to save less,

hold fewer retirement assets in their employer-provided pensions, and claim their retirement

benefits later, compared to the “old normal” state of affairs.

           In sum, even before the coronavirus emerged, personal and pension savings systems around

the world were actually facing deep challenges.



II. How the COVID-19 Pandemic Affected Retirement Systems

           The COVID-19 virus emerged in Wuhan, China in the late fall of 2019, and it was declared

to be a global public health emergency at the end of January 2020 (Mogaji 2020). A dramatic sign

of the pandemic’s impact on retirement systems became rapidly evident with the U.S. equity

market crash starting February 24, 2020, followed by several aftershocks felt throughout global

financial markets. In March of 2020, global stock markets lost around $20 trillion (Slok 2020).

Some Macroeconomic Changes

           In view of the massive dislocations the virus has generated around the world, and the lack

of widespread testing as well as the nonexistence of effective and reliable treatments and vaccines,

it is difficult to forecast when a “new normal” might emerge. 6 In the larger macroeconomic

context, it has been predicted that the COVID19 epidemic will depress the real (risk-free) rate of

return for decades, and it will exert a drag on capital markets generally. Based on historical

evidence of past European pandemics, Jorda et al. (2020: np) concluded that the “after-effects of

the pandemics persist for about 40 years, with real rates of return substantially depressed.”

Offsetting this pessimistic outcome somewhat is the authors’ prediction that real wage rates will

rise over the same period. This could help offset the massive drop in the employment to population



6
    For some interesting educated forecasts see Baker et al. (2020a, b, c)
                                                                                                 10


ratio from January 2020 to April 2020: for instance in the U.S., it fell from 60% down to 52%.

Coibion et al. (2020:4) indicated this was “larger than the entire decline in the employment to

population ratio experienced during the Great Recession.” Concurrently, federal debt levels are

heading up rapidly in the EU and the US, giving rise to new concerns about fiscal sustainability

(Slok 2020).

Retirement Plan Impacts

        Meanwhile, what can we say about the near term and longer run impacts on retirement

plans? On the DB front, early evidence implies far more worrisome levels of underfunding than

before. Yet because many DB plans are allowed to “smooth” their funding patterns over several

years, it will take time before the full impact of their investment losses is fully recognized. Even

the Dutch pension plans, previously among the best funded in the world, fell from a 105% funding

rate before the COVID-19 shock, to below 70%. This is likely to require important benefit cuts

under that system’s rules (van Alfen 2020). U.S. state and local pensions are also suffering, where

plan funding has fallen from an estimated 52% to 37%. Even larger drops are foreseen for

Connecticut (now having a 28% forecasted funding rate), Kentucky (25%), New Jersey (24%),

and Illinois (20%), leaving only a few years of assets with which to pay benefits (Brown 2020).

U.S. corporate DB plans faced $619 billion in underfunding as of March 2020, up from $329

billion at the end of 2019 (Morgan Stanley 2020). Moreover, the SECURE Act of 2020 permitted

corporate DB plans to delay their 2020 contributions until 2021, to help plan sponsors conserve

cash during the worst of the COVID-19 shock (Bradford 2020b). This will not improve DB plan

funding levels, to say the least.

        National and occupational retirement systems, many of which are DB plans, are also

feeling the pain as payrolls and government tax revenue contract. Moreover, rising numbers of
                                                                                                   11


jobless workers are likely to elect early retirement payments in order to survive after

unemployment benefits run out. Unfortunately, it is difficult to clearly assess how the COVID-19

shock has altered funding ratios across global DB plans, since as the OECD (2019: 222) notes,

“Funding levels are calculated using national (regulatory) valuation methodologies of liabilities

and hence cannot be compared across countries.” 7 Nevertheless, it is already clear that such

systems will require additional funding in order to make good on retiree benefit promises. For

instance, to cover promised pension benefits, Uruguay’s pensions will require state support that

will rise from just over one percent of GDP in 2035, to close to three percent by 2075 (FIAP 2020).

The US Social Security system had already been projected to be able to pay only about three-

quarters of scheduled benefits within a dozen years, reflective of underfunding estimated at $53

trillion in present value (in perpetuity; Social Security Trustees 2020). In the wake of the pandemic,

however, some estimate that the date of fund depletion may be now be 2029, far sooner than

projected (Brandus 2020; Gladstone and Akabas 2020; LaPier 2020).

           Defined contribution plans have also experienced the market pounding of 2020, along with

the ensuing joblessness and economic pain felt around the world. Some politicians have seized the

opportunity to take over funded plan assets. In Colombia, for example, the money is being used

for political purposes, while the government is promising to pay retiree benefits at a later date

(Barria 2020). Additionally, several countries have permitted plan participants to withdraw assets

from their retirement and unemployment funds to ease financial shortfalls during the COVID-19

period. For instance, Australia has allowed withdrawals of up to A$20,000 from workers’

retirement accounts, and Congressional groups in Chile and Peru have proposed giving workers

early access to a portion of their accumulated funds intended for retirement (FIAP 2020). The 2019



7
    Gold (2015) has written extensively on this point.
                                                                                                                   12


U.S. CARES Act similarly allows DC plan participants adversely affected by the pandemic to

withdraw up to 10% or $100,000 of their retirement assets without penalty (though income tax

must be paid, spread over up to three years; Anzalone 2020). In addition, conditions have been

loosened for workers to take DC plan loans. One estimate projects that half of US workers have

already dipped or plan to dip into their retirement funds under this provision (Singh 2020).

           Whether and when such asset withdrawals are consistent with sensible economic behavior

is controversial. For instance, some advisors urge people not to spend out of their retirement

accounts when young (Leonhardt 2020), while others note that taking a plan withdrawal might

enable workers to delay the age at which they claim their Social Security benefits (Ebeling 2020),

thereby boosting eventual benefits. Another post-COVID-19 policy change important in the U.S.

DC plan context is that numerous plan sponsors have reduced or suspended their matching

contributions to workers’ accounts, seeking to maintain their cash cushions. As many as 200,000

firms may also terminate their DC plans completely (Wilcox Volz 2020). Such cuts, in addition to

the loss of employee health insurance coverage due to joblessness, will exacerbate the negative

impact of the COVID-19 shock though they may be necessary for firm survival.

           A related topic pertains to whether DC participants will alter their investment portfolios in

the wake of the COVID-19 market shock. Bu et al. (2020) analyzed changes in risk preferences in

the region of China first subject to the pandemic, finding that survey respondents displayed far

more risk aversion in February of 2020, compared to before the quarantine went into effect in

October of 2019. 8 In the US, industry reports have indicated that some near-retirees moved money

out of their Target Date Funds in the first quarter of 2020, though 99.3 percent of the employees

studied made no change (Hallez 2020). Thus far, therefore, retirement plan participant behavior in



8
    An Italian study (Beine et al. 2020) also found that people became more risk averse after natural disasters.
                                                                                                                 13


developed countries at present suggests little participant investment response, similar to what was

seen during the GFC (Tang et al. 2012). Nevertheless, some governments are encouraging changes

in DC investment portfolios. For example, the Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, has

recommended that retirement savers “bail out” companies impacted by the deep recession

afflicting the economy (Burgess 2020). Chile’s Central Bank has boosted limits on how much the

national mandatory pension system can invest in alternatives, to “help to diversify investments and

improve risk/return prospects” (Baker 2020d: np).                 For these reasons, one cannot discount

policymaker efforts to alter participants’ retirement portfolios as the “new normal” emerges.

        A topic becoming increasingly salient in the context of the global pandemic is how

population subgroups are being differentially affected (e.g., by sex, age, ethnicity/race, educational

level, and the like). Alon et al. (2020) note that “conventional” recessions have hurt men’s

employment more than women’s; by contrast, in the present environment, it appears that women,

the less-educated, and lower-paid service sector employees are bearing the brunt of both job loss

and closure of child care facilities. 9 Lower-paid workers are especially unlikely to have paid leave

or healthcare insurance from their employers, leaving them more likely to need to work while

being less well protected. Moreover, in the U.S., women hold one of every three jobs categorized

as “essential” during the current pandemic, meaning that these workers must remain on the job as

they are needed for health and safety reasons (Robertson and Gebeloff 2020). In poor countries,

the problems are even greater, particularly in slums, refugee camps, and densely populated urban

areas where sanitation and healthcare were inadequate prior to the pandemic. Moreover, since

women comprise 70 percent of healthcare workers around the world and are also responsible for

much domestic work, many are having difficulty remaining quarantined (Oxfam 2020). Global

 They also note that unemployed fathers may take on child care responsibilities which could have a potentially
positive impact on household gender equality.

inequality is also expected to spread, since epidemics are more likely to infect and kill, the poor,

and survivors are experiencing job loss and pay cuts (Fisher and Bubola 2020). Mandatory

lockdowns in India and the Philippines have stranded many workers who lack resources to obtain

even basic food supplies (Einhorn et al. 2020).

Retirement Impacts

       Beyond hollowing out DB and DC retirement plans, the COIVD-19 pandemic has also

starkly altered peoples’ retirement prospects, as workers and retirees begin to recognize their far

greater susceptibility to catastrophically expensive health problems. In times past, retirees often

relied on the “4 percent rule” as a heuristic to determine how much they could withdraw from their

pension pots to live on. Now the pandemic has spurred some financial advisers to drop this

recommendation to 2.4 percent (Wollman Rusoff 2020). In the US, the “cost of retirement,” or the

amount of money one would need to save in order to generate a payment of $1 per year for 25

years has risen by 14 percent, from $21 for a target retirement in 2040 in 2019, to almost $24 in

March 2020 (Figure 2). Importantly, these calculations do not generally make allowance for rising

out-of-pocket healthcare costs in retirement (Figure 3).

Figures 2 and 3 here

       In the background, both pension schemes and social safety net programs have now realized

they face much greater demands on them as the global recession settles in. Prior to the pandemic,

the EU already spent over a quarter of its GDP on “social protection” programs, and the crisis is

exacerbating these costs massively (The Economist 2014). Gentilini et al. (2020) found that, as of

end-March 2020, 84 countries had launched or enhanced a total of 283 social protection and jobs

programs around the world in response to the COVID-19 shock, with the vast majority of them
                                                                                                      15


transfer programs. The as-yet untold cost of these programs will need to be met in the future, but

few politicians have begun to think about how to do so effectively (Figure 4).

Figure 4 here

        Working longer is likely to be one pathway to survival, if and when the pandemic subsides

sufficiently to permit millions to seek employment. The long term job market repercussions are

not yet known, but a March 2020 survey of Americans age 55-60 indicated that 44 percent would

defer their retirement given the big drop in their retirement portfolios. Of these, 18 percent claimed

they would work at least five more years (SimplyWise 2020). When working from home is

feasible, such employment will likely be more attractive to people who otherwise would need to

commute to work via public transportation. For instance, about one-third of workers in the greater

New York City metropolitan area used public transport to get to their jobs prior to the pandemic

(Levanon et al. 2020), and a mass return to work would exposing many to high risk of contagion

(until a vaccine is available). As a result, forecasters project that there will be continued interest in

telecommuting for many occupations (Figure 4). Also several companies have encouraged

employees to work from home, and half of the firms surveyed by Willis Towers Watson were

subsidizing the costs of remote work (Moran 2020). Yet in the U.S., two-thirds of all jobs cannot

be performed at home (Malicdem 2020), and the fraction is far higher in more labor-intensive

economies (Figures 5 and 6).

Figures 5 and 6 here

        Longer term, older workers are likely to have a more mixed response to the pandemic. On

the one hand, some may retire early and claim their pensions if they are old enough to do so, rather

than confront what will likely be massive unemployment for some time to come. In so doing, their

benefits are likely to be reduced due to early claiming, portending ill for wellbeing at later ages.
                                                                                                16


On the other hand, there has been a long-term trend toward “phased” retirement and bridge jobs,

where older workers maintain a foot in the labor market without retiring completely (Quinn and

Cahill 2017). The popularity of such partial retirement patterns had been rising steadily in the US

prior to the pandemic, and as businesses re-open, it is likely that this tendency will grow post

COVID-19. The situation is rather different in poor countries such as India, where working

conditions have worsened as unemployment has risen: some states now permit firms to require

maximum work weeks of 12 hours per day, 72 hours per week, with a widespread relaxation of

labor laws (The Economist 2020).

        One big unknown is when people will be able to return to work, and what their physical

and mental condition will be when that time arises. As yet, there are no proven vaccines to protect

the uninfected, testing is woefully inadequate, and as many as half of those who are carriers are

asymptomatic (Plater 2020). Further, it is unclear whether those who have survived the disease

can become re-infected. And even after recovering from the virus, it appears that many will remain

hobbled by heart disease, impaired lung capacity, kidney and liver problems, and mental distress;

also, as with some other viruses, there is a chance that the disease may lie dormant in the body,

only to reappear years later (Healy 2020). Whether and how resilient global labor markets are

remains to be seen, but unless jobs can be found for the billions who have lost them (PPI 2020),

the economic impact of the COVID-19 will be felt for years to come.



III. Reforming Pensions Post-Pandemic To Enhance Retirement Security: The Accumulation

Phase
                                                                                                   17


       Against this backdrop of substantial economic and political uncertainty, it is important to

identify and facilitate the kinds of pension reforms that can enhance workers’ ability to save and

invest for retirement. (In the next section we focus on the decumulation phase).

       One lesson we have learned is that tying workers’ pensions (and in some countries, health

insurance) to an employment relationship is quite risky when firms go out of business and worker

mobility results. Therefore, in the wake of the pandemic, retirement and health insurance coverage

are likely to be delinked from employer-provided plans in many countries, instead of continuing

what was once termed “industrial feudalism” under which workers were discouraged from leaving

their firms for fear of losing their benefits (Ross 1958; Mitchell 1983). The U.S. SECURE Act of

2019 now allows private sector employers to establish and operate multiple-employer pension

plans; this had been infeasible in the past due to rules requiring all sponsor firms to be in the same

industry (O’Brien 2019). The new law also requires employers to offer part-time and part-year

workers access to the firms’ DC plans, which could potentially benefit workers as the labor market

recovers.

       A different approach to expand coverage in the U.S. has been led by six states (Oregon,

California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, and New Jersey) which have launched state-based DC

plans that employers must make available to workers if they do not offer a retirement plan (Belbase

et al. 2020). In Oregon, the earliest implementer, the program was succeeding in covering lower-

paid workers at small firms who deposited an average of $110 per month, or about 5% of their pay

(Chalmers et al. 2019). Each year thereafter, the contribution rate is to be auto-escalated by one

percentage point until a contribution cap of 10% is reached. The first $1,000 of each worker’s

savings is held in a money market fund, and any contributions above that level will be deposited

into an age-appropriate target date fund. One important feature of the OregonSaves plan is that
                                                                                                   18


employee accounts are managed and invested at the state level, so workers who change jobs can

continue to contribute to their centrally-held accounts (thus far, as long as they remain in-state).

       Other countries, including many in Europe, have occupational-based pensions, so that as

long as a worker remains in a given occupation, his account continues to grow. Yet the labor force

of the future is likely to be even more mobile than in the past, implying that workers will need

greater flexibility to retain their pension plans as they seek employment across state, and national,

borders. The Pan-European Pension Plan (PEPP) outlined by the European Commission (2019)

was intended to offer workers across the European Union an additional option (in addition to state

and occupational pensions) to save for retirement. Unfortunately, it now appears that PEPP will

prove to be difficult to market, as the EU regulator is requiring a money-back guarantee, capping

administrative fees, and requiring the plans to pay very high long-term risk-free rates (of 3.75% in

2020; Pielichata 2020; Horneff et al. 2019a).

       The financial disruption due to the pandemic is also likely to hasten the demise of the

remaining traditional DB plans around the world, unless they receive substantial financial transfers

to bail them out or are dramatically altered to survive in different form. For instance, several U.S.

states including Illinois have requested federal help to enable them to continue paying retiree

benefits (Bauer 2020). Indeed the specter of state bankruptcy has already emerged as a potential

result of several U.S. states being unable to contribute enough to maintain their pension plans

(Bradford 2020a). How long the European Central Bank can continue to cover member country

debt is also coming into question (Fairless and Kownsmann 2020). Developing countries face the

most difficult prospects, as they confront enormous medical care costs, plummeting tax revenue,

an inability to issue bonds, and food insecurity. In fact, the International Monetary Fund has
                                                                                                    19


estimated that at least $2.5 trillion will be required to help them confront the pandemic-generated

unemployment, resulting poverty, and reconstruction needs (Gelpern et al. 2020)

       Several new models for pensions have been introduced in recent years that may spread in

the future. Focusing first on DB plans, Rappaport and Peterson (2016) summarize several plan

features that alter how risks are shared across workers and employers. As one example, a hybrid

plan can include a commitment to change benefits or discontinue benefit cost-of-living

adjustments if funding levels fall. A hybrid plan could alternatively raise contributions if the plan’s

financial position declined below some threshold. In some cases, longevity risk in DB plans may

be outsourced to insurers. In other cases, funding risk has been backstopped by government entities

including the UK’s Pension Protection Fund and the US Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

Nevertheless, these government entities are themselves facing financial troubles, particularly in

the U.S., leading one to conclude that this approach to risk transfer was not very successful. The

Netherlands has implemented DB-type “defined ambition” plans, where instead of guaranteeing a

benefit, the pension seeks to ‘target’ promised benefits at some percent (e.g. 75%) of career-

average pay. Actual payouts depend on the pension plan’s level of funding (Bovenberg et al. 2016).

Whether this model will survive the pandemic is unclear, particularly given 70% funding levels

the plans appear to have at present (van Alfen 2020) and forecasts of long-term poor capital market

performance (Jorda et al. 2020; Horneff et al. 2018).

       In view of the long-term decline of DB plans around the world, DC plans are likely to

remain the engine of growth in the future, and several features are likely to find increasing favor

in a post-COVID-19 world. There has already been widespread adoption of automatic enrollment

of new workers into DC plans, as well as annual auto-escalation of contribution rates (Benarzti
                                                                                                      20


and Thaler 2004; OECD 2015). Some 19% of states in the U.S. have now begun to offer DC plans,

as well, sometimes replacing old DB plans (Aubry and Wandrei 2020).

        A key question in such circumstances is how plan sponsors and their employees will want

to rethink plan contribution rates. If real returns remain low for years, it will be critical for workers

to save far more than they did in the past to cover their golden years. For instance, Poterba (2014)

has predicted that contribution rates must rise to 33-48% of pay, in order to support a nominal

annuity stream covering half of workers’ pre-retirement incomes when real returns are 2% and the

saving period lasts only 20 years. A 30-year contribution period still requires saving 15-16% of

pay to generate the same target, and saving rates must rise higher still if the goal is to generate a

payout stream that (more or less) keeps pace with inflation (Table 2).

Table 2 here

        A related issue is how DC plan participants will chose to allocate their retirement assets.

Assets in U.S. target date funds (TDFs) grew from $5B in 2000 to over $730 B in 2018, in part

because regulation permitted these to be the default investments in workers’ retirement accounts.

Additionally, many employers have chosen these as the default fund offering (Mitchell and Utkus

2020). TDFs are usually identified with an anticipated retirement year, providing plan participants

with implicit advice about which fund to hold (e.g., the 2040 fund would be deemed appropriate

for someone intending to retire in that year; Bodie and Crane, 2007). Moreover, each TDF has a

distinct equity glide path, which reduces portfolio risk as participants near their retirement year.

Investment choices are handled by professional portfolio managers who rebalance as necessary

along the glide path. In other countries such as Chile and Mexico, the governments have instituted

glide paths which depend on investor age, moving participants into less risky funds as they near

retirement (Schlecter et al. 2019). Research on U.S. target date funds in the 401(k) plan context
                                                                                                21


has shown that pure investors in a low-cost target date series may earn returns that are sufficient

to boost retirement wealth by as much as 50 percent over a 30-year savings horizon, compared to

their non-TDF counterparts (Mitchell and Utkus 2020). Additionally, the advent of robo-advice is

beginning to give workers inexpensive online guidance on how to allocate their savings, and many

new FinTech programs are targeting peoples’ wallets (Agnew and Mitchell 2019).

           In the wake of COVID-19, efforts to build better retirement plans will likely clash with

governments’ efforts to raise taxes on pension savings, as seek to recoup the massive fiscal

expenditures prompted by the pandemic. As a result, there may be substantial change in how

retirement saving plans are taxed. Currently, many countries exempt both pension contributions

and investment earnings on the assets (E), and retirees’ benefits are subject to tax (T); hence the

acronym EET. The opposite approach would be to tax the contributions, and then to exempt

investment earnings and benefit payouts (EET; Whitehouse 2005). In a simple world, these two

approaches provide the same revenue to the government in present value. In reality, however, the

latter approach generates more tax revenue in the immediate future, which may be attractive to

governments facing enormous current obligations. 10 In the real world, of course, there are many

nonlinearities and kinks in both tax and benefit schedules, so moving from an EET world to a TEE

world can generate important differences in the incentives to work and save. An analysis by

Horneff et al. (2019b) found that, in the U.S. context, moving to a TEE system would lead to a

reduction in work hours, later retirement ages, greater consumption inequality in retirement, and

lower government revenues. Hence such a policy change would not solve government shortfalls

by any means.




10
     Other combinations of tax regimes may also be found; see Whitehouse (2005).
                                                                                                 22


       Delayed retirement is likely to become increasingly necessary post-pandemic, given low

expected returns, pension shortfalls, and the rising longevity of the older population. Accordingly,

retirement saving plans that permit and even encourage continued work, allow for worker mobility

across firms and countries, and offer low-cost investment advice, are likely to help enhance old

age security.



IV. Reforming Pensions Post-Pandemic to Enhance Retirement Security: The Payout Phase

       Next we turn to a discussion of the period during which pensions can help retirees better

manage their savings during the payout phase. Yet designing customized withdrawal plans for

older persons is highly complex, perhaps even more so than designing the accumulation phase,

since consumers need to understand and account for the risk of outliving their assets, inflation,

capital market fluctuations, health risk, the role of housing equity, and how company-based

pension payouts interact with social security systems and taxes. Moreover, couples tend to have

even more complicated challenges, such as when both have workplace based pensions, are of

different ages, have children for whom they must make provision, and must decide on life and

health insurance plans as well. For this reason, the robo-advisors mentioned above have much

farther to go to integrate the complexity of real-world retirement payout modelling (Agnew and

Mitchell 2019).

       One topic commanding recent attention is how to help DC plan savers convert their

retirement nest eggs into lifelong annuities protecting them from outliving their savings. Some

countries have explicitly required that annuities be embedded into the payout phase, such as the

German Riester plans (Kaschützke and Maurer 2011). Singapore also requires that all retirees

covered by its Central Provident Fund (CPF) use a portion of their retirement savings to purchase
                                                                                                   23


a deferred annuity. Chile mandates either annuitization or a so-called programmed withdrawal

process regulating how quickly money can be withdrawn in retirement (Berstein et al. 2015). In

Israel, Hurwitz and Sade (2020) found a high level of adherence to minimum mandatory

annuitization. Horneff et al. (2020) showed that defaulting only 10% of DC plan savers’ assets

into a deferred annuity payable from age 80 (or 85) can substantially enhance retiree welfare, as

long as the assets accumulated by age 65 exceed a relatively low threshold. Nevertheless, where

annuitization has not been integrated into DC plans from the outset, it has proven difficult to add

that requirement after the fact, as in Australia.

       It is also worth noting that many different types of annuities exist, and the diversity around

these financial instruments generates complexity and consumer misunderstanding about the

products. For instance, consumers’ cognitive abilities and financial literacy strongly influence their

willingness to purchase annuities, partly because these are decisions people make rarely, and partly

because people can be “steered” toward or away from lifetime annuity products depending on how

the products are presented (or “framed”; Brown et al. 2017, forthcoming). Interest in tontines is

also growing: these are products purchased by a set pool of investors and held over time. In

simplest form, when someone in the pool dies, his or her assets are divided among the remaining

survivors and the last survivor takes all (Milevsky 2015). Legal tontines are now operating in South

Africa and France, and other countries have expressed interest as well (Fullmer, 2019). In the

U.S., participating annuities share some important similarities, in that sellers of the products bear

no mortality risk and hence can pay out more than traditional fixed annuities (Maurer et al. 2013,

2016a, b). Each of these products offers promise for retirees seeking to protect against longevity

risk. Nevertheless, with interest rates at or below zero, annuities have become relatively expensive

for purchasers (Arends 2020).
                                                                                                  24


       In sum, post COVID-19, it will be challenging but critical to provide more retirees access

to low-cost annuities and high-quality but low-cost investment advice. Additional research and

product development will be required, to make the retirement decumulation process easier for

retirees to manage. Moreover, different delivery systems for financial advice will likely be

appealing to different subsets of consumers. For instance Ben-David and Sade (2018) found that

younger adults prefer algorithmic over human advice, whereas the middle-aged favor a hybrid

model. They also reported that men were more likely to adopt and were willing to pay more for

financial advice than women.



V. Potential Roles for Policymakers

       Though the ultimate impacts of the coronavirus are not known, demographers and

epidemiologists are beginning to assess how the disease is likely to affect overall population

patterns, and the results are as yet not clear. For example, Goldstein and Lee (2020) estimated that,

if 1 million excess U.S. deaths were attributed to COVID-19, this would reduce the population’s

years of life remaining by 1/1000, below the excess mortality attributable to the Spanish flu but

similar to the impact of the HIV and opioid crises. Nevertheless, the authors felt that the risk for

older people was far higher, noting that a “78 year-old during the epidemic would be exposed to

the risk faced by an 80 year-old in normal times” (p. 6). By contrast, Cairns et al. (2020) reported

that the impact of COVID-19 on mortality rates of the surviving population in the UK will likely

to be modest, in that survivors’ life expectancies are unlikely to differ much from prior to the

pandemic. In other words, the two century-long trend toward population aging is likely to continue

and maybe even rise more, insofar as the older population in some countries has apparently attained

a “mortality plateau” (Figure 7).
                                                                                                   25


Figure 7 here

       Accordingly, even after the pandemic is brought under control, the world will continue to

age, giving even greater urgency to reform old-age systems to help support the aging population.

Policymakers can play a critically important role in this process, as they move to reform retirement

systems while setting in motion broader plans to emerge from the pandemic.

Retirement System Design Efforts

       One change that policymakers could consider to enhance retirement planning would be to

generate and make available better quality and more granular data about mortality and morbidity

patterns. These could help insurers seeking to price longevity risk around the world (Mitchell et

al. 2006).

       Second, evaluating retirement security is likely to require the development of a consistent

and economically coherent set of guidelines for measuring and forecasting social security and

pension assets and liabilities, as well as the assessment of long term care needs for the aging

population (Hurd et al. 2013).

       Third, policymakers are likely to want to encourage delayed retirement, delicately where

possible. For instance, Maurer et al. (forthcoming) found that older individuals would claim their

social security benefits later and work longer if they were allowed to receive a partial lump sum

when they finally claimed, in exchange for the deferral. In view of evidence that longer lifespans

allow people to work longer and healthier (Fitzpatrick and Moore 2017), and that jobs are less

physically demanding now than in the past (at least in developed economies), work at older ages

is increasingly feasible. Nevertheless, many firms and nations still impose mandatory retirement

policies discouraging employers from hiring older individuals and giving middle-aged workers

few incentives to invest in their human capital. Additionally, it will be important for plan designers
                                                                                                    26


to revisit the practice of setting relatively young retirement ages for benefit eligibility. Such rules

are often interpreted by middle-aged people as recommendations to leave the workforce young,

depreciating human productivity and raising the cost of old age pensions financed by the young.

       Fourth, a potentially very useful development could be to de-link the provision of benefits

from employment. Thus instead of pensions, healthcare, and insurance programs being offered

though the workplace, these could be made available by associations or multiple-employer

programs, or indeed workplace platforms. As noted above, this was facilitated in the U.S. by the

passage of the 2019 SECURE Act, which now allows firms to band together to offer benefits, thus

reducing administrative costs (Tergesen 2019). In this new format, workers would no longer need

to remain tied to a single firm, to retain their pensions and health insurance. That Act also gave an

invaluable push to annuitization in DC plans, giving firms a safe harbor to adopt a lifetime payout

component in their retirement plans. A related development could be a centralized database such

as that adopted in Israel which helps mobile workers track their pension accounts as they move

across employers (Rosen and Sade 2019).

       Fifth, an aging world is likely to need the greater flexibility afforded by the “gig economy,”

as this sector can offer older people the opportunity to engage in flexible, part-time, and other on-

demand work opportunities (AARP 2016; Abraham et al. 2020). The work-from-home trend

imposed by the pandemic is also likely to continue after the emergency, as employees decide that

they can reduce their commutes, do not need to travel as much, and can be at least as productive

in online meetings. Of course, one consideration regarding this trend is the fact that pension, health,

and other employee benefits have traditionally not been provided to gig workers, meaning that

many older employees needing such coverage could be at a disadvantage (Figure 8). Interestingly,

however, the status quo is beginning to change as some firms including Uber now offer
                                                                                                  27


partnerships helping drivers obtain low-cost health insurance (LaPonsie, 2018). The pandemic has

also enhanced the provision of sick leave policies for workers at a national level, previously

unavailable in some countries. For instance, the U.S. Families First Coronavirus Response Act of

2020 mandated a temporary period of sick leave due to illness or family responsibilities (Moran

2020). Legislators are also pushing for additional benefits such as workers’ compensation and

disability payments for workers who have lacked these in the past (Pardes 2020).

Figure 8 here

Broader Efforts

       In the wake of the pandemic, widespread financial education programs could also be

extremely beneficial both for older workers and their younger counterparts. With more

information, people do a better job planning, saving, and decumulating during retirement, and they

could also do better handling complex financial products such as mortgages, loans, and annuities.

Indeed, recent research has demonstrated a strong positive effect of financial literacy and financial

education on financial behaviors and retirement preparedness (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2014; Kaiser

et al. 2020), including reducing peoples’ tendency to take on and hold debt at older ages (Lusardi

et al. 2013, 2019).

       The global pandemic has also revealed very serious cracks in many countries’ social safety

net programs, including the unemployment benefits regime, housing and medical care systems for

the poor, and food distribution channels (Moffitt 2020). Some countries appear to be managing

this problem better than others. For instance, Denmark’s government has subsidized 75% of wages

for workers in firms hit by the virus slowdown, and Germany provided loans to firms facing

bankruptcy (Wood 2020). By contrast, the patchwork of state-based unemployment insurance,

Medicaid, and Food Stamp programs in the U.S. has made it nigh impossible for millions of
                                                                                                  28


workers to file for payments, and many others have discovered that they are simply ineligible.

Informal sector workers in Asia appear to be particularly at risk, as few are covered by social

insurance and many live hand-to-mouth (Dabla-Norris and Rhee 2020).

       To help fill the holes in safety net programs, some analysts and policymakers have

proposed the adoption of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) scheme as a means to provide a floor of

government-guaranteed income regardless of age, income, or employment status. Without digging

into the details of such a plan, it does appear that in the US, such a program would be extremely

expensive: one research team (Hoynes and Rothstein 2019) has noted that it could require

financing on the order of twice the cost of current transfer programs. Additionally, it is likely to

benefit mainly middle-income childless, nonelderly, nondisabled individuals, at the expense of

elderly and poor households. Accordingly more research is needed to understand how to balance

the equity and the efficiency implications of UBI schemes in an aging world.

       Poor countries are likely to have more difficult challenges to recover in the wake of

COVID-19, as recognized by leading international organizations such as the World Bank and the

International Monetary Fund. To this end, in March and again in April of 2020, the World Bank

approved billions to help India as well as other countries (Stankiewicz 2020). The G20, a group of

the globe’s richest economies, has also committed to massive assistance for poor countries and to

coordinate efforts with other agencies including a moratorium of debt payments (Djankov and

Kiechel, 2020). Moreover, the legacy of the pandemic is likely to be a substantial increase in global

poverty, likely complicated by a massive negative shock to global food supplies. Voss et al. (2020)

explored three scenarios for poverty assuming that there will be a labor productivity shock of 1.4%,

a total factor productivity shock causing a 1% decline in global GDP, or a trade shock boosting

costs by 5%. They predict millions more people will fall below the global poverty line, particularly
                                                                                                   29


in rural populations and in sub-Saharan Africa (see Figure 9). A silver lining may be that air

pollution levels have fallen rapidly with the pandemic, which is expected to cut mortality and boost

health for the affected populations (Cicala et al. 2020).

Figure 9 here

       Until testing and vaccines become widespread, these forecasts could quickly become far

worse. In one hopeful sign, the World Bank has brought to market “pandemic bonds” to help

spread the risk of epidemics such as the SARS and COVID-19 to capital markets (Durden 2020).

Such bonds pay investors a relatively high return as long as no pandemic is triggered, but the

principal is used to help afflicted countries in the event that the various triggers are met. The

catastrophe or ‘cat’ bond triggered in March 2020 provided $196 million to the World Bank which

is disbursing it for the intended purpose. Nevertheless, there were concerns about the slow rate

that at which the funds were paid out have been criticized (Scism and Hinshaw 2020). Private

reinsurers such as AXA Re are also discussing how to establish pandemic insurance with several

state governments in India (Acharya 2020). Nevertheless, many property and business interruption

insurers have been reluctant to admit liability for the coronavirus-induced halt in business as usual,

which will likely require regulators to clarify what exactly what must, and what will not, be

compensated (Barker et al. 2020).



VI. Conclusions

       As stated at the outset, retirement savings programs around the world were facing deep

challenges even before the COVID-19 pandemic struck. Now many new uncertainties confront

retirement plan savers, retirees, and plan sponsors, not the least of which is when and whether the

labor market will begin to function normally, when healthcare systems will recover from their
                                                                                                     30


burdens, and when (if) capital markets will begin to provide savers with positive returns.

Moreover, no one is yet certain when the pandemic will end (Yong 2020). Nevertheless, in the

future, a lesson provided by this pandemic is that pension saving, healthcare insurance, and

financial advice could sensibly be de-linked from employers. Of course global needs will vary, as

workers become more mobile, more likely to be found in the “gig” economy, and more diverse in

their needs (Figure 10).

Figure 10 here

       Pension models for the future will also require new methods to share risk, beginning with

enhancing financial literacy in the population, helping people to save more and invest smarter, and

to better manage longevity. Plan sponsors can also do more to make pensions more flexible, for

instance by linking retirement ages and contributions to funding levels. Policymakers could

enhance the decisionmaking environment by providing better data to price insurance products, and

by formulating better forecasts and establishing plans to respond to the aging population’s needs.

Raising retirement ages, incentivizing continued work, and helping people save more are also

likely to be part of the solution, though answers will vary across countries. Additionally,

strengthening safety net programs is also likely to be critical in helping those who cannot work

and lack private insurance. Taken together, these can strengthen not only retirement systems

around the globe, but also the economic vitality of our economies more broadly.
