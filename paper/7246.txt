                                              ABSTRACT

        Japanese stock returns are even more closely related to their book-to-market ratios than are their
U.S. counterparts, and thus provide a good setting for testing whether the return premia associated with
these characteristics arise because the characteristics are proxies for covariance with priced factors. Our
tests, which replicate the Daniel and Titman (1997) tests on a Japanese sample, reject the Fama and
French (1993) three-factor model but fails to reject the characteristic model.

Financial economists have extensively studied the cross-sectional determinants of U.S. stock returns,

and contrary to theoretical predictions, find very little cross-sectional relation between average stock

returns and systematic risk measured either by market betas or consumption betas. In contrast, the

cross-sectional patterns of stock returns are closely associated with characteristics like book-to-

market ratios, capitalizations, and stock return momentum.1 More recent research on the cross-

sectional patterns of stock returns document size, book-to-market and momentum in most developed

countries.2

    Fama and French (FF, 1993 and 1998) argue that the return premia associated with size and book-

to-market are compensation for risk, as described in a multi-factor version of Merton’s (1973)

Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM) or Ross’s (1976) Arbitrage Pricing Theory

(APT). They propose a three-factor model in which the factors are spanned by three zero-investment

portfolios: Mkt is long the market portfolio and short the risk-free asset; SMB is long small

capitalization stocks and short large capitalization stocks; and HML is long high book-to-market

stocks and short low book-to-market stocks.

    Daniel and Titman (DT, 1997) argue that the Fama and French tests of their three factor model

lack power against an alternative hypothesis which they call the “Characteristic Model.” This model

specifies that the expected returns of assets are directly related to their characteristics for reasons,

like liquidity, that may have nothing to do with the covariance structure of returns. Using alternative

tests, which they apply to U.S. stock returns between 1973 and 1993, Daniel and Titman reject the

FF three-factor model but not the characteristic model.

    The DT results are clearly controversial; they reject a model that captures the central intuition of

traditional asset pricing models in favor of a model that is almost completely ad hoc.3 Hence, as also

argued in Davis, Fama and French (DFF, 1999), it is important to test the robustness of the DT

results on different samples. Examining the results out of sample, however, is difficult because the

tests require a cross-section of stocks that is large enough to allow the researcher to form diversified

portfolios with cross-sectional variation in both factor loadings and characteristics. In addition, one

needs to examine samples where returns are strongly related to the characteristics. Given these data

requirements, the best places to look for out of sample confirmation of the DT results are probably

the U.S. market prior to 1973 and in the Japanese stock market during the past 23 years. DFF

examine whether average U.S. stock returns are better explained by characteristics or factors in the

pre-1973 period. We consider this same issue for Japanese stocks in the 1975 to 1997 period.4



                                 I. Testing Characteristic vs. Factor Models

    In this section we describe our empirical framework and discuss various issues relating to the power

to distinguish between a characteristic model and a factor model. In addition, we will briefly discuss

possible selection biases that can arise when we select a sample based on observed return premia

associated with the characteristics.




3
  Some have argued that the FF factor model implies rational behavior and the Daniel and Titman characteristics model
implies irrational behavior. This need not be the case. The FF model is consistent with an irrational model in which the
factor risk premia arise as a result of biased expectations. Similarly the characteristics model could be consistent with
rationality if the characteristics proxy for liquidity, or for variables relevant in an agency setting.
4
  This issue is also explored in Jagannathan, Kubota and Takehara (1998). They find that a book-to-market factor is
priced within book-to-market sorted portfolios, even after controlling for the book-to-market characteristic. However,
they do not control for the size characteristic, which is a strong determinant of average returns over their time period.
The results in this paper suggest that their book-to-market factor loadings may proxy for size in their tests.


                                                           2
    Our tests examine a nested version of a characteristic and factor model which assumes that security

returns are generated by the following process (for simplicity, we assume a single observable priced

factor ft here; the argument is equivalent when there are multiple factors):

                   Ri,t = E[Ri,t] + βi,t-1 ft + εi,t

where the expected return of securities is governed by:

                   E[Ri,t] = a + b θi,t-1 + λ βi,t-1                                                             (1)

and where θ and β are cross-sectionally related through the regression relationship:

                   βi,t-1 = γ θi,t-1 + ei,t-1                                                                    (2)

θi,t-1 is a characteristic of security i, observable at time t-1. This could be book-to-market ratio, or

some non-linear function of this characteristic. The factor model restricts b in equation (1) to be zero,

giving us the standard APT equations stating that expected returns are a linear function of the factor

loading. In contrast, the characteristic model restricts λ to be zero, meaning that expected returns are a

direct function of the characteristic θ. However, testing these two models is complicated. The reason

is that, based on equation (2), θi and βi are cross-sectionally correlated, and hence expected returns will,

for example, be related to βi under both models. Therefore, discriminating between the models requires

that we determine whether there is a relationship between E[Ri,t] and βi,t-1 after controlling for θi,t-1.

    Since we observe that returns are related to characteristics, if the factor model is correct, the factor

loadings must be related to the characteristics, as expressed in equation (2).5 If this is indeed the only

source of correlation between characteristics and returns, then a zero-investment portfolio that is long

high θ stocks and short low θ stocks, such as the FF HML portfolio, should have a high loading on the


5
  There are several arguments for why characteristics and factor loadings should be correlated. Under a rational model,
firms with a high loading on a priced factor will tend to have lower prices because their future cash flows are discounted
at higher rates; this will induce a correlation between betas and characteristics like size and BM. Also, DT note that,
under non-risk models, similar firms are still likely to become mispriced at the same time, and this will induce a
relationship between the factor structure and mispricing measures like size and BM.


                                                            3
priced factor. The FF results are consistent with this interpretation. First, there are strong covariances

between the returns of the stocks within their size and book-to-market factor-mimicking portfolios,

suggesting that these stocks load on a common, distress-related risk factor.6 Second, the returns of their

portfolios appear to do a good job of explaining the returns of other size and book-to-market sorted

portfolios.

    DT argue that the FF (1993) tests, which regress characteristic-sorted portfolios on other

characteristic-sorted portfolios, have very little statistical power to distinguish between the factor and

characteristics model and propose an alternative test, which can in fact distinguish between the models.

To perform this test, assets are sorted into portfolios based on both characteristics and factor loadings.

The goal is to form portfolios with high book-to-market characteristics, but with return covariances

that resemble low book-to-market portfolios (and vice-versa), and to test whether their returns are

different.7

    Specifically, DT construct two sets of test portfolios:

1. characteristic-balanced portfolios which are zero-cost portfolios for which the long and short
   positions include stocks with similar book-to-market ratios and capitalizations, but are
   constructed to have high negative loadings on one of the three factors (HML, SMB or Mkt).

2. factor-balanced portfolios which have zero loadings on each of the three factors, but are tilted
   towards high book-to-market or small stocks. These portfolios are constructed by first forming a
   characteristic-balanced portfolio, and adding long and short positions in the HML, SMB and Mkt
   so as to set the factor loadings to zero. Since HML and SMB are tilted towards the relevant
   characteristics, the resulting portfolio will also be tilted towards those characteristics.

    The FF three-factor model implies that the returns on the factor-balanced portfolios should

average zero (since they have zero factor loadings), but that the characteristic-balanced portfolios

should have negative average returns because they have negative factor loadings. In contrast, the

6
 In Section 3 of Daniel and Titman (1997) we run an alternative test and argue that the results of this test show that the
high covariance is not due to the presence of a separate, distress related factor.




                                                            4
characteristic model implies zero average returns for the characteristic-balanced portfolios, but

positive average returns for the factor-balanced portfolios because they have negative characteristics.

DT perform three sets of tests using characteristic- and factor-balanced portfolios based on HML,

SMB and Mkt factor sorts. They find that the average returns of the factor-balanced portfolios are all

reliably positive, and can therefore reject the FF factor model at better than a 5% level (the one tailed

p-values are 1.1%, 4.7%, and 1.5%, respectively). In contrast, they find that the average returns of

the three characteristic-balanced portfolios are not reliably different from zero.

    Clearly, the power to discriminate between the two hypotheses depends on whether well-diversified

portfolios can be formed with similar characteristics but different factor sensitivities. This will be

influenced by the length of the time series, the number of assets, the correlation between the

characteristics and factor loadings, or equivalently the variance of e in equation (2), and by our

ability to forecast the e’s, or equivalently, the future βs. A large number of assets allow us to

construct portfolios which have large positive or negative e's, but which are still well diversified.

The level of diversification is important because more diversified portfolios allow us to more easily

detect deviations of the returns of the characteristic-balanced and factor-balanced portfolios from 0,

as does a longer test period.

    The power to discriminate between the two hypotheses also depends on the characteristic/factor

return premium. Intuitively, to distinguish between different theories of the book-to-market effect one

requires data where the magnitude of the book-to-market effect is strong. This may be why the recent

DFF study finds that the DT tests cannot reliably distinguish between the characteristics and factor




7
  Berk (1999) shows that an errors-in-variables problem can arise if returns are regressed on measured betas. The
procedure discussed in Berk is not employed in Daniel and Titman (1997) or in any of the tests presented here. Berk also
discusses some power issues that also turn out to not be relevant for these tests.

models in a sample that includes more recent years, where the size and book to market effects are much

smaller.

   Data mining is also a concern here: to what extent will picking a country with a high realized (as

opposed to expected) RHML and RSMB affect the probability of falsely rejecting the null (i.e., the size

of our tests)? To understand how the magnitude of return premia on characteristic sorted portfolios

affects our tests, note that the return premium will be higher in a give sample if,

       1. b, the return premium associated with the characteristic, had a higher realization in the
          sample period.
       2. λ, the risk premium on the factor, was higher in the sample period.
       3. ft, the factor realization, had a higher realization in the sample period.

   If the higher return premium comes from effect 1, which implies the factor model is false, the test

will have more power to reject the factor model, because, holding everything else constant, it is easier

to discriminate between bθ and 0 when b is large. However, arbitrarily picking a period with a high b

will not affect the size of the test. Similarly, if the return premium comes from effect 2, which would

imply the characteristics model is false, the test will have more power to reject the characteristics

model, but again test size will not be affected. In either case 1 or 2, we are more likely to learn the true

cause of the return premium when the premium is higher. In contrast if the higher return comes from

effect 3, then the test will reject the characteristic model too often. In other words, we will reject at the

5% level more than 5% of the time when the characteristic model is in fact true. In periods where the

realization of f is high, high beta portfolios will return more than low beta portfolios, even if the

expected returns of high and low beta portfolios are the same. Thus, picking a period where the HML

premium is large may give us power to discriminate between the two models, but it may also cause us

to falsely reject the characteristic model. However, the probability of falsely rejecting the factor is not

affected by the realization of the factor in the sample period. In other words, a rejection of the factor

model using a high premium period is reliable.


                                                     6
    It is these last two factors that motivate our tests. As noted earlier, Japan has the largest equity

market aside from the U.S., in terms of both capitalization and number of securities. Second, the

spread between the returns of high and low book-to-market stocks is larger in Japan than in the U.S.

One should also note, however, that the spread between large and small stocks as well as the return

premium on the market portfolio is not particularly large in Japan during our sample period.8 Hence,

we expect to have the most power to distinguish between a characteristic and factor model with

characteristic-balanced portfolios that are sensitive to the HML factor, which will be the main focus

of our analysis.



                                          II. Data Description

    Our study examines monthly data on common stocks listed on both sections of the Tokyo Stock

Exchange (TSE) from January 1971 to December 1997. As noted in Chan, Hamao, and Lakonishok

(CHL, 1991), stocks listed on the TSE account for more than 85 percent of the total market

capitalization of Japanese equities.9 Our data are from several sources. Monthly returns including

dividends and market capitalization are from databases compiled by PACAP Research Center, the

University of Rhode Island (1975 - 1997) and the Daiwa Securities Co., Limited, Tokyo (1971 - 1975).

The monthly value-weighted market returns of both sections of the TSE are also from these two data

sources. There are no risk-free rates in Japan that are comparable to the U.S. Treasury bill rates. As a

result, we follow CHL by using a combined series of the call money rate (from January 1971 to

November 1977) and the 30-day Gensaki (repo) rate (from December 1977 to December 1997) as the




8
   The FF SMB and (excess) Mkt portfolios have mean returns of 0.26%/month (t=1.02) and 0.33%/month (t=1.09),
respectively, for our sample. The mean return for the HML portfolio is 0.67%/month (t=4.14).

risk-free interest rate. This interest rate series is taken from the PACAP databases (1975 - 1997) and

Diawa Securities (1971 - 1975).

     The data on book values are taken from both the PACAP databases and Nihon Keizai Shimbun,

Inc., Tokyo.     Though some firms publish semi-annual financial statements, we use only annual

financial statements due to the tentative nature of semi-annual statements. In addition, since there is a

substantial delay in the release of the consolidated financial statements and both the PACAP and Nihon

Keizai Shimbun only provide the unconsolidated financial statements, we use unconsolidated annual

financial data to obtain the book values of the firms.

     Our sample includes all listed stocks from both sections of the TSE.10,11 However, we exclude

stocks which do not have at least 18 monthly returns between t = -42 to -7 before formation date

(October of year t = 0). This criterion is needed in order to calculate the ex ante factor loadings for

individual stocks. We also exclude stocks with negative book equity.

     We form test portfolios based on sorts on market size (SZ) and book-to-market ratio (BM). We

wish to ensure that the accounting data that we use in forming portfolios are publicly available at the

time of portfolio formation. Most firms listed on the TSE have March as the end of their fiscal year

and the accounting information becomes publicly available before September. Therefore, we form

portfolios on the first trading day of October, and hold them for exactly one year. For portfolios

formed in October of year t we use the book equity (BE) of a firm at the fiscal year-end that falls

between April of year t-1 and March of year t. BM is set equal to the ratio of BE to the to market




10
  However, we have verified that excluding financial companies does not affect our results.
11
 The PACAP data does not include firms which were delisted (due to merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy) prior to 1988.
However, very few firms were delisted between 1975 and 1988 (an average of 6.7/year). Also, we are using value-
weighted portfolios in our analysis. Thus, there should be no appreciable survival bias in our data.

equity at the end of March of year t and SZ is set equal to market equity at the end of September of

year t.12

                 III.    Return Patterns of Size and Book-to-Market Sorted Portfolios

     This section examines the return patterns of 25 size and book-to-market sorted portfolios from the

universe of TSE stocks.13 At the end of each September from 1975 to 1997, all TSE stocks in the

sample are sorted into five equal groups from small to large based on their market equity (SZ). We also

separately break TSE stocks into five equal book-to-market equity (BM) groups from low to high. The

25 portfolios are constructed from the intersections of the five size and five book-to-market groups,

e.g., the small size/low book-to-market portfolio contains the stocks that have their size in the smallest

quintile and their book-to-market ratios in the lowest quintile. Monthly value-weighted returns for each

of these 25 portfolios are calculated from October of year t to September of year t+1.

     Panel A of Table I presents the mean monthly excess returns for the 25 size and book-to-market

sorted portfolios for the October 1975 to December 1997 period. The bottom row and right-most

column of this panel reports the differences between the average returns of the smallest and largest

stocks, holding book-to-market constant and the differences between the highest and lowest book-to-

market stocks, holding size constant. The panel documents that holding book-to-market fixed, the

difference in returns between the smallest and largest size quintile is large for the low BM quintile (106

basis points per month, t=2.56), but is insignificantly different from zero for all other BM quintiles

(t<1.52). The average size effect, across the five BM categories, is insignificantly different from zero

(T=1.53). In contrast, when size is held constant there is a large book-to-market effect. The difference

12
    The six-month (minimum) gap between the fiscal year-end and the first return used to test the model is conservative
and is consistent with FF (1993) and Daniel and Titman (1997). However, previous research on the TSE firms imposes
only a three-month (minimum) gap (Chan, Hamao, and Lakonishok (1991)).
13
   The construction of these 25 portfolios follows FF (1993). However, there are two exceptions: (1) the portfolios are formed
each year at the end of September (rather than at the end of June), and (2) we use the universe of TSE firms to determine the




                                                              9
in returns between the highest and lowest BM quintile is statistically significant (t>2.50) for all but the

smallest quintile of firms. The average book-to-market effect, across the five size categories, is large

and statistically significant (t=4.34).

   Panels B and C of Table I separate the sample into January and non-January months. As in the

U.S., the size effect is much larger and more significant in January (t>2.20 for all BM quintile-

differences), but outside of January it is only significant for the lowest BM quintile (t=2.05, all other

t’s<0.7). The BM effect remains equally strong in non-January months, where it is significant for all

but the smallest quintile (t>2.05). This is in contrast to the DT evidence, where the book-to-market

effect is stronger in smaller firms, and is concentrated in January (see, for comparison, Table 1 in

Daniel and Titman (1997)). It is, however, consistent with DFF, who find that the BM effect is

stronger in large firms prior to 1963.



                                      IV. Fama and French (1993) Tests

   In this section we replicate the FF (1993) tests on our sample of Japanese stocks.                              Our

construction of the factor portfolios follows FF (1993), and is described in the Appendix.

   We start by examining the returns of 25 characteristic-sorted portfolios using the Fama-French

three-factor asset-pricing model:

                   Ri,t - Rf,t= αi+ βi,HML (RHML,t) + βi,SMB (RSMB,t) + βi,Mkt (RMkt,t - Rf,t) + εi,t,          (3)

where Ri,t is the return on size and book-to-market sorted portfolio i, and RHML,t, RSMB,t and RMkt,t are,

respectively, the returns on the HML, SMB, and Mkt factor portfolios at time t. Rf,t is the risk-free rate

at time t; and βi,j is the factor loading of portfolio i on factor j.




size and book-to-market breakpoints in Japan. These two exceptions will apply to all attribute-sorted portfolios and the
pervasive factors throughout the paper.


                                                          10
   For comparison purposes we also consider a one-factor (CAPM) model using a value-weighted

benchmark. The results of both sets of tests are presented in Table II. Panel A of Table II reports the

intercepts and t-statistics for a test of the traditional CAPM. The results indicate that small firms and

high book-to-market firms earn very high CAPM risk-adjusted abnormal returns. The difference

between the S/H (small size and high book-to-market) portfolio and B/L (large size and low book-to-

market) is over 1.44 percent per month. The F-statistic testing whether all α’s are zero is significant,

suggesting that the CAPM does not hold for the Japanese data.

   The intercepts and t-statistics for the FF three-factor model are presented in Panel B of Table II.

Only 5 out of 25 t-statistics for the intercepts are over 2, and the F-test cannot reject the hypothesis that

all the intercepts are equal to zero. It is especially noteworthy that the large low book-to-market

portfolio, shown to have negative average excess returns in the previous table, has a three-factor alpha

that is virtually zero. These tests indicate that the three-factor model does a very good job explaining

the 25 portfolio returns.



                                    V. Characteristics versus Covariances

   As we discussed earlier, the tests considered in the last section are not designed to have much power

against the alternative hypothesis that the expected returns are determined directly by the characteristics

rather than by their factor loadings. The power problem arises because the correlation between the

factor loadings and the characteristics among the 25 test portfolios is very high. As discussed in

Section I, in order to distinguish between the factor model and the characteristic model we must form

portfolios with sufficiently low correlation between their factor loadings and their characteristics.




                                                     11
A. Construction of the Test Portfolios

     We first rank all TSE stocks by their book-to-market ratios (BM) at the end of March of year t and

their market capitalizations (SZ) at the end of September of year t and form 1/3 and 2/3 breakpoints

based on these rankings. Starting in October of year t, all TSE stocks are placed into the three book-

to-market groups and the three size groups based on these breakpoints. The firms remain in these

portfolios from the beginning of October of year t to the end of September of year t+1. Each of the

individual stocks in these nine portfolios are then further sorted into five sub-portfolios based on

their factor loadings (for example, βi,HML) estimated from month -42 to -7 relative to the portfolio

formation date in the following regression:14

          Ri,t - Rft = αi + βi,HML RHML,t + βi,SMB RSMB,t + βi,Mkt (RMkt,t - Rft) + ei,t, t = -42 to -7            (4)

     As in DT the above regression employs constant-weight factor portfolio returns. We take the

portfolio weights of the FF factor portfolios at t=0 (the end of September of year t) and apply these

constant weights to the individual stock returns from date -42 to -7 to calculate the returns of

constant weight factor portfolios.15 Using these returns, we calculate ex ante factor loadings for each

stock, which we use as instruments for their future expected loadings.

     The ex ante estimates for each of the three factor loadings are then used to further subdivide the

nine size and book-to-market sorted portfolios. This is done separately for each of the three sets of

factor loadings. For example, each of the stocks within the nine size and book-to-market sorted

portfolios are placed into five sub-portfolios based on estimates of βi,HML to form a set of 45

portfolios. The value-weighted returns for each of these 45 test portfolios are then calculated for


14
   As in Daniel and Titman (1997), we do not use the month -6 to 0 returns in estimating these loadings because the factor
portfolios are formed based on stock prices existing 6 months previously (as of the end of March of year t). An
implication of this is that HML returns are very negative up to t=-6, but are positive between t=-6 and t=-1. This “step
function” in the return pattern would add noise to our factor loading estimates, so we exclude it from our estimation
period. Daniel and Titman (1997) discusses this problem in detail; see especially Figure 1 and the discussion on page 12.
15
   Again, see Daniel and Titman (1997) for a full description of the motivation for this method.


                                                           12
each month between October 1975 through December 1997. Similarly, we form 45 test portfolios

based on ex ante βi,SMB sorts and 45 test portfolios based on the ex ante βi,Mkt sorts. Our tests of the

factor model and the characteristic model are performed on these three sets of 45 test portfolios.



B. Empirical Results on the Size, Book-to-Market and HML Factor Loading Sorted Portfolios

   Panel A of Table III presents the mean monthly excess returns of the 45 test portfolios formed

with the HML factor loading sorts. Each of the five columns provides the monthly excess returns (in

percent) of portfolios of stocks that are ranked in the particular quintile with respect to the HML

factor loading (with column 1 being the lowest and column 5 being the highest). The results reveal a

positive, monotonic relation between average mean excess returns and ex-ante factor loading

rankings. However, we will show that this relationship is considerably weaker than predicted by the

FF three-factor model, and that, within a size/book-to-market grouping, there is no statistically

significant relation between factor loadings and returns.

   The lack of a strong relation between the returns and the ex ante factor loadings could potentially

reflect the fact that ex ante factor loadings are weak predictors of future factor loadings. The results,

not reported here, indicate that this is not the case. Our sort on ex ante HML factor loadings produce

a monotonic ordering of the ex post factor loadings. It is also possible that the relation between the

loadings and the returns occur because, in sorting on the HML factor loadings, we pick up some

variation in book-to-market ratio within each SZ and BM sorted sub-grouping. Our tests of the

characteristic model assume that the stocks in columns 1 and 5 have equal book-to-market ratios, so

if this is not the case, our tests could be biased. However, unreported tests indicate that within each

SZ and BM sorted grouping there is a slight positive relation between the BM ratio and the HML

factor loading which would slightly bias our tests in favor of the factor model. Specifically, our tests



                                                   13
have a lower probability of rejecting the three-factor model when this model is false, and there is an

increased probability of falsely rejecting the characteristic model when it is true.16

     In Panel B we report the intercepts and the t-statistics from the three-factor regressions applied to

each of the 45 test portfolios. On first glance, these do not appear to provide much evidence against

the three-factor model. Only 4 out of the 45 alphas have t-statistics with an absolute value greater

than 2. Also, an F-test of the hypothesis that all intercepts are equal to zero is not rejected.

However, the F-test is not very powerful against the specific alternative hypothesis provided by the

characteristic model. Indeed, when we inspect the intercepts more closely, we find patterns that are

consistent with the characteristics alternative: the intercepts decrease with the HML factor loadings

within the SZ and BM groups and every one of the nine column 1 entries is higher than the

corresponding column 5 entry. This suggests that the returns may be related to the BM characteristics

even after the adjustment for factor risks.

     To obtain a more powerful test of the factor model against the alternative offered by the

characteristic model, we form 9 characteristic-balanced portfolios. Within each of the 9 size and

book-to-market groupings, we form portfolios which have a one dollar position in the high (the 4th

and 5th quintile) expected factor loading portfolios and a short one dollar position in the low (the 1st

and 2nd quintile) expected factor loading portfolios.17 If the characteristic model is correct, the

average returns on these portfolios should be zero, because they are long and short assets with

(approximately) equal characteristics. If, however, the factor model is correct, the returns should be


16
  As a way of assessing the magnitude of this bias, we regressed the average returns reported in Table III on the logs of
the average size and BM ratios. We calculated fitted returns for the characteristic-balanced portfolios whose returns are
reported here. This gives us an expected return for these portfolios, under the characteristic model, assuming that this
specification is correct. The fitted return for the characteristic-balanced portfolio in Panel C of Table III was 3 bp/month,
confirming our impression that the bias should be small.
17
    There is a difference between the portfolios here and their counterparts in DT. The long and short positions in these
portfolios are the reverse of the portfolios in DT, but are consistent with how they are reported in Davis, Fama and
French (1999). The only effect of this is to change the signs of the intercepts and coefficients in our regressions.


                                                             14
positive because these portfolios have a high loading on one of the FF factors. In addition, the alphas

obtained from regressing the returns on the three factor portfolios should be zero if the factor model

is correct, and should be negative under the characteristic model. Since the alphas represent the

returns of a portfolio that is factor-balanced but not characteristic-balanced we will sometimes refer

to the alphas as the return on a factor-balanced portfolio.

   The average returns of these zero cost portfolios as well as the regression results on the FF three-

factor model are reported in Panel C of Table III. The mean returns of these nine characteristic-

balanced portfolios, reported in the first column, reveal that eight of the nine portfolios have positive

mean returns, and that one of these means is significantly different from zero at the 0.05 (two-tail)

level. However, since the returns of these portfolios are highly correlated, finding one out of nine

positive returns does not necessarily indicate statistical significance. Indeed, the average return of a

single portfolio, formed by equal weighting the nine characteristic-balanced portfolios, is not reliably

different from zero (t=1.23).

   The remaining columns of Panel B provide the results of the regression of the returns of the

characteristic-balanced portfolio on the three factors. The intercepts on these nine characteristic-

balanced portfolios are all negative except two (one of the nine intercepts is significant at the 0.05

level). The intercept from the single portfolio regression on the equally-weighted portfolio of these

nine portfolios, reported in the last row of the panel, is negative and just statistically significantly

different from zero (t=–1.8), which is inconsistent with the three-factor model.

   As in DT we also examined the returns to zero-cost portfolio strategies that for each of the nine

size/BM groupings, take a long position in the highest (5th quintile) expected factor loading

portfolios and a short position in the lowest (1st quintile) expected factor loading portfolios. For

these Japanese data, this test yielded even stronger evidence against the three factor model: the



                                                   15
intercepts for all of the nine size/BM portfolios are negative, two of the nine at a 0.05 significance

level.   Also, the equal weighted combination of these nine portfolios had an intercept of –

0.37%/month (t=–2.19). In contrast, this characteristic-balanced portfolio had a mean return of

0.21%/month (t= 0.98), consistent with the characteristic model.



C. Results Based on Sorting by Other Factor Loadings

   Table IV replicates this analysis on portfolios sorted by SMB factor loadings. Consistent with the

findings of DT and DFF in the U.S., these tests fail to reject either the factor model or the

characteristic model. However the t-statistic on the α is –1.37, so we are close to the one-tailed level

for rejection of the three-factor model.

   Table V replicates this analysis on portfolios sorted by the Mkt factor loadings. This is where we

find the most striking difference between the U.S. and Japan. Both DT and DFF reject the three-

factor model using the βMkt-sorted U.S.-stock portfolios. For the Japanese data, neither the three-

factor nor the characteristic model can be rejected with these tests.



D. The Power of Our Tests

   It is instructive to examine how the power of these tests using Japanese data compare to the

power of the tests using U.S. data reported in Daniel and Titman (1997). Recall that our ability to

distinguish between factor models and characteristic models depends on our ability to construct well-

diversified characteristic-balanced portfolios with significant factor loadings as well as on the

magnitude of the average returns associated with the factors. The return of the HML portfolio in our

Japanese sample is slightly larger than the U.S. HML return in the DT sample (67 bp/month in Japan




                                                   16
versus 50 bp/month in the U.S.). Also, the HML beta of the characteristic-balanced portfolio is

larger than its counterpart in the DT sample (0.586 here, and 0.362 in DT).18

     In contrast, the return premia and factor sensitivities indicate that we are unlikely to have much

power to distinguish between the characteristic and factor models using either SMB or Mkt beta sorts.

The returns of the SMB and excess-Mkt portfolios are quite small in our sample period (26 and 33

bp/month, respectively, with t’s of 1.0 and 1.1). In addition, we did not successfully generate

characteristic-balanced portfolios with large sensitivities to either the Mkt or SMB factors – the

βSMB=0.305 for the SMB-factor loading sorted portfolio and βMkt=0.245 for the Mkt-factor loading

sorted portfolio.

     Based on these numbers, we expect to have slightly more power in our Japanese sample to

distinguish between the characteristic and factor models using HML beta sorts. While we do reject

the factor model with slightly less significance in Japan, this is not because the Japanese data

provides less power. Rather, it is because our point estimates indicate that a higher portion of the

high minus low book-to-market return spread can be attributed to factor risk in Japan.19 The above

numbers also indicate that our tests provide very little power to distinguish between the

characteristic and factor models using portfolios sorted by Mkt and SMB factor loadings.



                                                    VI. Conclusion

     This paper examines Japanese stock returns in the 1975 to 1997 period. The findings indicate

that the value premium in average stock returns is substantially stronger in Japan than in the U.S.

This is especially true for the largest quintile stocks, where high book-to-market stocks beat low

18
   In DT, we formed the characteristic-balanced portfolios differently than we do here, buying one dollar each of the 1st
and 2nd factor loading portfolio and selling one dollar each of the 4th and 5th factor loadings portfolios. We have adjusted
the numbers from DT to reflect this difference.



                                                             17
book-to-market stocks (sorted into quintiles) by 0.994% per month in Japan but only 0.347% in the

U.S. Because this sample exhibits a high value premium along with the large cross-section of

available stocks it offers an ideal setting for testing whether the value premium represents

compensation for bearing factor risk.

     To test the factor model, we follow Daniel and Titman (1997) and form zero cost portfolios that

are characteristic-balanced but are sensitive to at least one of the Fama and French (1993) factors.

The Fama and French factor model predicts that this portfolio should have a significantly positive

return. However, an alternative characteristic model, which posits that returns are directly related to

the book-to-market ratios, predicts that this portfolio should have a return of zero on average.

Consistent with the results for U.S. stocks in Davis, Fama and French (1999) as well as Daniel and

Titman, we are able to reject the factor model but not the characteristic model. There are, however,

some important differences between the U.S. and Japanese evidence. First, we reject the three-factor

model in only those tests that form characteristic-balanced portfolios that load on the HML factor.

DT reject with characteristic-balanced portfolios that load on the HML factor, and that load on the

Mkt factor; DFF reject only with tests that sort on the Mkt factor.

     The paper also includes a discussion of the power of tests that attempt to distinguish between

factor models and characteristic models.                 Our analysis explains why some tests are able to

distinguish between a characteristic and risk model, while others are not. For example, in Japan, we

were able to distinguish between a factor model and a characteristic model using portfolios based on

HML beta sorts because,

     1. The HML return was high in our sample period.

     2. HML betas were predictable and not too highly correlated with book-to-market ratios.


19
  This is evidenced by the higher return of the characteristic-balanced portfolio in Japan.


                                                             18
In samples where the return associated with a characteristic is not particularly high, and where one

cannot form diversified characteristic portfolios with returns that are sensitive to the factors, one will

not be able to distinguish between the theories.

   It should also be stressed that our tests examine a very specific characteristic model and factor

model. Because of limited power, it is difficult to make more general statements about the

importance of covariances and characteristics in determining expected returns. While we report tests

that reject the Fama and French (1993) factor model, it is possible that a variant of their factor model

may explain returns much better. For example, we know that any ex-post means mean-variance

efficient portfolio will explain our test portfolio returns perfectly. A more relevant question is

whether any ex-ante reasonable set of factors can explain the returns we observe.

Appendix: Construction of the Portfolios

The construction of the book-to-market and size portfolios follows FF (1993). Using the merged
PACAP/Diawa Securities/Nihon Keizai Shimbun files, we form portfolios of common shares based
on the ratio of the book-equity to market equity (book-to-market) and on market equity (ME). Book
value is defined to be stockholder's equity from either PACAP or Nihon Keizai Shimbun. In
calculating book-to-market, we use the book-equity from any point in year t, and the market on the
last trading day in year t, where the market equity, from PACAP, is defined as the number of shares
outstanding times the share price. We only include firms in our analyses which have been listed on
PACAP/Diawa Securities and which have prices available on PACAP/Diawa in both March of t and
September of year t. The book-to-market ratios, and sizes of the firms thus determined are then used
to form the portfolios from October of t to September of t + 1. The end of September is used as the
portfolio formation date because the annual report containing the book-equity value for the preceding
fiscal year is virtually certain to be public information by that time.

To form the portfolio, we first exclude from the sample all firms with book-to-market values of less
than zero. We take all TSE stocks in the sample and rank them on their book-to-market and size as
described above. Based on these rankings, we calculate 30% and 70% breakpoints for book-to-
market and a 50% breakpoint for size. We then place all TSE stocks into the three book-to-market
groups and the two size groups based on these breakpoints. The stocks above the 70% book-to-
market breakpoint are designated H, the middle 40% of firms are designated M, and the firms below
the 30% book-to-market breakpoint are designated L. Also firms above the 50% size breakpoint are
designated B (for big) and the remaining 50% S (for small). Note that the number of firms in each of
the six portfolios varies.

These two sets of rankings allow us to form the six value-weighted portfolios S/L, S/M, S/H, B/L,
B/M, and B/H. From these portfolio returns we calculate the SMB (Small-Minus-Big) portfolio
returns, which are defined to be RSMB = (RSL + RSM + RSH - RBL - RBM - RBH)/3, and the HML (High-
Minus-Low) portfolio returns, which are defined as RHML = (RSH + RBH - RSL - RBL)/2. Also, a,
value-weighted portfolio Mkt is formed which contains all of the firms in these portfolios, plus the
otherwise excluded firms with BM values of less than zero.

We first rank all TSE firms by their book-to-market at the end of March of year t (1975-1997) and their market capitalization
(ME) at the end of September of year t. We form 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% breakpoints for book-to-market and ME based
on these rankings. Starting in October of year t, we place all TSE stocks into the five book-to-market groups and the five size
groups based on these breakpoints. The firms remain in these portfolios from the beginning of October of year t to the end of
September of year t+1.

                      Time-Series Regressions of the 25 Size and Book-to-Market Sorted Portfolios:
                                            1975:10 – 1997:12, 267 months.

The formation of the 25 book-to-market and size-sorted portfolios is described in Table 1. The construction of the HML
(High-Minus-Low) factor portfolio (RHML), SMB (Small-Minus-Big) factor portfolio (RSMB) and the Mkt (market) factor
portfolio (RMkt) is as follows. We first exclude from the sample all firms with book values of less than zero. We take all TSE
stocks in the sample and rank them on their book-to-market and size as described in Table I. Based on these rankings, we
calculate 30% and 70% breakpoints for book-to-market and a 50% breakpoint for size. The stocks above the 70% book-to-
market breakpoint are designated H, the middle 40% of firms are designated M, and the firms below the 30% book-to-market
breakpoint are designated L. Firms above the 50% size breakpoint are designated B, and the remaining 50% S. These two
sets of rankings allow us to form the six value-weighted portfolios L/S (RLS), M/S (RMS), H/S (RHS), L/B (RLB), M/B (RMB),
and H/B (RHB). From these six portfolio returns, we calculate the HML factor portfolio returns, which are defined as RHML =
(RHB + RHS - RLB - RLS)/2, and the SMB factor portfolio returns, which are defined as RSMB = (RHS +RMS + RHS - RHB - RMB -
RLB)/3. A value-weighted portfolio Mkt is formed that contains all of the firms in these six size and book-to-market sorted
portfolios plus the otherwise excluded firms with book values of less than zero. Note that we have variation in the number of
firms in each six size and book-to-market sorted portfolios formed in this way. This table presents each of the intercepts
estimates and t-statistics from both the CAPM and the Fama-French three-factor asset-pricing model. The estimation method
is ordinary least square (OLS). F is the F-statistic to test the hypothesis that the regression intercepts for a set of 25 portfolios
are all 0. p(F) is the p-value of F.

      Mean Monthly Excess Returns and Time-Series Regressions -- HML Factor Loading Sorted Portfolios
                                      October 1975 - December 1997

Panel A gives the mean monthly returns (in %) for 45 portfolios formed based on size (SZ), book-to-market (BM), and
pre-formation HML factor loadings.

Panel B presents intercepts and t-statistics from the multivariate time-series regressions:

         Ri,t - Rft = αi + βi,HML(RHML,t) + βi,SMB(RSMB,t) + βi,Mkt(RMkt,t - Rft) + ei,t.

The estimates of slope coefficients are not presented here. The left-hand side portfolios are formed based on size (SZ),
book-to-market (BM), and pre-formation HML factor loadings.

Panel C presents the regression results from the characteristic-balanced portfolio returns, described below, on the HML,
SMB, and excess-Market portfolio returns. From the resulting forty-five return series, a zero-investment returns series is
generated from each of the nine size and book-to-market categories. These portfolios are formed, in each category, by
subtracting the sum of the returns on the 1st and 2nd quintile factor-loading portfolios from the sum of the returns on the
4th and 5th factor-loading portfolios, and then divided by 2.

The first nine rows of the Panel give the mean returns (in percent) and the regression coefficients for the characteristic-
balanced portfolio that has a long position in the high expected factor loading portfolios and a short position in the low
expected factor loading portfolios that have the same size and book-to-market rankings. The bottom row of the right
panel provides the coefficient estimates as well as the t-statistics for this regression for a combined portfolio that
consistent of an equally weighted combination of the above zero-investment portfolios. * represents significance at the
0.1 level and ** significance at 0.05 the level in a two-tailed test.
