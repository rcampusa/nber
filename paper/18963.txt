                                              ABSTRACT

We empirically assess the relative importance of various economic fundamentals in accounting for
the sovereign credit default swap (CDS) spreads of emerging markets during 2004-2012, which encompasses
the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. Inflation, state fragility, external debt, and commodity terms
of trade volatility were positively associated, while trade openness and more favourable fiscal balance/GDP
ratio were negatively associated with sovereign CDS spreads. Yet the relative importance of economic
fundamentals in the pricing of sovereign risk varies over time. The key factors are trade openness and
state fragility in the pre-crisis period, external debt/GDP ratio and inflation in the crisis period, and
inflation and public debt/GDP ratio in the post- crisis period. Asian countries enjoy lower sovereign
spreads than Latin American countries, and this gap widened during and after the crisis. Trade openness
was the biggest factor behind Asia’s lower sovereign spreads before the crisis, and inflation during
and after the crisis. The results imply that external factors were paramount in pricing sovereign risk
prior to the crisis, but internal factors associated with the capacity to adjust to adverse shocks gained
prominence during and after the crisis.

1 Introduction


       Emerging markets showed remarkable resilience during and after the global

financial and economic crisis of 2008-9. Their resilience is all the more remarkable in

light of the advanced-country origins of the global crisis and the subsequent eurozone

sovereign debt crisis. Advanced countries still account for a hefty share of global output

and remain key exports markets for emerging markets. Emerging markets were not

entirely immune from the effects of the global crisis, as evident in the collapse of their

exports and growth in the 4th quarter of 2008 and 1st quarter of 2009. However, by and

large, their financial systems did not suffer the paralysis inflicted upon their US and

European counterparts, largely due to the marginal exposure of emerging-market banks

to US subprime assets. Just as significantly, emerging country governments unleashed

massive fiscal and monetary stimulus programs to support aggregate demand. As a result,

emerging markets weathered the storm of the global crisis far better than expected.

       In striking contrast to the advanced economies, which still remain mired in

stagnation and uncertainty, emerging markets are growing at a healthy pace once again

although they remain exposed to a possible growth deceleration due to the persistent

weaknesses of the former. The much talked about two-speed world economy refers to

the visibly faster and stronger momentum of recovery and growth in the emerging

markets compared to the advanced economies since the global crisis. The healthy growth

of the emerging markets provides welcome relief for a world economy weighed down by

the post-crisis sluggishness of the advanced economies. The two-speed world economy

prompted debate about the possible decoupling of emerging markets from advanced

                                            2
economies. While decoupling is at first sight a plausible interpretation, more rigorous

analysis highlights the need for caution in interpreting the two-speed world economy as

definitive evidence of the decoupling hypothesis.1 For one, it is not at all clear whether

even the most dynamic emerging markets had decoupled themselves from the business

cycle of the advanced economies.2 Even high-flying China reeled from the impact of the

advanced economies’ extended slump and grew by less than 8% in 2012.3

        Regardless of the validity of the decoupling hypothesis, what is beyond dispute is

that emerging markets have fared much better than expected during and after the global

crisis than widely expected. That is, when the US or EU sneezes, China or Thailand or

Brazil no longer catch a cold. The key question then becomes “What explains the

apparent resilience of emerging markets?” One leading candidate is relatively strong

fundamentals or sound policies throughout emerging markets. Asian countries have long

had strong fundamentals such as healthy fiscal positions and these help explain their

superior performance during the past few decades. More recently, emerging markets

outside Asia, most notably Latin America, have also raised their game. According to IMF

(2012), good policies indeed play a major role, explaining about three fifths of the

improved macroeconomic performance of emerging markets. Luck, in the form of less

frequent external and internal shocks, accounts for the rest.
1
  In this context, IMF (2012) warns that it may be premature to jump to hasty conclusions about the
resilience of emerging markets in the post-global crisis period.
2
  Didier et al. (2012) concluded that “Contrary to popular perceptions, emerging economies suffered growth
collapses relative to the pre-crisis levels comparable to those experienced by developed economies, even
when they continued growing. Afterwards, most economies returned to their pre-crisis growth rates.
Although emerging economies were not able to avoid the collapse originated in the US and then transmitted
across countries, they were more resilient during the global crisis than during past crises. Moreover,
breaking with the past, emerging economies did not fall more than developed economies during the global
crisis and were able to conduct countercyclical policies, thus becoming more similar to developed
economies.”
3
  To be sure, there are other reasons for China’s deceleration, including tightening of macroeconomic
policy to prevent asset price bubbles. However, the prolonged weakness of the advanced economies, which
still absorb a large share of China’s exports, is likely to have had a major impact.

                                                    3
       Given the substantial role of fundamentals in mitigating the adverse effect of the

global crisis on emerging markets, the next logical question to ask is which fundamentals

matter the most. The central objective of this paper is to empirically investigate the role

of various fundamentals or economic factors in reducing the vulnerability of emerging

markets to shocks. To do so, we empirically assess the relative importance of key

economic factors such as fiscal balance/GDP ratio, inflation, external debt/GDP ratio,

trade openness, and state fragility in accounting for the sovereign default credit swap

(CDS) spreads in emerging markets during 2004-2012. We use the CDS spread, a widely

used measure of premium, to capture vulnerability to shocks. Going forward, resilience

against shocks is of more than passing interest to emerging markets since the post-global

crisis period is likely to be characterized by greater volatility than the pre-global crisis

period. Above all, the persistent fragility of advanced countries, which are no longer the

bedrocks of stability they used to be, poses a serious threat to global stability and stability

of emerging markets. The on-going eurozone crisis is a concrete example of such threat.4

       Another objective of our analysis is to compare the role of fundamentals across

different regions, particularly Asia versus Latin America (LATAM). A comparison

between the two regions is of considerable interest since they differ noticeably in their

economic structures. More specifically, LATAM is primarily an exporter of commodities

whereas Asia has become the factory of the world partly as a result of different economic

policy orientation in the past – i.e. import substitution in Latin America as opposed to

export promotion in Asia. In addition, Asian countries tend to run larger current account

surpluses or smaller deficits than their Latin American counterparts. Asian countries have

importance of the fundamentals in pricing sovereign risk in the context of the euro debt crisis.

                                               4
also enjoyed greater macroeconomic stability as a result of more prudent fiscal and

monetary policies. Elson (2006) provides a good summary of the structural and policy

differences between the two regions.

       The rest of our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the data and

framework used for our empirical analysis. In this section, we examine descriptive

statistics to take a first cut at the relationship between various fundamentals and CDS

spread. Section 3 reports and discusses the main findings of econometric analysis. In this

section, we perform more rigorous analysis to take a more in-depth look at the nexus

between fundamentals and CDS spreads. Section 4 brings our paper to a close with some

concluding observations. The Appendix reports and discusses the results of principle

component analysis which supplements our main empirical analysis.

2 Data and Empirical Framework

       Figure 1 shows the evolution of sovereign credit default risks of emerging

markets in our sample from 2003Q1 to 2012Q4. Sovereign vulnerability rose markedly

during the crisis period, albeit to varying degrees across countries and regions. For our

empirical analysis, we organize the events around the global financial crisis of 2008-2009

into three phases: the pre-crisis period of 2004-07, the crisis period of 2008-09, and the

post-crisis period of 2010-11. During each of the three periods, we are interested in a

number of fundamental variables that potentially influence the business cycles of

emerging markets. The variables are outlined in Table 1, along with the data sources and

the description of each variable. The data are publicly available at annual frequency up to

2011 for most variables, and up to 2012 for sovereign spreads, real effective exchange




                                            5
rates, and global real economic activity in industrial commodity markets. The variables

cover a wide range of important domestic and external factors in the emerging markets.

                                        [Figure 1]

                                        [Table 1]

       Our sample comprises 20 emerging market countries, of which 7 are in Asia, 6 in

Latin America, 5 in Europe, and 2 in Africa. These countries were selected on the basis of

data availability, especially sufficient information on the fundamental variables and

external shocks. Our sample is quite representative of emerging market economies in the

aggregate. Table 2 provides the list of countries and regions, and the ISO country codes

that we will use in the analysis and figures. Note that all these countries are included in

benchmark global bond and equity indices such as EMBI and MSCI. They are thus

recognized as significant emerging economies in the global capital markets. The

inclusion of counties from Asia, Latin America, Europe, and Africa is critical since this

allows for a more meaningful comparison across countries and regions.

                                        [Table 2]

       The descriptive statistics for the variables of interests are listed in Table 3. For

each variable, we report the difference between its average for Asia and for Latin

America. From 2004-12, sovereign bond yields (EMBI) and sovereign credit default risks

(CDS prices) are clearly on the rise. Both bond yields and default risks tend to be lower

for Asian countries than for Latin American countries, and this gap widened during the

crisis of 2008-09. Looking first at internal factors, the summary statistics do not clearly

indicate which type of internal factors might contribute to the difference between the

regions. Across emerging markets, the domestic credit/GDP ratio increased from 53% in



                                            6
the pre-crisis period, to 60% during the crisis, and 62% after the crisis. Relative to Latin

America, Asia’s domestic credit/GDP ratio is higher, and both public debt/GDP and

fiscal balance/GDP ratios have deteriorated, most likely as a result of the massive fiscal

stimulus put in place to boost aggregate demand during the global crisis. State fragility

also deteriorated in Asia relative to Latin America but inflation has been lower and

industrial production higher throughout the period of study.

                                         [Table 3]

       Turning to external factors, the current account surplus/GDP ratio, along with the

gross trade/GDP ratio, fell for emerging markets during the sample period. While Asian

countries had higher current account surplus/GDP ratio, their external debt level

increased relative to Latin America. Looking at financial assets and liabilities, the gross

(assets + liabilities)/GDP ratio increased across all emerging markets. Latin American

countries have a higher gross FDI/GDP ratio than Asian countries, although the gap is

narrowing. While it is not evident that net foreign assets are increasing for the emerging

markets in our sample, they clearly experienced foreign exchange reserve accumulation

and appreciation of real effective exchange rates. The coefficient of variation of

commodity terms of trade has risen whereas activity in the global commodity markets

declined markedly after the crisis of 2008-09.

       The Appendix supplements these descriptive statistics. There we report the results

of the principle component analysis (PCA), which allows a broader view of the

correlations among the countries and variables in the sample. The factor loadings of each

variable provide information about their contribution to the variation in the data and

which fundamental variables cause the similarities and differences across the emerging



                                             7
markets. To analyze the data in greater detail, we use formal econometric specifications

and regression analysis using ordinary least squares (OLS) for annual data and dynamic

panel estimation (GMM) for quarterly data. Using the OLS and GMM specifications, we

are able to approximate the economic significance of each fundamental determinant of

the vulnerability of emerging markets, and to make comparisons across regions. While

there are a number of vulnerability indicators, we use the sovereign credit default risk

(CDS) as the dependent variable. CDS data is available as real time data for most

emerging markets in our sample, and CDS is a more comparable market summary of

sovereign risk, in terms of its construction and reports, relative to alternative indicators of

sovereign risk. We first analyze annual data in our dynamic panel estimation before

moving on to quarterly data.

3 Empirical Results

       We now turn to a formal econometric estimation. We hope to address a number of

empirical questions by the estimation, including (1) how vulnerable are the emerging

markets in our sample in terms of their internal and external fundamentals, (2) what is the

economic significance of the fundamental variables, and whether there are variations

across region, and (3) did some fundamental variables become relatively more important

since the global crisis. While there are several forms of regression analysis that can be

called upon, we pursue a linear estimation due to its simplicity and the fact that we do not

have any prior on any specific kind of sample distribution for the countries in this study.

3.1 Baseline Results

       Using annual data covering all 20 countries, we start by regressing sovereign

credit default risks, measured by CDS prices, on both internal and external economic



                                              8
fundamentals.5 The linear estimation results in Table 4 are reported for the whole sample

period 2004-12 in column (i), as well as for the pre-crisis period 2004-2007 in (ii), crisis

period 2008-2009 in (iii), and post-crisis period 2010-2012 in (iv). The whole sample

period result suggests that public debt/GDP ratio, inflation, and state fragility are all

associated with the level of default risk, but this relationship is stronger in the pre-crisis

period. We find no evidence of an association between sovereign default risk and current

account surplus/GDP ratio, gross financial trade, external debt/GDP, and foreign

exchange reserves in the pre- and post-crisis periods. External debt and real exchange rate

appreciation are, respectively, positively and negatively associated with sovereign risk.

We find some evidence in the whole sample period that an increase in commodity terms

of trade volatility and a reduction in global commodity activities are positively associated

with the default risk.

                                              [Table 4]

        A regional effect lowers the default risks of Asia relative to those of Latin

America in the pre-crisis period; the coefficient estimate of the dummy variable for Latin

America is positive and statistically significant. However, the regional effect has become

smaller during and after the crisis period. As shown earlier in Table 3 the gap in default

risks between Asia and Latin America has widened in the crisis period, implying that the

higher default risks of Latin America are driven by the underlying fundamentals, and not

simply a time-invariant regional effect.

 Note that we do not include EMBI in the regression. EMBI may be correlated with external debt and other
explanatory variables. The indices have also become less reflective of emerging markets’ external
vulnerability since they are running down their stock of external debt (see Economist, 2007, “Bye-bye
EMBI”). Interestingly, the correlations between EMBI, and public debt/GDP and external debt/GDP ratios
are negative. For all these reasons, we decide not in include EMBI in our estimation.

                                                   9
3.2 Robustness Check

       To gain more confidence about which internal and external factors influence the

vulnerability of emerging markets to shocks, we need to explore alternative empirical

specifications and include other variables in the analysis. In Table 5, we look at an

alternative set of fundamentals for the whole sample period 2004-12. First, to explain

sovereign CDS spreads with an alternative measure of fiscal space, we replace the public

debt/GDP ratio in column (i) in Table 4 with fiscal balance/GDP ratio in column (v) in

Table 5. The fiscal balance/GDP ratio is significant and has the correct sign. To preserve

the degree of freedom, we drop the domestic credit/GDP ratio, which is not significant in

specification (i), from this regression. The estimation results now suggest that both

domestic and external factors are significantly associated with the sovereign default risks

with the expected signs, except current account surplus/GDP ratio, gross financial trade

and real exchange rate appreciation. Note that current account surplus has the correct

sign, but it is not statistically significant. We find that inflation, state fragility, external

debt and commodity terms of trade volatility are positively associated, while fiscal

balance/GDP ratio and global commodity market activities are negatively associated with

sovereign default risk.

                                          [Table 5]

       Next we look at the role of the tradable sector. We do this by replacing current

account surplus/GDP ratio with trade openness, measured by (exports + imports)/GDP

ratio in column (vi). Trade openness is negatively associated with default risk at a higher

level of statistical significance than the current account surplus/GDP ratio. To examine

the financial sector, in column (vii), we replace gross financial trade/GDP ratio with gross



                                              10
FDI investment/GDP ratio, but this variable is not significant. However, when we use

gross equity investment/GDP ratio in column (viii), it is and negatively associated with

sovereign default risk. This seems to suggest that portfolio equity investment is a more

important financial variable than other types of financial flows for emerging markets over

2004-2012. Across the alternative set of estimations in columns (v) to (viii), we find a

core set of economic fundamentals that are statistically significant throughout. These

variables are used as the basis for further analysis about economic significance and

regional differences in the following section.

3.3 Economic Significance

       To measure the economic significance, we first report in Table 6 the estimation

results for the whole sample period [column (ix)] and by each period [columns (x) to

(xii)], based on the set of fundamental variables found statistically significant in Section

3.2. Note that the difference between (ix) of Table 6 and (v) of Table 5 is that we revert

to public debt/GDP ratio, which remain significant nonetheless, as the fiscal space

variable. In the pre-crisis period – i.e. column (x) – we find that fiscal space, inflation,

state fragility, and trade openness are statistically significant with the expected sign.

During the crisis period – i.e. column (xi) – inflation, external debt/GDP ratio and real

exchange rate appreciation are significant with the expected sign. Finally, in the post-

crisis period – i.e. column (xii) – fiscal space and inflation are significant with the

expected sign.

                                         [Table 6]

       Based on our estimation results, we now calculate the economic significance of

each variable. Economic significance is the product of the coefficient estimate in Table 6



                                            11
and the standard deviation of each variable for the corresponding period in Table 3. The

results are reported in Figure 2A for our whole sample of emerging markets for the pre-

crisis period. Trade openness is the most important factor – one standard deviation

increase of trade openness is associated with a 19.0 basis points drop in sovereign CDS

spreads. The second most important variable is state fragility – 9.6 bps increase. The

results for the crisis period is shown in Figure 2B. External debt/GDP ratio is the most

economically significant – one standard deviation increase is associated with 21.1 bps

increase in sovereign CDS spreads. The second most important variable is inflation –

13.5 bps increase. Figure 2C shows the results for the post-crisis period. Inflation and

public debt/GDP ratio are most closely associated with sovereign CDS spreads. One

standard deviation increase of inflation and public debt/GDP ratio is associated with 27.5

bps and 16.4 bps increase of sovereign spreads, respectively.

                                  [Figure 2A, 2B, 2C]

       Next we make comparisons across regions. Figure 3 reports how the economic

significance of each fundamental variable can explain the differences in vulnerability

facing Asian countries vis-à-vis Latin American countries. We do this by multiplying the

coefficient estimate by the difference in the averages between the two regions, as

reported in Table 3, for each variable. In the pre-crisis period, shown in Figure 3A,

Asia’s higher trade openness the most important factor that explains regional differences

in sovereign default risks. Asia’s higher level of trade openness is associated with 36.7

basis points lower sovereign CDS spreads. State fragility – 17.8 bps higher in Asia – is

the next most important factor. During the crisis of 2008-09, shown in Figure 3B, lower

inflation is the most economically significant in explaining the difference – 11.5 bps



                                           12
lower CDS spreads in Asia. The external debt/GDP ratio – 5.4 bps higher in Asia – is the

next most important factor. After the crisis, shown in Figure 3C, lower inflation is the

most significant in explaining the difference between the two regions – Asia’s 44.1 bps

lower sovereign spread. The public debt/debt ratio – 12.9 bps higher in Asia – is the next

most important factor.6

                                         [Figure 3A, 3B, 3C]

3.4 Econometric Results Based on Quarterly Data

        Annual data may be subject to aggregation issues. For example, during the global

financial crisis sovereign vulnerability could be affected by variables that tend to

fluctuate at higher frequencies than annually. To explore this possibility, we gather

available quarterly series. Countries with sufficient quarterly data include six from Asia

[China, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand], three from Latin America

[Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico], and three from other regions [Hungary, Russia, and

South Africa].

        Quarterly data allows us to work with a more dynamic econometric specification.

We are also able to narrowly pin down the global crisis period to 2007Q3-2009Q3. Our

variables of interests are trade balance and industrial production. The results of the

estimations based on annual data indicate that current account balance/GDP ratio and

trade openness are significantly associated with sovereign default risks of emerging


6
  Ideally we would like to lag the explanatory variable by one period, since simultaneity may be an issue.
However, lagging presents its own problems. For one, lagged values might fall in a different period than the
dependent variable – e.g. explanatory variables are from the in pre-crisis period but the dependent variable
is from the crisis period. Some data is lost in the lagging process. Using the contemporaneous values t = 0
may be defended on the ground that reverse causality from sovereign spreads to real variables is unlikely.
At any rate, we have tested the relationship using lagged determinants and find that the results, which are
available from authors upon request, are less significant. More importantly, some coefficients on the lagged
explanatory variables have the wrong sign, most notably the public debt/GDP ratio, which is now
negatively associated with CDS spreads.

                                                    13
markets. At a higher level of data frequency, say quarterly or monthly, trade

balance/GDP ratio is the indicator that financial markets tend to follow. Industrial

production is also widely followed by financial markets on a real-time basis at monthly

and quarterly intervals. The insignificance of industrial production in the estimation

results based on annual data may be due to aggregation issues.



       The estimation results based on quarterly data are presented in Table 7. The

coefficients are estimated using the GMM dynamic panel data estimation [see Arellano

and Bond (1991)]. The estimation includes as endogenous explanatory variables lagged

CDS, industrial production, and trade balance/GDP ratio. The instruments that we used

are the variables found significant in the annual data estimation, namely public debt/GDP

ratio, inflation, trade openness, external debt/GDP ratio, real effective exchange rate, and

world index of industrial commodity activity. We also include the interaction of crisis

period – dummy variable taking on value of 0 or 1 – with industrial production and trade

balance/GDP ratio to see whether the crisis affected the association between these

variables and sovereign CDS spreads.

                                         [Table 7]

       In the quarterly data, there is some persistence of sovereign default risk price in

Asia (column xiii) and in Latin America (column xiv). On average, higher industrial

production lowers sovereign risk in other emerging markets, but not in Asia and Latin

America. During the crisis period, industrial production remains significant for other

emerging markets and becomes significant for Asia but remains insignificant for Latin

America. We find that trade balance/GDP ratio is significant in explaining Latin



                                            14
America’s sovereign default risk, and the effect is not larger during the crisis period.

Trade balance/GDP ratio has no discernible effect in Asia or other emerging markets.

       Figure 4 summarizes the economic significance of the quarterly macroeconomic

variables on sovereign vulnerability in each region. Each bar in Figure 4 is computed

similarly to Figures 1 and 3. The economic significance is found by multiplying the

coefficient estimate with the standard deviation of each variable. For Asia, we find that

the most important variable is industrial production, which explains about 17.3 basis

points of sovereign CDS price during the crisis period. The next most significant

variables are the crisis effect, equals to 5.7 bps, and the persistence of CDS price, equals

to 3.7 bps. These results are derived from quarterly data, so adding them up over a year

could result in quite sizable effects. For Latin America, we find that the persistence of

CDS price is the most economically important variable – 49.3 bps – followed by trade

balance/GDP ratio – 28.4 bps. For other emerging markets, industrial production is the

most significant variable, with the effect especially pronounced during the crisis, when it

rose to 38.7 bps from 11 bps on average.

4 Concluding Observations

       One of the most interesting and significant recent economic trends is the

resilience of emerging markets in the face of the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and

the prolonged weakness of the advanced economies since that crisis. While emerging

markets were not immune from the effects of the crisis, their relatively robust recovery

and growth in the post-crisis period has given the world economy a much needed fillip at

a time when its traditional engine of growth – the advanced economies – is stalling. This



                                            15
naturally brings up the question of what are the key factors that explain the resilience of

the emerging markets in the face of shocks? Or, conversely, what are the key factors

which heighten or lower their vulnerability to shocks? The answers to these questions

matter for at least a couple of reasons. For one, they help us to better understand the

resilience and vulnerability of emerging markets to shocks in recent years. Just as

importantly, they give us some clues about the potential resilience and vulnerability of

emerging markets to future shocks in the post-global crisis environment of increased

global volatility and uncertainty. This type of analysis can also help us identify

differences in the relative importance of different fundamentals across different regions.

       More specifically, using 2004-2012 data from 20 major emerging markets in four

regions, we regress sovereign credit default risks, measured by CDS prices, on internal

and external economic fundamentals. We find that inflation, state fragility, external debt,

and commodity terms of trade volatility were positively associated, while trade openness

and more favourable fiscal balance/GDP were negatively associated with sovereign CDS

spreads. Our results are consistent with economic intuition. To better gauge how the

relative importance of the different fundamentals changed over time, especially around

the global crisis of 2008-2009, we divide the sample period into the pre-crisis period,

crisis period and the post-crisis period. The key factors are trade openness and state

fragility in the pre-crisis period, external debt/GDP ratio and inflation in the crisis period,

and inflation and public debt/GDP ratio in the pos-crisis period. Comparing two regions

at broadly similar income levels but significantly different fundamentals, we find that

Asian countries enjoy lower sovereign spreads than Latin American countries, and this




                                              16
gap widened during and after the crisis. Trade openness was the biggest factor behind

Asia’s lower sovereign spreads before the crisis, and inflation during and after the crisis.

       Our results suggest that the pricing of risk depends both on external and internal

fundaments. Prior to the crisis, the markets placed greater importance on external factors,

in particular trade openness. The higher the degree of exposure to foreign trade, the more

dependent an economy is on the global business cycle and hence the larger the impact of

foreign output shocks. The global crisis and its aftermath brought to the fore the

challenge of managing crisis. The markets thus gave a bigger weight to the scope for the

government to use fiscal and monetary policy to mitigate the adverse impact of crisis. As

a result, public debt/GDP ratio and inflation – indicators of fiscal and monetary space –

became more important in explaining sovereign credit default risks. In addition, external

debt/GDP ratios also gained significance. The results of both regression analysis and

principle component analysis, reported in the Appendix, suggest that the global crisis has

heightened market awareness of tail risks and the varying capacity of emerging-market

governments to cope with those risks. Overall, our findings seem fairly robust in the

sense that all results are consistent with economic intuition and attest to the substantial

role of economic fundamentals in the pricing of sovereign risk in emerging markets. For

one, our baseline specification can explain over half of the variation in CDS spreads.

Furthermore, the lower sovereign spreads enjoyed by Asian countries relative to Latin

American countries is probably due in part to their stronger fundamentals.

                        Principle Component Analysis:
            How comparable are the fundamentals of emerging markets?

Whole sample period, 2004 – 2012

       In this appendix, we present the results of principle component analysis (PCA).

Since PCA and OLS specifications are very different estimation techniques, PCA results

should be viewed as supplementary. The purpose of PCA is not to replace OLS, but

instead to get some additional information about our sample, including comparability

across emerging markets, association among the different fundamentals, and the effect of

the 2008-09 global financial crisis. In Figure A.1, the left panel plots the result of

principal component analysis of the fundamentals data. The score-plot has the x and y

axes that report how well we can explain the variation in the data. For 2004-12, we can

explain 42 percent of the data by the top two components. In the plot, a country is

denoted by A if it is in Asia, L if Latin America, and O if otherwise. We can see that

countries in the same region tend to bunch together, albeit to a varying degree. The score-

plot cannot answer why countries from different regions are situated relative to each other

in this way based on the economic fundamentals, but nonetheless some clear regional

patterns emerge.

       While we are inclined to think that the data are drawn from some underlying

distribution for this sample of emerging markets, there are some outliers, though not so

extreme, notably the plots marked ‘O’. A closer look at the data indicates that these plots

represent Hungary before, during, and after the crisis. To help understand the variation in

the data, we provide the loadings-plot on the right panel. The loadings provide further

information about each of the 16 economic fundamentals. We can see that the relative



                                            19
importance of the fundamentals differs across countries. For Asia, a large part of the

variation is explained by current account surplus/GDP, domestic credit/GDP, foreign

reserves/GDP, and gross equity (assets + liabilities)/GDP ratios. On the other hand, for a

number of Latin American and other emerging markets, sovereign spreads, commodity

terms of trade, inflation, fiscal space, and state fragility are likely to be more important.

       The score-plot suggests that economic fundamentals are important, as most do not

locate near the (0,0) coordinate. The exception is the index of global real economic

activity in industrial commodity markets, which implies that this variable is not consistent

with the variation in the data. We can see several correlations among the variables. For

instance, current account surplus/GDP, domestic credit/GDP, foreign reserves/GDP, and

gross equity (assets + liabilities)/GDP ratios are located nearby each other, suggesting

that these variables move together and contain similar information about the variation in

the emerging market sample. Notice that current account surplus/GDP ratio is located

opposite the credit default swap spreads, implying a negative association.

Pre-crisis period, 2004-07

       We now divide the sample period into three sub-periods. Figure A.2 provides the

score-plot and loadings-plot for the pre-crisis fundamentals in detail. Based on what we

learned in the earlier plot, we make two adjustments in the principle component analysis.

We remove the index of global real economic activity in industrial commodity markets,

and we drop Hungary. While these adjustments allow more clarity in the plots, by no

means should we completely discard Hungary and the index of global real economic

activity in industrial commodity markets. They are not mismeasured but outliers and can

thus be handled in a subsequent estimation analysis. The pre-crisis PCA suggests that the



                                              20
top two components can explain 45 percent of the data. We can see in the pre-crisis

score-plot some regional similarities based on the economic fundamentals, notably

among China, Korea, and Thailand in Asia, and among Brazil, Mexico, Peru, and

Colombia within Latin America.

       Before the crisis, we can also see several groups of variables that drive variation

in the data. Most visible in the loadings-plot are the current account balance/GDP ratio,

gross financial (assets + liabilities)/GDP ratio, net foreign assets/GDP ratio, and trade

openness. Taken together with the score-plot, this seems to suggest that prior to the crisis

Asian emerging markets were driven by trade and financial openness, as well as foreign

direct investment and domestic credit/GDP ratios. There is no clear pattern in the data of

other emerging markets. The exceptions include Argentina and Egypt, both of which are

influenced by the stock of public debt/GDP and the stock of external debt/GDP ratios,

and Brazil, Mexico, and Peru, influenced by sovereign spreads.

Crisis period, 2008-09

       During the crisis, the top two components account for 46 percent of variation in

the data. The score-plot and loadings-plot in Figure A.3 suggest some patterns in the data

during this turbulent period. First, emerging markets in Asia, notably China, Thailand,

and Malaysia, are influenced by current account balance/GDP, foreign reserves/GDP, and

net foreign assets/GDP ratios, while Korea is driven by domestic credit/GDP ratio, trade

openness, and gross financial (assets + liabilities)/GDP ratio. Second, South Africa and

Czech Republic are exposed to the crisis via external debt/GDP ratio, while Brazil,

Mexico, Colombia, and Turkey are influenced by sovereign bond spreads and fiscal

balance/GDP ratio. Third, during the crisis, Argentina appears to be affected by CDS



                                            21
spreads, public debt/GDP ratio, inflation, and government fragility. These observations

suggest that the exposure of each emerging market to the global financial crisis of 2008-

09 varied idiosyncratically with a number of economic fundamentals.

Post-crisis period, 2010-12

        In the post-crisis period, it is clear that some countries and regions are affected

more by a certain set of economic fundamentals, as evident in Figure A.4. First, there are

similarities among China, Korea, Thailand, and Malaysia in that these emerging markets

are influenced by current account balance/GDP, foreign reserves/GDP, and domestic

credit/GDP ratios. This appears to be a common theme that we also observed before and

during the crisis period. Second, sovereign bond spreads are associated with significant

variation in the data of Brazil, Turkey, Mexico, Colombia, and Indonesia; for Brazil and

Mexico, this is similar to the earlier periods. Third, India, Argentina, and Egypt are

driven by inflation, commodity terms of trade, sovereign CDS spreads, and state fragility.

Fourth, external debt/GDP ratio and real effective exchange rates separate Poland and

Czech Republic from the other countries. Lastly, China has become quite different from

the rest of the sample due the size of its net foreign assets/GDP ratio.

        We sum up the results of the principle component analysis into two points: (1)

While emerging markets in Asia are more likely driven by current account balance/GDP,

foreign reserves/GDP, and domestic credit/GDP, those in Latin America are influenced

by sovereign bond spreads; (2) variation in the sample across these countries depends on

the periods of study: whether it is pre-crisis, crisis, or post-crisis period does matter.

Table 7. Quarterly Adjustment of Sovereign Default Risk over the Crisis Period.
This table reports the dynamic panel estimation (system GMM) using quarterly data. The depedent variable is
the change in sovereign credit default swap prices. The explanatory variables are the change in industrial
production index (2005=100) and the size of trade balance/GDP, both of which are treated as endogeneous
determinants. The instruments include public debt/GDP, inflation, trade openness, external debt/GDP, real
effective exchange rate, and world index of industrial commodity actitity. The sample covers 2004Q2 to
2012Q3. The crisis period is defined over the period of 2007Q3 to 2009Q3. Robust standard errors are in
parentheses, with ** (*) denotes statistical significance at 1 (5) percent level.

Figure 3. Economic Significance of Internal & External Shocks, Asia versus Latin America, Annual Data.
This figure plots the economic significance of each fundamental variable on the sovereign credit default risk,
comparing Asia and Latin America. Each bar is calculated by multiplying a coefficient estimate in Table 6 with
a difference between Asia and Latin America (a former minus a latter) of a concerning variable (in descriptive
statistics of Table 3). The plots are reported in basis points of sovereign CDS prices.
