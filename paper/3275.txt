                INCREASING RETURNS AND ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY


                                ABSTRACT

     This paper develops a two—region, two—sector general
equilibriun model of location. The location of agricultural
production is fixed, but ionopolistcally competitive manufacturing
finns choose their location to maximize profits. If transportation
costs are high, returns to scale weak, and the share of spending
on manufactured goods low, the incentive to produce close to the
market leads to an equal division of manufacturing between the
regions. With lower transport costs, stronger scale economies, or
a higher manufacturing share, circular causation sets in: the more
manufacturing is located in one region, the larger that region's
share of demand, and this provides an incentive to locate still
more manufacturing there. Thus when the parameters of the economy
lie even slightly on one side of a critical "phase boundary", all
manufacturing production ends up concentrated in only one region.

     The study of     economic        geography           -   -        of    the     location           of     factors              of

production in space      -   occupies a relatively small part of                                 standard               economic

analysis. International trade theory,                   in        particular,             conventionally                  treats

nations as dimensionless points (and frequently                                assumes      zero         transportation

costs between countries as well). Adnittedly, models descended from von Thünen

play an important role         in     urban       studies,              while       Hotelling-ty-pe             models              of

locational competition get a reasonable                       degree           of    attention           in     industrial

organization. On the whole, however, it seems fair to say that                                           the       study            of

economic geography plays at best a marginal role in economic theory.

     On the face    of       it,    this      neglect             is        surprising.       The             facts                 of

economic geography are surely among the most striking features                                           of     real-world

economies, at least to laymen. For example, one of the most remarkable                                                       things

about the United States is that in a                    generally              sparsely       populated                 country,

much of whose land is fertile, the bulk of the population                                     resides              in        a     few

clusters   of   metropolitan          areas;       forty           percent          are    crowded            into           a     not

especially inviting section of the East Coast. It has often                                        been        noted              that

nighttime satellite photos of Europe reveal little                                  of    political            boundaries,

but clearly suggest a center-periphery pattern whose hub is                                         soniewhere               in     or

near Belgium. A laynian might have expected that these facts would play                                                      a     key

role in economic modelling.

      Furthermore, there is a long if                    somewhat              thin       tradition           in        location

theory, that one might         have       supposed        would              inspire       the      efforts             of        both

theorists and econometricians. Indeed,                    several              schools        of        thought          nay        be

identified. Best known, perhaps, is the German School, originating in the work

of von Thünen (1826) but            led    in     the     twentieth                 century        by    Weber           (1909),

Christaller (1933), and Lösch (1940). Inspired by this German school, but less

preoccupied with the geometry of location, was the American school of regional

science, including Hoover (1948) and                    especially              Isard       (1956).           Yet        another




                                              1
tradition, drawing on Marshall's initial description of agglomeration                                               due     to

external economies, stresses the role of externalities in producing                                            divergent

regional development; the most influential                  writings           in        this       tradition              are

those of Myrdal (1957),      Hirschmann           (1958),     and        Perroux           (1950),             and        this

tradition has been carried on more recently by David (1984) and Arthur (1989).

      Economic geography, then,         is both an important subject and one that                                          has

at least occasionally drawn sustained attention. Yet it is largely ignored by

the   economics    profession.    Why?      The      answer     seems           clearly              to         lie         in

considerations of method. The interesting questions of economic geography                                                  are

not easily addressed by the model            of     competitive           general           equilibrium                   that

increasingly came to dominate economic thinking between 1940 and the 1970s. If

we ask why so much of the American economy is concentrated in                                   a        few        coastal

strips, we are immediately driven            to     speak     about           economies             of     scale           and

externalities. Yet economies       of       scale     internal           to     firms           imply          imperfect

competition, which until recently was               regarded        as        too        difficult             to     model

rigorously,     while   purely   technological              external            economies                 seem            both

itnplausible and too elusive to have useful empirical content.                                  The        result           is


that discussions of economic geography have historically tended to rely either

on logically incomplete models or on verbal discussion in which models are                                                  at

best implicit. As standards of rigor rose over time, and as                                 those          economists

who wrote about geographical issues failed to keep                       up,         their          work        and        the

subject as a whole was simply submerged.

      This crowding out of important but poorly formalized insights in economic

geography is reniniscent of what happened in several other areas of economics.

Most notably,     in    international       trade     the     insights              of     such          thinkers           as

Burenstam Linder (1961), Vernon (1966), and even of important parts                                            of     Ohlin

were increasingly neglected as a rigorous general equilibrium approach                                               became

de rigeur; while in development economics the same happened to                                      the        ideas        of




                                        2
such authors as Young (1928) and Rosenstein-Rodan (1943). In                              both        trade             and

development,   however,   recent      applications       of    new            models        derived                  from

industrial organization have begun to restore the prominence of these                                          earlier

ideas. In trade, the "new international economics" of such                            authors             as        Dixit

and Norman (1980), Krugman (1979), and Helpman (1981)                         has     given           rigor,            and

hence respectability, to non-comparative-advantage explanations of                                        trade.         In

development economics, the "new growth theory" of Romer                            (1986,        1987),             Lucas

(1988), and of Murphy, Shleifer,          and   Vishny    (1989a,              1989b)       has           begun          to

accomplish the same thing.

     The purpose of this paper is to suggest that application                               of        models            and

techniques derived   from    theoretical        industrial          organization                 now          allow       a

reconsideration of economic geography; that it                is    now            time     to        attempt            to


incorporate the insights of the long but informal tradition in this area                                             into

formal models. In order to     make       the   point,    the       paper            develops             a        simple

illustrative model designed to shed light on             one        of        the     key        questions               of

location: why and when does manufacturing become                    concentrated                  in           a        few

regions, leaving others relatively undeveloped?

     What we will see is that it is possible to develop a very simple model of

regional divergence based on       the     interaction        of    economies               of        scale          with

transportation costs. This is perhaps not too surprising, given the                                       kinds          of

results that have been emerging in recent           literature                (with        Murphy             et.       al.


perhaps the closest parallel). More interesting                is        the        fact     that             regional

divergence need not always happen, and that whether                      it        does     depends                in    an

interesting way on a few key parameters. These parameters                            define           a       sort       of

"phase boundary"; the geography of economies that lie                         on     one     side             of     that

boundary will evolve in a fundamentally different way from that                                  of       economies

that lie on the other side.

     The paper is in five parts.          The   first    part        sets           the     stage             with       an




                                      3
informal discussion of the problem. The second then sets                 out     the        analytical

model. In the third part we analyze the determination of short-run equilibrium

and dynamics. The fourth section analyzes the conditions under which                          regional

divergence does and does not occur. Finally, the paper concludes with a                            brief

discussion of some natural extensions.




1.         for regional divergence



     Why   is   so much of the population of the US concentrated along                      500    miles

of the East Coast? The standard answer is "external economies". At some                             level

this must be right; yet as it stands the answer is unsatisfying, because it is

too vague and leaves too many questions hanging. What is the nature of these

externalities? How      necessary   is    the     geographical     concentration             to     their

realization? How different would either history or               technology       have        to     have

been for the great American megalopolis either not to exist or to,                     be         located

somewhere else? Without more specificity these questions                 cannot        usefully        be

posed.

     I will adopt the working assumption that the externalities that sometimes

lead to regional divergence are vecuniarv externalities associated with either

demand or supply linkages, rather than            purely   technological         spillovers.           In

competitive general equilibrium, of course, pecuniary                  externalities          have     no

welfare significance and could not lead to the kind of interesting dynamics we

will derive later. Over the past decade, however, it               has    become        a     familiar

point that in the presence of imperfect competition               and     increasing          returns,

pecuniary externalities matter --        for    example, that     if     one    firm's            actions

affect the demand for the product of another firm whose price exceeds marginal

cost, this is as much a "real       externality as if one firm's               R&D     spills        over




                                     4
into the general knowledge pool. At the same time, by focussing                           on        pecuniary

externalities we are able to make the analysis much more concrete than                                     if    we

allowed   external    economies     to   arise     in     some      invisible       form            (this        is


particularly true when location is at issue:                  how   far    does     a      technological

spillover spill?).

      To understand the nature of the postulated pecuniary                        externalities,                  it

is useful to retrace some of the steps of               the     grand      tradition           in     location

theory. Weber (1909), though best known for               his       "location       triangles",                 also

laid out a general view of the evolution of a pattern of location in a nation.

He thought of this as involving the sequential laying                      down     of     a        series        of

"strata", increasingly divorced from the distribution                      of     natural           resources.

The first stratum would consist of farmers, miners, etc.. whose location would

be determined by the distribution of arable               land      and     other        resources.              One

might idealize the distibution of this first stratum by imagining it uniformly

spread across a featureless plain. The second stratum would                         consist           of        less

locationally bound activities designed to service the first stratum - -                                    market

towns, manufacturing activities, and so on. Because of                      transportation                 costs,

the second stratum's location would tend to follow that of the first;                                  because

of economies of      scale,   however,     it    would not          be     unifor1y distributed.

Instead, it would form a sort of lattice across the plain. There would then be

a third stratum of activities servicing the               second         stratum,        and        forming        a


sparser lattice, and so on.

     Two latsr authors        elaborated     these      basic       scheme.       Christaller              (1933)

argued that the lattices of the          second,     third,         etc.    strata        would        form        a


hierarchy of central      places,    whose      number        would      decrease        but        population

increase as one went up the scale. Christaller                  documented         the     existence              of

such a hierarchy in southern Germany. Lösch (1940), in a famous                            contribution,

pointed out that if the objective was to minimize transportation                               costs,           then
the lattice of central places on a featureless plain would form                                   a     series           of

hexagonal market areas.

     Thit is this scheme right? Isard (1956) pointed out                         a     key        problem           with

Weber's view, and hence with the Christaller-Losch                      extensions.               According

to the Weberian story, the second stratum exists to                       service           the        first,           the

third to service the second, and so on. However, some of the                                demand           for        the

second stratum's services will come, not from the first stratum, but frotn                                              the

second and higher strata themselves. This immediately raises                                the       possibility

of a process of circular causation: the location of higher strata                                      depends           on

the distribution of demand, but the distribution                   of      demand           depends           on        the

location of higher strata.

     The circularity become still worse if              one        takes        into        account           another

factor: it will, other things equal, be more desirable                          to     live           and     produce

near a central place high in the hierarchy,             because            it        will     than           be     less

expensive to buy the goods and services this central place provides.

     The circularity will not matter too much if the higher strata employ only

a small fraction of the population and hence generate only a small fraction of

demand; or if a combination of weak economies of scale and high transportation

costs induce suppliers of goods and services to the lowest stratum                                      to        locate

very close to their markets. These criteria would have                          been        satisfied              in     a


pre-railroad, pre-industrial     society,        such     as       that         of     sixteenth-century

Europe. In such a society the bulk of the population would have                                   been        engaged

in agricultur.; the small manufacturing and comiiiercial sector would                                       not     have

been marked by   very     substantial   economies             of     scale;           and     the           costs        of

transportation would have ensured that most of the needs                             that     could           not        be

satisfied by rural production would         be     satisfied by                  small        towns           serving

roughly hexagonal market areas.

     Bit now let the society become richer,              so        that     a        higher           fraction           of




                                   6
income is spent on non-agricultural goods and services; let the factory system

and eventually mass production emerge, and with them economies of                                 large-scale

production;   and    let   canals,   railroads,     and     finally                 automobiles               lower

transportation costs. Then the tie of production to the distribution                                    of     land

will be broken. A region with a relatively large nonrural population                                    will       be

an attractive place to produce both because of             the        large           local      market            and

because of the availability of the goods and             services              produced          there;        this

will attract still more population, at the expense                   of        regions          with     smaller

initial production; and the process will feed on itself until the whole of the

nonrural population is concentrated in a few regions.

     There    are   two    interesting     points   suggested                  by        this      imaginary

history. First, it seems that small changes in the parameters of                                 the     economy

may have large effects on its qualitative behavior. That is, when                                 some        index

that takes into account transportation costs,             economies                 of    scale,        and        the

share of nonagricultural goods in expenditure crosses a                         critical          threshhold,

population will start to concentrate and regions                to        diverge;         once         started.

this process will feed on itself. Thus the geography will go through a kind of

change of state when the index crosses a critical level, much as water changes

its qualitative behavior when the temperature goes from a little                                 above        to     a


little below freezing.

     Second, the details of the geography that emerges                     •   - which     regions end up

with the population -- depend sensitively on initial conditions. If one region

has slightly aor. population than another when, say, transportation costs fall

below some critical level, that region ends up gaining                         population          at        the

other's expense; had the distribution of population at                         that       critical           moment

been only slightly different,        the   roles    of    the        regions             might     have        been

reversed. Again to use a physical analogy, this is a "random broken synimetry":

like ice crystallizing as water is cooled, the detailed structure                                 depends           on




                                      7
possibly small accidents of early history.

     This is about as far as an informal story can take us. The next                         step       is

to develop as simple as possible a formal model, to see whether the story just

told can be given a more rigorous formulation.



2. A two-region model



     We begin, for simplicity, with a model of two             regions     (a       many-region

model is considered in the last section). In this model there are                   assumed             to

be two kinds of production: agriculture, which is          a     constant-returns                 sector

tied to the land, and manufactures, an increasing-returns sector that                            can    be

located in either region.

     The model, like many of the models in both the            new      trade     and        the       new

growth   literature,    is   a   variant   on      the         monopolistic         competition

framework initially proposed by Dixit and       Stiglitz        (1977).     This        framework,

while admittedly special, is remarkably    powerful        in     its     ability           to     yield

simple intuition-building treatments of seemingly intractable                   issues.

     All individuals in this economy, then, are assumed to                 share        a        utility

function of the form



                                  U —




where CA is consumption of the agricultural good and CM is                consumption              of    a

manufactures aggregate. Given (1), of course, manufactures will always receive

a share p of expenditure; this share is one of the key               parameters         that           will

determine whether regions converge or diverge.

     The manufactures aggregate CM is defined by
                              CM -   (E(al)/c)c/(cl)                                             (2)




where N is the large number of potential products and c>l is the elasticity of

substitution among the products. The elasticity          c   is    the     second       parameter

determining the character of equilibrium in the model.

        There are two regions in the economy, and two factors             of     production       in

each region. Following the simplification suggested in             Krugman        (1981),    each

factor is assumed specific to one sector. Peasants produce agricultural goods;

without loss of generality we suppose that the unit labor requirement is                        one.

The peasant population is assumed completely immobile between regions, with                        a


given peasant supply (l-/A)/2 in each region.         Workers     may     move     between       the

regions; we let L1, L2 be the worker supply in regions 1 and 2,                   respectively,

and require only that the total add up to the overall nunber of workers



                                      L1+L2—/A                                                   (3)




        The production of an individual manufactured good i involves a fixed cost

and constant marginal cost, giving rise to economies of scale:




                                     i —a÷fl                                                     (4)




where       is the labor used in producing i and         is the good's output.

        We turn next to the structure of transportation           costs    between       the two

regions.     Two   strong   assuptions    will   be   made   for     tractability.          First,


1This choice of units ensures that the wage rate of             workers        equals    that     of

peasants in long-run equilibrium.

transportation of agricultural output ii.ll k. assumed                                        g costless.2                The

effect of this sssuniption is to ensure thst the price of agricutturat                                                output,

and hence the earnings of each peasant, are the same in both regions. We                                                 will

use   this   common   agricultural     price/wage              rate            as         nunieraire.                 Second,

transportation    costs   for   manufactured             goods      will            be        assumed            to      take

Samuelson's "iceberg" form, in which transport costs are incurred in the                                                 good

transported. Specifically, of each           unit        of    manufactures                    shipped           from     one

region to the other, only a fraction r<l arrives. This fraction r, which is an

inverse index of transportation costs,              is        the    final           parameter              determining

whether regions converge or diverge.

      We can now turn to the behavior of firms. Suppose that there are a large

number of manufacturing firms, each producing a single product. Then given the

definition of the manufacturing aggregate (2) and the                               assumption              of        iceberg

transport costs, the elasticity of demand facing any individual firm is a (see

Krugman (1980)). The profit-maximizing pricing behavior                                  of     a     representative

firm in region 1 is therefore to set a price equal to




                                P1 —       [a/(al)]flwl                                                                   (5)




where w1 is the wage rate of workers in region 1. A similar                                     equation              applies

in region 2; so comparing the prices of representative products, we have


2The reason for this assumption is the following: since agricultural                                              products

are assumed to be homogeneous, each region is either                            exporting              or        importing

them, never both. But if agricultural goods                   are     costly              to        transport,           this

would introduce a "cliff" at the           point    where           the        two        regions           have        equal

numbers of workers, and thus     where        neither          had        to        import           food.        This     is


evidently an   artifact    of   the    two-region             case:        if        peasants           were          spread

uniformly across a featureless plain, there would be no discontinuity.



                                      10
                                                 — w1/w2-                                          (6)




     If there is free entry of           firms       into   manufacturing,      profits    must     be

driven to zero. Thus it niust be true that



                                                      — aw1                                         (7)




which implies



                                x1 — x2          —   a/(ci-l)                                       (8)




     That is, output per firm       is    the same in each region, irrespective of wage

rates, relative demand, etc.. This has the useful implication that the                          number

of manufactured goods produced in each region is proportional to the number of

workers, so that



                                     n1/n2 — L1/L2                                                  (9)




     It should be noted that in zero-profit equilibrium ci/(ci-l) is                      the    ratio

of the marginal product of labor to its average product, i.e., the                        degree    of

economies of scale. Thus Q,    although it is a parameter of tastes                  rather        than

technology, can be interepreted as an inverse index of                   equilibrium      economies

of scale. As such, it   is    the        third       and    final   parameter    determining       the

behavior of this economy.

     We have now laid out the basic structure of the niodel. The next                       step     is


to turn to the determination of equilibrium.




                                         11
3. Short-run and long-run equilibrium



     This model lacks any explicit dynamics. However, it is useful to                              have     a


concept of short-run equilibrium before turning to full equilibrium. Short-run

equilibrium will be defined in a Marshallian way, as an equilibrium                           in       which

the allocation of workers between regions may        be      taken        as     given.           We     then

suppose that workers move toward the      region     that        offers        them     higher           real

wages, leading either to convergence      between    regions         as        they     move           toward

equality of worker-peasant ratios, or divergence as the workers all congregate

in one region.

     To analyze short-run equilibrium, we      begin        by     looking        at     the           demand

within each region for products of the two regions. Let c11 be the consumption

in region 1 of a representative region 1 product, and c12 be                     the     consumption

in region 1 of a representative region 2 product. The price of a local product

is simply its f.o.b. price p1; the price of a product from the                        other        region,

however, is its transport-cost-inclusive price p2/r. Thus the relative                                 demand

for representative products is



                      c11/c12 —   (p1r/p2)°—(w1r/w2)°                                                    (10)




     Define z11 as the ratio of region 1 expenditure on local manufactures                                 to


that on manufactures from   the   other    region.    Two         points        should        be       noted

about z. First, a one percent rise in the relative price of                     region        1        goods,

while reducing the relative quantity sold by a percent, will reduce the yj

by only a-l percent, because of the valuation effect. Second, the                        more           goods

produced in region 1, the higher their share         of     expenditure           for     any           given

relative price. Thus z11 equals




                                  12
               — (n1/n2)(p1r/p2)(c11/c12)             —    (L1/L2)(w1r/w2)°                               (11)




     Similarly, the ratio of         region      2    spending        on     region        1   products     to

spending on local products is



                                 —   (L1/L2)(w1/w2r)°                                                     (12)




     The total income of region 1 workers is equal to the                           total      spending     on

these products in both regions. (Transportation                     costs     are        included    because

they are assumed to be incurred in the goods themselves). Let Y1,                               Y2   be    the

regional incomes (including the wages of peasants). Then the income of                                  region

1 workers is



                w1L1 —   p([z11/(14-z11)]Y1          +     [z12/(l+z12)]Y2)                               (13)




and the income of region 2 workers is



                     w2L2 —   p([l/(l+z11)]Y1         +    [l/(l+z12)Y2)                                  (14)




     The incomes of the two regions, however, depend on                        the        distribution      of

workers and their wages. Recalling that the                  wage     rate     of        peasants    is    the

numeraire, we have




                                      —   (l-p)/2    + s,1L1                                              (15)




                                 "2 —     (l-p)/2    + w2L2                                               (16)




    The set    of    equations       (ll)-(16)       may     be     regarded        as     a   system     that

determines       and      (as well as four other variables) given the                     distribution

of labor between regions 1 and 2. By inspection, one can see                       that     if

w1—w2. If labor is then shifted to region 1, however, the relative                          wage          rate

w1/w2 can move either way. The reason is that there are two opposing                             effects.

On one side, there is the "home market effect": other things equal,                             the       wage

rate will tend to be higher in the larger market (see Krugman (1980)). On                                  the

other side, there is the extent of competition: workers in the region with the

smaller manufacturing labor force will face                less    competition       for the           local

peasant market than those in the more populous region. In other                          words,           there

is a tradeoff between proximity to the larger market and lack                       of     competition

for the local market.

        In moving from    short-run       to    long-run     equilibrium,        however,        a        third

consideration enters the picture.              Workers     are    interested,      not     in        nominal

wages, but in real wages; and workers in the region with the larger population

will face a lower price for manufactured goods. Let f—L1/p, the share                                of     the

manufacturing     labor    force     in    region    1.    Then     the   true     price        index        of

manufactured goods for consumers residing in region 1 is




                  P1 -    [fw° (l-f)(w2/c)]°
                                      +                                                                    (17),




while    that for consumers residing in region 2 is


                  P2 -    [f(w1/c)             +   (l-f)w)'°                                               (18)

  either regional convergence or regional divergence.

       Figure 1 makes the point. It shows computed values of
                                                                                       as a function
  of f in two different cases. In both cases we assume
                                                                  cz—4    and     p—.3.         In      one
  case, however, r—.5 (high transportation
                                                  costs), while in the other r—.75 (low
 transportation costs). In the high transport cost
                                                    case, the relative real wage
 declines as f rises. Thus in this case we
                                               would expect to see regional
 convergence, with the geographical
                                       distribution of the      "second stratum"
 following that of the first. In the low
                                          transport cost case,      however, the
 slope is reversed; thus we would expect to see regional
                                                          divergence.
      It   is   possible   to   proceed    entirely      numerically     from      this            point,
 generating a "map" of parameter values for         which      convergence        or        divergence
will occur. By taking a somewhat different approach,
                                                     however, it                       is     possible
to characterize the properties of this map analytically, and
                                                             also to develop a
simple way of computing it.



4. Convergence       divergence



     To ask when regions diverge,
                                         it turns out to be most         useful        to     reverse
the way we approach the problem.
                                     Instead of asking whether an            equilibrium                in
which workers are distributed equally between the regions
                                                          is                stable,           we     ask
whether a situation in which all workers are concentrated in
                                                             one region is                              an
equilibrium.

     Consider a situation in which all workers are concentrated
                                                                                  in        region      1




                                   16
(the choice of region of course is arbitrary). Region 1 will then constitute a

                                                          total         income   p      is        spent      on
larger market than region 2. Since a share of

manufactures, and all of this income goes to region 1, we have



                                       —    (1-i)/(l+)                                                    (21)




                                                                          then       each     firm        will
       Let n be the total number of manufacturing firms;

have a         of sales equal to



                                V1 —   (l/n)(Y1   + Y2)                                                   (22)




which is just enough to allow each firm to make zero profits.

       Now we ask: is it possible for an individual firm to commence                          production

profitably in region 2? (I will        refer     to   such     a       hypothetical          firm       as     a


"defecting firm). If not, then concentration of production in region 1 is                                      an


equilibrium; if so, it isn't.

       In order to produce in region 2,        a firm must be able to attract                      workers.


To do so,    it   must   compensate    them     for   the      fact      that    all        manufactures

 (except its own infinitesimal contribution) must be                   imported;       thus        we     must


have



                                   w2/wl -     (l/                                                         (23)




       Given this higher wage, the firm will charge                a    profit-maximizing                 price

 that is higher than that of other firms in the same                    proportion.          We     can      use


 this fact to derive the value     of the     firm's sales. In region 1, the                       defecting

 firm's value of sales will be the value of           sales        of     a    representative              firm

                                                                              will    be      that        of      a

firms sales will be

       Notice that transportation costs work to the firm's disadvantage                            in     its

sales to region 1 consumers, but work to its advantage on sales                           to     region     2


consumers (because other firms must pay them but it does not).

       From (22), (23), and (24) we can (after                   some     manipulation)        derive     the

ratio of the value of sales by this defecting firm to the sales                           of     firms     in

region 1:



                 V2/V1 -      (l/2)ra[(l+,)r+(l,)rl)]                                                    (25)




       One might think that it is profitable for a firm to                      defect    as     long      as

V2/V1>l, since firms will collect a constant fraction of any sales as a markup

over marginal costs. This is not quite right,                     however,     because    fixed         costs

are also higher in region 2 because of the higher wage rate. So we                             must      have

V2/V1>w2/w1 —    r.    We must therefore define a new variable,



                          -                                                                              (26)




       When w<l, it is unprofitable for a firm to begin production in                           region      2


if all other manufacturing production is concentrated in                        region    1.     Thus      in

this    case   regional       divergence        is   the       long-run      equilibrium.        If      w>l

concentration of production in one region is not an equilibrium.

       Equation (26) at first appears to be a                   fairly    unpromising     subject        for

analytical results. However, it yields to careful analysis.



                                           18
     First note what we want to do with (26). It defines a boundary: a ser                                of


critital parameter values that             mark   the   division         between    convergence          and

divergence. So we need only evaluate it in the vicinity of v — 1,                         asking         how

each of the three parameters must change in order to offset a change in either

of the others.

     Let us begin, then, with the most straightforward of the                         parameters,         p.


We find that



                 ôu/ôp —   vc(ln     r) +    (l/2)r                         c 0                         (27)




     That is, the larger the share of income spent on manufactured goods,                                the


lower the relative sales of the defecting                firm.     This     takes     place    for       two


reasons. First, workers demand a larger wage premium in order to move                              to     the


second region; this effect is reflected in the first term. Second, the                              larger

the share of expenditure on manufactures, the larger the relative size of                                 the


region 1 market and hence           the    stronger     the   home       market     effect.    This        is


reflected in the second term in (27).

     Next we turn to transportation costs. From inspection of (26),                           we        first

note that when r—l, u—i --          that    is, when transport costs are zero location                     is


irrelevant (no surprise!). Second, we note that when r is small, u                            approaches

(l-p)r°0. Unless a is very small or p very large, this must exceed 1 for

sufficiently small r (the economics of the alternative case will                         be     apparent

shortly). Finally, we evaluate 8w/Or:



                    —   pcu/r   +   rMC(cl)((l+p)rC(l.p)r]/2r                                            (28)




    For r close to 1, the second term in (28)                    drops    out,      leaving    only       the


positive first term.



                                            19
       Taken together, these observations indicate a shape for &' as                     a       function

of r that looks like Figure 2 (which represents an actual calculation for p                                —

.3, a — 4): at low levels of r (i.e., high transportation                 costs),            v    exceeds

one and it is profitable to defect; at some critical value of r,                   t'    falls      below

one and concentrated manfacturing is an equilibrium, and the relative value of

sales then approaches 1 from below.

       The important point from this picture is that at the critical value of                              r


that corresponds to the boundary between convergence and divergence, av/ar                                is
negative. That is,      higher   transportation        costs   militate      against             regional

divergence.

       We can also now interpret the case where a(l-p)<l, so that                  v<l           even     at

arbitrarily low r. This is a case where economies of scale are so large (small

a) and or the share of manufacturing in expenditure so high (high p)                             that     it

is unprofitable to start a firm in region 2 no matter how high transport costs

are.

       Finally, we calculate öv/öa. This equals



              8v/öa —   ln(r)(pv + (l/2)r°[(l+p)r°-(l-p)r°])




                                 —   ln(r) [tic]   (öv/ör)




Since we have Just seen that öv/ör is negative at              the   relevant           point,          this

implies that öv/öc is positive. That is, a higher elasticity                 of         substitution

(which also implies smaller economies of scale in equilibrium)                    works           against

regional divergence.

       The implications of these results can be seen digrammatically. Holding                             a

constant, we can draw a "phase boundary" in p, r space.               This    boundary             marks



                                       20
parameter values at which firms are just                      indifferent      between        staying        in    a


region-i concentration or defecting. An economy that iies inside this boundary

wiii not deveiop concentrations of industry in one or the other region,                                   while

an economy that iles outside the boundary wiii. The siope of the boundary is



                                   Br/Bp —       -(Bw/Bp)/(ôw/Br)       C 0




        If we instead hoid u constant and consider changing a, we find



                                   Br/Ba —       -(Bw/Ba)/(Bw/Br)       > 0




        Thus an increase in a will shift the boundary in p,r space outward.

        Figure 3 shows caicuiated boundaries in pr space for two vaiues of a,                                      4


and iO. The figure teiis a simpie story that is preciseiy the intuitive                                      story

given     in   part   i    of     this     paper.        In   an    economy    characterized         by       high

transportation costs, a smaii share of footloose                        manufacturing,          and/or        weak

economies of scaie, the            distribution          of     manufacturing        production      wiii         be

determined by the distribution of the                     "primary     stratum"       of   peasants.          With

lower transportation costs, a              higher        manufacturing         share,      and/or    stronger

economies of      scaie,        circuiar        causation       sets   in,     and    manufacturing           wiii

concentrate in whichever region gets a head start.

        What is particuiariy nice about this resuit is that it requires no appeal

to eiusive      concepts        iike     pure        technoiogicai     externaiities;          the   external

economies are pecuniary, arising from                     the      desirabiiity      of    seiiing      to        and

buying from a region in            which        other     producers      are    concentrated.        It       aiso

involves no arbitrary assumptions about the geographical                             extent     of   externai

economies: distance enters naturaily via transportation costs, and in no other

way. The behavior of the modei depends on "observabie" features of the                                    tastes




                                                2i
of individuals and the technology of firms;                        the     interesting           dynamics          arise

from interaction effects.

        Obviously this     is    a    highly      special       model.            I    will      not     attempt       to

generalize it significantly in this paper, but there is                                  one     special       feature

that needs some further discussion: the assumption that                                  there     are     only       two

regions.




5. Multiple rezions




        The assumption of a two-region economy, while a natural first cut at this

problem,     begs   many    of       the   important         questions            of     traditional          economic

geography. Among the extensions one should clearly try to make is therefore an

effort to model multiple-region behavior.

        In the grand tradition of economic geography one clearly                                 ought        to     drop

the notion of regions altogether, and start from                          a       uniform        distribution          of

peasants across a featureless two-dimensional plain. I would                                     argue,     however,

that a premature attempt at quasi-realistic geometry has been one of the vices

of economic geography, focussing                its    attention          away         from      the     fundamental

economic issues. Preliminary insights can be gained without                                    going      this       far.

Specifically, let us assume that there are several distinct regions,                                          each     of

which     will   itself    be    modelled        as    a     point,       and          that      the      world        is

one-dimensional, i.e., the regions are laid out in a line.

        It will be desirable to maintain symmetry; the only way to do this is                                          to

assume that the regions are in fact laid                     out     in       a       circle     (surrounding          an

impassable mountain range?). We also                  want     to        consider         as     few     regions       as

possible consistent with interesting behavior; for reasons                                     that    will        become

apparent in a moment, the useful number turns out to be six.



                                           22
     Consider, then,    :he economy shown in Figure 4. It contains                            six        regions,

laid out   in   a   circle.     It     has     the   same    tastes        and     technology             as     our

two-region model. Each        region    has     one-sixth      of      the         economy's              peasant

population. Manufactures production can be carried out in any region. However,

when manufactures are shipped from one region to the next,                          a     fraction             (l-r)

evaporates en route; thus if goods are shipped from, say, region 1                                  to        region

4, only a fraction       arrives.

     What will long-run equilibrium look like in                    this     model?           Obviously          one

possibility is that manufactures production will be evenly                          spread          among        the

six regions. A second     possibility           is   the    reverse:        that        all     manufactures

production will concentrate in a single "metropolis". In Figure 4, we                                     suppose

that region 1 becomes the metropolis, its role indicated by the shading of its

circle.

     But there are now intermediate possibilities. Consider in particular                                        the

case illustrated in Figure 5 (ignoring the dashed arc for the moment). In this

case there is one metropolis in region 1, but a second one in region                                     4.     Each

of these metropolises has a "hinterland" of two rural regions: while they will

sell manufactures into each other's hinterland, each will have a larger market

share in the local area.

    Evidently which kind of equilibrium develops depends on the parameters                                        of

the economy. Very low transport costs, etc., will lead to the                             case       shown        in

Figure 4; very high costs to a dispersed               manufacturing             sector;        intermediate

parameters to an intermediate case.

     This is still only a caricature of realistic economic geography,                                     but     it


is already rich enough to shed some interesting new light on an old                                  question.

What are the effects of economic integration, especially when a small                                     country

integrates with     a   large    one?        Neoclassical     economists           have        traditionally

invoked the idea of gains from trade in both goods and factors, while critics,



                                         23
from Graham (1923) on, have worried that the small country will be crowded our

of increasing        returns   sectors.        The    discussion         has       been        made       vague      and

confusing by both uncertainty about how to model increasing returns, and about

the   extent    to     which   external        economies    are      national                 as      opposed         to


international in scope.

      The model sketched out here suggests a new way                       of           thinking          about    this

issue. A small country does not, in general,                  consist              of     small       regions;        it

consists of aL&L regions. When it                integrates       with         a        larger       economy,        the

question is how these new regions fit into the emergent economic geography.

      Consider Figure 5 again. Suppose that the                   six      regions              consist       of     two

countries -- one comprising regions 1,2,5,6, the other                              comprising             regions     3


and 4. (The broken line indicates               the    border).      We        suppose             initially       that

political restrictions on trade and factor mobility are sufficient                                         that    each

economy's regional structure evolves independently.                        Specifically,                   the     large

country develops a metropolis in region 1, while the                           small          country        develops

one in region 4.

      Now suppose that the countries engage in a "1992" that                                  removes        barriers

to trade and factor mobility. What will happen? There are                                 two      possibilities.

One is the Graham case, or the Canadian nightmare: the                              larger         metropolis         at

region 1 attracts all manufacturing to itself,                    leaving               the     smaller          country

entirely rural. The other is that the case shown in Figure 5, rather than that

in Figure 4,    is the equilibrium. In that case               the        small           country          metropolis

actually exDands as a result of integration, as it gains access                                      to     its     full

natural hinterland.

      This is hardly a complete analysis; but it suggests that many issues that

are currently framed as issues of international trade should instead be viewed

as issues of regional economics and economic geography.
