                                            ABSTRACT

This paper uses data from the Health and Retirement Study to examine retirement and related labor
market outcomes for the Early Boomer cohort, those in their mid-fifties at the onset of the Great
Recession. Outcomes are then compared with older cohorts at the same age.

The Great Recession increased their probability of being laid off and the length of time it took to find
other full-time employment. Differences in layoffs between those affected by the recession and members
of older cohorts in turn accounted for almost the entire difference between cohorts in employment
change with age. The Great Recession does not appear, however, to have depressed the wages in
subsequent jobs for those who experienced a layoff.

In 2010, 17 percent of the Early Boomers were Not Working and Not Retired or Partially Retired, and
6 percent were unemployed, leaving at least 9 percent who were not working and not unemployed
but not retired or only partially retired.

At the recession’s peak, half of those who experienced a layoff ended up in the Not Retired or Partially
Retired, Not Working category. But only a quarter of those who declared themselves to be Not Retired
or Partially Retired, and were Not Working, had experienced a layoff. Most of the jump in Not Retired
or Partially Retired, Not Working appears to reflect a change in expectations about the potential or
need for future work, a change that is not the result of an actual job loss.

       This paper uses panel data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to analyze

changes in the course of retirement and related labor market outcomes brought on by the Great

Recession. The population studied was approaching retirement at the onset of the recession.

       Recent studies have documented the effects of various stages of the Great Recession on

particular labor market and retirement related outcomes. For example, Coile and Levine (2011a

and b), Johnson (2012), Burtless and Bosworth (2013), Gorodnichenko, Song and Stolyarov

(2013) and Copeland (2014) have each considered the effects of the Great Recession on some

measure of retirement or employment status.1

       In an effort to increase understanding of the effects of the Great Recession on retirement

and related labor market outcomes, we attempt a more comprehensive analysis. First, a number

of retirement related measures are considered, including full and partial retirement, as well as

flows among retirement states, including returns from states of lesser to greater work. Here

retirement status is classified based on hours and weeks of employment, but for those who are

not working, retirement status is also based on self-reports. We consider differences between

reported retirement status and actual employment, and other relevant outcomes for near retirees.

We also examine levels and flows in related labor market outcomes, including full-time and part-

time work status, losses in job tenure, layoffs, unemployment, unemployment duration, and

disability status. In addition to considering the course of each of these outcomes, the relations

among these outcomes are analyzed, including the relation of layoffs and unemployment to

reported retirement state.

       Key outcomes are also compared between the cohort affected by the Great Recession and

members of older cohorts when they were the same age. This allows us to distinguish the effects

study that takes account of demand differences among areas, see Maestas, Mullen and Powell
(2013).

of the Great Recession from trends that may have caused differences between cohorts even in the

absence of the recession. For example, differences in retirement outcomes between cohorts of

women will partially reflect well known trends in their employment patterns. Similarly, trends

have been observed in the retirement behavior of men. Studies have attributed these trends to

changes in pension and Social Security rules, demographic factors like increasing life expectancy

and improved health, the effects of increased participation of wives on the retirement of their

husbands, and to other factors.2

         One interesting issue affecting some measures of retirement and labor market activity is

the relation between the Great Recession and perceived retirement status. A key measure is the

number of those without a job who nevertheless report themselves as not retired or partially

retired. We investigate the relation of perceived retirement status to layoffs and unemployment.

         We then turn to a multivariate analysis which focuses on layoffs, unemployment,

duration until full-time work is again secured, and the relation of layoffs and unemployment to

wages.

         Our analysis does not focus on those who were older than the Social Security age of

eligibility when the Great Recession began (e.g., see Rutledge, 2013). We are interested in

isolating the effects of the Great Recession on those in their fifties who had not yet been subject

to strong, immediate incentives from pensions or Social Security. These incentives have changed

over time and would make comparisons between cohorts more problematic for isolating the

effects of the Great Recession.3

  For an estimate of the importance of each of these factors in determining retirement, as well as
a summary of the relevant literature, see Council of Economic Advisors (2014). Gustman and
Steinmeier (2000, 2014) analyze the relation between the retirement decisions of husbands and
wives.

       Section II examines the levels and differences in retirement outcomes experienced over

the course of the Great Recession and its recovery by members of the HRS Early Boomer cohort,

those 53 to 58 in 2006. Section III compares the retirement flows for the HRS Early Boomers

with flows observed for members of older cohorts when they were the same age, introduces other

labor market outcomes and compares those outcomes among cohorts at the same age. Section IV

explores the relation of unemployment and layoffs to retirement status. Section V pools those

members of all cohorts who were at full-time work in the base period, analyzes changes in

unemployment incidence and duration induced by the Great Recession, and explores resulting

wage changes. Section VI concludes.



II: Retirement Flows Experienced by Early Boomers Over the Course of the Great Recession

       In this section our analysis is based on the Early Boomer cohort of the Health and

Retirement Study. This cohort was ages 51 to 56 in 2004. They are sampled every two years. The

Early Boomers were nearing retirement when they were exposed to the Great Recession (they

were 53 to 58 in 2006 before the recession hit).4 Their experience over the next six years

includes both the periods of decline and recovery from the Great Recession. As of the writing of

this paper, 2012 is the last year HRS data are available to us.

       We calculate retirement status based on the number of hours and weeks worked per year

and, in ambiguous cases, by self-reported retirement status as well. Respondents working at least

30 hours per week and 1560 hours or more per year are classified as not retired. Respondents

working less than 100 hours per year are classified as not working. Those working at least 100

hours per year and 25 hours or less per week, or 1250 hours or less per year, are partially retired.

4
 We take the onset of the Great Recession to be October, 2007, when the Dow Jones Industrial
Average peaked at 14,164. Eighteen months later, on April 15, 2009, it was just below 8,000, a
decline of 43 percent. Over the next sixth months, as of September 14, 2009, it had recovered to
above 9,500, leaving a decline from its peak of one third.


                                                 3
If the number of hours per year worked is between 1250 and 1560, but the self-reported

retirement status is either retired or not relevant, a partially retired status is assigned to the

respondent. Respondents who report between 1250 and 1560 hours worked, but report not retired

to the self-reported retirement status question, are considered to be not retired. Those who report

they are not working in response to the working for pay question, and report they are not retired

or partially retired in response to the retirement status question, are considered to be Not Retired

or Partially Retired and Not Working. If they report they are not working, and also report

themselves as retired, they are considered to be retired. If they report “not working” and in

answer to the self-reported retirement status question answer “not relevant”, they are assigned to

the "not relevant" category.5

        We describe the dynamics of retirement for the Early Boomers in Table 1. The row heads

indicate retirement status in the base year, 2006, and the column heads show retirement status in

2012.

        Looking down the last column of Table 1, in 2006 62 percent of the Early Boomer cohort

was not retired; 10 percent was partially retired and 11 percent fully retired. Of the remainder, 17

percent fall in the “other, not working” category. Among this group, 6 percent indicated that the

retirement status question was not relevant. Three percent reported they were partially retired but

were not working. Eight percent reported they were not retired but not working. Presumably if a

suitable job came along at an acceptable wage, or if sufficient need arose, those who were not

retired but not working could see themselves going back to work.


5
  The self-reported status question in 1994 to 1998 is different from that question in 1992 and
from 2000 forward. The difference is in the definition of “Not relevant” response. From 1994 to
1998 it is defined as “Question not relevant to R, Does not work for pay or is homemaker, has
not worked for 1 or more years”. In 1992, the response is the same as in 1994 to 1998, except it
is noted the number of years “not worked for 10 or more years” instead of “not worked for 1 or
more years”. From 2000 forward the response is modified to “Question not relevant to R, Does
not work for pay or is homemaker, etc.”.


                                                    4
       Comparing the bottom row of Table 1 with the right hand column, the fraction who were

not retired declined by 22 percent over the six year period, the fraction partially retired increased

by 1 percent, and the fraction completely retired increased by 21 percent. The other, not working

category increased by one percent.

       The remaining cells in the matrix provide additional information about changes in work

status by individuals. Looking across each row, one can see the change in status conditional on

the initial state in 2006. In row 1 the initial state is not retired. From row 1, among those who

were not retired in 2006, 58 percent remained in that state, 9 percent partially retired and 22

percent fully retired. Altogether, 31 percent experienced transitions consistent with a move from

greater to lesser work. The remaining 11 percent moved into the other not working category.

       The next row shows the same flows for those who were initially partially retired in 2006.

Proceeding across row 2, we see the first reversal from a state of lesser to greater work, with 19

percent of those who were partially retired in 2006 returning to a state of not retired in 2012.

Thirty six percent of those who were partially retired in 2006 remained partially retired in 2012,

while twenty seven percent moved from a state of partial to full retirement.

       Row 3 reports outcomes in 2012 for those who were fully retired in 2006. Here we find

much weaker evidence of reversals. Among those who were fully retired in 2006, 3 percent were

not retired in 2012 and 5 percent were partially retired in 2012. Most, 82 percent, remained fully

retired in 2012. Lastly, 10 percent of those completely retired in 2006 were classified as other not

working in 2012. Results for those who were in the other not working category in 2006 are

reported in the following row.

       Findings for men and women are presented in Appendix Tables 1 and 2. Comparing

retirement status in the base period, we find that women are much less likely to be not retired in

the base period than men. The percentages of men in the base period who are not retired,



                                                  5
partially retired, fully retired and other not working are 71, 6, 11 and 11 percent respectively. For

women, the corresponding percentages are 54, 13, 11 and 22.

       The flows into various retirement states in 2012, conditional on being Not Retired in

2006, are not very different between men and women. That also is true for those beginning in

other retirement states.

       The differences in retirement outcomes between men and women in 2012 are largely the

result of differences in initial status in 2006, rather than to differences in retirement flows

conditional on initial retirement state.

       Next we consider the differences in retirement flows between the period of deepening

recession, 2008 to 2010, and the initial period of recovery, 2010 to 2012. We focus on the Early

Boomers. For consistency in comparisons, the sample includes those respondents who were

included in the survey in 2008, 2010 and 2012.

       Table 2 shows the flow from 2008 to 2010, while Table 3 shows the flow from 2010 to

2012. As would be expected, the values in the bottom row of Table 2 match the values in the

right hand column of Table 3. Comparing the last column of Table 2 with the bottom row of that

table, between 2008 and 2010, the fraction of the sample “Not Retired” declined by 10

percentage points, while the fraction “Completely Retired” increased by 7 percentage points.

Although the population is two years older in Table 3, the share “Not Retired” declined by only 7

percentage points between 2010 and 2012, while the fraction “Completely Retired” increased by

10 percentage points.

III. Cohort Differences in Retirement and Other Labor Market Outcomes

       The first four rows of Table 4, last two columns, repeat the levels of retirement outcomes

observed in 2008 and 2010 for Early Boomers.6 Columns 1 to 4 of Table 4 report the outcomes

for members of older cohorts at the same age. Comparing values in columns 1, 3 and 5 for

retirement outcomes listed in the first four rows of the table, one can see a slight increase in the

percent not retired over time, as well as a decline in the fraction cohort falling in the other not

working category.7 Comparing columns 2, 4 and 6 in these first four rows, which report values

for the end year of each two year period, there are no obvious changes for the Early Boomers

associated with the Great Recession.

       The remaining rows of the table provide a first look at how the Great Recession affected

layoffs, unemployment, long term job attachment, and related outcomes. From row 5, columns 1,

3 and 5, there is a slight upward trend in the fraction of cohorts working 35 hours or more per

year. Since hours of work is one component of our retirement status measure in row 1, the results

in rows 1 and 5 show similar trends. Looking at columns 2, 4 and 6 of rows 1 and 5, there are no

trends at all in these outcomes. That is, the level of retirement or full-time work in the second

year of the two year period is similar among cohorts.




   6
      The difference in outcomes between Tables 2 and 4 is the result of restricting the sample in
Table 2 to those with observations in 2008, 2010 and 2012. In Table 4, the sample includes
respondents who had observations in 2008 and 2010.
    7
      Underlying the change in the “Other Not Working” category is a major difference among
cohorts in the fraction reporting their retirement status as “Not Relevant”. Nine percent of the
War Babies fell in the Not Relevant category in 2004. The status of members of the original HRS
cohort was listed as Not Relevant in 16 percent of the cases in 1998. And in the Early Boomer
category, 4 percent of the respondents fell in the Not Relevant category in 2010. The changing
fraction of a cohort for whom retirement status is not relevant is both the result of retirement
trends, and also is an artifact of changes in the HRS retirement questions over the years of the
survey. Specifically, in the early waves of the HRS survey a longer period of previous work was
required before the retirement question was classified as relevant.


                                                  9
       When compared to older cohorts, there are increases for Early Boomers in the percent

reporting unemployment or layoffs, and these appear to be associated with the Great Recession.

But despite an increase in layoffs, changes in long term employment are similar to those

observed over more stable periods.

       Also noteworthy in the table is the trend in participation in Social Security disability

insurance. Any change in SSDI participation associated with the Great Recession appears to be

obscured by a much stronger trend measured among cohorts.

       While Table 4 shows levels and changes in key labor market outcomes over a two year

period corresponding to the onset of the Great Recession, and experiences during comparison

years for members of older cohorts, Table 5 indicates these same outcomes at the beginning and

end of the six year period spanning the Great Recession. In the base year, respondents range

between ages 53 and 58. For the Early Boomers, the six year period spans a time ranging from

just before the onset of the Great Recession, 2006, through the latest HRS data available relating

to the recovery, in 2012.

       Looking at the base years in columns 1, 3 and 5, for the most part there are no noteworthy

trends. An exception is the increase in SSDI participation (applied or receiving benefits) from 2

percent to 6 percent of the sample. Comparing columns 2, 4 and 6, there also are noticeable

changes in the levels observed for the end years of each six year period. The fraction completely

retired rises over time, while other not working declines. The change in fraction on DI between

the initial and end date is similar for each cohort, however, so that once again we perceive no

extraordinary effect of the Great Recession on DI participation.

        There are no obvious trends in the fraction working more than 35 hours, long term

employed, or in layoffs.

       We now focus directly on the changes in these outcomes over the two and six year

periods, rather than the levels of outcomes. From Table 6 we see that over the first two years of

the Great Recession, the change in the frequency of Early Boomer respondents reporting they

were Not Retired was -9 percentage points, which is two to three percentage points greater, in

absolute terms, than the decline experienced over the same age span by members of older

cohorts.

       In row 5, we see a three percentage point difference between Early Boomers and

members of older cohorts in the percent reducing work over the two year period. Focusing

directly on the fraction working 35 hours in row 8, this measure declined by 9 percentage points

for Early Boomers, which is a 3 or 4 percentage point greater decline than was observed for

members of older cohorts at the same age. In contrast to the measure of full-time work, there

was little difference in row 9 between cohorts in the change in the percentage on a long term job.

       Moving to Table 7, we examine these same changes for the six years spanning the Great

Recession for the Early Boomers, and over comparable ages for the members of the other two

cohorts. From rows 5 and 6, there are no differences in the percentage reducing work among

cohorts, nor in the percentages working the same amount.

Layoffs and Unemployment Induced by the Great Recession Relative to Older Cohorts:

       We also have calculated the fraction of the population experiencing layoffs and

unemployment. In Table 6, line 10, over the two year period corresponding to the onset of the

Great Recession, 2008 to 2010, layoffs were experienced by 8.2 percent of the Early Boomers,

compared to 4 percent of members from the older cohorts over the same age span. Thus the share

of the population experiencing a layoff was about four percentage points higher during the period

of the Great Recession. Most of this difference reflects layoffs that did not end with

reemployment. 8 From line 11, unemployment experienced by Early Boomers over the 2008-10

period is 3 percentage points greater than unemployment experienced by those in older cohorts

when they were the same age.9

       Table 7 considers layoffs and unemployment by Early Boomers over the six year period

spanning the Great Recession, and compares that experience to the experience of members of

older cohorts when they were the same age. While from line 11, 4 percent of the members of

older cohorts experienced unemployment any time over the six year period, 8 percent of Early

Boomers experienced unemployment. And from line 10, while 11 percent of the members of

older cohorts experienced a layoff any time over the six year period, 14 percent of Early

Boomers experienced a layoff.

8
  To identify involuntary layoffs, we consider first those who were working in the previous
interview wave of the survey but reported not working in the current wave. For those who were
working in the current wave we inquire whether they were working in the same job they held in
the wave two years earlier. If not, we look at the question as to the reason they left the job they
had held two years earlier. If the reason included such things as “business closed” or “laid off/let
go,” or “would have been laid off”, the response is coded as an involuntary termination. Layoff
is from respondent’s previous job.
9
  In a table that is not included, we find the layoff rate between 1998 and 2000 for the HRS
cohort, ages 57 to 62 in 1998, to be 3.52 and the percent who are unemployed in 2000 who were
employed in 1998 is 0.78. For WBs (the same age group in 2004) the layoff rate between 2004
and 2006 is 2.63 and the percent unemployed who were employed in 2004 is 0.64. For EBs (the
same age group in 2010) the layoff rate between 2010 and 2012 is 4.56 and the corresponding
percent unemployed who were employed in the previous wave is 2.27.



                                                 16
       It appears that additional layoffs induced by the Great Recession explain the actual

change in employment fairly well. In Table 6, the percent reporting a layoff between the base

year and the end year who were not employed at the end year rose from (1/2) (1.7 + 2.2) = 1.45

(the average of the HRS and War Babies) to 4.9 (Early Boomers). That is, unemployment from

layoffs increased by 3.45 percentage points for the Early Boomers during Great Recession

period. Meanwhile, the percentage employed (difference in percent not retired plus difference in

percent partially retired) changed from -5 percent for the HRS cohort and War Babies to -8

percent for the Early Boomers, declining an additional 3 percentage points in the Great

Recession. That is, the reduction in employment for the Early Boomers was 3 percentage points

greater in absolute terms than for the other cohorts, and this approximately matches the 3.5

percentage point increase in layoffs with no reemployment for the Early Boomers.

       In Appendix Tables 3 we restricted the sample to those who were working full-time in

the base year. The rate at which respondents leave the state of Not Retired is almost twice as

high among full-time workers in Appendix Table 3 as it is for the age 53 to 58 population as a

whole in Table 7. But there are no apparent trends in retirement among the cohorts. The

difference in the percent reporting a layoff increases from 3 percentage points for the full sample

to 5 or 6 percentage points among full-time workers.

       When in Appendix Table 4 we limit the sample to full-time workers with at least ten

years of tenure in the base period, layoffs over the period of the Great Recession are 4 to 5

percentage points higher than layoffs in earlier periods for members of older cohorts over the

same age span.

IV: Relationship of Layoffs to Not Retired/Partially Retired and Not Working

       Next we investigate the relation of a respondent having been laid off to the respondent

reporting they are not working but also not retired or partially retired. Table 8 reports the number



                                                17
of respondents with these outcomes in 2008 and 2010 for Early Boomers, and in years when

members of older cohorts were comparable ages. As seen in row 1, apparently as a result of the

Great Recession, there is a sharp jump in the number of Early Boomers who have been laid off

and who are Not Retired or Partially Retired, and Not Working. The number of respondents in

this category more than doubles between 2008 and 2010, from 52 to 116.

       From row 4, column 6, in 2010, those who experienced a layoff account for about one

quarter of those who are Not Retired or Partially Retired and Not Working. This is 5 to 11

percentage points higher than similar ratios observed for older cohorts in columns 2 and 4.

       From row 5, which compares rows 1 and 3, in 2010 only about half of those who

experienced a layoff report themselves as Not Retired or Partially Retired, Not Working. This is

substantially higher than the values found for older cohorts, where one quarter to one third of

those who experienced a layoff reported they were also Not Retired or Partially Retired and Not

Working.

       Those who were involuntarily laid off may be reluctant to declare themselves as

permanently out of the labor force. Some may be responding to asset losses from the Great

Recession.10 Others may claim they are not yet retired in reaction to increased uncertainty. Still

others who did not lose their jobs, some in positions where they have accumulated considerable

tenure, may defer retiring or leaving their main job in reaction to wealth loss or increased

uncertainty.

       The bottom line here is that even when the Great Recession had its peak effects, only half

of those who experienced a layoff ended up in the Not Retired or Partially Retired, Not Working

category, and only a quarter of those who are Not Retired or Partially Retired, Not Working,

have experienced a layoff. Most of the jump in Not Retired or Partially Retired, Not Working

associated with the Great Recession appears to reflect a change in expectations about the

potential for future work, or a change in assets, neither of which is the result of job loss.

       Table 9 reports analogous results to those reported in Table 8, but the sample is restricted

to those who worked full-time in the base year. The layoff rate was higher for full-time workers

than for the full sample, with 8.4% (229/2736) of the full sample having been laid off by 2010,

and 11.5% (176/1534) of those who were full-time workers in 2008 having been laid off by

2010. Fifty seven percent of Not Retired or Partially Retired, Not Working among full-time

workers are accounted for by those who experienced a layoff. Fifty two percent of those who

experienced a layoff among full-time workers reported themselves as Not Retired or Partially

Retired, and Not Working. These numbers are much higher than those experienced by members

of older cohorts at comparable ages, where these ratios are roughly one third.

       Table 10 reports comparable results to those in Tables 8, using unemployment status

instead of layoffs. In 2010, about 17 percent (460/2736) of the population is Not Retired or

Partially Retired and Not Working. Six percent of the population (164/2736) is unemployed.

That leaves roughly 9 percent of the population Not Retired or Partially Retired and Not

Working, but not unemployed.

       From the last two columns of Table 10, rows 1 and 2, while the number unemployed and

Not Retired or Partially Retired and Not Working grew by 63 (150 – 87) between 2008 and

2010, the total Not Retired or Partially Retired and Not Working grew by 152 (460 – 308). Once

again, the growth in the ranks of the Not Retired and Not Partially Retired consists only in part

of the newly unemployed, the same result we found for layoffs. From the last column, row 4,

about one third of those who reported themselves as Not Retired or Partially Retired and Not

Working experienced unemployment between the last wave and the current wave. This is up 5

percentage points from the value in 2008. In contrast, members of older cohorts experienced a 4

to 8 percentage point decline in this ratio between the base year and final year. Once again the

Great Recession raised the number Not Retired and Not Partially Retired –Not Working, but by

more than twice the increase in the number unemployed.

       One difference between Tables 8 and 10 may be noted. The fraction of those who

experienced unemployment who reported themselves Not Retired, Not Partially Retired and Not

Working, is around 90 percent. This result, shown in row 5 of Table 10, is due to the definition

of unemployment. It differs from the comparable finding in Table 8, where only half of those

who experienced a layoff reported themselves as Not Retired, Not Partially Retired, and Not

Working.

        In Table 11 we recalculate the relationship of Not Retired, Not Partially Retired and Not

Working to the number Unemployed for those who were working full-time in the base year. Here

55 percent of those who reported themselves as Not Retired or Partially Retired and Not

Working experienced unemployment between the last wave and the current wave. Compared to

members of older cohorts, the importance of unemployment in accounting for the not working,

not retired group doubled with the Great Recession. For those who started in a full-time job,

unemployment plays a greater role in explaining the Not Retired or Partially Retired and Not

Working group than it does for the overall population.

        Nevertheless, even when the Great Recession had its peak effects, only half of those who

experienced a layoff ended up in the Not Retired or Partially Retired, Not Working categories,

and only a quarter of those who are Not Retired or Partially Retired, Not Working, have

experienced a layoff. Most of the jump in Not Retired or Partially Retired, Not Working appears

to reflect a change in expectations about the potential for future work, a change that is not the

result of job loss.

        In a related table (not shown), we also found that the increased layoffs and resulting

unemployment resulting from the Great Recession struck lower tenure workers more severely.

than higher tenure workers. Most of the individuals experiencing layoffs still regard themselves

as not retired, at least for a while, even if they do not find other work.

    V. Multivariate Analysis of Layoffs and Unemployment


        For the bulk of the population, which has not been laid off, retirement status is measured

objectively by the amount of work supplied. However, the descriptive analysis has shown that

retirement status and employment status may be quite different for those who have lost their job.

For job losers, much of the relation between retirement status and layoffs, or unemployment




                                                  25
status, is based on respondents’ expectations of future work, even though they do not presently

have a job.

       To avoid having to rely on subjective expectations based on unspecified circumstances,

the remainder of our analysis will focus on the relation of the Great Recession to employment,

layoffs and unemployment, rather than on a measure of retirement status based on expectations.

The analysis is multivariate. Covariates are included to standardize for the effects of job tenure,

experience, education, demographic measures, industry, occupation and the individual’s wage.

Standardizing for these factors, we then look for the average difference in outcomes during the

2008-10 period.

Layoffs

       The most important of the effects of the Great Recession on employment is on the

probability of being able to keep one’s current job, and the consequences of losing the job. If one

loses the job, then questions arise about the probability of obtaining another job, as well as the

conditions of the subsequent job, most notably the compensation in that job.

       Table 12 indicates the conditional probability of HRS respondents being laid off by a

given wave of the study, given that they had been working full-time in the previous survey. In

each wave of the HRS, the study asks individuals who were employed in the previous wave if

they are still employed by that employer. If they are not still employed by the previous wave’s

employer, the study asks the individual the reasons why. Multiple responses are permitted, and

the individual is considered to have been laid off if the responses include “business closed,” “laid

off/let go,” and/or “would have been laid off.”

       The table looks only at the first time the individual is laid off during the study; if the

individual is laid off more than once during the study, waves after the first layoff are not counted

in either the numerator or denominator of the probability. The third column gives the probability

of the layoff by year, and the fourth column gives the approximate standard deviation. For

instance, the first line says that between the first wave in 1992 and the second wave in 1994,

about 7 percent of the respondents who were working full-time in the 1992 survey had been laid

off.

       In general, the layoff percentages are within a percentage point of the overall mean,

which is 6.2 percent over a two-year interval. The one outlier, as might be expected, is the

interval between the 2008 and 2010 waves, when the layoff percentage almost doubled and is

clearly significantly above the others. This spike in layoff probability does not seem to have

persisted, however. By the interval between the 2010 and 2012 waves, the percentage had

dropped to the overall mean. Nor does this pattern seem to be an anomaly; the statistics from

BLS on major layoffs follow a similar pattern where the layoffs spiked shortly after the Great

Recession started and then fell rapidly to roughly pre-recession levels.

        Table 13 gives the results of a probit estimation of the probability of a layoff between the

waves on a set of personal and job characteristics, including a binary variable for the 2008-2010

interval. The entries in this table are the marginal effects, that is, the change in the probability

from a one unit increase in the corresponding explanatory variable. Thus, the first entry says that

the effect of each additional year of tenure is to reduce the probability of a layoff by 0.39

percentage points. This effect of tenure is modified by the entry in the second row, which gives

the effect of tenure squared. Comparing the effects of tenure and experience, it is clear that

tenure by far the more important determinate of layoff probabilities. Having 10 years of tenure

reduces the probability by around 3 percentage points, and having 20 years reduces the

probability by around 5 percentage points. This compares with an overall average of 6

percentage points. The effect of experience, on the other hand, is not only insignificant and

relatively small numerically, but the direction of the effect is in the opposite direction of what

would be expected.

        The remaining effects are more or less as expected. More education reduces the

probability of layoffs, with the effect being particularly strong for those with advanced degrees.

Race does not seem to have a significant effect, while marriage has a marginally negative effect.

Standardizing for education and job tenure, those in manufacturing industries have a 3-4

percentage point greater risk of layoffs, and those in management, professional, and white collar

occupations (as opposed to blue collar occupations) have around a 1 percentage point greater risk

of layoffs. Government workers and employees with pensions in their jobs have around a 3

percentage point reduced risk of layoffs.11

        The largest effect in this equation, however, is the binary variable indicating the period

between wave 9 in 2008 and wave 10 in 2010, which corresponds to the initial period of the

11
  Note that because of the nonlinear form of the probit relationship, the total effect of a group of
characteristics is not necessarily the sum of the marginal effects.

Great Recession. During this time frame, the probability of layoff rose by 5.7 percentage points

on top of a base of 6.2 percentage points. Thus, the spike in layoffs evident in Table 12 carries

over largely intact when covariates related to personal and job characteristics are introduced.

          In any stochastic model, the realized values of the stochastic variables may vary from

their expected values. For instance, the draws for the realized returns on assets may be above or

below the ex-ante expected values. The same is true for layoffs. The layoffs in the early years of

the Great Recession were higher than expected, but the main question is whether these layoffs

resulted in an upward shift in the probabilities of layoffs in future years. The transitory nature of

this increase, severe though as it was, suggests that the ex-ante probabilities in future years were

probably not affected. Thus the large but temporary increases in layoffs may be treated as

positive deviations from a distribution and not as a change in the distribution applicable for the

future. This is in contrast to what we believe happened with asset returns, where the long string

of negative real short-term interest rates has probably lowered permanently the perceptions of

what the distribution of those interest rates looks like.

          The next item in the sequence is the question of how long, if an individual is laid off from

a full-time job, it takes to find another full-time job.12 Fortunately, the HRS has a sequence of

questions which attempts to ascertain, month by month, what an individual’s employment status

is subsequent to a layoff. If an individual is not in the previous job, the study asks the month and

year when the individual left that job. If the individual is currently working, the study asks the

starting month and year of the current job and the number of hours in the current job. Unless the

ending date of the previous job coincides with the starting data of the current job, the study

inquires about which months, if any, the individual was working in intermediate jobs, as well as

the hours in those jobs. When the information is complete, it is possible to construct a measure of

                                                  30
the number of months between a layoff and the start of another full-time job, even if the next

full-time job begins in a wave after the initial layoff.

        Table 14 reports the distribution of the length of the spells before the next full-time

employment by the year of the layoff. The column labeled “censored” refers to cases where no

full-time employment was observed in the study after the layoff. This can occur either because

the individual left the survey before any full-time employment was recorded, or because the

individual effectively retired and never re-entered full-time employment. It can also occur in

cases where the individual had gaps in the data and had no full-time employment before such a

gap.

        Table 15 provides the distribution of the lengths of time observed after a layoff for those

who did not enter full-time employment during the time they were continuously observed. This

table gives the overwhelming impression that the primary cause of censored observations is that

individuals never re-entered full-time employment, not that the period of observation ended

before a full-time job was observed. For instance, for layoffs in 2002, 28 of the 45 cases of

layoffs that year in which subsequent full-employment was not observed had at least 31 months

of observation after the layoff. From Table 14, the cases where full-time work was observed after

the layoff were strongly skewed toward relatively short periods, and one would expect only a

few cases where individuals with censored spells of 31 months or more would eventually be

employed full-time. Only for layoffs after 2010 does it appear that the last observed wave of the

study may have cut short the period of observation before individuals found other full-time jobs.

Notes: See text for an explanation of the three sets of columns. Tenure and experience are both
measured as years divided by 10. Trend is (year of layoff – 2002) / 10 and ranges from -1 (1992)
to 1 (2012). Great Recession is a binary variable with a value of 1 for 2009 and 2010. The
columns labeled t are absolute values of asymptotic t-statistics. Number of observations: 1940.




                                              34
        The distribution of observed spells from Table 14 suggests a distribution that is strongly

declining over time, such as a Weibull distribution. Normally, an estimation of the Weibull

distribution takes into account both the distribution of completed spells and the distribution of

spells which are censored before completion. The number and lengths of incomplete spells in

Table 15, however, appears to be much greater than would be expected from a Weibull

distribution, or any distribution with a rapidly falling tail, consistent with Table 14. These data

suggest that the distribution of spells may perhaps best be described by some kind of a

compound distribution. In the first stage, let the probability that the individual will effectively

retire after the layoff be p, with 1 – p being the probability that the individual will eventually

return to full-time work. For those who return to full-time work, let f(x) be the distribution of

times until the return. A censored observation, that is, a layoff for which no subsequent return to

full-time work is observed, can occur either because the individual has effectively retired or

because the subsequent period of observation is too short to capture the return to work.

        To make things a little more specific, Let f(x) be a Weibull distribution, with a

cumulative distribution F(x)  1  e ( x / λ ) , where x is the length of the time between the
                                               k




layoff and the next full-time job. In a Weibull distribution, the λ parameter is called the scale

parameter and governs how stretched the distribution is along the horizontal axis. The k

parameter is called the shape parameter and, as its name implies, governs the shape of the

distribution. For values between 0 and 1, the Weibull is a continuously declining distribution.

The closer the value is to 0, the sharper the distribution falls. Both the λ and the k parameters

must be positive values.

        For observations for which a complete spell from the layoff to the beginning of the next

full-time job is observed, the log-likelihood value is given by

(1  p) f(x)  (1  p)(k / λ) (x / λ) k 1 e (x / λ) , which is simply the probability that the layoff does
                                                   k




                                                       35
not result in an effective retirement times the conditional probability density for the spell,

conditional on a completed spell. For observations for which the layoff does not result in

subsequent full-time employment, the log-likelihood value is given by

p  (1  p)F(x)  p  (1  p)[1  e (x / λ) ] . This is simply the probability of retirement plus the
                                           k




probability of an incomplete spell, conditional on the individual returning to full-time work. The

overall likelihood value is simply the sum of the likelihood values for these two types of

observations.

       The likelihood values are thus functions of parameters p, λ, and k. But these

parameters may in turn be functions of explanatory variables. let p = N(Xpβp), so that the

probability of retirement is a probit relationship dependent on a group of explanatory variables

Xp. This guarantees that the probability lies between 0 and 1. Similarly, let λ = exp(Xλβλ) and k

= exp(Xkβk), where the exponential functional form guarantees that both λ and k will be

greater than 0, as required for the Weibull distribution. The likelihood function is then

maximized with respect to βp, βλ, and βk to obtain estimates.

       The results of the estimation are presented in Table 16. A quadratic trend term is included

in each of these linear forms to capture any trends in retirement and/or changes in the distribution

of spells over time. Most of these trend terms are significant. About the only other terms which

reach 95% confidence in the Weibull distribution are the coefficient for black race in the linear

form for λ and the coefficient for manufacturing in the linear form for k. A term for layoffs in

the 2009-2010 time frame is included in the linear form for λ and is significant at better than

99% confidence. Its coefficient indicates that spells between layoffs and successive full-time

work lengthened considerably over this period. Similar coefficients for the other two linear forms

were completely insignificant and were dropped from the specification.




                                                 36
       For a typical individual with average characteristics in the sample, these coefficients

indicate that, under normal circumstances, there is a 45% chance that a spell after a layoff before

the next full-time job will last less than 3 months, a 16% chance that the spell will last between 3

and 6 months, and a 17% chance that it will last between 6 and 12 months.13 When the Great

Recession variable is factored in, these percentages change to a 34% chance that the spell will

last for less than 3 months, a 14% chance it will last between 3 and 6 months, and a 17% chance

that it will last between 6 and 12 months. The median duration is normally 3.7 months but rose to

6.5 months for layoffs during the Great Recession.

       The question arises whether this increased duration of nonworking spells after a layoff

could be perceived as permanent, or whether it was a transitory increase. To answer this

question, a binary variable indicating a layoff in the 2011-2012 period was added to the

specification in Table 16. Measuring the effects on duration of layoffs during this period is a

little tenuous, since the last wave was in 2012 and only relatively short durations would have

been completed. Nonetheless, the coefficient of the 2011-2012 layoff variable is of the wrong

sign and gives no indication that the duration effects of the Great Recession were long lasting.

As with the probability of a layoff, it appears that the increase in duration of spells before the

next full-time job was a transitory phenomenon and not a permanent shift in the distribution of

durations.

       Thus, the Great Recession both increased the probability of being laid off and increased

the length of time it took laid-off workers to find other full-time employment.

       The next issue is the nature of the subsequent job, and in particular the wage rate in the

subsequent job. Table 17 contains coefficients from fixed effects regressions of wages taken

from the HRS. These wages include wages in full-time jobs held in any of the study wave years

plus wages in full-time jobs in the job histories collected in the first interview. All wages are

indexed to 1992 (the first year of the HRS) using the average weekly earnings series reported in

various Economic Reports of the President. The use of fixed effects nets out any differences due

to different personal characteristics and only uses information on the wage changes over time for

the same individual.

       If an individual gets laid off, the wage in the subsequent job should be less, reflecting the

loss of tenure. The question of interest here is whether there is an additional effect from having

been laid off, relative to leaving a job for other reasons, and furthermore whether this effect was

larger for layoffs which happened during the Great Recession. In the table, the first two columns

include a term related to whether the individual has ever been laid off in a prior job. The

coefficient, which is highly significant, suggests that having been laid off in a prior job results in

a 7.3 percent reduction on top of the reduction from the loss of tenure. The last two columns

include an additional binary variable which has a value of 1 if the layoff occurred between wave

9 (2008) and wave 10 (2010) of the study, which includes the first two years of the Great

Recession. This term is slightly positive, which is the opposite of what might be expected, but it

is not significant. The conclusion is that while the Great Recession resulted in a greater

probability of being laid off and a longer wait until the next full-time job, it does not appear to

have depressed wages in subsequent jobs below the levels which would have occurred anyway

with a layoff.




                                                  39
   VI. Conclusions.

       Older workers, with their longer tenure and resulting job security, are not expected to be

as vulnerable to a recession as prime age and younger workers. Nevertheless, the Great

Recession did have an effect on those who were in their fifties at its outset. Both the probability

of a layoff and the length of time it took laid-off workers to find other full-time employment

were increased.

       Layoffs appear to explain the actual change in employment experienced over the Great

Recession. Our findings suggest that compared to the experience of members of older cohorts at

the same age, unemployment from layoffs increased by 2.9 percentage points for the Early

Boomers during Great Recession period. Meanwhile, the reduction in employment for the Early

Boomers was 3 percentage points greater in absolute terms than for the older cohorts. These two

changes are approximately equal.

       As one might expect from the definition of unemployment, most (around 90 percent) of

the unemployed declared themselves to be Not Retired or Partially Retired. In 2010, at the peak

of the labor market effects of the Great Recession, about half of those who experienced a layoff

reported themselves as Not Retired or Partially Retired, Not Working. This fraction is

substantially higher than the values found for older cohorts at the same age. In previous years,

one quarter to one third of those in their fifties who experienced a layoff reported they were also

Not Retired or Partially Retired and Not Working.

       More surprisingly, in 2010, those who experienced a layoff accounted for only about one

quarter of those who are Not Retired or Partially Retired and Not Working. While this is 5 to 11

percentage points higher than similar ratios observed for older cohorts, job loss is not the major

reason a person declares themselves to be Not Retired or Partially Retired while Not Working.



                                                 40
           Apparently many of those who have left their jobs voluntarily declare themselves to be

Not Retired or Partially Retired. During the Great Recession, even more of those who left their

employment and in other times would have declared themselves to be retired, instead held on to

a subjective connection to the labor market.

           A labor market connection for someone who is not working and not unemployed must be

quite tenuous. Such an individual who also claims to be not retired or only partially retired

probably does not have immediate plans to try to get back to work. There may be several

motivations for such individuals to claim they are not retired or only partially retired. It may be

that they don't want to admit that they are really retired (in which case they really are retired), or

there may be circumstances which cause them to think that they will return to work at some time

in the indefinite future. It might be a health problem from which they expect to recover, or a

financial shock which leaves them with insufficient assets to fully retire. Some may indeed have

planned to return to work after taking a break (Maestas, 2010). In any case, it seems like this

group grew as well during the Great Recession; among the Early Boomers in 2010, 17 percent

were Not Working but Not Retired or Partially Retired and 6 percent were unemployed, leaving

at least 9 percent who were not working and not unemployed but not retired or only partially

retired.

           To avoid having to rely on subjective expectations based on unspecified circumstances,

our multivariate analysis focused on the relation of the Great Recession to employment, layoffs

and unemployment, rather than on a measure of retirement status based on subjective responses

about retirement status. Between the 2008 and 2010 waves, the layoff percentage almost

doubled, rising by 5.7 percentage points on top of a base of 6.2 percentage points. This spike in

layoff probability does not seem to have persisted, however. By the interval between the 2010

and 2012 waves, the percentage had dropped to the overall mean. The multivariate analysis also



                                                  41
suggests that the median duration of unemployment after a layoff is normally 3.7 months, but

rose to 6.5 months for layoffs during the Great Recession. As with the probability of a layoff, it

appears that the increase in duration of spells before the next full-time job was a transitory

phenomenon and not a permanent shift in the distribution of durations.

   Although the Great Recession increased the probability of near retirees being laid off and

subject to a longer wait until the next full-time job, it does not appear to have depressed wages in

subsequent jobs below the levels which would have occurred anyway with a layoff.
