                                             ABSTRACT

Employer health insurance mandates form the basis of many health care reform proposals. Proponents
make the case that they will increase insurance, while opponents raise the concern that low-wage workers
will see offsetting reductions in their wages and that in the presence of minimum wage laws some
of the lowest wage workers will become unemployed. We construct an estimate of the number of
workers whose wages are so close to the minimum wage that they cannot be lowered to absorb the
cost of health insurance, using detailed data on wages, health insurance, and demographics from the
Current Population Survey. We find that 33 percent of uninsured workers earn within $3 of the minimum
wage, putting them at risk of unemployment if their employers were required to offer insurance. Assuming
an elasticity of employment with respect to minimum wage increase of -0.10, we estimate that 0.2
percent of all full-time workers and 1.4 percent of uninsured full-time workers would lose their jobs
because of a health insurance mandate. Workers who would lose their jobs are disproportionately likely
to be high school dropouts, minority, and female. This risk of unemployment should be a crucial component
in the evaluation of both the effectiveness and distributional implications of these policies relative
to alternatives such as tax credits, Medicaid expansions, and individual mandates, and their broader
effects on the well-being of low-wage workers.

INTRODUCTION

     Employer health insurance mandates form the basis of many health care reform

proposals. Democratic Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton, John Edwards and Barack

Obama have all proposed reforms that include pay-or-play mandates. Individual states

are contemplating these mandates as well. In California, for example, the state legislature

passed a law requiring employers above a certain size to provide a specified package of

health benefits for their workers. California voters narrowly overturned the measure

(“Proposition 72”) in 2004, but Governor Schwarzenegger recently unveiled a new plan

to expand insurance coverage that requires employer contributions. Oregon and

Washington enacted mandates that were later repealed. Hawaii implemented an employer

mandate in 1974. The recent reform in Massachusetts, which combines an individual

mandate, employer requirements, redirection of Medicaid funds, and the creation of a

new insurance pooling mechanism, has garnered much attention and may spur similar

reforms in other states.

       The proponents of these measures make the case that they will increase insurance

coverage while maintaining the role of the market in generating competition and

efficiency in health insurance offerings. Opponents raise the concern that low-income

workers will see offsetting reductions in their wages and that in the presence of minimum

wage laws some of the lowest wage workers will become unemployed. Academics and

the popular press alike cite increased health insurance costs as one of the causes of recent

increases in unemployment (Porter, 2004). Estimates of the potential job loss from the

mandates included in the failed Clinton health care proposal ranged from 600,000 to

more than 2,000,000.

        To determine how important the potential job loss from employer mandates is, we

need to know how many workers are likely to be affected. Several factors affect the

degree to which employer mandates will cause unemployment. First, what is the likely

cost of the mandated health insurance? This clearly depends on the specifics of the

mandated coverage.1 Second, how much of an increase in the cost of employing workers

is borne by employees in the form of reduced wages? There is substantial evidence that

the cost of health insurance mandates will be shifted to employees, resulting in lower

wages.2     Third, how many workers not currently covered by employer-sponsored

insurance are so close to the minimum wage that their wages cannot be lowered enough

to offset the cost of the new mandate? We focus on the last question. This paper provides

an estimate of how big the pool of workers at risk of unemployment is likely to be and

what characteristics they are likely to have, taking into account minimum wage laws and

patterns of employer health insurance offering and coverage.

        We construct an estimate of the number of workers whose wages are so low that

they cannot be lowered to absorb the cost of health insurance, using detailed data on

wages, health insurance, and demographics from the Current Population Survey. We

characterize the population of workers at risk in terms of their socio-demographic

characteristics (age, race, gender, education, family structure), and industry of

employment.       We find that 33 percent of uninsured workers earn within $3 of the

minimum wage, putting them at substantial risk of unemployment if their employers were

required to offer insurance. These workers are disproportionately likely to be high school

dropouts or racial minorities. Understanding which workers these laws are likely to

affect should play an important role in the assessment of the effect of employer mandates

on the level and distribution of employment and insurance coverage.



BACKGROUND

        The estimated impact of an employer health insurance mandate on insurance

coverage and employment depends on two sets of factors: (1) the specifics of the mandate

and (2) what one assumes about the dynamics of wages, fringe benefits, and employment.

        Specific mandate proposals vary widely from state to state.3               Most include

exemptions for smaller firms (e.g. those with fewer than 20 employees in California) and

for employees with few hours (e.g. fewer than 20 hours per week in Hawaii or 100 hours

per month in California). Most include minimum employer contributions (such as 80

percent of premiums in California or 75 percent for employees in Oregon) and minimum

coverage requirements (benchmarked to other plans offered in the state in Hawaii;

including prescription drugs and preventive care in California). Three of these features

are likely to be particularly important for the analysis of any particular mandate. First,

which employers and employees are affected? Any exemptions, such as those for small

firms or part-time workers, will dilute both the positive and negative effects of a mandate.

Second, what is the marginal cost of the newly mandated benefits, both in terms of

specific benefits and in terms of lost flexibility for employers? A mandate can specify a

mandate in order to estimate the proposal’s cost.


                                                3
generous benefits package that all employers must provide (thus increasing costs for

some employers already providing insurance) or it can require minimal coverage that

affects only employers who do not already provide insurance. Third, what fraction of

these costs must nominally be borne by the employer? When nominal wage rigidities

prevent accommodation of increased costs through reduced wages, the statutory

incidence may have a substantial effect. Policies that require firms to offer insurance but

not pay for it would like have little effect on rates of coverage because uninsured workers

do not appear to be very responsive to the availability of benefits unless they are very

heavily subsidized (Chernew, Frick and McLaughlin, 1997; for a review of the recent

literature on price elasticities of demand for health insurance among uninsured workers,

see Gruber and Washington, 2003).4

        The second set of issues – what assumptions one maintains about the dynamics of

wages, fringe benefits, and employment – comes into play when a significant share of the

cost of the newly mandated health benefits falls on employers. There is a consensus

among most economists that these costs, like the cost of any fringe benefit that workers

value, will be passed on to workers in the form of reduced wages whenever possible (see

Gruber and Krueger, 1991; Gruber, 1994; Fishback and Kantor, 1995; Olson, 2002). The

implication of this is that when an insurance mandate accomplishes its stated goal of

extending coverage to a previously uninsured worker, that worker will also experience a

reduction in her wage or the growth of her wage relative to what would have happened

otherwise. In the best-case scenario, the worker’s wage will be sufficiently high to


4
  If workers are required to take up the insurance, the degree to which workers value the benefits and the
elasticity of labor supply and demand would determine the ultimate effect on wages (and the “incidence”
of the mandate) – as discussed below. See Summers (1989) for a discussion of how worker valuation
affects the incidence of mandated benefits.


                                                    4
absorb the entire cost of the benefit, and the mandate will have changed the composition

of compensation (less wages, more benefits) but not the total value of compensation.

       The problem arises when the worker’s wage is not high enough to absorb this cost

without bumping into the minimum wage. When this is the case, the insurance mandate

has the same effect on employment as an increase in the minimum wage. Suppose, for

example, that an uninsured worker earning the minimum wage becomes subject to an

insurance mandate that requires the employer to provide benefits that cost $1 per hour

worked. Since there is no scope to reduce wages, the hourly cost of employing the

worker is now the minimum wage plus $1. Economists have long believed that this is

likely to result in lower employment, as employers substitute machines for workers when

workers become more expensive. The size of this “elasticity” of employment with

respect to the minimum wage has been the subject of considerable recent controversy:

there is little consensus on the magnitude of the unemployment effect associated with an

increase in the minimum wage (see Brown, 1999, for a review). Regardless of one’s

beliefs about the employment effect of minimum wage increases, however, the

employment effect of an employer health insurance mandate that increases employer

costs ought to be the same as the effect of a change in the minimum wage. In the analysis

that follows, we present estimates of the population at risk of being affected by the

imposition of employer mandates, to which different estimates of the elasticity of

employment with respect to changes in the minimum wage can be applied. Our analysis

shows how many uninsured workers are within different ranges of the minimum wage

(such as within $3), so that readers can consider mandates that impose different levels of




                                            5
cost on employers and a range of estimates of the effect of changes in the minimum wage

on employment.



DATA AND METHODS

        The primary data for analysis come from the Current Population Survey (CPS),

conducted annually by the Bureau of the Census. The CPS collects information from

about 50,000 households each month about household composition, socio-demographic

characteristics, earnings, and employment in eight different monthly surveys over the

course of sixteen months. Each month’s survey provides detailed demographic data such

as age, race, education, marital status, and family composition of respondents. The March

survey in each year also collects information about health insurance coverage. We

combine these variables with information provided by respondents about their labor force

status, whether or not they are paid hourly, usual hours worked, and wages in an exit

(“outgoing rotation”) interview.5 We use data from 2000 to 2006, the most recent CPS

survey available. We restrict our sample to respondents age 22 to 65.

        To this data we add information on the minimum wage, which varies by state and

over time (see Nelson, Nelson and Fizpatrick, and Fitzpatrick, various years, for details

of state law changes, also shown in Appendix Table A1). While the federal minimum

wage was $5.15 throughout our study period, several states enacted minimum wages that

were higher than the federal minimum, so workers and employers in these states faced a

5
  We are able to match just over 70 percent of March respondents to their corresponding exit (“outgoing
rotation”) interview. Reasons for failing to find a respondents across months include household mobility,
nonresponses, and noise in the identifiers. There is also a known decline in match quality following the
expansion of the CPS sample size in 2002 (driven in part by the way that household identifiers were
assigned to the new sample). We use the standard household and person identifiers to match across
months, and then screen for match quality using respondent demographics (such as age and gender), based
on methodology outlined in Madrian and Lefgren (2000). About 5.1% of observed “matches” appear to be
false, and these observations are dropped.


                                                    6
higher minimum wage. We then compare workers’ wages to the minimum wage in effect

in January in their state and year (which corresponds best with the period from which

respondents in the CPS report their wages).

        We also use information on health insurance premiums by state, year, and policy

type (family or single) collected by the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey for 1999 to

2005. We merge this data with the individual observations from the CPS for those years

(using the previous year’s survey to most closely match the timing of the CPS

questionnaire) to impute a health insurance premium for each observation, attributing

family policy premiums to those with a spouse or children and single policy premiums to

those without.6 We deflate all dollar amounts to year 2006 dollars using the CPI.

        Together, these data allow us to estimate both the likely effect of different

employer mandates on wages and employment, as well as the distributional implications

for workers with different characteristics. In the analysis that follows, we aggregate data

from the CPS across years, and report workers’ insurance status, wages relative to the

minimum wage, and various demographic characteristics such as age, race, marital status,

and education.      We use the weights provided in the CPS so that the numbers and

proportions we report are representative of the full-time private sector workforce as a

whole. See the Appendix Tables that follow for more detail.



RESULTS

        We use these data to estimate which workers would be at risk of unemployment

with the imposition of employer mandates. We present data on the health insurance and

6
 The health insurance questions in the March CPS refer to coverage in the previous calendar year. Swartz
(1986) presents evidence that people actually respond to these questions as if they were reporting their
coverage at the time of the survey.

wage distribution of all workers, as well as different demographic subgroups, focusing in

particular on workers with wages close to the minimum wage since it is these workers

whose wages may have the least flexibility to be lowered in response to mandates that

make employing them more costly, and thus may be most likely to face adverse

employment consequences.7 We focus our analysis on workers employed more than 20

hours per week, as those with fewer hours are likely to be exempt from employer

mandates.8 Much more detailed data are shown in the Appendix Tables that follow.


Workers at Risk

        More than 15 percent of private sector workers employed more than 20 hours a

week (whom we call “full time”) are currently uninsured. Note that our estimate of

uninsured workers includes those who decline insurance offered to them by their

employers, but does not include workers who get insurance from a source other than their

own employer.9




7
   While hourly workers may be more susceptible to binding minimum wages than salaried workers,
minimum wage laws apply to almost all salaried workers as well. We impute an hourly wage for those
workers on salary using the usual hours worked per week and weekly wages from the CPS. Workers paid
hourly are much more likely to be close to the minimum wage than those paid on salary, but we include
both in our analysis.
8
  Many proposed mandates only apply to full-time workers. Employers might thus have the incentive to
substitute away from full-time employees towards part-time employees. We ignore these dynamics. We
are also implicitly assuming here that wages adjust independently of whether workers would have taken up
insurance or not – insofar as there is no mechanism for employers to know ahead of time (when offering a
wage and insurance package) whether a worker is going to take up that coverage or not.
9
  Implicitly, we are assuming that the wages of workers who turned down have not already adjusted
downward by the cost of the insurance that they declined. Analysis of the February Contingent Work
Supplements to the Current Population Survey in 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001 and 2005 shows that about one-
quarter of uninsured workers were offered insurance. We also assume that workers with coverage from
another source, which is typically a spouse’s employer-sponsored policy, would not be affected by
mandates.

Who are these uninsured workers? They are more than three times as likely to be high-

school drop-outs as insured workers, and twice as likely to be from a minority racial or

ethnic group. They are 50 percent more likely to be under age 35 and to be unmarried.

They are almost twice as likely to be single parents.

Uninsured workers are thus demographically quite different from insured workers.

Several of these characteristics make them economically vulnerable – and also make

them the target population for policies intended to expand health insurance coverage.

       Many of the employer mandates being considered by different states exempt

small firms. More than 55 percent of all uninsured workers are employed in firms with

more than 25 employees (compared to more 80 percent of insured workers) – which




                                             9
means that they would be covered by many proposed mandates.10 Of course, mandates

that cover only firms above this size would have commensurately smaller effects both on

insurance coverage and on the risk of decreasing employment than proposals without

such limitations.

Benchmark Insurance Costs

           How likely these uninsured workers are to face unemployment depends on

whether the minimum wage is binding – that is, if the hourly cost per worker of newly

mandated health insurance is greater than the gap between the worker’s wage and the

minimum wage.               While a more detailed calculation requires knowledge of (or

assumptions about) workers’ family structure, health status, the elasticity of labor supply

and demand, workers’ valuation of health insurance benefits, long-run labor market

dynamics (such as substitution towards part-time employees) and the like, we calculate

several informative back-of-the-envelope benchmarks using aggregate insurance costs.

The average annual premium for employer-sponsored health insurance in our data was

approximately $9,046 for family coverage and $3,429 for single coverage (for the period


10
     It is not clear how accurate employees’ reports of their establishment size are.


                                                        10
   2000-2006, expressed in 2006 dollars), for an average hourly premium of $3.66 for a full-

   time worker.11 If employers were required to pay 80% of premiums, the average hourly

   wage for this group of workers would thus have to decrease by about $3 to absorb fully

   the cost of providing the average health insurance package. Here, clearly, the costs

   would be different if the mandated insurance coverage were more or less generous than

   the typical plan already provided to most workers or if workers were required to pay

   more of the premium directly.

            We also calculate a more sophisticated benchmark based on the insurance cost

   facing individual workers, rather than a broad average. We impute the insurance cost for

   each worker based on state of residence, year, and family structure, divide that number by

   2,000 to generate an average hourly cost of insurance, and compare the difference

   between hourly wages and the minimum wage to that hourly insurance cost.

   The Role of the Minimum Wage

            A large fraction of uninsured workers earn little more than the minimum wage.

   Insurance costs potentially represent an enormous increase in the minimum compensation

   for this group of workers.           The federal minimum wage is $5.15, and the average


   11
     These data are consistent with other survey results on insurance costs, suggesting that our algorithm for
   assigning premiums in our sample is representative. For example, the Kaiser/HRET survey reported
   average employer premiums in 2006 of $11,500 for family policies and $4,200 for single policies, while in
   our CPS/MEPS sample the average premium in 2006 was $10,700 for family policies and 4,000 for single
   policies.


                                                       11
minimum wage in our sample (taking into account state minimums that are sometimes

higher) is $5.98 – so the benchmark cost of $3 represents 50 percent of the effective

minimum wage.12 There is clearly a great deal of disagreement about the effect of

minimum wages on employment, but even under relatively conservative elasticity

estimates this could result in significant effects on minimum wage workers.

        Uninsured workers earning within $3 of the minimum wage represent 5 percent of

the workforce, and a third of all uninsured workers. (Using the more sophisticated

benchmark based on individual insurance costs yields answers very similar to the $3

benchmark, both of which are reported in the Appendix Tables.)

Figure 1 shows a more detailed distribution of the hourly wages of uninsured workers

relative to the minimum wage.




12
  On average, wages represent about 70 percent of compensation in the private sector, with health insurance
costs accounting for an addition 7 percent, other voluntary fringe benefits accounting for 14 percent, and
legally required benefits (such as Social Security) accounting for the remaining 9 percent (Department of
Labor 2007). In theory, then, employers might respond to insurance mandates by reducing other fringe
benefits. Low-wage workers are less likely than the typical worker to have these other benefits, however
(Schwabisch 2004), so it is unclear in practice how much of a buffer other benefits provide.

                                        Thus, while the overall fraction of private sector workers who are “at risk” is

moderate, since only 5 percent of all workers are uninsured workers earning within $3 of

the minimum wage, a potentially very large fraction of the group supposedly targeted for

help by employer mandates might in fact be hurt, since 33 percent of uninsured workers

earn within $3 of the minimum wage. So, of the roughly 114 million U.S. private sector

workers, 105 million of whom work more than 20 hours per week, 16 million are

uninsured, and more than 5 million of those earn within $3 of the minimum wage.13

                                        As Table 2 suggested, low-skilled workers are more likely to be uninsured.

Figure 2 shows this wage distribution for workers with different levels of education.

Workers with less than a high school degree are significantly more likely to have

earnings close to the minimum wage.

Thus, among the uninsured, those with the least education face the highest risk of losing

their jobs under employer mandates. The same is true for nonwhites, those under age 35,

single parents, and women (as seen in Appendix Table A4).


Potential Job Loss

                             How many of those workers are likely to lose their jobs? We calculate an

approximate answer to this question in the following way.                                                                     First, we compare the

individual-specific hourly insurance costs described above to the cushion between an

uninsured worker’s wage and the minimum wage. If a worker’s wage is sufficiently high

that it can adjust downward by the full cost of insurance without hitting the minimum

wage, we assume this worker is not at risk of losing her job. If, however, the minimum

wage constraint binds, we calculate the percentage increase in total compensation implied



                                                                                              14
by the health insurance mandate. For example, if a worker earning $6 per hour is

mandated to have health insurance costing the firm $2 per hour, we assume that her wage

will adjust downward by 85 cents to the minimum wage of $5.15.                          However, the

remaining $1.15 of the cost of the mandate cannot be absorbed by reducing wages and

increases her total compensation to $7.15 – an increase in compensation of almost 20

percent ($1.15/$6.00 = 0.19). Assuming an employment elasticity with respect to the

minimum wage of -0.1, meaning that a ten percent increase in the minimum wage would

lead to a one percent reduction in employment, this worker has a two percent chance of

losing her job.14 Performing a similar calculation for all the workers in our sample

suggests that about 224,000 workers would lose jobs as a result of a mandate with these

costs.    More than 60 percent of these workers would be racial or ethnic minorities and

about one-third would have less than a high school education. The burden of the mandate

would thus fall disproportionately on these groups since, for example, racial and ethnic

minorities are only 30 percent of the workforce in this sample.

  This is a relatively conservative estimate of the sensitivity of employment to minimum wage laws. See
Brown (1999) for a review of the wider range of estimates of this elasticity.


                                                  15
        To the extent that mandates impose additional costs on firms (such as reduced

flexibility or more generous coverage than they were already offering), these figures

represent a lower bound on the increase in unemployment likely to result from such

mandates. As noted above, if mandates apply only to some workers this will dilute both

the positive and negative effects of a mandate. For example, establishments with fewer

than 25 workers employ 44 percent of uninsured workers (Table 3); if these small

employers were exempted from a mandate, our estimate of job loss would drop to about

45 percent of the number above.


Regional Variation

        These results are not confined to any particular area of the country. As Appendix

Table 7 shows, the Northeast, Midwest, South, and West have very similar fractions of

workers at risk for unemployment. Looking at individual states shows that there is local

variation in this at-risk pool, however (although sample size limits our ability to compare

individual states).

                                           CA       MA        OR      WA      US Avg

Individual states should be more concerned with employment effects of their own

minimum wage laws and health insurance mandates than the federal government, since




                                            16
firms and jobs may move across state lines if nearby states place fewer constraints on

employers.


DISCUSSION

       Understanding the labor market consequences of employer mandates is a key

component in evaluating their effectiveness relative to other policies such as tax credits,

Medicaid expansions, and individual mandates. Several studies have analyzed the effect

of different versions of employer mandates on insurance premiums and on workers’

wages. This study contributes an important missing piece to the analysis: how large is

the potential risk of unemployment? Our analysis suggests that one third of the targeted

population of uninsured workers have hourly wages close enough to the minimum wage

that employers will not be able to lower their wages enough to accommodate fully the

increase in compensation costs that employer mandates would impose. These workers,

who tend to be disproportionately low-education, minority, and female, thus face a risk of

unemployment.     This risk of unemployment should be a crucial component in the

evaluation of both the effectiveness of these policies in reducing the number of uninsured

and their broader effects on the well-being of low-wage workers.
