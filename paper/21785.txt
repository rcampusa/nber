                                            ABSTRACT

I reconstruct the data on Virginia’s paper money regime using forensic accounting techniques. I correct
the existing data on the amounts authorized and outstanding. In addition, I reconstruct yearly data
on previously unknown aspects of Virginia’s paper money regime, including printings, net new emissions,
redemptions and removals, denominational structures, expected tax revenues, and specie accumulating
in the treasury for paper money redemption. These new data form the foundation for narratives written
on the social, economic, and political history of Virginia, as well as for testing models of colonial
paper money performance.

        Forensic Accounting Reconstruction of the Data

        I reconstruct the data on Virginia’s paper money regime using forensic accounting
        techniques. I correct the existing data on the amounts authorized and outstanding. In
        addition, I reconstruct yearly data on previously unknown aspects of Virginia’s paper
        money regime, including printings, net new emissions, redemptions and removals,
        denominational structures, expected tax revenues, and specie accumulating in the treasury
        for paper money redemption. These new data form the foundation for narratives written
        on the social, economic, and political history of Virginia, as well as for testing models of
        colonial paper money performance.

        In 1755, Virginia and Georgia became the last of the 13 colonies to emit paper money.

The performance of Virginia’s paper money regime is central to the history of the period. It was

at the center of the conflict with the Crown over colonial monetary powers and provided

justification for Parliament passing the Currency Act of 1764 (4 Geo III c. 34). This conflict

contributed to revolutionary sentiments. Virginia’s paper money regime was also a point of

contention in Virginia politics. Irregular activities by Virginia’s treasurer occupied a substantial

amount of political attention. Virginia’s administrative structure was altered as a result. 2

        Virginia had the second largest free population of the 13 colonies (Carter, et al. 2006, v.

5, p. 652). Why Virginia took so long to initiate its own paper money regime is curious. Part of

Virginia’s delay may be due to the relative efficiency of its commodity “tobacco” money which

was commonly used in domestic transactions and to pay local taxes. Prior to emitting paper

money, Virginia’s media of exchange consisted of barter, typically involving book-credit and

tobacco—often in the form of claims to tobacco or tobacco notes; personal bills of exchange and

promissory notes; and specie coins. The composition of this media is unknown, though specie

coins were considered relatively scarce.

       Budgetary crises caused by wars typically pushed colonies into paper money systems

(Grubb 2016). Virginia did not face such a crisis until the Seven Year’s War. The immediate and

large spending demands of Virginia’s participation in the Seven Year’s War swamped Virginia’s

ability to raise enough taxes immediately to meet these expenses (Brock 1975, pp. 466-9, 476).

As a result, the Virginia legislature authorized 614,797 “Virginia pounds” (£VA) worth of paper

money to be printed between 1755 and 1774.

       Paper money was created by colonial legislatures and directly spent by those legislatures

through their respective treasuries. Legislature-issued, colony-specific paper monies were the

only paper monies in circulation in colonial America. No public or private incorporated banks

issuing paper banknotes backed by fractional specie reserves, with said banknotes redeemable at

face value in specie at the issuing bank, existed in colonial America (Hammond 1991, pp. 3-67).

       The amount of paper money the Virginia legislature maintained in public circulation is

foundational data. The political, social, and economic narratives of Virginia’s late colonial

history, and the history of colonial America over its last quarter century, are erected upon, and

must be consistent with, that data. Yet, no one alive today knows where the quantitative data

currently in use on Virginia’s paper money regime originates (Carter, et al. 2006, v. 5, pp. 692-

6). It is mysterious data that could be, for all anyone knows, totally made up.

       This is a methodological essay. Scholars need to know how quantitative data are created.

They need to know where these data are reasonably solid and trustworthy—closely linked to

primary source observations, and where they are highly constructed and fragile—being based on

supposition, assumption, and conjecture. In particular, scholars need to know where the data




                                                                                                    2
suffer error variance in their construction, what the source of that error variance is, the

magnitude of that error variance, and what alternative data constructions are possible. Scholars

who craft the political, social, and economic narratives of Virginia’s late colonial history, as well

as economists who test models of colonial paper money, depend on that knowledge.

       I will show how the quantitative data on Virginia’s colonial paper money are constructed,

and in the process produce better data than currently exists. I will also construct yearly data on

previously uncharted aspects of Virginia’s paper money regime, including on paper money

printings, net new emissions, redemptions and removals, denominational structures, expected tax

revenues, and the specie accumulating in the treasury for paper money redemption. Throughout,

the goal is to show scholars the nitty-gritty of how it is done—to lay bare the assumptions made

so that the reasonableness of the data constructions may be compared with possible alternatives.

       The essay proceeds as follows: First, I assess the current quantitative data on colonial

Virginia’s paper money regime and compare it with my final reconstructed data. Second, I

proceed step-by-step through how these data are constructed. I start with emissions, proceed

through redemptions and removals, and end with a final data series of paper money in public

circulation. Third, I present data on the denominational structure of Virginia’s paper money and

estimate the medium in which the taxes imposed by paper money acts were paid. I also estimate

the amounts of specie and tobacco monies accumulating in the treasury to be used to redeem

paper money. Lastly, I use these data to reassess the John Robinson treasury scandal that rocked

Virginia politics in the mid-1760s.

       Virginia referred to its paper money as treasury notes. Other colonies referred to their

paper monies as bills of credit. While treasury notes were the same as bills of credit, I will refer

to Virginia’s paper money throughout as notes rather than bills in keeping with Virginia’s

                                                Mysterious Data

           Historical Statistics (Carter, et al. 2006, v. 5, pp. 692-6) is the current go-to place for data

on the amount of colonial Virginia paper money in circulation each year. If one tracks back

through the citations and sources listed, the hypothesis that these numbers are made up cannot be

rejected. They are not observations, even though they are seemingly presented as such. They are

not estimates or interpolations, as that would indicate that some methodology or calculating

construction was used, and none is offered. Where these numbers come from is a mystery.

           In the Historical Statistics, the numbers for Virginia are taken from Brock (1992, p. 116).

John J. McCusker compiled the numbers in the Historical Statistics, and while he cites several

sources, the numbers are identical to those in Brock (1992, p. 116) and not to those in any other

source. 3 Of the sources cited, only Brock (1992, p. 116) and Ernst (1972, p. 370) report numbers

on the amount of Virginia notes in circulation. Brock (1992, p. 116) cites Ernst (1973, pp. 7 and

356). However, no such numbers exist in Ernst on those pages. Ernst (1973, p. 370) does report

some numbers for the amounts of Virginia paper money in circulation, but only for 9 of the 20

years covered by Brock. These numbers are also not the same as those in Brock (1992, p. 116) or

in the Historical Statistics. McCusker concluded that “Brock (1992), p. 115, seems to have

interpolated some of his data but this is not made explicit,” —a generous assessment (Carter et

al. 2006, v. 5, p. 695).

           Brock (1992, p. 116) was not published by Brock, but by Ron Michener well after

Brock’s death using Brock’s surviving notes. A close look at Brock (1975, pp. 476-7 [original

1941]) shows that Brock had created these numbers on Virginia’s notes in circulation prior to

1941, as he graphed these numbers on those pages. He did not, however, present the actual

                                                                                                          4
numerical values. Brock (1975, p. 475) describes the graph as “Some idea” of the sums

outstanding and not as an estimate or as observations of the sums outstanding.

       I assume the numbers in Brock (1992, p. 116), as well as in Ernst (1973, p. 370), are not

totally fabricated, but came from some investigation of evidence in primary sources. I use three

primary sources in my forensic reconstruction of the data, namely the statutory paper money acts

(Hening 1969); the treasury accounts as recorded in the Journals of the House of Burgesses

(Kennedy 1906a, pp. 64-6, 108, 118-20, 124-8, 154-6, 283-5, 303; 1906b, pp. 72, 217-8; 1907,

pp. 143, 171, 176-8, 356-7; McIlwaine 1908, pp. 15, 36-7, 115-6, 171-2, 249-50; 1909, pp. 388,

458, 487-90); and the letters published in the Virginia Gazette by the post-1765 treasurer Robert

Carter Nicholas (William and Marry College Quarterly Historical Magazine 1912, pp. 227-62).

Brock and Ernst clearly consulted these three primary sources to construct their numbers. The

mystery of how they used and interpreted these sources is sorted out here.

         While the statutory paper money acts appear to offer rather straightforward data that

can be simply picked out and reported, there are subtle issues of interpretation that can lead

scholars astray. More significantly, the statutory paper money acts by themselves do not yield the

amounts of paper money in circulation. Information from the treasury accounts must be added.

Alas, the treasury accounts are incomplete, disorganized, irregularly reported, chaotic and

inconsistent in presentation structure, and unclear in the use of common terminology. For

example, what is meant in the treasury accounts by the term “issued” and the term “in

circulation” are not what we commonly understand by such words today.

       An extensive forensic accounting reconstruction of these accounts is required to make

sense of them. This reconstruction is provided below. The forensic reconstruction also puts key

terminologies used in the treasury accounts into their proper historical context, thereby




                                                                                                    5
deciphering their usage by contemporaries. Forensic accounting uses existent records to

reconstruct the accounts of interest to a standard sufficient to meet legal criteria. Given that the

records are legislative, that standard is appropriate. This reconstruction relies on tracking internal

consistencies and coherences across the existent records, paying close attention to the execution

details embedded in the relevant laws, and using reasonable inferences to fill in missing data. 4

        While we may never know how Brock and Ernst created their numbers, my forensic

reconstruction of Virginia’s paper money regime shows what Brock and Ernst likely did, along

with what they likely missed. In the process, additional information beyond the amount of paper

money authorized by statute and the amount in circulation are recovered. The forensic

reconstruction process also shows where the data are solid and where the data are fragile—giving

scholars a feel for the error variance in the paper money data in the historical record.

                                                   Preview

        Figure 1 presents my preliminary and final forensic reconstruction of the amounts of

Virginia’s notes in public circulation along with those numbers presented by Brock and Ernst.

My preliminary and final reconstructions are reasonably close to the numbers provided by Brock

and Ernst. If my forensically reconstructed data are rejected, including their component parts,

then the data presented by Ernst and Brock, a.k.a. the Historical Statistics data, must also be

rejected, leaving no usable data on this topic.

        While my reconstructed data are reasonably close to that of Brock and Ernst, Table 1

shows that in some years the percentage deviations of Brock’s numbers and Ernst’s numbers

from my final reconstructed numbers are substantial. As such, my final reconstruction makes

important corrections to the Brock and Ernst data. The substantial deviations of Brock and Ernst

from my reconstructed data in Table 1 are due to oversights by these scholars when looking at

the primary sources and to the fact that they did not reconstruct tax revenues.

         Brock substantially overstates the amount in circulation in 1755. He missed the fact that

3,960£VA authorized to be emitted in 1755 was recorded in the treasury accounts as never

emitted, and missed the fact that 18,861£VA authorized to be emitted in 1755 was recorded in the

treasury accounts as not emitted in 1755, but in a subsequent year. By contrast, Ernst must have

incorporated these facts as he gets the amount for 1755 correct—within the rounding exercise he

employs. The other deviations of Brock from my reconstructed data are the result of timing

placements regarding when amounts reported as emitted and redeemed were actually put into

and taken out of circulation, which is partly due to how tax revenues are reconstructed and used.

         The substantial deviations of Ernst from my reconstructed data in Table 1 are the result

of several oversights by Ernst. While Ernst must have consulted the treasury accounts, he simply

reports the numbers found rather than interpreting their meaning. For example, he reports a

number for 1756 that assumes that no redemptions took place in 1756. The redemption and

removal of the first emission was scheduled for mid-1756. Its redemption was not reported in the

treasury accounts until early in 1757. Ernst must have assumed, given the reporting year, that



                                                                                                            8
none was redeemed in 1756. Most taxes to redeem notes, as Ernst himself points out (Ernst 1973,

p. 186), were collected in the fall, with total collections not reported until the next spring.

Therefore, it is unlikely that this emission was not primarily redeemed in 1756.

           Ernst’s numbers in Table 1 for 1767-1769 and 1772-1773 come directly from statements

in the treasury accounts about the amount of notes in circulation. 5 Again, Ernst simply reports

the numbers he ran across. Such reporting results in three errors of interpretation. First, these

statements were typically made early in the year and thus refer to notes removed in the latter part

of the prior year. Thus, these statements are off by one year and the amounts reported should be

placed in the prior year. Second, the treasury accounts explicitly refer to these amounts in

circulation as being only for “old” notes, meaning notes issued before 1769. They do not include

the 40,000£VA “new” notes emitted in 1769 and 1771. Thus, the amounts Ernst lists after 1769

are biased low. Finally, the treasury accounts construct these numbers by taking all notes printed

and then subtracting all notes burned. To the extent that this construction fails to subtract notes

sitting idle in the treasury, unburned and un-emitted, it overstates the amounts actually in public

circulation, especially pre-1769. Thus, pre-1769, Ernst’s numbers are biased high.

           What follows is my forensic reconstruction of the data using the primary sources. It will

show in detail what Brock, and to a lesser extent Ernst, must have done to create their data, and

what they failed to consider. It also gives scholars a sense of what aspects of this estimation are

more exact to observation and what are highly constructed. I proceed from the most solid and

trustworthy evidence in the primary sources through the forensically reconstructed data that

relies directly on that solid and trustworthy evidence to the most fragile or “constructed” data

that relies on reasonable inference, back-projection, interpolation, and data cloning. This is done

so scholars can get a sense of the size and location of the error variance in measurement and so

         The Forensic Reconstruction of Colonial Virginia’s Paper Money Accounts

       Ultimately, the number desired is the amount of paper money in public circulation each

year. It is this amount that influences behavior and thus historical processes and outcomes. Such

numbers, however, cannot be found in the surviving records of colonial Virginia. One cannot just

go to a primary source and copy down such data. The few times that colonial Virginia documents

mention amounts of paper money in circulation they did not mean what is commonly understood

as being “in circulation.” As such, this data has to be constructed out of the information that has

survived. To find the amounts of paper money in circulation each year, one needs to establish the

amounts of new paper money emitted into public hands each year, then subtract from that the

amounts of paper money removed from the public each year, and then chart the total

accumulation or de-accumulation of paper money over time as a result of this yearly emission-

redemption-removal process.

a. New Emissions Authorized by Statutory Law

       The data construction process starts with identifying how much new paper money was

emitted each year by the legislature. Such information can be derived from the statutory laws that

authorized paper money emissions. While this information comes from the most complete and

clear surviving primary source, it still is not free from scholarly misinterpretation. Simply

copying down data in this source can lead one astray. The statutory laws on paper emissions

report total paper money authorized to be printed and total paper money authorized to be emitted.

They are not the same totals. The difference for Virginia comes from one-for-one swaps of new

paper money for old. Such one-for-one swaps do not affect the total amount of paper money in




                                                                                                   10
public circulation. To get to the total amount of paper money in public circulation, information

on net new emissions of paper money rather than total printings of paper money is needed.

       Table 2 lists the 16 paper money acts, their legislative session dates, and the total printed

versus net new emissions of paper money authorized by each act. These two numbers are the

same for each act except for emissions #6 and #16. Emission #6 included 95,000£VA to be

swapped one-for-one with emissions #2, #3, and #4. Emission #16 was all to be swapped one-

for-one with what was left outstanding from emissions #14 and #15. These amounts must be

removed to get the total net new emissions authorized.

       Table 2 shows that Ernst (1973, p. 370) reported total printings not net new emissions.

Given that most readers assume that the numbers reported are net new emissions, Ernst’s data

overstates total net new emissions by 27 percent. A similar judgment can be made of the data

reported in the 1912 William and Mary College Quarterly Historical Magazine. By contrast, the

data reported by Brock (1975, pp. 476-7) is for net new emissions and not total printings. Brock,

however, does not report emissions after 1762 and excludes 4,963£VA from emission #6,

erroneously counting that amount as part of the one-for-one currency swap rather than as part of

the new emission. The 4,963£VA amount were new emission #6 notes used to pay the accrued

interest on emissions #2, #3, and #4 when those notes were swapped for emission #6 notes. They

are part of the net new emission of emission #6 notes. As such, Brock understates total net new

emissions by 9 percent.

       One last adjustment has to be done to the net new emissions authorized in Table 2. While

statutory law authorized only 10,000£VA for emission #5, 12,000£VA was actually printed and

emitted according to the House of Burgesses (McIlwaine 1909, p. 490). While statutory law is

regarded as superior in authority to legislative statements, treasurer accounts corroborate this

alternative total. On three different occasions across two different treasurers, the treasury

accounts says that 539,963£VA were emitted from 1755 through 1762 (Kennedy 1906a, pp. 119,

155; William and Mary College Quarterly Historical Magazine 1912, p. 234). Summing the

authorized numbers in Table 2 indicates that these treasury accounts are reporting total printings

as the amounts “issued” and not net new emissions.

         The summing of authorized amounts printed in Table 2 is 2,000£VA less than that

reported in the treasury accounts for that period. The only mention of this extra 2,000£VA is in

regard to emission #5 (McIlwaine 1909, p. 490). Given this corroboration and coherence across

the existent records, 12,000£VA will be taken as the correct amount for emission #5 (see also



                                                                                                                  12
Table 8 below). Both Ernst and Brock report emission #5 as being for 12,000£VA rather than the

10,000£VA as authorized by statutory law. These two scholars must have been examining the

treasury accounts as reported in the Journals of the House of Burgesses to construct their data on

paper money, as that source is the only place the 12,000£VA figure can be found.

b. Net New Emissions Actually Put Into Public Circulation

       In the absence of contrary evidence in the treasury accounts, I assume that notes went

into public circulation in the year they were authorized by legislative statute. The dates printed

on the notes averaged only one month later than the assembly session authorizing the respective

notes (Newman 2008, pp. 437-43). Given this observation, and the fact that new authorizations

came yearly and often sub-yearly before 1761, it is a reasonable assumption.

       Table 3 uses the information stated in the treasury accounts to make two adjustments to

turn the net new amounts authorized into net new emissions actually put into public circulation.

First, the treasury accounts state that certain authorized amounts from emissions #1 and #2 were

never spent out of the treasury, but sat there, and were eventually burned without ever being

emitted. Column (2) of Table 3 lists those sums and the authorized emissions from which they

must be subtracted.

       The amount identified in column (2) of Table 3 for emission #2 in 1755, however, must

be added back in 1757. For emissions #2, #3, and #4, a total of 99,963£VA of emission #6 notes

were authorized to be swapped for emission #2, #3, and #4 notes in public circulation and to pay

off the accrued interest on those notes to that point. Only 93,604£VA of emissions #2, #3, and #4

were emitted into public circulation, thus the interest portion of the amount authorized was

6,359£VA. In effect, the “missing” un-emitted notes from emission #2 are added back in to the

total emitted via interest payments above the 93,604£VA currency swap.

                                                                                                              14
a
  The 93,604£VA notes from emissions #2, #3, and #4 were not swapped for emission #6 notes all at once, but over
the next eight years. The net new emissions from this swap were the extra 6,359£VA emission #6 notes printed to pay
the 1.2 years of accrued interest on emission #2, #3, and #4 notes. I assumed that this interest was only paid when
the notes were brought in to be swapped. 6,359£VA / 93,604£VA = 0.0679. This percentage was used to convert notes
listed as still held in the treasury to execute this swap into the net new emission #6 notes that were emitted as the
interest payment portion of this swap. I assume the 93,604£VA total actually emitted for emissions #2, #3, and #4
was known by the crafting of emission #6, and it was known how many extra emission #6 notes were needed to pay
the accrued interest.
b
  7,255£VA of emission #6 notes that were part of the new 80,000£VA emission of emission #6 notes were unspent in
the treasury in 1758. This sum gets incorporated into discussions of emissions #7 and #8 that were still unspent in
the treasury and when those unspent sums were no longer in the treasury and so must have been spent. 6,775£VA of
emissions #7 and #8 were designated to fund the Rangers (a military unit) and the Commissioner on Indian Affairs.
This amount was reported as still held in the treasury for this purpose into 1760, when 4,275£VA was no longer
mentioned as being so held. I assume that 3,275£VA was released that year to fund the Rangers and 1,000£VA to fund
the Commissioner on Indian Affairs, as 2,500£VA was still reported as held in the treasury to fund the Commissioner
on Indian Affairs in the years after 1761. This 2,500£VA shows up again in 1766 as part of the monies the treasurer,
John Robinson, diverted out of the treasury as loans to his friends. Exactly what year this 2,500£VA was put into
circulation by Robinson is unknown. It is arbitrarily placed in 1764 as a best guess.
c
  The +5,212£VA in 1761 from emissions #9, #10, #11, and #12 are pro-rated in subtraction across those emissions
because which emission this added amount should be subtracted from was not indicated.


         In other words, emission #6 authorized 179,963£VA notes which consisted of 80,000£VA

of new emissions plus 93,604£VA in one-for-one currency swaps for notes outstanding from

emissions #2, #3, and #4 plus 6,359£VA in interest payments. The 1,396£VA notes never emitted

added to the 93,604£VA notes actually emitted equals the 95,000£VA originally authorized, which

in turn when subtracted from the emission #6 total authorization of 179,963£VA equals

84,963£VA net new emissions going into public hands.

         The treasury accounts also list sums that were sitting in the treasury unspent from given

emissions for some time after their initial authorization. Given that the treasury accounts never

refer to these sums as being destroyed without being emitted, I assume that they were spent into

public circulation at some later date. Column (3) in Table 3 lists these amounts as stated in the

treasury accounts, subtracts these amounts from the amounts authorized in their respective

emission year, and then adds these amounts back in the year where it seems reasonable to

assume they were spent into public circulation.

         For the most part, the numbers, along with the year when each is subtracted, are direct



                                                                                                                  15
observations taken from the treasury accounts. The year when they are added back in, however,

must be inferred as it is not directly stated in the treasury accounts. The method for placement

assumes that following the last mention of a sum still sitting idle in the treasury, if that mention

was early in the year, I assume that sum went into circulation in the last year it was mentioned. If

the sum was last mentioned late in the year, then I assume it went into circulation in the

following year. 6 At this stage, the data construction process has moved from direct observations

to controlled conjectures. Some potential error variance in the path of net new notes put into

public circulation is introduced here.

        Column (4) of Table 3 incorporates the two adjustments to the net new emissions

authorized to produce the time-path of the net new emissions actually put into public circulation.

Column (5) sums the accumulation of these emissions under the assumption that none were ever

removed from circulation. It simply provides the maximum ceiling for total notes in circulation.

Any analysis that leads to more than that listed in column (5) would not be credible.

c. Removal of Notes from Public Circulation: Preliminary Evidence and Adjustments

        To derive the amount of notes in public circulation, notes removed from public

circulation must be subtracted from the net new notes put into public circulation. Table 4

provides information on the amount of notes removed, and estimates of when they were

removed, from public circulation. For the most part, the amounts of notes removed from public

circulation are direct observations taken from the treasury accounts. When these notes were

removed from public circulation prior to their reporting in the treasury accounts, however, must

be estimated. Some back-projection, interpolation, data cloning, and other placement estimation

methods are required. The methods used depend on the type of information provided in the

6
  Trying to prorate the introduction of these notes by month, say for some months at the end of a year and then some
in the months after the New Year, was not attempted here. The spending by the treasury each month is unknown,
and to guess at its prorated flow would be pure speculation.

  Emission #1 had 3,961£VA never emitted. Out of the 16,039£VA emitted, 15,932£VA were redeemed in 1756 and
subsequently burned in 1757. What happened to the difference, 107£VA, is unknown. I assume it was lost by the
public—a one-year loss rate of 0.67 percent is not unthinkable. At redemption, 606£VA was paid in interest for the
one year period that the emission was outstanding. I assume the interest payment was in specie or tobacco claims
and not notes as no statement to the contrary was recorded.


treasury accounts. In addition, the treasury accounts do not use consist language when indicating

that notes were removed and burned. Some liberties of interpretation are required. At this point,

we have moved the farthest away from direct observation and thereby introduced the most



                                                                                                               17
potential error variance into the time path of notes in public circulation.

       Column (1) of Table 4 reports the direct evidence from the treasury accounts at the time it

was reported in the House of Burgesses of the amount of notes burned. Several subtle

interpretations, however, must be used to make sense of this evidence. First, statements about

total notes burned to date, such as on 7 April 1768, cannot be directly used because they refer to

total notes printed and not notes in public circulation (Kennedy 1906a, p. 155). Burning notes

taken in as one-for-one swaps for new notes has no effect on total notes in public circulation.

These burnt notes are removed from column (1) totals.

       Second, notes removed and burned from emission #5 must be indirectly inferred. After

1757, i.e. after emission #5 was to be fully redeemed, the treasury accounts state the amount of

funds remaining in a dedicated account to fully redeem emission #5 notes as they were brought

in for redemption. I assume that the difference between the amount of emission #5 notes emitted,

12,000£VA, and the sum remaining in the treasury account for its redemption measures the

amount of emission #5 notes redeemed and burned to that date (see Table 8 below).

       Column (2) of Table 4 makes several adjustments to the data in column (1). First, column

(2) makes a placement adjustment. Again, the treasury accounts as reported in the Journals of the

House of Burgesses were typically made early in the year and so refer to redemptions made in

the prior year. Most redemption taxes were collected in the fall, and so notes reported in the

Journals of the House of Burgesses as burned were likely removed via tax payments in the prior

year. As such, the amounts stated in the treasury accounts of notes burned in the early part of the

year are moved to the immediately prior year in terms of when they were removed from public

circulation. The amounts stated in the treasury accounts of notes burned in the latter part of the

year are assumed to have been removed from public circulation in that same year.




                                                                                                     18
       Second, missing accounts for the years 1764 through 1766 are filled in via back-

projection and interpolation. I assume that any time the treasury accounts mention a sum of notes

burned in a given year, that that sum is the complete amount removed and burned that year. So

only years when nothing is mentioned must have their amounts estimated. In the last three years

of John Robinson’s tenure as treasurer (he had been treasurer since 1738 and died in 1766), little

information was recorded from the treasury accounts.

       The redemption amounts for these three years are back-projected and interpolated values

based on the difference between redemptions up through 1762 estimated in column (2) of Table

4, and the 1768 treasury account of the total accumulated notes burned between 1755 and 1 April

1767. The treasury accounts report an accumulated total of 326,192£VA notes burned before 1

April 1767. This number is out of all notes printed, not all notes emitted into public circulation.

Thus, it must be reduced by notes burned that were not net new emissions to the public. This

reduction includes 3,960£VA never spent out of treasury and the 93,604£VA that were emission #6

one-for-one currency swaps for emission #2, #3, and #4 notes (the swapped notes being

presumably burned, though no direct statements of such were made in the treasury accounts).

The amount of notes redeemed from the public and burned up through 1762 is estimated in

column (2) of Table 4 to be 162,587£VA. A statement of notes burned in 1767 that were from

removals in 1766 exists, so only three years, 1763, 1764, and 1765, need to be filled by this

estimate. The calculation is: 326,192 – 3,960 – 93,604 – 162,587 = 66,041; 66,041 / 3 = 22,014

for each of these years.

       Two additional back-projected, prorated interpolation exercises are needed to finish

constructing the data on note removals for the period after 1769. Column (3) of Table 4 reports

the outcome of these exercises, along with the resulting preliminary reconstructed time path of




                                                                                                  19
net new notes removed from the public each year for 1755 into 1775. The amounts of net new

emissions removed in the years 1770 and 1771 are estimated as follows: The difference between

the House of Burgesses treasury account of notes in circulation between 1768 and 1771 is

(127,714 – 88,190) = 39,524£VA. The amount redeemed in 1769 is subtracted to yield (39,524 –

18,442) = 21,082£VA for redemptions in 1770 and 1771. This number is prorated and because

these are for “old” notes only, the amounts of “new” notes directly mentioned as redeemed in the

treasury accounts for these years are added to those sums, i.e. 403£VA for 1771.

       The amounts of net new emissions removed in the years 1772 into 1775 are estimated as

follows: The difference between the House of Burgesses treasury account of “old” notes in

circulation between 1771 and 1772 is (88,190 – 54,391) = 33,799£VA. The implied redemption of

“new” notes in 1772 in paper money act #16 is 2,763£VA (3,166 – 403 redeemed in 1771). These

two numbers are added to get the total redeemed in 1772. I assume that the same amounts were

redeemed in 1773. The same amounts of “new” notes are assumed to be redeemed in 1774 and in

1775. The amount of “old” notes redeemed in 1774 is taken as the remainder of “old” notes after

subtracting out their 1773 redemption, i.e. 54,391 – 33,799 = 20,592£VA. As such, no “old” notes

remain in circulation after 1774, and only “new” notes remained in circulation after 1774.

       Column (3) of Table 4 yields my preliminary estimate of note removals. Subtracting

these numbers from net new emissions actually put into public circulation in column (4) of Table

3 yields my preliminary estimate of the amount of notes actually in public circulation as

displayed in Figure 1. This preliminary estimate is close to what Brock reports. Thus, Brock

must have done some redemption analysis adjustments along the lines done here in columns (1),

(2), and (3) of Table 4, though perhaps not as thoroughly as done here.




                                                                                               20
d. Removal of Notes from Public Circulation: The Final Adjustment

       The estimate of notes removed from public circulation each year in column (3) of Table 4

assumes that notes removed via tax payments did not sit long in the treasury before being

burned. Given that tax payment obligations were relatively constant, a relatively constant amount

of notes should have been removed from public circulation each year. Yet, the numbers in

column (3) of Table 4 show considerable yearly variation. In some years, the amount listed

appears well in excess of that year’s tax obligation. As such, notes redeemed from the public via

tax payments must have sat idle in the treasury for some time before being burned. The language

in the statutory paper money act for emission #11 implies as much (Hening 1969, v. 7, p. 353).

Thus, an additional placement adjustment is needed to account for when notes were likely

removed from public circulation via tax payments.

       The amount of revenue collected each year from taxes imposed by the paper money acts

is not recorded in the primary sources. The paper money acts only state the type of taxes

imposed, the tax rate per tax type, and the years over which each tax was in force. From 1755

through 1769, the taxes imposed by the paper money acts included a poll tax, a land tax, a slave

import duty, and a tobacco export duty. Table 5 reports the tax rate per each of these tax types

per year imposed when consolidated across all paper money acts.

       In 1763, the treasury accounts report the revenue expected that year for each of these

taxes (Kennedy 1907, p. 178). Using the expected revenues per tax type for 1763, given the tax

rates listed in Table 5, the expected tax revenue per tax type for each year from 1755 through

1769 can be cloned. Table 5 provides these cloned expected tax revenues per tax type imposed

by the paper money acts. The raw total across all tax types is reduced by a 7 percent yearly

collection fee. This fee was imposed for the year 1763, and I assume it was the same for other




                                                                                                   21

years. 7 After 1769, poll and land taxes were removed and taxes on carriages and licenses were

added in the paper money acts. The expected revenues generated per tax rate cannot be cloned in

post-1769 years, as was done for the pre-1770 years, because of a lack of similar information in

the treasury accounts after 1769.

         The expected revenues listed in Table 5 are used to adjust the yearly placement of note

removals listed in column (3) of Table 4. Note removals are spread or smoothed over time by

weighting them by expected tax revenues in each year. 8 This adjustment method is applied


7
  I made no effort to adjust expected tax revenues to changes in population, land ownership, and tobacco exports
over time. The treasury accounts when estimating tax revenues made no such adjustments. In addition, the data on
such changes are at best speculative, so no adjustments were attempted.
8
  I made no adjustment for tax arrears. Tax arrears mentioned in the treasury accounts were either minuscule or not
mentioned at all before 1766. Substantial tax arrears were mentioned in the treasury accounts for the years 1766,
1768, 1769, and 1772, but not in the intervening years. As such, tax arrears do not appear to accumulate from year to
year. The tax arrears mentioned in 1768, 1769, and 1772 are not larger than that year’s expected tax revenues. Thus,
I assume that tax arrears are mostly delayed transfers of taxes collected by sheriffs to the central treasury for the
current year. These taxes are assumed to show up shortly after that year’s treasury accounts were recorded in the
Journals of the House of Burgesses. See the sources cited in Table 3.


                                                                                                                  22
separately to three periods, 1757 through 1762, 1763 through 1765, and 1766 through 1769. The

three periods are chosen based on the structure of the surviving treasury accounts. In 1763, the

treasury provided the most thorough accounting of any year, including some accumulative

accounting from 1757 to present (Kennedy 1907, pp. 177-8). Between 1763 and 1766, little

information about what was in the treasury accounts was recorded. In 1766, the treasury accounts

revealed the extent of the John Robinson scandal in the immediately prior years at the treasury,

and a new treasurer took over from 1766 through 1769 (Kennedy 1906a).

       The placement adjustments are made as follows: Total notes burned from 1757 through

1762 in column (3) of Table 4 are divided by the total expected tax revenues from 1757 through

1762 in Table 5, namely 146,655£VA / 189,953£VA = 0.77206. Notes redeemed per year over

these years are estimated by multiplying 0.77206 by the expected tax revenue in that year as

listed in Table 5. Total notes burned from 1763 through 1765 in column (3) of Table 4 are

divided by the total expected tax revenues from 1763 through 1765 in Table 5, namely

66,042£VA / 105,090£VA = 0.62843. Notes redeemed per year over these years are estimated by

multiplying 0.62843 by the expected tax revenue in that year as listed in Table 5. Total notes

burned from 1766 through 1769 in column (3) of Table 4 are divided by the total expected tax

revenues from 1766 through 1769 in Table 5, namely 91,696£VA / 129,154£VA = 0.70997. Notes

redeemed per year over these years are estimated by multiplying 0.70997 by the expected tax

revenue in that year as listed in Table 5. The end result is reported in column (4) of Table 4.

       The exercise above yields an implied division of tax payments into 77 percent being in

notes in 1757 through 1762, 63 percent being in notes in 1763 through 1765, and 71 percent

being in notes in 1766 through 1769, with the balance in each period being in specie or tobacco

monies. This percentage division in what media was used to pay yearly taxes is consistent with,




                                                                                                   23
and so corroborated by, the treasury account statements in 1769 and 1770 about the note-to-

specie division in tax payments (see below).

e. The Resulting Time Path of Notes in Public Circulation

       Table 6 subtracts the estimated net new notes removed from the public from the

estimated net new notes actually put into public circulation to get the time path of notes

remaining in public circulation each year. These amounts are slightly different from the treasury

account statements of the amounts in circulation, because the treasury account statements

specifically refer only to “old” notes in circulation, and because the treasury account statements

calculate notes in circulation by taking total notes ever printed and subtracting total notes ever

burned. To the extent that notes sitting idle in the treasury, never emitted or not yet burned, are

included in this construction, the treasury accounts misstate the amounts in public circulation.

       Alternative assumptions, back-projects, and interpolations are certainly possible, and so

alternative estimates of the amount of notes in public circulation could be plausible. However,

any deviation from that done here would either cause the coherent fabric of the forensically

consistent and interlocking patterns to unravel or require less plausible assumptions. While error

variance exists in these estimates, it is relatively small given the limited range of plausible

alternative assumption and estimation methods that maintain an overall forensic coherence.

                                    Denominational Structure

       Were Virginia’s notes used as a circulating medium of exchange? The denominational

structure is consistent with such usage. Virginia’s notes were issued in relatively small

denominations, small enough to make paying yearly tax assessments easy with said notes, and

small enough to make it an easy domestic circulating medium of exchange in terms of being able

to make change with said notes. For emissions #6, #8, #9, #11, #12, and #13 the denominational




                                                                                                      24

  These are statements about the amount of notes in circulation in the treasury accounts as reported in the Journal of
the House of Burgesses or by the treasurer Robert Carter Nicholas in letters. These statements explicitly refer only to
“old” note, i.e. those emitted before 1769, and not to “new” notes, i.e. those emitted after 1768. These statements
were also made early in the year and relied on information on notes burned that were received in taxes from late in
the previous year. Thus, the year for these numbers is moved one forward from when reported to reflect when notes
were actually taxed out of circulation, rather than when they were subsequently burned.

       Comparing Table 7 with the yearly tax burdens imposed in Table 5 indicates that well

over 50 percent of the units emitted were in a denomination small enough to pay an individual’s

yearly taxes without the necessity of resorting to tobacco or specie monies to make change to

complete that year’s tax payment. Table 7 also is consistent with John Hanson II’s (1979, 1980a,

1980b) argument that the colonies intentionally issued paper money in small denominations to

facilitate the making of change in local transactions. Hanson (1979, p. 284), however, only

reports the denominational structure of Virginia’s paper money using data from 1759. He also

lists no source for this data. Hanson (1980a, p. 414; 1980b, p. 171) dropped Virginia data from

his analysis. Why is unknown. Table 7 is certainly consistent with the denominational structure

Hanson reports for the other colonies.

                             How the Redemption Process Worked

       Every paper money act included additional new taxes, typically a land tax and a poll tax,

that were operative for a number of years. The number of years over which these new additional

taxes were operative was chosen so as to generate enough funds to fully redeem the notes

authorized by each respective paper money act. The date in each paper money act set for the final

redemption of the notes authorized by that act closely matched the end to the taxing period set by

that act. The final legislated redemption date for each emission is listed in Table 2.

       The Virginia legislature took note redemption and its effect on controlling the value of its

paper money seriously. Such is illustrated in the March 1760 paper money act which stated,

                And whereas it is of the greatest importance to preserve the credit of the paper
       currency of this colony, and nothing can contribute more to that end than a due care to
       satisfy the publick that the paper bills of credit, or treasury-notes, are properly sunk,
       according to the true intent and meaning of the several acts of assembly passed for
       emitting the same; and the establishing a regular method for this purpose may prevent
       difficulties and confusion in settling the publick accounts,… Be it therefore enacted, by

                                                                                                   27
       the authority aforesaid, That Peyton Randolph, esquire, Robert Carter Nicholas,
       Benjamin Waller, Lewis Burwell and George Wythe, gentleman, or any three of them,
       be, and they are hereby appointed a committee, to examine at least twice in every year
       (and oftener, if thereto desired by the treasurer for the time being) all such bills of credit,
       or treasury-notes, redeemable on the first day of March, one thousand seven hundred and
       sixty five, as have been or shall be paid into the treasury, in discharge of the duties and
       taxes imposed by any former act of assembly; and upon receipt of the said bills or notes,
       the said committee shall give to the treasurer for the time being a certificate of the
       amount thereof, which shall avail the said treasurer in the settlements of his accounts as
       effectually, at all intents and purposes, as if he produced the said bills or notes
       themselves: And the said committee are hereby required and directed, so soon as they
       have given such certificate, to cause all such bills or notes to be burnt and destroyed.
       (Hening 1969, v. 7, p. 353, italics in the original)

       If the taxes accompanying a paper money act were paid in that act’s notes then the

amount of the notes from that emission in circulation would decline at a more or less constant

rate from its initial emission year to its final legislated redemption year. If these taxes were paid

by other means, such as in tobacco or specie coins, then the notes would continue in circulation

until the final legislated redemption year when they could be redeemed at face value and

removed from circulation using the accumulated tax receipts in the treasury. The language in the

1756 paper money acts illustrates this redemption structure.

       That all such notes, so issued, shall be redeemable on the last day of June one thousand
       seven hundred and sixty, and shall then be paid by the treasurer… That the several sums
       of money and tobacco to be collected, by virtue of this act,…shall be,…paid to John
       Robinson, esquire, treasurer of this colony,… That the money to be raised by the duties
       imposed by this act, shall stand, be, and remain as a security for the redemption of the
       said treasurer notes so to be issued, and the said John Robinson, treasurer,…is hereby
       required to apply all such money, as shall come to his hands, by virtue of this act, for, and
       toward the redemption of such treasury notes, and to no other use or purpose whatsoever.
       (Hening 1969, v. 7, pp. 19, 29, 32).

All of Virginia’s paper money acts had this language. By “money”, colonists typically meant

specie monies, sometimes referred to as real money. The face value of the notes for redemption

purposes was fixed in law to be 1£VA = 200 pounds of tobacco = 1.25£S [£VA = Virginia paper

pounds, £S = pounds sterling] (Hening 1969, v. 6, pp. 468-9, 568-9; v. 7, pp. 9-10, 28-9).



                                                                                                    28
       Were redemption taxes paid in notes or in specie? The treasury accounts provide some

evidence to answer this question. The clearest statement in the treasury accounts was made on 15

June 1770 (Kennedy 1906b, p. 72, italics in the original).

               It appears to your Committee, that the Balance in the Treasurer’s Hands of Cash
       received of the several Collectors for Taxes appropriated to the Redemption of the old
       Treasury Notes [those issued before 1769], amount to Ten Thousand Three Hundred and
       Twenty-six Pounds Eleven Shillings, of which they have burnt and destroyed Seven
       Thousand Eight hundred Pounds, and have left in the Treasury, on that Account, in
       Specie, a Balance of Two Thousand Five Hundred and Twenty-six Pounds Eleven
       Shillings to be exchanged for old Treasury Notes.

A redemption tax of 10,327£VA was collected, of which 2,527£VA was in specie that was

explicitly set aside in a dedicated account to be used to redeem notes brought to the treasury. The

rest of the tax payments were burnt, implying that those tax payments were made in notes.

Therefore, 76 percent of this tax was paid in notes, and 24 percent was paid in specie.

       The above statement sets an interpretative standard for similar statements in the treasury

accounts that are not as direct. In particular, redemption taxes received that were burnt must have

been paid in notes, and redemption taxes received but not burnt must have been paid in specie.

These tax sums in specie must have been held in a separate account and earmarked to redeem

notes brought to the treasury that had reached their final legislated redemption date.

       Applying this interpretative standard indicates that of the 12,642£VA redemption taxes

received on 30 November 1769, 10,642£VA were paid in notes that were burned, leaving

2,000£VA paid in specie (Kennedy 1906a, p. 303). Therefore, 84 percent of this tax was paid in

notes, and 16 percent was paid in specie. The treasury account of 23 November 1769, regarding

the prior year, indicates that of the 42,067£VA redemption taxes collected, 29,264£VA were paid in

notes that were burned, leaving 12,800£VA paid in specie (Kennedy 1906a, p. 284). Therefore, 70

percent of this tax was paid in notes, and 30 percent was paid in specie.



                                                                                                 29
       The above analysis establishes that redemption taxes generated specie sums that were to

be held in the treasury until the final redemption date legislated for each paper money act, at

which time holders of those notes could cash them in at face value for the specie held in the

treasury for that purpose. However, at the final redemption date holders of the respective notes

did not rush to the treasury to exchange them for specie. The notes continued in circulation and

note holders could cash them in at the treasury at their leisure. Robert Nicholas Carter, Virginia

treasurer after 1766, noted this behavior, “Most of the Merchants as well as others, … preferred

them [Virginia’s treasury notes] either to Gold or Silver, as being more convenient for

transacting the internal Business of the Country.” (William and Mary College Quarterly

Historical Magazine 1912, p. 235)

       Table 8 illustrates this behavior for emission #5, the only emission that is uniquely

specified throughout the treasury accounts. While the taxes to redeem all of emission #5 appear

to have been fully paid at the end of 1757 as legislatively required, 54 percent of that payment

was in specie or tobacco monies. That sum sat in the treasury in a dedicated account and was

used to redeem emission #5 notes brought into the treasury slowly over the next nine years. What

happened to the last remaining 305£VA in specie or tobacco monies in this account after 1766 is

unknown. The treasury accounts speculate that the public likely lost some notes, thus accounting

for the lack of full redemption. A note loss rate of 2.5 percent would not be unthinkable. The

total amount of notes of emission #5 redeemed by 1766 was 11,695£VA which corroborates that

emission #5 was for 12,000£VA rather than for 10,000£VA as stated by statutory law, see Table 2.

4 are subtracted from the expected net tax revenues collected each year in Table 5 to get the

amount of specie and tobacco monies paid into the treasury each year. These amounts

accumulated in the treasury from year to year to 1766.

        The numbers for 1767 through 1772 are taken from the treasury accounts for these years.

They were stated as the sums remaining on hand. They are assumed to be what is on hand for



                                                                                                                31
potential current note redemption. Therefore, these numbers are not added or accumulated from

year to year. When stated early in the year, they are placed in the prior year to reflect when the

action was actually executed.

       The numbers for 1773 into 1775 are projected estimates based on the last treasury

account from 1772. The estimate takes the taxes received for “old” notes in 1772, adjusted for a

downward trend from 1769, and adds to that the taxes received for “new” notes. I assume the

specie portion of these taxes was 20 percent. Thus, the total tax number is multiplied by 0.2 to

get the specie funds available in the treasury for note redemption. These numbers are not added

or accumulated over time as I assume that these sums were being used to redeem notes. This

assumption is consistent with the fact that more notes were being redeemed and burned in these

years than there were notes paid in as taxes. This estimate of the specie (or tobacco) monies

accumulating in the treasury, which were to be used for future note redemption, provides an

important correction to the history of the John Robinson treasury scandal.

                            Reassessing the John Robinson Scandal

       John Robinson was the speaker of the House of Burgesses and treasurer of the colony

from 1738 until his death 11 May 1766. The last years of his administration involved a financial

scandal that occupied Virginia’s political and legal system for a half decade. It led to the

separation of the office of speaker of the House of Burgesses from the office of treasurer. The

scandal involved the diversion of funds out of the treasury, without direct authorization from the

legislature, into loans to Robinson’s friends. The accounting made on 12 December 1766

indicates that Robinson diverted out of the treasury 95,828£VA in accumulated taxes received that

were earmarked to redeem notes, 2,500£VA in notes in a fund reserved for the Commissioner on

Indian Affairs, and 3,389£VA “on the public account”, for a total of 101,717£VA (Ernst 1973, pp.



                                                                                                     32
174-96; Kennedy 1906a, pp. x-xxvi, 64-6; Mays 1952, pp. 174-208; Mays 1967, pp. 24-74).

       Were the funds diverted notes or specie? Scholars have typically assumed these diverted

funds were notes put back in circulation (Ernst 1973, pp. 188-96; Kennedy 1906a, p. x; Lee

1825, p. 22; Mays 1952, pp. 185-6). As such, this diversion could affect the amount of notes in

circulation, and thus note depreciation. This claim, however, turns out to be presumption based

on questionable logic. For example, Mays (1952, pp. 185-6) assumes that the diverted funds

were notes because he assumes there was no specie in the colony. Therefore, all taxes must have

been paid in notes. As shown above, the treasury accounts indicate that 16 to 30 percent of note-

redemption taxes were paid in specie. As such, a considerable accumulation of specie funds in

the treasury earmarked for future note redemption must have been occurring before 1766.

       Ernst (1973, pp. 188-9) quotes Robert Carter Nicholas, the incoming treasurer after

Robinson and an ardent anti-paper proponent, regarding the fund-diversion crisis that money

“squeezed from the people for their taxes instead of being sunk at our Treasury as it ought to

have been, was thrown back into circulation.” Even in this quote, it is unclear whether Nicholas

means notes or specie being thrown back into circulation—though Ernst assumes it meant notes.

Ernst points out that Nicholas’s conclusion was a deduction, not an observation. Nicholas

reasoned that the only thing that could cause the exchange rate to deteriorate was too much paper

money in circulation. Therefore, the diverted funds must have been notes put back in circulation.

Ernst (1973, p. 189) concluded that “In Nicholas’s mind at least the theory of money had plainly

triumphed over reality,…” The exchange rate could have deteriorated just as easily due to the

prospect of the non-redemption of notes due to the division of specie funds earmarked for note

redemption out of the treasury. Yet, Ernst (1973, pp. 193-5) seems to accept that the diverted

funds were notes even though he cannot square that conclusion with his finding that the notes in



                                                                                                  33
circulation were not expanding, but were instead sharply contracting at that time.

       No direct evidence from the period exists stating that these diverted funds were notes,

except for the 2,500£VA in notes in a fund reserved for the Commissioner on Indian Affairs. A

close reading of the primary sources and the secondary sources indicates that no one ever really

says in what money the diverted funds were denominated. Ernst (1973, pp. 174-96) never quite

commits to or directly says in what money the diverted funds were denominated, though a less

than careful reading could induce a leap to the conclusion that it was notes. In the letters of

Edmund Pendleton, the executor of John Robinson’s estate, no mention is ever made that the

diverted funds were notes (Mays 1967). In the treasury accounts no mention is made in what

money the diverted funds were denominated. In the primary evidence offered by Kennedy

(1906a, pp. x-xxvi) no mention is made in what money the diverted funds were denominated.

       The only direct statement that the diverted funds were notes, that I could find, is in the

Memoir of the Life of Richard Henry Lee (Lee 1825, p. 22), “…he [John Robinson] had been

induced to lend to many members of the House of Burgesses, the government bills which had

been redeemed, and ought to have been destroyed.” This statement was written in 1825 by

Richard Henry Lee’s grandson. It is not a memoir penned by Richard Henry Lee himself, nor is

the above statement in the memoir ascribed to anyone. Its source is unknown. The hypothesis

that it is just a long-after-the-fact supposition by a grandson cannot be rejected.

       The last meaningful treasury account in the Journals of the House of Burgesses before

Robinson’s death was in May of 1763. It is fairly comprehensive (Kennedy 1907, pp. 177-8).

The treasury account of May 1763 indicates that sizable amounts of notes from emissions #6

through #12 were being paid in taxes and were burned in each year from 1760 into early 1763

(Kennedy 1907, pp. 177-8; Table 4). The treasury account was silent on the specie portion of the



                                                                                                    34
taxes collected—both on how much had accumulated and where it was. Notes received in tax

payments before their end maturity were being burned, and in significant amounts. It is

information on the specie portion of the tax payments that is missing.

       The next treasury report, the last before Robinson’s death, was in May of 1765. It is

relatively sketchy. That report lists 47,418£VA on hand in the treasury for note redemption

(Kennedy 1907, p. 356). Table 8 indicates that at least 81,012£VA should have accumulated in the

treasury by the start of 1765 for that purpose. The estimation procedure here, therefore, is

consistent with at least 33,594£VA having already been diverted out of the treasury by Robinson

by early 1765.

       The estimated specie portion of the accumulated taxes in the treasury from taxes imposed

by the paper money acts into 1766 were 98,828£VA, see Table 8. By early 1766, Robinson had

removed from the treasury 95,828£VA of accumulated taxes held for redemption of notes when

said notes’ circulation time was at an end, see Table 2. In 1766, it was recorded that only

2,218£VA was left in the treasury to pass on to the new treasurer after Robinson death (a sum to

be used to redeem notes, thus this amount is assumed to be specie as notes could not redeem

notes). The closeness of the 95,828£VA figure with what would have accumulated in the treasury

into 1766, namely (98,855£VA – 2,218£VA) = 96,637£VA, provides consistency for this

interpretation. This consistency also indicates that the error variances in my data estimation

procedures are small across the totality of the forensic data reconstruction project here.

       Finally, a fund diversion of 95,828£VA in notes cannot be made consistent with any of the

statements in the later treasury accounts, those made after Robinson’s death, regarding total

notes in circulation. The only way they could be made consistent would be if there existed an

unprecedented, massive, un-documented, and uncommented on redemption of notes in the early



                                                                                                   35
to mid-1760s in excess of that already mentioned in the treasury accounts. This inconsistency, in

a forensic accounting sense, implies that the funds diverted were unlikely to be notes. Lastly,

both Brock (1992, p. 116) and Ernst (1972, p. 370) must have implicitly or unknowingly

assumed that the diverted funds were specie and not notes. The forensic accounting

reconstruction of how they derived the amount of notes in circulation cannot yield their

outcomes unless the assumption is made that the diverted funds were not notes.

                                             Conclusion

       I provide major improvements in the quantitative data on colonial Virginia’s paper

money regime. These improved data will assist scholars in crafting their political, social, and

economic narratives of the period, as well as assist economists in testing models of colonial

paper money performance. I thoroughly explicate how these quantitative data are created,

providing a methodological guide to understanding their soundness and fragility. If my data are

rejected, then the data on colonial Virginia paper money currently in use (taken from the

Historical Statistics) must also be rejected, for their construction is similar, if not as thorough, as

that shown here for my data. Scholars of colonial America should know how colonial

quantitative data are created. It should not remain a mystery.
