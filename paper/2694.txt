        TIME-VARYING RISK PERCEPTIONS AND THE PRICING OF RISKY ASSETS


                                  ABSTRACT



     Empirical results based on two different statistical approaches lead to
several conclusions about the role of time-varying asset risk assessments in
accounting for what, on the basis of many earlier studies, appear to be
time-varying differentials in ex ante asset returns. First, both methods
indicate sizeable changes over time in variance-covariance structures
conditional on past information. These changing conditional
variance-covariance structures in turn imply sizeable changes over time in
asset demand behavior, and hence in the market-clearing equilibrium structure
of ex ante asset returns.

     Second, at least for some values of the parameter indicating how rapidly
investors discount the information contained in past observations, the implied
ex ante excess returns bear non-negligible correlation to observed ex post
excess returns on either debt or equity. The percentage of the variation of ex
post excess returns explained by the implied time-varying ex ante excess
returns is comparable to values to which previous researchers have interpreted
as warranting rejection of the hypothesis that risk premia are constant over
time.

     Third, although for long-term debt the two statistical methods used here
give sharply different answers to the question of how much relevance market
participants associate with past observations in assessing future risks, for
equities both methods agree in indicating extremely rapid discounting of more
distant observations - - so much so that in neither case do outcomes more than a
year in the past matter much at all. While the paper's other conclusions are
plausible enough, the finding of such an extremely short "memory" on the part
of equity investors suggests that the standard representation of equity risk by
a single normally distributed disturbance is overly restrictive.

    The past two decades of empirical research on asset pricing, including

studies of the term structure of interest rates in the monetary economics

literature as well as studies of the market for corporate equities in the

finance literature, have now provided a large body of evidence indicating a

prominent role for time-varying risk premia in expected asset returns)

Part of this evidence consists of the repeated rejection of the hypothesis

of equal ex ante returns on different classes of securities. Another part

consists of the repeated rejection of the hypothesis that whatever

differences exist between the ex ante returns on different classes of

securities remain constant over time.

     Despite the tenacity of many researchers' apparent dedication to these

respective rejected null hypotheses, there is nothing startling a priori in

the finding of risk premia that not only assume non-zero values but also

vary over time. Unless the market for the assets in question is dominated

by risk-neutral investors controlling large pools of capital (who are they?

where does their capital come from?),2 most standard theories of asset

pricing imply that assets with different risk properties will bear

different ex ante returns. Moreo'ier, these same asset pricing theories

also immediately suggest a variety of circumstances --   familiar   examples

include changing investor perceptions of asset risks, changing outstanding

supplies of outside assets, and utility exhibiting non-constant risk

aversion --   under which the ex ante return differentials that they imply

will vary over time.3 Indeed, only under specific assumptions ruling out

these and other potential sources of change do standard risk-based asset
pricing models imply ex ante return differentials that are constant at any

non-zero level,

     Each of the known major potential explanations for the variation of

asset risk premia over time has attracted at least some attention.

Increasingly, however, attention has focused on the possible role of

changing investor risk perceptions. The most plausible reason for this

emphasis is the finding, in studies reporting time-varying ex ante return

differentials, that the differentials they have identified typically move

about in a fairly volatile way over a short period of time. The mix of

outstanding outside asset supplies changes both too slowly and too smoothly

to account for this phenomenon. So do the factors governing the prevailing

level of market-wide risk aversion in most models. By contrast, at least

in principle the risks that investors associate with holding various assets

may change quite quickly, either because the underlying probabilities have

actually changed in some objective sense, or because investors' perceptions

have changed independently, or both.

     Because investors' risk perceptions are unobservable, for purposes of

empirical research it is necessary to place some discipline on the presumed

structure of risk - -   either   at a single point in time or as it varies

through time -- used to infer ex ante asset return relationships. In the

context of variations over time, the usual source of this discipline is

some connection to the previously observed variation of actual asset

returns. Modigliani and Shiller (1972), for example, used a moving-average

standard deviation of observed short-term interest rates as an explanatory

variable in an equation for the spread between long- and short-term

interest rates.4 Similarly, Friedman (1980) and Roley (1982) used
                                         3

moving-average variances of interest rates and equity prices as explanatory

variables in equations for the demands for specific financial assets by

different categories of individual or institutional investors. More

recently, Friedman (1985) used a moving-sample vector autoregression to

estimate the ex ante variance-covariance structure of U.S. asset returns,

quarter by quarter over a period of years, and Bollerslev et al. (1988)

used a generalization of Engel's (1982) autoregressive conditional

heteroskedasticity method to estimate a time-varying ex ante

variance-covariance structure and also use that structure in explaining the

variation over time of observed U.S. asset return differentials.

      The object of this paper is to explore how the variation of observed

(ex post) asset returns affects investors' assessments of (ex ante) asset

risks, and therefore how this variation in turn affects asset demand

behavior and consequently the equilibrium structure of asset prices. To

carry out this analysis, the paper relies on the respective estimates of

the time-varying variance-covariance structure of ex ante asset returns

delivered by a generalization of the vector autoregression (VAR) approach

 and by the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity

 (GARCH) approach. As in both Friedman (1985) and Bollerslev et al. (1988),

 the analysis here focuses on thre& broad classes of assets traded in the

U.S. financial markets --   short-term   debt, long-term debt, and equity - -

 and applies the standard one-period capital asset pricing model as the

 simplest plausible framework within which to exploit and compare these two

 empirical approaches.5

      From the perspective of any one point in time, both the VAR     and   the


 ARCH methods are ways of inferring investors' perceptions of these assets'
                                      4

risk properties from the observed variation of their ex post returns up

until then. In addition, both are ways of constraining the movement of

these inferred perceptions from one point in time to the next. Hence each

method disciplines the inference of asset risk perceptions not only by

(explicitly) tying them to observed return data but also by (implicitly)

imposing certain smoothness properties. Nevertheless, the estimates of ex

ante asset risks that the two methods deliver, and hence their respective

implications for asset demand behavior and for equilibrium asset prices,

need not be identical, or even similar. Comparing the different results

given by these two approaches is therefore a further object of interest

throughout the paper.

     Section I briefly sets out the respective mechanics of the VAR and

CARCH methods as applied to the estimation of ex ante asset risk, and makes

explicit the parallels and differences between them. Section II compares

the results of applying these two methods to infer the ex ante risk

associated with returns on long-term debt and equity in the United States.

Section III draws the implications of these respective results for

investors' portfolio behavior over time. Section IV shows what these

results for investors' portfolio behavior imply in turn for the market-

clearing structure of equilibrium asset returns. Section V summarizes the

paper's principal conclusions, and indicates a specific direction that they

suggest for future research.

1.     The Generalized VAR and GARCH Methods

       Most theories of the pricing of financial assets assign a central role

to perceptions, in the minds of the investors who hold the assets, of the

risks associated with holding them.6 For example, under the simplest

version of the single-period capital asset pricing model, in which each

investor takes asset returns to be joint normally distributed and maximizes

a utility function characterized by constant relative risk aversion, the

investor's set of asset demands at any time t is of the linear homogeneous

form7


(1)         taBt(!+P +ir

where a is a vector of portfolio proportions (summing to one) ,    e is    a

vector of expected returns corresponding to the assets in , is a vector

of proportions (also summing to one) describing the minimum-variance

portfolio, and B is a matrix (with each column summing to zero) showing to

what extent the investor will choose a portfolio different from       in

response to incentives provided by non-uniform expected returns. Both B

and     depend directly on the variance-covariance structure associated with

re      If none of the available assets is riskless -- as is plausible in most

macroeconomic contexts, in which Cnvestors' utility depends on real

variables, and inflation is stochastic --      then B and   are of the form



               —         — (1'01!)1         v
 (2)

                 — (!"'P1 —l
                                      6

where ) is the relevant variance-covariance matrix, and (for sufficiently

small time periods to make the underlying expansion approximately correct)

p is the coefficient of relative risk aversion. Alternatively, if one

asset is riskiess, the minimum-variance portfolio consists only of it, and

the expression equivalent to (1) then gives the demands for the risky

assets only as a function of the expected excess returns on the risky

assets over whatever certain return the risk-free asset provides, with



(3)       B —


and    equal to a vector of zeroes, where ,   B   and ) are now defined for the

sub-vector of risky assets only.

      The crux of the matter for empirical applications of such theories, of

course, is that the ex ante variance-covariance matrix ( is unobservable.

Moreover, when stochastic asset returns vary systematically over time, the

unconditional variance-covariance matrix computed over any specific sample

probably overstates the degree of uncertainty perceived by investors who

possess information about that systematic movement.8 What matters for

investors' asset demands, ai. hence for market-determined asset prices, is

instead the variartce-covariance structure conditional on whatever relevant

information investors have.

      Serial correlation is hardly the only kind of systematic variation

that causes sample unconditional variance-covariance matrices to overstate

the risks perceived by investors, but it is surely the most obvious kind.

For an investment horizon of one calendar quarter, for example, the 91-day

U.S. Treasury bill is risky only because inflation is uncertain. But the

quarterly time series of price inflation in most countries is highly
                                           7


serially correlated. Over the 1960-85 sample used as the basis of the

results presented below, the first-order serial correlation of the U.S.

consumer price index was 0.75. Hence an investor who wants to forecast the

real return to holding Treasury bills over the coming quarter, and who

knows the most recent value of the inflation rate, can typically do much

better than simply to subtract from the observed nominal interest rate the

sample mean of 5.24%, and associate with this forecast the sample standard

deviation of 3.92%.

      The VAR Approach. The VAR method exploited in Friedman (1985)

represents investors as taking account of generalized serial correlation in

forming their asset return expectations by estimating, for each time period

t, a vector autoregression of the form9


(4)            —   r(LIt—l)r        +
                                1



where   r is a vector of realized asset returns corresponding to expectations

f r(Lt-l)      is a matrix of polynomials in the lag operator estimated using

observations on       up through (but not beyond) period t-l, and j   is   a vector

of disturbances. After period t elapses, investors incorporate the new

observation of       into the sample, re-estimate (4), and use the updated

model to project x     for   period t+l.

        For each time period t, (4) gives a conditional expectation e In

addition, because (4) gives the estimated values of the disturbances .j        for
each period up through t-1, it also gives the associated conditional

variance-covariance structure



(5)            —
                                              8

Given this time-specific estimate of L), the minimum-variance portfolio and

asset substitutability matrix describing investors' asset demands in

period t follow from (1) -       (3),   or from any richer (perhaps interternporal)

model of portfolio behavior.

       An intuitively helpful interpretation of the VAR method, therefore --

at    least from the perspective of this paper's focus on time-varying asset

return differentials --     is   that it is a way of estimating the conditional

variance-covariance structure at any time, as a function of past "surprise"

(that is, nonsystematic) movements of realized returns. In particular, it

allows the conditional variance-covariance structure to change over time as

new observations of asset returns, and hence new estimates of the

corresponding "surprises," become available.

        A question that immediately arises in such a context is whether

investors treat more distant observations as if they have the same

information content, for this purpose, as more recent ones. Friedman

(1985) experimented with an expanding-sample method in which the estimation

of (4) uses all observations after a specific initial period, as well as a

rolling-sample method in which each new observation takes the place of the

most distant one (so that the sample size remains unchanged). A more

general way to allow more distant bservations to "matter" less than more

recent ones -• and, to anticipate, a way that is consistent with the

application of the GARCH method by Bollerslev et al. -         - is   to relate the

conditional varjance-covariance structure to the estimated past

disturbances according to

"memory" parameter determining the relative weight placed on more distant

available information.

        The GARCH ADyroach. The GARCH method applied by Bollerslev et al.

(1988) is an alternative way of constructing time-varying estimates of CL

Specifically, the GARCH method directly models the respective elements of

at time t    as   a vector ARMA process, according to

where      for any period is the estimated vector of unexpected components of

asset returns (       - e).            k—1,...,n, and &, k—I      m, are matrices

of coefficients to be estimated; and the vech operator stacks the lower

triangular portion (that is, the unique elements) of a symmetric matrix.

In the terminology of Engle (1982) and Kraft and Engle (1983), (7) is a

GARCH(n,m) process.
                                             10

        That the 0, W and        matrices consist of freely estimated coefficients

in principle allows an extremely flexible pattern of both contemporaneous

and intertemporal dependence among the elements of U, with each element

dependent in general on all elements of U and j.' from prior periods.

Because the model in this general form requires estimation of

(p(p+l)/2)(l + (m+n)p(p+l)/2) parameters (where p is the number           of
equations),     however, both Engel (1982) and Bollerslev et al. (1988)

constrained the       and       matrices to be diagonal, so that the ij-th element

of U depends only on the respective ij-th elements of U and j' from prior

periods. This constraint reduces the number of parameters to be estimated

to    (l+m+n)p(p+l)/2.
       Like   the VAR method, the GARCH method can also be interpreted as a way

of estimating the conditional variance-covariance structure at any time as

a function of past "surprise" movements of returns. Furthermore, the

GARCH(l,1) specification used both in Bollerslev et al. and in the analysis

presented in this paper directly is analogous to (6) in relating each

period's U to past estimated "surprises" according to a pattern of

geometrically declining weights, since with n—rn—i (7) reduces to

       Despite the strong correspondence, there are also several key

differences between the two approaches - -        as   will be apparent in the
                                              11

results presented below. The difference that is most immediately apparent
                                                                         A
from comparing (6) and (9) is that the VAR method constrains (1 to be
                                     AA
homogeneous of degree one in past jj'         while    the GARCH method does not. In

other words, the VAR method as applied here not only constrains the weights

in the function relating 0 and j.'       to   sum to unity, but also excludes a

constant term, while the GARCH method does neither. An additional

difference is that the GARCH method implicitly delivers an internal

estimate of the memory parameter ,        while      in the VAR method it is necessary

to specify    a priori.

       In conjunction with some model like (1) -          (3),   solved out to deliver

asset return expectations e for each time period, and hence facilitating

calculation of the estimated error vector i,            the GARCH method in the form

(7) also generates a time series of estimates of the conditional variance-

covariance structure 0, and hence the implied asset demand behavior, for

each period. The specific form of the model used by Bollerslev et al., and

reproduced below, applies the single-period capital asset pricing model

with a risk-free asset to express the expected returns on all risky assets

in the excess return form

                                     -




where rf is the return (taken to be exogenous and known with certainty

ex ante) on the risk-free asset, aS       is       a vector stating the respective

shares of the risky assets in total portfolio wealth (also taken to be

exogenous and known with certainty ex ante), and the risk aversion

parameter p is here a coefficient to be estimated.11 An alternative

procedure, which avoids the assumption of a risk-free asset, would be to
                                              12

use some independent process (an autoregressive model, for example) to

generate expected inflation, subtract this expectation from the stated

nominal return to calculate the expected short-term debt return r, and

then use (I) -    (3)       to express the expected returns on all other assets (the

vector i) as

where the conditional variance-covariance matrix                and supply vector

likewise refer only to assets other than short-term debt. Either (10) or

(11) generates ex ante asset returns               for each period and hence permits

calculating for each period the estimated ex post "surprises"              and, in

turn, the conditional variance-covariance structure              for the next period.

Given ),   the   asset substitutability matrix and (if there is no risk-free

asset) the minimum-variance portfolio again follow from (1) -            (3).

II. Estimated Time-Varying Risk Structures

    Table 1 summarizes the basic features of the after-tax quarterly ex

post returns on long-term debt and equity, stated in each case in the form

of excess returns over the corresponding return on short-term debt, based

on quarterly U.S. data for l96O85.12 The pre-tax data are for the last

day of each quarter, from Ibbotson and Sinquefield (1982, and subsequent

updates). For each asset the corresponding after-tax return is calculated

by applying the U.S household sector's average effective marginal tax rates

in each year for interest, dividends, and capital gains to the

corresponding respective components of the pre-tax returnsJ3

     The sample means, shown in Table 1 in decimals at annual rates,

indicate positive excess returns for both risky assetsJ4 Not

surprisingly, the unconditional sample variance-covariance matrix indicates

a larger excess return variance for equity than for long-term debt, by a

factor of somewhat less than two. Although the two respective excess

returns exhibit quite different p case there is sufficient serial

correlation to warrant the supposition that investors who use available

information efficiently take account of it in forming their expectations.

     VAR Results. Table 2 and Figures 1 and 2 show the results of applying

the VAR method to estimate the quarter-by-quarter variation in the ex ante

risk structure of these two excess returns. This procedure as applied here

involves the estimation of a separate bivariate autoregression of form (4),

in which the two stochastic variables are the two excess returns, for each

of the 104 quarters in the 1960-85 sample. The procedure begins by using

data spanning 1954:1 -   l959:IV   in the autoregression that generates U for

1960:1, continues by adding one quarter's data at a time, and concludes by

using data spanning 1954:1 - 1985:111 in the autoregression that generates

() for 1985:IV. Each autoregression includes L — 1,       .   . .4 for both variables,

and also includes a constant term.

      Following the discussion in Section I, a key issue in the application

of any such backward-looking procedure to represent investors' perceptions

about the likely distributions of future outcomes, is what part of the

available past history people deem relevant and therefore use in forming

these perceptions. The results summarized in the top row of Table 2 and in

Figure 1 are based on a value of unity for the memory parameter , so that,

as time passes, investors continue to regard as equally relevant all

observations during the entire post-Korean War and post-Treasury/Federal

Reserve Accord era. The top row of Table 2 summarizes the performance of

the resulting bivariate vector autoregression (it makes no sense to show

statistics for 104 pairs of regressions individually) by showing the mean

of the estimated conditional variance-covariance matrices. Comparison with

the sample conditional variance-covariance matrix shown in Table 1

indicates that, on average, allowing for serial correlation via the VAR

method removes more than two-thirds of the variance of the excess return on

long-term debt, but less than one-fourth of the variance of the excess

return on equity.15

        The three panels of Figure 1 plot the quarter-by-quarter values of

the three elements of the resulting conditional variance-covariance matrix.

Given the assumption that the entire past history (since 1954:1) continues
                                                A
to   be fully relevant, the variation of these 0. .      elements over time
                                                    tJ

reflects a combination of investors' growing amount of information (that

is, growing effective sample size) and their reaction to specific
                                         15

"surprise" episodes involving large ex post expectation errors. More

information implies smaller variances and covariance, while the immediate

effect of "surprises" is just the opposite. Prominent examples of

"surprises" that have readily visible effects on the         values plotted in

Figure 1 include the stock market crash in 1962, the "credit crunch" in

1966, the Penn Central default in 1970, the combination of OPEC and tight

monetary policy in 1974, and the introduction of new monetary policy

procedures in 1979. On balance, the effect of these and other "surprises"

more than outweighs the effect due to the accumulation of additional

observations, so that over time both conditional variances tend to increase

(as does the conditional covariance, which also changes sign).

     Alternatively, if investors do not continue to regard the entire post-

1953 experience as fully relevant to future outcomes as time passes, the

results shown in Figure 1 and summarized in the top row of Table 2 are

based on an (ever increasing) overstatement of the information base behind

the formation of investors' expectations. The remaining rows of Table 2

show analogous mean estimated conditional variance-covariance matrices

based on a range of less-than-unit values for S. As is to be expected, in

light of the sharp increase in the volatility of long-term interest rates

that has occurred during the latter part of the 1960-85 period, limiting

the estimation procedure's "average memory" in this way sharply increases

the mean estimated conditional variance associated with the ex ante excess

return on long-term debt. At —       0.9,   for example, the mean     is already

more than twice the value reported in the first row for —l. The effect on

the mean EE is analogous, though less pronounced. Even for          values of

0.5 and smaller, however --   that   is, even for memory that decays so rapidly
                                                   16

as to place practically negligible reliance on observations more than one

year in the past -     - all    three elements of the mean estimated conditional

variance-covariance matrix are still distinctly smaller than the

corresponding unconditional variances and covariance shown in Table 1.

     Figure 2 --       in    which the vertical scale of each panel is far larger

than in Figure 1 - -        further   indicates the effects of discounting past

observations in the VAR procedure by plotting the quarter-by-quarter values

of the three elements of the conditional variance-covariance matrix

estimated for        — 0.7 and        —   0.3   as dashed and dotted lines, respectively.

Comparing these two sets of results to one another, and both to the results

for 4 —    I   shown in Figure 1, indicates that discounting past observations

in this manner greatly enhances the inferred impact of the major "surprise"

episodes in increasing the estimated conditional variances (and

covariance). As is to be expected, discounting past observations also

results in a rapid decline of these estimated conditional £. . elements
                                                                         ii
after the "surprise" has occurred.

     GARCFI Results. Tables 3 and 4, together with the solid lines in

Figure 2, show the results of applying the GARCH (actually, "GARCH-M" for a

GARCH model in which the conditional mean vector depends on the conditional

variance-covariance matrix) procedure to the same problem of estimating the

quarter-to-quarter variation in the ex ante risk structure of the two

excess returns. This procedure as applied here involves the joint
                                                                              A

equation of form (10) includes a constant term (although the relevant

theory does not indicate any role for an ex ante return differential not

related to risk).

     Table 3 gives the estimated value and corresponding t-statistic for

each of the model's twelve coefficients. Within the CARCH process, two of

the three (diagonal) elements of the constant matrix S in (7) are

significantly different form zero at the .05 level, but all three S.. are

small in absolute value. All three elements of matrix W (which relates the

conditional variance-covariance matrix to the most recent observation of

the error matrix) are significant at the .05 level, and those corresponding

to the two variances are fairly large. All three elements of matrix

(which describes quarter-to-quarter persistence in the conditional

variance-covariance structure and therefore corresponds to the memory

parameter   in the VAR method) are highly significant, again with fairly

large estimated values. As the relevant theory predicts, neither of the

constants arbitrarily inserted in (10), denoted by k in the table, differs

from zero at any plausible level of significance. Finally, the estimated

value of the coefficient of relative risk aversion is 2.0, with t-

statistic 1.6.17

     Table 4 shows the mean of th& estimated conditional variance-

covariance matrices which these results imply for each of the 104 quarter

spanning 1960:1 -   1985:IV.       Comparison with Table 1 immediately indicates a
                               A
sharp contrast to the mean 0 given by the VAR procedure under any
assumption about the discounting of past observations. Despite the joint

estimation of (7) and (10) •-       that   is, despite the inclusion of the

variance terms as additional explanatory variables in the excess return
                                             18

equations - -   the   GARCH procedure yields conditional variances for both

excess returns that, on average, are larger than the corresponding sample

unconditional variances. (The mean of the conditional covariance is

smaller.) Instead of removing some of the unconditional variance, as does

the VAR procedure as it allows for serial correlation, the GARCH procedure

adds to it in arriving at its average estimate of the conditional variance-

covariance structure.

     One part of the likely explanation for this result is that the GARCH

procedure, unlike the VAR procedure, is constrained to exploit the

information contained in past realizations of excess returns only in so far

as they affect the variance-covariance structure. Serial correlation that

does not reflect changing variance-covariance structures, or even such

basic information as whether a "surprise" is positive or negative, does not

enter the GARCH information set in any direct way. Another part of the

explanation is that both the sums                 +       and   LE +   LE   exceed unity,

so that the processes estimated by GARCH for 0LL and                   are both

                                                      is less than unity but close
nonstationary, while the sum             +
                                             EE
                18
nonetheless

      The solid lines in Figure 2 plot the quarter-by-quarter variation of

the three elements of the GARCH-es-timated conditional variance-covariance

matrix. Once again, the effect of familiar major "surprises" -               - for
example, the 1962 and 1974 episodes for the equity market, and the 1979

episode for the bond market -     - is   readily apparent. As is to be expected

from the fact that the estimated             values (the persistence coefficients)

are far from unity, the conditional variance-covariance elements plotted in

Figure 2 display quarter-to-quarter smoothness that is more like the
                                       19

corresponding VAR-estimated elements shown there (with discounting of past

observations) than those shown in Figure 1.     The increase in conditional

variance due to each major "surprise" disappears fairly rapidly. Second,

again in contrast to the VAR-estimated results shown in Figure 1 but like

those in Figure 2, none of the three        elements estimated by the GARCH

procedure displays any noticeable tendency to grow larger over time.

Finally, as is consistent with the respective means shown in Tables 2 and

4, a comparison of the respective scales used in the corresponding panels

of these figures indicates that each GARCH-estimated       element tends to

be larger, on average, than the corresponding VAR-estimated element,

regardless of the discounting of past observations.

III. Implications for Investors' Portfolio Behavior

     Given the importance of risk in theories of portfolio behavior,

estimates of conditional variance-covariance structures as different as

those plotted in Figures 1 and 2, and summarized in Tables 2 and 4,

presumably imply widely differing asset demands. Table 5 summarizes these

differences by showing the optimal asset substitutability matrix B

calculated from (3) using in turn each of the average conditional variance-

covariance structures estimated by the VAR and GARCH procedures, as shown

in Tables 2 and 4, and in each case a value of 2.0 for the coefficient of

relative risk aversion.19

     As is to be expected from the smaller average conditional variances in

Table 2, compared to those in Table 4, the VAR procedure implies much

greater average sensitivity of the optimal portfolio allocation to expected

excess returns than does the GARCH procedure. When the VAR procedure does

not discount past observations, this greater sensitivity to expected excess

returns takes the form of greater substitutability between each risky asset

 (individually) and short-term debt, and especially so between the two debt

assets. With —l, an increase of .01 in the expected excess return on

long-term debt on average increases the optimal portfolio share invested in

that asset by .28, while reducing the optimal shares invested in short-term

debt and equity by .26, and .02, respectively. According to the GARCH

procedure, the corresponding increase in the long-term debt share is just

 .07, and the reductions in the other two asset shares are .06 and .01,

 respectively, Similarly, the results of the VAR procedure with —l imply

 that an increase of .01 in the expected excess return on equity on average

 increases the optimal portfolio share invested in equity by .07, while

reducing the optimal shares invested in short-term debt and long-term debt

by .05 and .02, respectively. According to the GARCH procedure, the

corresponding increase in the equity share is .05, and the reductions in

the other two asset shares are .03 and .01, respectively.

     In comparison with these values, the results of the VAR procedure

applied with discounting of past observations consistently indicate a

greater degree of substitutability between the two risky assets. At the

same time, they consistently show substitutability between long- and short-

term debt that is smaller than in the VAR results based on —l, but still

greater than in the GARCH results. The substitutability between equity and

short-term debt that they show is consistently about the same as in the

GARCH results. For values of    varying from 0.9 to 0.3 (and below that,

too), an increase of .01 in the expected excess return on long-term debt on

average increases the optimal portfolio share invested in long-term debt by

about .14, and reduces the optimal shares invested in short-term debt and

equity by .10 and .04, respectively. Similarly, for values of    throughout

this range an increase of .01 in the expected excess return on equity

increases the optimal equity share by .07, while reducing the optimal

short- and long-term debt shares by .03 and .04, respectively.

     The results shown in Table S are based on the average conditional

variance-covariance structure that each procedure estimates for the entire

1960-1985 period, and therefore they describe optimal asset demands on

average over this entire period. Given the quarter-to-quarter variation in

the estimated conditional variance-covariances structures plotted in

Figures 1 and 2, risk-based models of portfolio behavior imply that the
                                     22

corresponding optimal asset demands also varied substantially during this

period.

     Figures 3 and 4 plot the quarter-to-quarter variation in each of the

six unique elements of the asset substitutability matrix corresponding to

several of the estimated conditional variance-covariance structures

described above, again using 2.0 as the coefficient of relative risk

aversion in each case.2° The asset demand elements plotted in Figure 3

correspond to the conditional variance-covariance structure plotted in

Figure 1, estimated by the VAR method with &l. Figure 4 plots analogous

asset demand elements corresponding to the VAR method with       (dashed

lines) and the GARCH method (solid lines).

     As is to be expected, the results shown in Figures 3 and 4 closely

mirror the patterns shown in Figures 1 and 2. The asset demand parameters

implied by the VAR procedure with —l exhibit substantial smoothness, with

large discontinuities in the wake of major "surprises," and in most cases a

tendency to shrink (in absolute value) over time. By contrast, the asset

demand parameters implied by the VAR procedure with discounting of past

observations, or by the GARCH procedure, exhibit neither much smoothness

nor any time trend.

     The results differ in other respects as well. The VAR procedure with

—l implies that long-term debt and equity were complements from the

beginning of the sample until 1970, and then substitutes thereafter. The

two debt instruments were substitutes throughout the sample period, as were

short-term debt and equity. With —0.5, long-term debt and equity were

complements from the beginning of the sample until 1965, and then

substitutes throughout the remainder of the sample except for a few

scattered quarters. Again, the other two asset pairs were substitutes

throughout. The GARCH estimates indicate that long-term debt and equity

were complements from the beginning of the sample until 1966, and then

consistently substitutes. Here too the other two asset pairs are

consistently substitutes.

     Finally, as the average results shown in Table 5 suggest, the asset

demand parameters implied by the VAR procedure with —l are each

substantially smaller on average (in absolute value) than the corresponding

parameters implied by the VAR procedure with —O.5, and these in turn are

mostly smaller on average than those implied by the GARCH procedure.

IV. Implications for Equilibrium Returns

    Just as different variance-covariance structures imply differences in

asset demand behavior, differences in asset demand behavior in turn imply

different structures of market-clearing ex ante returns for any given

composition of the "market portfolio" of assets to be held. Figures 5 and

6 summarize these differences by plotting the time paths of the respective

sets of ex ante returns implied by the asset demand systems corresponding

to the variance-covariance structures estimated by the VAR method (with

different 4i values) and the GARCH method. Following (10), the pair of

ex ante excess returns (or risk premia) for each period are calculated as

      where    is again the conditional variance-covariance matrix as

estimated for that quarter by either the VAR and the GARtH procedure, c is

the historical value of the asset supply vector for that quarter, and p is

again in each case the GARtH-estimated value 2.0.21

     The upper panel of Figure 5 plots the risk premium on long-term debt,

as implied by the asset demand system estimated by the VAR procedure with

&l. The lower panel of the same figure - -     in   which the vertical scale is

roughly an order of magnitude larger than in the upper panel --      plots
corresponding series, again for the risk premium on long-term debt, implied

by the asset demand systems estimated by the VAR procedure with —0.7 and

—0.3, and by the GARCH procedure. Figure 6 plots analogous sets of

results for the equity risk premium.

     For long-term debt, both the GARtH procedure and the VAR procedure

(for all three *   values)   imply a systematically greater risk premium during

the 1980-85 period than earlier on. This finding is a natural consequence

of the larger estimated conditional variance of the excess return on long-

term debt, shown in Figures 1 and 2.   For the early years of the sample

(1960-66 under the CARCH procedure, 1960-63 under the VAR), when the

estimated     was small and the estimated     was negative, the implied

risk premium on long-term debt is negative. The VAR procedure with —l

implies a risk premium that rises almost monotonically over time, reaching

about .04 by the end of the sample. The other estimates exhibit

substantially more volatility, in some quarters reaching what appear to be

absurdly large values. The general pattern shown by the CARCH results is

roughly similar to that of either of the VAR results with discounting of

past observations, with less volatility than in the $—0.7 case but more

than in the =0.3 case. The mean implied risk premium on long-term debt is

.0416 for the GARCH procedure, .0081 for the VAR procedure with —l, and

.0303 and .0301 for the VAR procedure with —0.7 and 0.3, respectively.

      In contrast, none of these procedures implies any overall trend in

the risk premium for equities. For both the CARCH procedure and the VAR

procedure with discounting of past observations, there is substantial

volatility, with the implied equity risk premium rising sharply (albeit

only temporarily) in the wake of each of the major "surprises" familiar

from the figures shown earlier on. The GARCH procedure again implies a

degree of volatility that is intermediate between what the VAR procedure

implies with .=0.7 and —0.3. Once again, also, all three of these sets of

risk premia reach what appear to be absurdly high levels in some quarters.

There are some notable differences, however. For example, the largest

equity risk premium implied by GARCH occurs after the 1974 market crash;

three other "surprises" loom larger in the VAR results. Finally, the

equity risk premium implied by the VAR procedure with .4—1 is again quite
                                         26

smooth in comparison to the others. The mean implied risk premium on

equities is .0964 for GARCH, .0596 for VAR with 4—1, and .0773 and .0770

for VAR with 4—0.7 and 4—0.3, respectively.

      How closely does any of these implied ex ante excess return series

compare with the observed ex post excess returns? Table 6 shows the simple

correlations between the respective ex ante risk premium series implied by

the VAR and GARCH procedures and the corresponding ex post excess returns,

as well as the root-mean errors of the corresponding differences, over the

104 quarters of the 1960-85 sample. For the risk premium on long-term

debt, the VAR procedure with 4—I provides the best fit. The risk premium

implied by the VAR procedure with any significant degree of discounting of

past observations (4—0.9 or below) shows a much weaker correlation, though

only marginally greater root-mean-square error. The risk premium implied

by the GARCH procedure shows a poorer fit than that for the VAR procedure

with little or no discounting (4—0.9 or above), but a closer fit than that

for the VAR procedure with more substantial discounting. By contrast, for

equities the VAR procedure with substantial discounting (4—0.5 or below)

generates risk premia that are more closely related with the ex post excess

returns --   for   4—1 or 0.99 the correlation is negative - -   and   the GARCH

procedure implies a risk premium with an even closer fit (albeit only

marginally so).

     Although the value of 2.0 for p estimated by the GARCH procedure is

the natural one to use in calculating the asset demand behavior and

consequent ex ante risk premia implied by the GARCH-estimated variance-

covariance structure, its analogous use in the context of the VAR procedure

is arbitrary. Simply rescaling the implied risks premia by changing the

risk aversion parameter will not affect the correlations shown in Table 6,

but in general doing so will affect the root-mean-square errors. The

simplest way to explore this possibility is to project the observed ex post

excess returns on the corresponding implied ex ante excess returns in an

ordinary-least-squares regression of the form.

                     r)      + S   (r. —

CARCU procedure (with p—2.O),       is a disturbance term, and   and 6 are

coefficients to be estimated. A value of 6 different from unity would

correspond to rescaling the risk premium by substituting a value of the

risk aversion parameter different from 2.0.22

       Table 7 shows the estimated 6 values, the t-statistics testing the

null hypothesis S—I, and the regression standard error for each of the risk

premium series considered in Table 6. Despite the wide range of differer

S estimates, including several that are significantly different from unity,

the regression standard errors are not much smaller than the corresponding

root-mean-square errors reported in Table 6.

       Finally, in comparing the respective results given by the VAR and

GARCH procedures it is important to recall that because equations (10)

estimate excess returns on a weighted basis, where the weights reflect the

CARCH-estimated variance-covariance structure, use of the weighted

correlations and root-mean-square errors shown in Table 6 potentially

biases the comparison. Table 8 therefore presents correlations that are

analogous to those shown in Table 6 but computed with the 104 individual

quarters weighted as in the CARCH procedure.23

    These weighted correlations tell a quite different story for long-term

debt, though not for equity. On this criterion, either heavy discounting

of past observations or else none at all produces the strongest

correlations from among the long-term debt risk premium series implied by

the VAR procedure, but in any case the weighted correlations are all far

smaller than their unweighted counterparts with =l or .99. As is to be

expected, the weighted correlation for the long-term debt risk premium

implied by the CARCH procedure is stronger than the corresponding

unweighted correlation. Even so, it remains weaker than the weighted

correlations for the VAR procedure except for cases with little or no

discounting.

     For equities, the weighted correlations are not all that different.

The weighted correlations are uniformly weaker than their unweighted

counterparts, even for the CARCH model (although the pronounced negative

correlations for the VAR procedure with —l or .99 no longer arise). As

with the unweighted correlations, discounting of past observations within

the VAR procedure greatly strengthens the weighted correlations, at least

up to a point. The maximum again occurs with =.4. Once again, the

weighted GARCH correlation falls just short of this maximum.

V.   Concludin Remarks About the Results

     The empirical results presented in this paper lead to several

conclusions about the role of time-varying asset risk assessments in

accounting for what, on the basis of many earlier studies, at least appear

to be time-varying differentials in ex ante asset returns. First, both the

VAR method (with or without discounting of past observations) and the GARCH

method indicate sizeable changes over time in variance-covariance

structures conditional on past information. These changing conditional

variance-covariance structures in turn imply sizeable changes over time in

asset demand behavior, and hence in the market-clearing equilibrium

structure of ex ante asset returns.

     Second, at least for some values of the memory parameter describing

the discounting of past observations, the ex ante excess returns implied by

the VAR method bear non-negligible correlation to the excess returns

observed ex post on either long-term debt or equity. For the GARCH model,

the same is true for equities though not for long-term debt. The

percentage of the variation of ex post excess returns explained by the

implied time-varying ex ante excess returns is as great as .04 for long-

term debt, and .11 for equity -- comparable to values to which previous

researchers have interpreted as cøtisistent with rejection of the null

hypothesis of risk premia that are constant over time.24

     Third, for long-term debt the two methods give sharply different

answers to the questions of how much relevance market participants

associate with more distant past observations in assessing future risks.

Within the VAR method, the greatest correlation between implied ex ante

excess returns and observed ax post excess returns follows from values of
                                          30

the memory parameter indicating little or no discounting of past

observations, so that more distant outcomes are as relevant as more recent

ones (or nearly so) .     The corresponding parameter estimated directly within

the GARCH method indicates far greater discounting of past observations.

The correlation between implied ex ante excess returns and observed ex post

excess returns is about twice as great under the VAR method with little or

no discounting as under the GARCU method, however.

     Fourth, for equities both methods agree in indicating extremely rapid

discounting of more distant observations -. so much so that in neither case

do outcomes more than a year in the past matter much at all. Under the VAR

method, the greatest correlation between implied ex ante excess returns

and observed ex post excess returns follows from a memory parameter value

of .4 (per quarter). The corresponding value directly estimated by the

GARCH model is substantially identical, at .417.

     While the first three conclusions reported here are plausible enough,

the finding of such an extremely short "memory" on the part of market

investors - -   indeed,   the almost precise agreement of both empirical methods

applied here in reaching this finding -    - is   sufficiently startling to raise

serious questions about the overall approach to risk assessment underlying

the analysis both here and in the related literature. In particular, the

representation of equity risk by a single normally distributed stochastic

disturbance may be too restrictive.

     A more general alternative, with which the authors are experimenting

in further research along these lines, is to specify equity returns to

include two distinct stochastic components: one that may be well described

by the usual assumptions of normality and (modest) serial correlation, and
                                         31

the other characterized by larger, albeit only occasional nonzero values,

and no serial correlation --   for   example, a Poisson process.25 An investor

who correctly understood the nature of the two processes would take account

of the serial correlation of the first in the manner modeled here, but

would assume that a nonzero realization of the second bore no implication

for the immediate future. By contrast, the econometrician who failed to

distinguish the two processes, and proceed in the fashion of this paper

(and substantially all of the related literature) ,   would derive a downward
biased estimate of the memory parameter relevant to the first process.    If

the variance of the second process were sufficiently large relative to that

of the first, the bias could be great enough to deliver an implausibly

short "memory" like that found here for equities.

1. The recent surveys by Melino (b'86), Shiller (forthcoming) and

Singleton (forthcoming) provide numerous references.

2. This assumption was made explicit by Meiselman (1963), for example.

3. Prominent examples include the capital asset pricing model, in the

original single-period form due to Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965), or the

intertemporal form first developed by Merton (1973), or the intertemporal

consumption-based form due to Breeden (1978); Stiglitz's (1970)

consumption-based model of the term structure of interest rates; Ross's

(1976) arbitrage pricing model; and successor models, like that laid out in

Gox et al. (1985), which make the factor approach more explicit. See

Merton (forthcoming) for a survey delineating the common features in all of
                                  -
these models.

4.   Modigliani and Shiller's dependent variable was actually the long-term

interest rate, but their equation included the short-term rate as a right-

hand-side variable.

5. As in Friedman (1985), but unlike in Bollerslev et al. (1988), the

returns here are stated in after-tax terms, using the average effective

marginal tax rates applicable to individual U.S. investors in each year
                                      33


during the sample.

6. Additional elements are necessary if the theory is also to encompass

nonfinancial assets which bear direct service returns, or financial assets

which provide transactions services in addition to any pecuniary returns.

7.   See Friedman and Roley (1987) for derivations of these expressions, for

references, and for qualifications about the assumptions employed.

8.   If investors are aware of the possibility of events that have not

occurred during the sample, however, the measured sample variance-

covariance matrix may understate the relevant uncertainty. See, for

example, Ederington's (1986) analysis of this possibility in a context

closely related to this paper's focus on serial correlation.

9. The application of the VAR method in Friedman (1985) is more like a

factor model of asset risk in that it first decomposes each asset's return

into components known with certainty ex ante (for example, the nominal

return on a Treasury bill, or the price and coupon rate on a Treasury bond)

and stochastic components that the investor must forecast (for example, the

price change in bonds or equities), and then specifies the vector

autoregression in terms of the stochastic components directly. Our efforts

to estimate the GARCH model in a parallel way proved unsuccessful, however,

and so for purposes of this paper we applied the VAR method directly to

return vector r so as to make the two sets of results as comparable as

possible.

10. An alternative procedure, which would probably deliver about the same

results, would be to estimate (4) using generalized least squares, with a

block diagonal weighing matrix made up of successive powers of .
                                         34

Ii. The assumption that the supply vector is exogenous, which is standard

in much of the literature, embodies the contradiction of implicitly taking

as given the prices of the assets whose expected returns the model is

supposed to determine, even though for most assets it is primarily

variation in price that delivers variation in expected return.

12. Our original intention was to use real rather than nominal returns and

to treat all assets as risky, as in Friedman (1985) .    Trivariate   versions

of the GARCH procedure failed, however, as the parameter estimates

converged to values corresponding to non-positive-definite        for some t.

Hence we followed fiollerslev et al. ,   as well as much of the finance

literature, in using nominal returns (so that short-term debt would be

risk-free) and estimating the model in terms of excess returns relative to

the short-term rate. (An alternative approach, as in Engle (1987), would

have been to impose a factor structure onto the variance-covariance matrix

and estimate the factor loadings.) We did follow Friedman (1985) in using

after-tax rather than before-tax returns.

13. The marginal tax rates applied to interest and dividends for years

1960-79 are values estimated by Estrella and Fuhrer (1983), on the basis of

Internal Revenue Service data, to reflect the marginal tax bracket of the

average recipient of these two respective kinds of income in each year; the

values applied for years 1980-85 are from an updating of the

Estrella-Fuhrer analysis. The marginal tax rate applied to capital gains

in each year is an analogous estimate, in principle including allowances

for deferral and loss offset features, due to Feldstein and Jun (1986).
                                     35

14. In samples that exclude the 1980s, the excess return on long-term debt

is typically negative. See the discussion of this phenomenon in Bodie et

al. (1985) and Friedman (1985).

15. The average      of the 104 individual regressions are -0.08 for rL and

0.11 for rE.

16. The maximum likelihood estimation was performed using the quadratic

hill-climbing algorithm supplied in the GQOPT numerical optimization

package.

17. A value near two is consistent with the findings of Friend and Blume

(1975). By contrast, Grossman and Shiller's (1981) work suggested a value

of four, and Friend and Hasbrouck (1982) suggested six. The        of the two

GAPM regressions are for (rL_rS) and for (rE_rS)

18. Yet a further potential explanation is that, because equations (10)

estimate excess returns on a weighted basis, where the weights reflect the

estimated variance-covariance structure, the weighted mean excess returns

estimated by these equations in general differ from the corresponding

sample-period means despite the presence of a constant term in each

equation. Any difference between the estimated and actual means on an

unweighted basis would, of course, add to the corresponding unweighted

variances. In fact, however, differences in the unweighted means account

for less than 1% of the estimated variances reported in Table 4.

19. This is the value estimated by the GARCH procedure (see again

Table 3); the VAR procedure does not deliver an estimate of the risk

aversion coefficient. Because the formulation of the problem here treats

short-term debt as a risk-free asset, and therefore focuses on the excess

returns to holding long-term debt and equity, the form of B here is 2x2
                                       36

rather than 3x3. In addition, the      vector in each case consists simply of

a unit element for short-term debt and a zero element for each of the other

two assets.

20. Because B is symmetric, LE —            In   addition, because the columns

of B uniformly add up to zero, SL —          +        and SE —        +

•2l.   An intertemporal version of the capital asset pricing model would

include an extra term to reflect the investor's ability to hedge against

systematic variation over time in C.

22. Including the constant term also allows the regression to correct for

any difference in means. The estimated 1 was not significantly different

from zero in any of the regressions run, however.

23. There is no obvious weighted analog to the root-mean-square errors

reported in Table 6.

24.    See, for example, Shiller (1979) and other references cited in Shiller

(forthcoming).

25.    See, for example, Merton (1971) for an exposition of standard

portfolio theory in the presence of Poisson disturbances.
