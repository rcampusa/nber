                      Flexible Exchange Rates in the 1970's


                                   ABSTRACT


     The 1970's witnessed the dramatic evolution of the international monetary system

from a regime of pegged exchange rates into a regime of flexible rates. This paper

surveys the key issues and lessons from the experience with floating rates during the

1970's. The main orientation is empirical and the analysis is based on the experience

of the three exchange rates: the Dollar/Pound, the Dollar/French Franc, and the Dollar!

DM. The first issue that is being examined is the efficiency of the foreign exchange

market and the degree of exchange rates volatility. The analytical framework emphasizes

that exchange rates are the prices of assets that are traded in organized markets and are

strongly influenced by expectations about future events. The principal finding is that

the behavior of the foreign exchange market has been broadly consistent with the efficient

market hypothesis. The second issue concerns the relationship between exchange rates

and interest rates. It is shown that during the inflationary period of the 1970's,

exchange rates and interest rates were positively correlated. This positive association

is interpreted in terms of the role played by inflationary expectations. The analysis

draws a distinction between expected and unexpected changes in interest rates; it is

demonstrated that changes in exchange rates are strongly associated with the unexpected

component of changes in the interest rates. The third issue concerns the relationship

between exchange rates and prices. It is shown that the experience of the 1970's

does not support the prediction of the simple version of the purchasing power parity

theory and that the deviations from purchasing power parities can be characterized

by a first—order autoregressive process. These deviations are then interpreted.

 I. Introduction

         Our recent experience with a system of flexible exchange rates had led

 to a renewed interest in the operations of foreign exchange markets and in

 studying the principal determinants of exchange rates. The 1970's witnessed

the dramatic evolution of the international monetary system from a regime of

pegged exchange rates which prevailed for about a quarter of a century since

the Bretton Woods conference into a regime of flexible (though managed) rates.

The emergence of the new legal and economic system confronted traders,

national governments and international organizations with new economic problems,

choices and instruments. During the 1970's exchange rates have fluctuated

widely and inflation rates accelerated. The international monetary system

had to accommodate extraordinarily large oil related shocks which affected

trade flows in goods and assets. Huge oil payments had to be recycled.

Uncertainties concerning future developments in international politics reached

new heights and the prospects for the world economy got gloomier. These

developments have placed unprecedented pressures on the markets for foreign

exchange as well as on other asset markets. They have been associated with a

large slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, and have resulted in speeding up the

creation of new institutions like the European Monetary System which provides the

formal framework for the management of exchange rates among members. The increased

interdependence among countries and the recognition that exchange rate

policies by one national government exert influence on other economies have

also induced a legal response from international organizations. For example,

in late April 1977 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund

approved the details of the second amendment to Article IV of the amended

Articles of Agreement dealing with the principles and procedures for surveillance

of member countries' exchange rate policies.
                                    2




      These developments provide the background for this paper which is

intended to present a brief survey of key issues and lessons from the

experience with floating rates during the 1970's. The main orientation of

the paper is empirical and the analysis is based on the experience of three

exchange rates: the Dollar/Pound, the Dollar/French Franc and the Dollar/DM.

In Section II I analyse the efficiency of the foreign exchange markets by

examining the relationship between spot and forward exchange rates; in that

context I also examine and interpret the extent of exchange rate volatility.

The analysis of the foreign exchange markets is important because it sheds

light on several questions like (i) have exchange rates fluctuated "excessively"?

(ii) is there evidence that speculation in the foreign exchange markets is

destabilizing? (iii) is there evidence that there is "insufficient"

speculation in the foreign exchange markets? (iv) is there evidence for a

market failure in the sense that there are unexploited profit opportunities?

These issues are relevant for assessing the performance of floating rates as

well as for discussing whether there is a case for government intervention in

the foreign exchange markets. The analytical framework that is used for

interpreting the volatility of exchange rates and the association between spot

and forward rates is the modern theory of exchange rate determination.

Within this perspective exchange rates are viewed as the prices of assets that

are treded in organized markets and, like the prices of other assets, are

strongly influenced by expectations about future events.

        The relationship between exchange rates and interest rates is analysed in

Section III from the perspective of the monetary approach to the exchange rate.

This analysis is of particular relevance in view of the new policies of the Federal

Reserve Board that are intended to curb inflation and to support the dollar and

which were announced on October 6, 1979. One of the key issues that is raised
                                       3




 in this section is the distinction between anticipated and unanticipated

 changes in rates of interest. The policy implication of this distinction is

 obvious. As an analytical matter this distinction is important because the

 modern approach to exchange rate determination implies that exchange rates

 are strongly influenced by "news" which by definition are unpredicted.

 Therefore, unanticipated rather than anticipated changes in interest rates

 should have a strong effect on changes in exchange rates. This prediction is

 tested empirically.

           Section IV analyses the relationship between exchange rates and prices

by examining the patterns of deviation from purchasing power parities. This

examination is relevant for assessing whether the flexible exchange rate

system was successful in insulating national economies from foreign shocks,

and whether it provided policy makers with an added instrument for the

conduct of macroeconomic policy. The evidence on deviations from purchasing

power parities is also relevant for the discussion of whether there is a case

for managed float. Section V concludes the paper with some concluding

remarks.



II. The Efficiency of the Foreign Exchange Market and the Movement of

    Exchange Rates

        In this section I analyse the principal characteristics of the

relationship between spot and forward exchange rates which seem to emerge

from the experience of the 1970's. Following an analysis of the efliciency

of the foreign exchange market I discuss the more general issues underlying

the relationships between spot and forward rates and their volatility.

TI.l The Efficiency of the Foreign Exchange Market

        One   of   the central insights of the monetary (or the asset market)

approach to the exchange rate is the notion that the exchange rate, being

a relative price of two assets, is determined in a manner similar to the

determination of other asset prices and that expectations concerning

future course of events play a central role in affecting current exchange

rates

        If the foreign exchange market is efficient and if the exchange rate is

determined in a fashion similar to the determination of other asset prices, we

should expect current prices to reflect all currently available information.

Expectations concerning future exchange rates should be incorporated and reflected

in forward exchange rates. Thus, to examine the efficiency of the market I

first regress the logarithm of the current spot exchange rate, 2,n S, on

the logarithm of the one—month forward exchange rate prevailing at the

previous month, £n Ft_l, as in equation (l).2

        If the market for foreign exchange is efficient and if the forward

exchange rate is an unbiased forecast of the future spot exchange rate,

then we expect that (1) the constant term in

 1921—1923 see Frenkel (1976, 1977, 1979). For an application to other
exchange rates during the 1920's see Frenkel and Clements (1980), for an
application to the 1920's and the 1970's see Krugman (1977); for an interesting,
analysis using time—series and cross—section data see Bilson (1979), for an
analysis of market efficiency using novel econometric techniques see Hakkio (l979a),
and Hansen and Hodrick (1980), and for surveys see Levich (1978, 1979).

equation (1) should not differ
                                  significantly from zero,3 (ii) the slope
coefficient should not differ significantly from unity and, (iii) the

residuals should be serially uncorrelated. I examine three exchange

 rates: the Dollar/Pound, the Dollar/Franc and the Dollar/DM. Equation

 (1) was estimated using monthly data for the period June 1973 —
                                                                   July   1979.

The beginning of the period was determined by the attempt to concentrate

on the experience of the current exchange
                                             rate regime (following
the initial post Bretton—Woods transition period). The resulting ordinary

least squares estimates are reported in Table 1. Also reported in Table

1 are additional regressions which will be analysed shortly.

As may be seen for the Dollar/DM
                                    exchange rate the hypotheses that (at the
95 percent confidence level) the constant term does not differ significantly

from zero and that the slope coefficient does not differ significantly from

unity cannot be rejected. These hypotheses are rejected for

the Dollar/Franc exchange rate and are rejected (marginally) for the

Dollar/poundexchange rate. The joint hypotheses, however, that the constant
is zero and that the slope coefficient is
                                             unity can not be rejected at the
95 percent for the Dollar/Pound and the Dollar/DM exchange rates and at the

99 percent for the Dollar/Franc exchange rate. The test statistics for

testing the joint hypotheses are reported in the column headed by F in
Table 1.

           It was argued above that in an efficient market, expectations concerning

future exchange rates are reflected in forward rates and, that spot exchange

rates reflect all currently available information. If forward exchange

                                                                        measures
the expected value of the future spot rate, than the constant term in the
logarithmic equation (1) should be —O.5a2; see Frenkel (1979).

 rates   prevailing at period t—l summarize all relevant information available

at that period, they s'iould also contain the information that is summarized

in data corresponding to period t—2. It thus follows that including

additional lagged values of the forward rates in equation (1) should not

greatly affect the coefficients of determination and should not yield

coefficients that differ significantly from zero. The results reported in

Table 1 are consistent with this hypothesis; in all cases the coefficients

of £n t—2 do not differ significantly from zero and the inclusion of the

additional lagged variables does not improve the fit. Furthermore, in all

cases the Durbin—Watson statistics are consistent with the hypothesis of

the absence of first—order autocorrelated residuals and an examination of

higher order correlations (up to 12 lags) shows that no correlation of any

order is significant.

           To further examine the relationship between the various exchange

rates we note that one of the assumptions underlying equation (1) was the

notion that the forward exchange rate measures the unobservable value of

the expected future spot exchange rate. This assumption provided the

justification for using equation (1) instead of the more fundamental relationship

that is embodied in equation (2):


(2)        £n St   = a + b £fl(Se Jt   —
                                           1) +

where (S    t—l) denotes the expected spot exchange rate for period t based
on the information available at period t — 1. If, however, the forward
exchange rate at t —      1
                         is a "noisy" proxy for the expected future value of
the spot rate, (i.e., it measures it with a random error) then we would obtain
that

        in          =                  1) + v1; E(vt) = 0
                        in(S   t   —

and substituting equation (3) into equation (2) yields:


(4)     in St = a + b in Ft_i + (E          —
                                                 bvi).
In this case the error term in equation (1) would be             =    — bvi,   and the

assumption that the covariance between in Ft_i and u is zero would entail

a specification error, and the application of the ordinary—least squares (OLS)

procedure would yield inconsistent estimates due to the classical errors in

variables bias.

        In order to examine the possibility that the OLS estimates might be

subject to the errors in variables bias, one needs to test the

hypothesis that cov(ut, in F1) = 0.              This test follows the specification

test outlined by Hausman (l978). To perform the test equation (1) was

estimated by applying the OLS procedure as well as by using an instrumental

variables (IV) estimation method. Under the null—hypothesis of no mispecification

the OLS coefficients vector b0 is an efficient and an unbiased estimate

of the true coefficient vector. Under the alternative hypothesis of

misspecification the vector b0 is biased and an unbiased coefficient

vector b1 can be obtained by applying an instrumental variables

estimation procedure. The test—statistic relevant for testing the

 where var(b1) and            var(b0) denote the variance—covariance matrices of

       and b0, respectively. Under the null—hypothesis m is distributed (in

 large samples) as            with two   degrees      of freedom. Table 1 reports the

 results of estimating equation (1) by applying the instrumental variables

 estimation method. As may be seen for all exchange rates the two vectors of

 coefficients b1 and b0 are very close to each other. For example for the

Dollar/Pound exchange rate, the constants are .033 and .035 and the slopes

 are .956 and .953 —          consequently, the resulting m statistic is .90 which is
well below 5.99 ——           the   critical value of X2(2) at the 95 percent confidence

level. The m statistics corresponding to the other exchange rates are also

below this critical value. It is concluded, therefore, that the use of the

forward exchange rate as a proxy for expectations does not introduce a

significant errors in variables bias and thus the use of the OLS estimation

procedure seems appropriate.

           The efficiency of the foreign exchange market and the rationality of

using data from the forward market to measure expectations can also be analysed

from a different angle. Consider equation (6):


(6)           =
                  o+        at +              +           + wt


where x denotes the percentage change in the spot exchange rate (2n St —
in    S....1), ir1 denotes the forward premium on foreign exchange (in Ft_1 —
in    Sr_i), t denotes time, n denotes the number of lags, and w denotes an
error term. If                summarizes all available information concerning the

future evolution of the exchange rate, then given the value of the forward

should not "help" the prediction (i.e., the past history should not be viewed

as Granger—causing future changes), and the joint hypotheses that a and f3.
                                                                       1

are zero should not be rejected. The results of applying these tests

to the three exchange rates for various number of lags are reported in Table

2; also reported in Table 2 are the results of testing the joint hypotheses

that a1 and   are zero and that 'y,   the   coefficient of the forward premium,

is unity. The relevant statistic for testing the null—hypothesis is an F—

statistic which is reported in Table 2. As is evident in all cases the

null—hypothesis can not be rejected at the 95 percent confidence level

since the values of the various F—statistics fall well below the corresponding

critical values. It is concluded therefore that the forward premium on

foreign exchange may be viewed as a rational expectations measure of the

percentage depreciation of the currency in that it incorporates the

available information that is contained in the series of past depreciations.

        The principal conclusions that may be drawn from the previous

discussion are that the behavior of the foreign exchange market during the

1970's has been broadly consistent with the general implications of the

efficient market hypothesis and that the forward exchange rate summarizes the

relevant available information concerning the future evolution of the rate.


11.2 Exchange Rate Movement: Volatility and Predictability

        In this section I analyse the volatility of exchange rates and the

extent to which this volatility is predictable. To set the stage for the

analysis I present in Figure 1 the percentage daily and quarterly changes in

the three exchange rates. This figure indicates that the various exchange

rates have been very volatile and that the degree of volatility of day—to—day

changes in the exchange rates have been extraordinarily high and has been

much smaller when averaged over longer periods.   Further, the standard errors

of the regressions in Table 1 indicate that the forecasts of future spot

exchange rates based on the forward rates are imprecise: the standard errors

of the equations are about 3 percent per month.

        These characteristics of price changes are typical to auction and

to organized asset markets. In such markets current prices reflect expectations

concerning future course of events, and changes in expectations are immediately

reflected in corresponding changes in prices. Periods which are dominated by

uncertainties, new information, rumors and announcements, are likely to be

periods in which changes in expectations are the prime cause of fluctuations

in asset prices. Further, since the information which alters expectations

must be new, the resulting fluctuations in price cannot be predicted by lagged
                                                              5
forward exchange rates which are based on past information.       Therefore,

during such periods, one should expect exchange rates to exhibit large

fluctuations and to be unbiased but imprecise forecasts of future spot rates.

        To gain further insights into the implications of this perspective on

the relationship between predicted and realized changes in exchange rates, I

present in Figures 2—4 plots of predicted and realized changes in exchange rates

for the three pairs of currencies where the predicted change is measured by

the lagged forward premium. Also presented in these Figures are the

differentials in national inflation rates which are discussed in Section IV.

The key fact which emerges from these figures is that predicted changes in

exchange rates account for a very small fraction of actual changes.6


        5The analysis of the role of "news" in determining current exchange
rates and in explaining forecast errors from the forward rate has been made
forcefully by Nussa (1976a, l976b, 1977, l979a). See also Dornbusch (1978).
The large degree of volatility is also analysed by McKinnon (1976) who
attributes it to insufficient speculation.

       6These and the following empirical regularities are analysed in detail
in Mussa (1979a). See also Frenkel and Mussa (1980). An interesting extension
would examine the relationship between the variances of predicted and actual
changes in exchange rates in a manner analogous tothat of Shiller (1979).

This fact suggests that the bulk of exchange rate changes seem to be due to

"new information" which, by definition, could not have been anticipated and

reflected in the forward premium or discount which prevailed in the previous

period.

          In order to examine this hypothesis I present in Figures 5—7 plots

of the spot and the contemporaneous forward exchange rates for the three pairs

of currencies. Also presented are the ratios of national price levels which

are discussed in Section IV. If the dominant factor underlying changes in

rates is "new information" which alters views about current and expected

future exchange rates by approximately the same amount, then one should

expect a high correlation between movements of spot and forward rates. This

fact is clearly demonstrated by Figures 5—7 where it is seen that spot and

forward exchange rates tend to move together and by approximately the same

amplitude (the vertical difference between the two rates correspond to the

forward premium or discount on foreign exchange). The high correlation between

movements in spot and forward rates is expected since the two rates respond

at the same time to the same flow of new information. This characteristic

is typical to the foreign exchange market as well as to other markets for

stocks and durable assets. The recent pattern of gold prices provides a

useful example of this general principle. Table 3 reports the spot and the

future price of gold as recorded recently in the New York Commodity Exchange

on four recent consecutive days. The two key facts which are illustrated by this

Table are the extent of day—to—day volatility in gold prices and the

uniformity by which these changes are reflected in the price of gold for

immediate delivery as well as in the prices for the twelve future delivery

dates.

         Another feature which is revealed by Figures 5—7 is that the

contemporaneous spot and forward exchange rates are approximately equal

and thus indicating that the market's best forecast of the future spot

rate is (approximately) the current spot rate. This phenomenon reflects the

fact that, as an empirical matter, exchange rates have followed (approximately)

a randon walk process. For such a process current prices are indeed the best

forecasts of future prices. To the extent that the exchange rate had some

drift, the above statement should be interpreted in reference to that drift.

This empirical phenomenon seems to correspond to the actual paths of exchange

rates even though it does not reflect a theoretical necessity.

         The final characteristic of the foreign exchange market is described

by Figures 8—10 which plot for the three pairs of currencies the spot exchange

rate and the forward premium on-forward exchange. Since the units of the spot

rate and the forward premium are fundamentally different, the two series were

normalized by subtracting from each series its mean and by dividing by the

corresponding standard error. The fact which emerges from these Figures is

that generally (though not always) there is a positive correlation between

the   expected depreciation of the currency (as measured by the forward premium
on foreign exchange) and the spot exchange rate. This positive correlation
may be   rationalized by noting that currencies which are expected to depreciate
are   traded at a discount in the forward market and, on average, these

currencies also command a lower foreign exchange value in the spot market.

This correlation is interpreted further in the next Section.

 III. Exchange Rates, Interest Rates and Innovations

         In this section I analyse the relationship between exchange rates and

 interest rates from the analytical perspective of the monetary approach to

 the exchange rate. To set the stage for the analytical development it is

useful to recall the typical analysis which generally predicts a negative

association between the rate of interest and the exchange rate. According

to that analysis a higher rate of interest attracts foreign capital which

induces a surplus in the capital account of the balance of payments and

thereby induces an appreciation of the domestic currency (i.e., a lower spot

exchange rate). Another variant of the popular approach states that the

higher rate of interest lowers spending and thus induces a surplus in the

current account of the balance of payments which results in a lower spot exchange

rate. A third variant of this approach claims that the higher rate of interest

implies (via the interest parity theory) a higher forward premium on foreign

exchange and to the extent that at a given point in time the forward exchange

rate is predetermined by past history, (an assumption that is clearly rejected

by the evidence on the comovements of spot and forward rates), the required

rise in the forward premium will be brought about by a lower spot rate (i.e.,

by an appreciation of the domestic currency). Whatever the route, this

approach predicts a negative relationship between the rate of interest and

the spot exchange rate (or alternatively, a positive relationship between

the rate of interest and the foreign exchange value of the domestic currency).

        These predictions, however, do not seem to be in accord with the

broad facts. Over the recent period the rise in the rate of interest in

the U.S. (relative to the foreign rate of interest) has been associated with

a rise in the spot exchange rate (i.e., with a depreciation of the dollar).

Figure 11 illustrates the point by plotting the foreign exchange value of

the U.S. dollar against the interest rate differential. As is evident, in

contrast with the popular prediction, the higher (relative) rate of interest

in the U.S. has been associated with a higher exchange rate (i.e., with a

lower foreign exchange value of the dollar). This contradiction however does

not arise when the exchange rate is analysed from a monetary (or an asset

market) perspective to which we now turn.

        The major building blocks of the monetary approach are hypotheses

concerning the properties of the demand for money and money market equilibrium

and hypotheses concerning the link between domestic and foreign prices.7

Consider first the equilibrium in the money markets. The supplies of

domestic and foreign real balances are M/P and M*/P* where M and P denote

the nominal money supply and the price level, respectively, and where variables

pertaining to the foreign country are indicated by an asterisk. Denoting the

demands for real balances by L and L* (both of which are functions which

are specified below), equilibrium in the money markets is attained when



(7)     L = M/P and


(8)     L* =   M*/P*.


From equations (7)—(8), equilibrium in the money markets implies that the

ratio of the two price levels is:


        P _M L*
()      p*M*L


        7For theoretical developments and applications of the approach see,
for example, Dornbusch (1976a, 1976b), Kouri (1976), Mussa (1976a),Frenkel
(1976), Frenkel and Johnson (1978), Frenkel and Clements (1980), Bilson (1978),
Hodrick (1978), and Frankel (1979).

        The second building block links domestic and foreign prices. Assuming

the simple version of purchasing power parity implies that:8


(10)    P =   SP

Using equation (10) in (9) yields

              M   L*
(11)    S =i*"i:

which expresses the exchange rate in terms of domestic and foreign supplies

and demands for money. To gain further insight into the determinants of the

exchange rate and to set the stage for the empirical estimation, assume that

the demand for money depends on real income (y) and the rate of interest (i)

according to:


(12)    L aye
                           _a*i*
(13)    L* =    b*y*fl*e

Using equations (12)—(13) in (11) and assuming for simplicity of exposition

that foreign and domestic parameters of the demand for money are the same,



        8For a discussion of the choice of the relevant price index to be
used in equation (10) see Frenke]. (1978). This simple version of the purchasing
power parity theory Is used here to simplify the exposition. To the extent
that there are systematic deviations from purchasing power parity they can
be incorporated into the final exchange rate equation; Similarly, to the
extent that purchasing power parities holds in the long run but not in the
short run, the final exchange rate equation will reflect these dynamic
characteristics. To the extent that purchasing power parity pertains
to traded goods only, the exchange rate equation would also contain
terms which relate to the relative prices of traded to non—traded goods;
for a formulation along these lines see Dornbusch (1976b) and for an
empirical application see Clements and Frenkel (1980). A more refined
specification would allow for the effects of tariffs on the relationship
between domestic and foreign prices as well as for short—run effects of
unanticipated money on output rather than only on prices and the exchange
rate.

i.e., that c =   a*,    and that   =   we obtain:


 (14)   in S =   C   + in    +         (    i   —   1*)

where C E   in(b*/a).
Equation (14) relates the exchange rate to the ratios of domestic to foreign

money supplies and incomes and to the interest rate differential.9 Most

pertinent to the present purpose and in agreement with the facts summarized

by Figure 11, equation (14) yields a positive relationship between the rate of

interest and the exchange rate. The economic interpretation of this association

in the context of the U.S. dollar and the inflationary environment is as

follows: a rise in the domestic (relative) rate of interest is primarily

dominated by a rise in the expected (relative) rate of inflation which induces

a decline in the demand for real cash balances; for a given path of the

nominal money supply asset market equilibrium requires a price level which

is higher than the price which would have prevailed otherwise. Since the

domestic price level is linked to the foreign price through some form of

purchasing power parity, and since the path of the foreign price is assumed

to be given, the higher domestic price can only be achieved through a rise

in the spot exchange rate (i.e., through a depreciation of the currency).

        This explanation of the positive association between interest rates

and exchange rates has an intuitive appeal in that it implies that in an

inflationary environment a relatively rapid rise in prices is associated

with high nominal rates of interest as well as with a depreciation of the


        9it should be noted that a similar set of variables would also
appear in the reduced form of a variety of alternative models. The dependence
of the demand for domestic money on the domestic rate of interest and the
dependence of the demand for foreign money on foreigii rate of interest is
assumed only for simplicity of exposition. A more general formulation would
recognize that the demands for domestic and foreign monies depend on all
margins of substitution. See Frenkel and Clements (1980).

currency in terms of foreign exchange. The traditional prediction of a

negative relationship between interest rates and the exchange rate may

however be reconciled with the monetary approach under the assumption that it

concentrates on the short—run liquidity effects of monetary changes.

Accordingly, in the short—run, a higher rate of interest may arise from

tight money which induces an appreciation rather than a depreciation of the

currency.   It should be emphasized however that during an inflationary

environment (like the one prevailing in the U.S. in recent years) the

variations in the rate of interest are most likely to be dominated by

variations in inflationary expectations rather than by liquidity effects

associated with changes    in the ratio of money to bonds. In such an

environment the rate of interest is expected to be positively correlated with

the exchange rate.

        The discussion provides an illustration of the difficulties associated

with using the rate of interest as the relevant monetary indicator. Traditionally,

the height of the rate of interest was the criterion for assessing whether

monetary policy has been easy or tight: a high interest rate was interpreted

as indicating a tight monetary policy while a low interest rate was interpreted

as indicating an easy monetary policy. By now it is well recognized that

during inflationary periods it is vital to draw a distinction between nominal

and real rates of interest and, as a result, during inflationary periods the

rate of interest may provide a very misleading interpretation of the stance

of monetary policy. The same logic applies with respect to the analysis of the

relationship between exchange rates and interest rates.


        rhe short—run liquidity effects is emphasized in Dornbusch (l976b).
The role of inflationary expectations in dominating excharice rate developments is
emphasized in Frenkel (1976). Frankel (1979) and Edwards (1979) attempt to
integrate these two factors.
                                     32




        The foregoing analysis also provides the explanation for the observation

(which was noted in Section 11.2) that generally there is a positive correlation

between the forward premium on foreign exchange and the level of the spot

rate. Since the spot rate is expected to be positively correlated with

interest rate differential and since according to the interest parity theory

that differential must equal the forward premium on foreign exchange, it

follows that the forward premium is also expected to be positively correlated

with the level of the spot rate.11 That positive correlation may also be

rationalized by noting that currencies which are expected to depreciate

are traded at a discount in the forward market and, on average, these

currencies also command a lower foreign exchange value in the spot market.

        Prior   to proceeding with the empirical evidence on the relationship
between exchange rates and interest rates it   might   be useful to highlight
some of the main features of the monetary approach which are reflected in

equations (11) and (14). First, these equations demonstrate the symmetric

roles that are being played by the supplies of domestic and foreign monies

and the demands for these monies. Since the demands for monies depend on real

variables like real incomes as well as on other real variables which underlie

expectations and rates of interest, it is clear that the monetary approach


        "For evidence on the robustness of the interest parity relationship
see Frenkel and Levich (1977). The positive association between the spot
exchange rate and the forward premium has been interpreted in terms of an
explicit monetary model. It is noteworthy that this positive association
would be predicted by any model in which current exchange rate reflects
immediately the expectations of future depreciation.  See for example Mussa
(1976a) and Frenkel and Mussa (1980). Since the rate  of interest and the
exchange rate are dimensionally incomensurate, their association raise
questions that are familiar from the discussions of the Gibson Paradox. In a
separate paper I intend to examine the relationship between exchange rates
and the forward premium (or the interest differential) in light of the
various explanations of the Gibson Paradox.
does not imply that the exchange rate depends only on the relative supplies

of money; nor does it imply that real variables do not affect the equilibrium

exchange rate. Second, from the policy perspective the monetary approach

 brings to the forefront the implications of the homogeneity postulate:

ceteris paribus a rise in the quantity of money results in an equiproportionate

rise in the exchange rate. This illustrates the intimate connection between

monetary policy and exchange rate policy. Third, the

positive relationship between interest rates and exchange rates and the central

role played by inflationary expectations imply that policies which attempt to

induce an appreciation of the currency should aim at reducing inflationary

expectations. The reduction in inflationary expectations would halt the

depreciation of the currency in terms of goods and in terms of foreign

exchange, and would result in lower nominal rates of interest while maintaining

(or even raising) real rates of interest.

          The discussion in Section II and in particular the contributions by

Mussa (1977, l979a) and Dornbusch (1978) emphasized that the predominant cause

of exchange rate movements are news which could not have been anticipated. It

was also argued in Section II that the forward rate seems to summarize the

information that is available to the market when the forward rate is being

set. We may therefore express the spot rate at period t as a function of

factors which have been known in advance and are summarized by the lagged

forward rate, as well as a function of the tInews.?


(15)      in S = a + b in Ft_i + "news't


          The empirical difficulty is in identifying the variable which measures

the "news." Assuming that asset markets clear relatively fast and that the "news"

are immediately reflected in (unexpected) changes in the rates of interest we

may    write   equation (15) as

and where Eti (i —
                     i*)t   denotes the interest differential which was expected

to prevail in period t based on the information available at t —      1.   The

expected interest rate differential was computed from a regression of the

interest differential on a constant and on two lagged values of the differential.12

The previous analysis of the relationship between interest rate differential

and the exchange rate implies that the coefficient         is expected to be positive.

        Table 4 reports the OLS estimates of equation (16) for the three

exchange rates over the period June 1973—July 1979. As may be seen, in all

cases the coefficients of the unexpected interest differential are positive

and in most cases the coefficients are statistically significant. In order to

verify the importance of using the series of innovations in the interest

differential, Table 4 also reports estimates of regressions which replace the

innovations by the actual series of the interest differential as well as

regressions which include both the innovation and the actual differential.

In all cases the coefficients of the actual interest differential do not
                                  13
differ significantly from zero.        To allow for a simultaneous determination

of interest rates and exchange rates, equation (16) was also estimated using

a two—stage—least—squares estimation procedure. These results are reported in

Table 5 in which again in all cases the coefficients of the        unexpected

interest differential are positive. These coefficients are highly significant



        12An alternative way to compute the expected differential would
use data on the term structure of interest rates. Since data on the
differential of 2—month rates are not readily available, this computation
would require interpolations.

         '3In order to check whether the dollar rescue policies of November 1978
have had a systematic effect on the estimates, these regressions were also
estimated for the period up to September 1978. The results did not change
materially.

On the whole the record shows that during the 1970's exchange rates and

interest rate differential have been associated positively and thus indicating

that during that inflationary period the same factors which induced a rise in

the interest differential also induced a rise in the spot exchange rates.

Furthermore, consistent with the hypothesis that current changes in exchange

rates are primarily a response to new information, the evidence shows the

importance of the innovations in che interest differential.

        The principle that current exchange rates already reflect expectations

concerning the future course of events implies that changes in exchange rates

are primarily due to innovations. In the present section this principle was

applied to the analysis of the relationship between exchange rates and interest

rate differential. The principle however is general. For example, it implies

that the relationship between a deficit in the balance of trade and the

exchange rate depends crucially on whether the deficit was expected or not.

A deficit that was expected may have no effect on the exchange rate since

the latter already reflected these expectations. In contrast, an unexpected

deficit in the balance of trade may contain significant new information that

is likely to induce a strong effect on the exchange rate.14

and the current account see Dornbusch and Fischer (1978) and Rodriguez (1978).

Iv.   Exchange Rates and Prices

       One of the striking facts concerning the relationship between prices

and exchange rates during the 1970's is the extent to which the evolution of

prices and exchange rates have not coincided.        The originators and

proponents of the purchasing power parity doctrine (Wheatley and Ricardo

during the first part of the 19th century and Cassel during the 1920's) have

viewed the doctrine as an extension of the quantity theory of money to the

open economy. By now the concensus seems to be that purchasing power

parities can be expected to hold in the long—run if most of the shocks to

the system are of a monetary origin which do not require changes in relative

prices. To the extent that most of the shocks reflect "real" changes (like

differential growth rates among sectors), the required changes in sectoral

relative prices may result in a relatively loose connection between exchange

rates and aggregate price levels. The experience during the 1970's illustrates

the extent to which real shocks (oil embargo, supply shocks, commodity booms

and shortages, differential productivity growth) result in systematic deviations

from purchasing power parities. As illustrated in Figures 2—4 short run

changes in exchange rates have not been closely linked to short run

differentials in the corresponding national inflation rates, particularly as

measured by consumer price indices. Furthermore, this loose link seems to

be cumulative. As illustrated in Figures 5—7 divergences from purchasing

power parities, measured in terms of the relationship between exchange rates

and the ratio of consumer price indices, seem to persist.

       The loose link between prices and exchange rates is illustrated in

Table 6 which reports the results of regressions of changes in the

exchange rates on changes in (wholesale) prices. As may be seen, for the

Dollar/Pound and the Dollar/Franc exchange rate the slope coefficients are

very close to unity; for the Dollar/DM exchange rate the slope coefficient

is less close to unity. Furthermore, in all cases the parameter estimates

are extremely imprecise. The results are even poorer when the wholesale

price indices are replaced by the cost of living indices. It should be noted,

however, that to some extent this phenomenon is specific to the 1970's.

During the floating rates period of the 1920's, the doctrine of purchasing

power parities seems to have been much more reliable.15

       The discussion in Section II emphasized that in periods which are

dominated by "news," which alter expectations, exchange rates (and other

asset prices) are expected to be highly volatile. Aggregate price indices

on the other hand are not expected to reveal such a degree of volatility since

they reflect the prices of goods and services which are less durable and

therefore are likely to be less sensitive to the news which alter expectations

concerning future course of events. It follows therefore that in periods

during which there are ample "news" which cause large fluctuations in exchange

rates there will also be large deviations from purchasing power parities.16

The different degrees of volatility of prices and exchange rates are

illustrated in Table 7 which reports the average absolute monthly percentage

changes in the various exchange rates and prices. As is evident, the mean

absolute change in the various spot exchange rates has been about 2 percent

per month (and even slightly higher for the changes in the forward rate).

The magnitudes of these changes have been more than double the magnitudes



       1For evidence see Frenkel (1976, 1978, l980b) and Krugman (1978).

       l6 this see Nussa (l979a). It is noteworthy that the emphasis in
the text has been on the words large fluctuations; this should be contrasted
with periods during which there are large secular changes in the exchange
rate (like the changes which occurred during the German hyperinflation).
During such periods the secular changes do not stem necessarily from "news"
and need not be associated with deviations from purchasing power parities.

of   the changes in most of the various price indices as well as in the

ratios of national price levels. For example, the mean monthly change in

the cost of living price index was .4 percent in Germany, .7 percent in the

U.s., .9 percent in France and 1.2 percent in the U.K. These differences are

even more striking for the detrended series.

        The notion that exchange rates have been volatile is clearly illustrated

by Figures 2—4 and by Table 7. The comparison of the magnitudes of the

changes in the exchange rates with the magnitudes of the changes in the price

indices and in the ratios of national price levels may suggest, according

to a narrow interpretation of the purchasing power parity doctrine, that

exchange rate fluctuations have been "excessive." The previous discussion

however has emphasized that exchange rates, being the relative prices of

assets, are fundamentally different from the price indices of goods and

services and therefore are expected to exhibit a different degree of volatility

in particular during periods that are dominated by "news." An alternative

yardstick for measuring the degree of exchange rate fluctuations would be a

comparison with prices of other assets. Indeed, while exchange rate changes

have been large relative to changes in national price levels, they have been

considerably smaller than changes in the prices of other assets like gold,

silver, many other commodities that are traded in organized markets, and

common stocks. For example, Table 7 also reports the mean absolute monthly

percentage change in stock market indices. As may be seen the mean monthly

change in these indices ranged from over 3 percent in Germany to over 6

percent in the U.K. By these standards it is difficult to argue that exchange

rates have been excessively volatile.

        The fundamental difference between the characteristics of exchange

rates and national price levels is also reflected in their time series
properties. The monthly changes in exchangerates exhibit little or no

serial correlation while national price levels do exhibit a degree of serial

correlation. The serial correlation of national price levels has been

rationalized in recent macroeconomic theorizing in terms of costs of price

adjustment, the existence of nominal contracts, confusion between relative

and absolute prices and confusion between permanent and transitory changes.

This difference between the time series properties of exchange rates and

prices is reflected in the low correlation between the practically random

month—to—month exchange rate changes and the serially correlated differences

between national rates of inflation.

       Given the short run deviations from purchasing power parities, it

is relevant to explore whether these deviations tend to diminish with time

or tend to persist or even grow in size. In order to examine the patterns of

the deviations I have computed the autocorrelation functions and the partial

autocorrelation functions of these deviations for the wholesale and the cost

of living price indices. The deviation from purchasing power parities during

month t is denoted by A and is defined as:


(17)      = 2n St —   in(P/P*)

Figures 12—14 illustrate the patterns of the deviations for the three exchange

rates. As may be seen the general pattern is very similar for the three

exchange rates and for the two price indices. In all cases the autocorrelation

function tails off at what seems to be an exponential rate and in all cases

the partial autocorrelation function shows a spike at the first lag. This

pattern seems to indicate (as might have been expected on the basis

of the time series properties of exchange rates and price indices)

that the deviations from purchasing power parities follow a first order

autoregressive process. It is noteworthy, however, that in all cases the

value of the autoregression term is about 0.9 indicating the possibility

that the series may not satisfy the
                                       stationarity requirement. To allow for
this possibility I have also examined the autocorrelation functions and the

partial autocorrelation functions of       —
                                               t—l'   i.e., of the first difference
of the deviations from purchasing power parities. The results indicate that

these differences are serially uncorrelated and thus implying that the

deviations    follow a random walk processP In view of this possibility i

conclude that the deviations from purchasing power parities seem to follow

a first order autoregressive process but that the data do not provide

sufficient evidence to reject the alternative hypothesis of a random walk.

Finally it may be noted that the main difference between accepting the AR(l)

rather than the random walk hypothesis relates to the economic interpretation

of the two alternative processes. The random walk process implies that

deviations from purchasing power parities do not tend to diminish with the

passage of time while the stableAR(l) process implies that there are

mechanisms which operate to ensure that in the long run pruchasing power

parities are satisfied. For the purpose of forecasting the near future,

however, there is a very little difference between using the AR(l) process

with an autoregressive coefficient of 0.9 and using the random walk process.


V. Concluding Remarks

       In this paper I examined some aspects of the operation of flexible

exchange rates. The analysis was based on the experience of the 1970's. The

principle conclusions which may be drawn from the empirical work are:

  (i) In spite of the extraordinary turbulence in the markets for foreign



       171f the deviations follow a random walk process than they do not
entail (ex ante) unexploited profit opportunities. For an analysis of
equilibrium deviations from purchasing power parities see Saidi (1977).

      exchange, it seems that to a large extent the markets have operated

      efficiently. It should be noted however that the concept of

      "efficiency" that is being used in this context is somewhat narrow

      in that it only refers to the notion that the markets do not seem

      to entail unexploited profit opportunities. A broader perspective

      should deal with the social cost of volatility in terms of the

      interference with the efficiency of the price system in guiding

      resource allocation as well as with the cost of alternative outlets

      for the disturbances that are currently reflected in the volatility

      of exchange rates.

(ii) The high volatility of exchange rates (spot and forward) reflect an

      intrinsic characteristic of the relative price of monies and other

     assets. The price of gold, the price of stocks as well as exchange

     rates between national monies depend critically on expectations

      concerning future course of events, and adjust rapidly in response

      to new information. In this perspective the exchange rate (in

     contrast with the relative price of national outputs) is being

     viewed as a financial variable.

(iii) During inflationary periods variations in nominal rates of interest

     are dominated by changes in inflationary expectations; as a result,

     high nominal rates of interest are expected to be associated with

     high exchange rates (a depreciated currency). This relationship was

     demonstrated within the analytical framework of the monetary approach

     to the exchange rate, and was supported by the empirical work. In this

     context the key finding was the dependence of exchange rate changes

     on the changes in the rates of interest. This finding is in accord

     with the analytical prediction that current exchange rates already

     reflect current expectations about the future while changes in the
                                   49




      current exchange rates reflect primarily changes in these expectations

      which, by definition, arise from new information.

 (iv) 'Ifle experience ot trie 1970's does not support the predictions of the

      simple version of the purchasing power parity doctrine which relates

      the values of current prices to current exchange rates. The empirical

      work showed that deviations from purchasing power parities can be

      characterized by a first order autoregressive process.

           One of the key analytical insights that is provided by the

      monetary (or the asset market) approach to the exchange rate is that

      exchange rates do not reflect only current circumstances but also

      reflect those circumstances which are expected to prevail in the

      future. This anticipatory feature of the exchange rate (which is

      emphasized by Mussa, 1979b) does not characterize (at least to such

      a degree) the prices of national outputs. As a result, during periods

     which are dominated by frequent changes in expectations about the future,

      one may expect to find frequent deviations from purchasing power parities

     when the later are computed using current prices.18

of Cassel's birthday (Cassel was born on October 20, 1866) it seems
appropriate to conclude with the quote that reflects this key idea.

   "The international valuation of the currency will, then
   generally show a tendency to anticipate events, so to speak,
   and become more an expression of the internal value that
   the currency is expected to possess in a few months, or
   perhaps in a year's time" (Cassel, 1930, pp. 149—50).

                                    DATA APPENDIX


1. Exchange Rates

      The spot exchange rates are end of month rates obtained from the IMF tape

     (May 1979 version, updated to July 1979 using the November 1979 issue of the

     International Financial Statistics) obtained from the International Monetary Fund.

            The forward exchange rates are end of month rates for one month

      maturity. The forward rates for the U.K. Pound and the DM for the period

      Jund 1973 — June 1978 are bid prices obtained from the International Money

      Market (1MM). For the period July 1978 —      July   1979 they are sell prices

      obtained from the Wall Street Journal. The forward rates for the French

      Franc for the period June 1973 —   July   1974 are bid prices calculated from

      the Weekly Review publication of the Harris Bank which reports the spot rate

      and the forward premium; in each case the closest Friday to the end of the

     month was chosen. For the period August 1974 — June 1978 the rates are bid

     rates obtained from the 1MM and for the period July 1978 —       July   1979 they

     are sell prices obtained from the Wall Street Journal.


2. Prices

     The wholesale and cost of living price indices are period averages obtained

     from the IMP tape, lines 63 and 64, respectively.


3. Rates of Interest

     All interest rates are 1—month Eurocurrency rates obtained from the Weekly

     Review of the Harris Bank. In all cases the figures used correspond to the

     last Friday of each month.


4. Stock Markets

     The stock market indices correspond to the last trading day of the month. The

     sources are Capital International Perspective, Geneva, Switzerland, monthly

     issues.
