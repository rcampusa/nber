Impact of Rural and Urban Hospital Closures on Inpatient Mortality
Kritee Gujral and Anirban Basu
NBER Working Paper No. 26182
August 2019, Revised June 2020
JEL No. I11,I12,I14,I18

                                          ABSTRACT

This paper uses a difference-in-difference approach to examine the impact of California's hospital
closures occurring from 1995-2011 on adjusted inpatient mortality for time-sensitive conditions:
sepsis, stroke, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute myocardial
infarction (AMI). Outcomes of admissions in hospital service areas (HSAs) with and without
closure(s) are compared before and after the closure year. The paper focuses on: 1) the
differential impacts of rural and urban closures, 2) the aggregate patient-level impact across
several post-closure mechanisms, and 3) the effect on Medicare as well as non-Medicare patients.
Results suggest that when treatment groups are not differentiated by hospital rurality, closures
appear to have no measurable impact, i.e. there is no general impact of closures. However,
estimating differential impacts shows that rural closures increase inpatient mortality by 0.78%
points (an increase of 8.7%), whereas urban closures have no measurable impact. Subgroup
analyses indicate the existence of a general impact for stroke and AMI patients (4.4% increase in
inpatient mortality) and relatively worse impacts of rural closures for Medicaid patients and racial
minorities (11.3% and 12.6%, respectively).

1       Introduction
About 15% of U.S. hospitals have closed since 1990 and rates of hospital closure have increased
over the last decade, with rural closures being of particularly high concern (Carroll, 2019). Com-
mon reasons cited for hospital (and emergency department (ED)) closures are weakened hospital
finances resulting from low reimbursement rates and uncompensated care (Lindrooth et al., 2018;
Hodgson et al., 2015). These problems become exacerbated in rural areas. As has been the case
recently, economic downturns can lead to outmigration of rural residents to urban areas. Shrinking
populations imply lower patient volumes at hospitals, which can prevent hospitals from achieving
economies of scale. Moreover, populations left behind may be older, sicker, and uninsured or more
reliant on Medicaid and Medicare, resulting in less favorable payer-mixes at hospitals, making them
susceptible to closures.
    Nonetheless, such market-driven hospital closures can have enormous negative implications for
patient welfare. Hospital closures can severely fracture patient access to care (especially emergency
care), leading to treatment delay and adverse health outcomes (Carroll, 2019; Wishner et al.,
2016). Rural closures, in particular, have been known to increase travel times for patients (Troske
and Davis, 2019; Hsia and Shen, 2011) and to cause outmigration of health care professionals
(Manlove and Whitacre, 2017; Wishner et al., 2016; Germack et al., 2019), severely dismembering
patient access to care and exacerbating social disparities in health outcomes (Song and Saghafian).
On the other hand, given that closing hospitals may have had low volumes prior to closure, it
is theoretically possible that closures ultimately do not result in adverse impact for patients if
patients are rerouted and reallocated appropriately. It is also theoretically possible that closures
result in more efficient reallocation of patients to neighboring hospitals, potentially improving
patient outcomes and welfare. The net patient-level impact of closures, whether rural or urban,
across several such post-closure mechanisms is not well-known, and remains an empirical question
that this paper aims to answer.
    Although previous studies have examined the reasons for (Lindrooth et al., 2018; Wishner
et al., 2016; Friedman et al., 2016) and the financial and economic impact of hospital closures
(Manlove and Whitacre, 2017; Hodgson et al., 2015), literature studying the effect of hospital
closures on patient outcomes is relatively sparse and lacks sufficient consensus for guiding informed
policy-making. Large-scale published studies have found no impact of hospital (or ED) closures
on patient mortality (Joynt et al., 2015; Hsia et al., 2012; Rosenbach and Dayhoff, 1995), with
some evidence of improved outcomes, i.e. a reduction in mortality, for heart attack patients (Joynt
et al., 2015). Only one published county-level study (Buchmueller et al., 2006) thus far has shown
adverse patient-level impact, i.e., an increase in deaths due to urban hospital closures. Additional
studies examining the impact of hospital closures on patient outcomes are necessary given the
accelerated rate of closures, especially rural, in recent years (GAO, 2018; Kaufman et al., 2016b).
Such crucial efforts are underway; recent working papers (Song and Saghafian; Carroll, 2019) do find
that hospital closures can increase mortality. Nonetheless, most of this emerging and existing work
has focused on Medicare patients (Song and Saghafian; Carroll, 2019; Joynt et al., 2015; Rosenbach
and Dayhoff, 1995). As post-closure health access barriers may be greater for the uninsured and
Medicaid populations, there is a need for studies that also include these populations.1 Furthermore,
despite studying similar diagnostic conditions, results differ across the set of emerging and existing
    1
    Liu et al. (2014) and Hsia et al. (2012) do study patient outcomes for these populations, but in the context of
ED closures, and the impact of ED closures may be smaller and/or different compared to that of hospital closures.
For instance, hospitals may have multiple EDs such that the effect of an ED closure could be smaller than that of
a hospital closure. Further, the interruption of services due to the loss of a full hospital, which include potentially
long-term losses of medical staff and other community resources, may be larger than that of an ED closure.

studies, of Medicare population studies, of California-specific studies (Liu et al., 2014; Hsia et al.,
2012; Buchmueller et al., 2006), and of ED closure studies (Liu et al., 2014; Hsia et al., 2012). This
warrants further discussion of the nuances, such as study design differences or population differences,
that lead to differing results and implications. Additional research will provide more evidence on
and help elucidate these nuances, thereby improving policy recommendations concerning closures.
    This paper studies the impact of rural and urban hospital closures in California, 1995-2011, on
inpatient mortality for time-sensitive conditions: sepsis, stroke, asthma/COPD, or acute myocar-
dial infarction (AMI). Post-closure mechanisms that raise concerns (such as longer travel time or
overcrowding at surrounding hospitals) are likely to result in larger adverse impacts for patients
with time-sensitive conditions. These conditions also offer comparability with prior work (Carroll,
2019; Liu et al., 2014; Joynt et al., 2015; Hsia et al., 2012; Buchmueller et al., 2006). This paper's
novel contribution is its focus on three nuances for analyzing the impact of closures: 1) the dif-
ferential impact of rural and urban hospital closures, 2) controlling for unobserved time-invariant
hospital characteristics, and 3) including Medicare as well as non-Medicare populations.
    Previous patient-impact studies either examine rural closures while ignoring concurrent urban
closures, which makes it difficult to disentangle the isolated effect of rural closures2 or study the
general effect by treating all hospital closures alike, without distinguishing between rural and urban
hospitals. However, there are baseline differences between rural and urban health care markets
such as rural patients experiencing larger transportation times, larger health care access barriers,
bypassing nearby hospitals, and using hospitals for primary care needs, compared to urban patients
(Lindrooth et al., 2018; Kaufman et al., 2016a; Premkumar et al., 2016; Wishner et al., 2016; Hsia
and Shen, 2011). Additionally, there are post-closure differences; rural patients experience a 76%
increase in ambulance transportation time post-closure in their zipcode, whereas urban patients
do not experience any change in transportation time post-closure in their zipcode.3 While urban
patients have been shown to shift their usual source-of-care from hospitals to physicians' offices,
which are viewed as more appropriate sources for primary care (Buchmueller et al., 2006), no such
favorable substitution is observed for rural patients (Rosenbach and Dayhoff, 1995). There may
also be larger declines in physician and health care staff availability in rural areas post-closure
(Rosenbach and Dayhoff, 1995) compared to urban areas, exacerbating rural patients' baseline
pattern of seeking primary care at hospitals. Given such baseline differences and post-closure
differences, the overall effect of a rural hospital closure, which includes transportation delays and
related spillover effects, is hypothesized to be larger than that of an urban closure. Theoretically
possible post-closure improvements in patient outcomes may also differ depending on whether the
closing hospital was rural or urban. Hence, this paper allows for differential impacts of rural and
urban closures.
    Finally, even with the usual generalizability limitations that accompany a state-specific study,
California is an important state to study because it has historically been and continues to remain
a state with high number of hospital closures (Nicholas C Petris Center, 2001; OIG, 2000; Troske
and Davis, 2019). With early closures in the U.S. being concentrated in California and high data
availability in the state, this study can offer insights, bifurcated by rural and urban closures, that
move the needle forward for national research and policy efforts concerning closures, especially
   2
     Neglecting to account for concurrent urban closures can confound estimates of rural closures (or vice versa). For
instance, if urban closures decrease mortality, but are not controlled for when studying the impact of rural closures,
the effect of rural closures may be overestimated. If urban closures increase mortality but are not controlled for,
the impact of rural closures would be underestimated. This paper limits confounding of this sort by appropriately
accounting for both types of closures.
   3
     Miller et al. (2020) also find that rural hospital closures increased mean emergency medical services transport
and total activation times in the year after a closure.



                                                          2
given that relatively more rural states that may be more vulnerable offer lower data access. To our
best knowledge, this is the first paper drawing explicit focus to rural closures in California.
    The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the methodology and data sources; Section
3 presents descriptive results, primary results estimating the general and differential impacts of
closures, and subgroup analyses and robustness checks. Section 4 presents the concluding discussion.


2        Methodology
Using a difference-in-difference (DID) approach, two primary specifications were used for examining
the impact of hospital closures on inpatient mortality:

        · General impact of hospital closures

        · Differential impacts of rural and urban closures

    Section 2.1 outlines the definition of "affected patients" used, Section 2.2 details the estimation
strategy, discussing the two above-mentioned specifications, and Section 2.3 describes the data.

2.1        Definition of "Affected Patients"
Several prior studies (Carroll, 2019; Hsia et al., 2012; Buchmueller et al., 2006) define "affected
patients" in relation to the change in geographic distance to the nearest hospital that was expe-
rienced post-closure. While distance is an important factor determining patient choice, especially
in rural areas, distance sensitivity can vary for different types of procedures (Premkumar et al.,
2016) and other factors such as hospital size, technologies available, hospital quality may addition-
ally influence hospital choice (Premkumar et al., 2016; Hodgson et al., 2015; Escarce and Kapur,
2009). Moreover, geodetic distances, driving distances, and driving times may sometimes suffer
from measurement inaccuracies (Hsia et al., 2012). Given that prior California-specific studies (two
of which use such metrics) (Hsia et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2014; Buchmueller et al., 2006) find differing
implications for mortality (albeit due to other differences in study designs), this paper takes an
approach for defining "affected patients."
    Similar to Joynt et al. (2015) and Rosenbach and Dayhoff (1995), this paper uses Hospital
Service Areas (HSAs), which represent local health care markets representing patients' past travel
patterns, to define "affected patients." Patients are considered affected if their residential zip codes
were part of HSA(s) that experienced a hospital closure. Appendix A.1 presents maps that help
illustrate the concept of HSAs visually.
    Advantages of such HSA-based definition are:

        · Inclusion of the transportation delay mechanism, which may occur due to increased distance,
          increased drive time, or increased ambulance time.

        · Inclusion of multiple other mechanisms:

            ­ Immediate as well as delayed outcomes due to delayed or foregone care post-closures.
            ­ Effects on patients seeking care both within and outside their residential HSA.4
    4
    This HSA-based definition of affected patients vs. HSA-based definition of affected hospitals overcomes a limita-
tion noted in Liu et al. (2014): if affected patients switch HSAs post-closures, the effect on those patients would be
missed if studying affected hospitals.




                                                          3
           ­ Ripple effects, such as overcrowding and overburdening of hospitals, on surrounding
             communities within the HSA (similar concerns as those raised in Song and Saghafian;
             Hodgson et al. (2015); Liu et al. (2014)).5
           ­ Potentially reduced quality at surrounding hospitals due to lower hospital market com-
             petition when prices are market-determined (Frakt, 2019).
           ­ Increased efficiency at surrounding hospitals (Gaynor et al., 2015).

       · Reduction in confounding of estimates due to inadequate control of simultaneous post-closure
         mechanisms that may occur when studying one specific post-closure mechanism without con-
         trolling for the others.

    Naturally then, the primary disadvantage of such HSA-based definition of affected patients is
its inability to distinguish between the various mechanisms of impact, limiting immediate policy
implications from emerging. Nonetheless, it is important to estimate the overall impact of hospital
closures, in case the adverse effects of closures are sparsely distributed across several mechanisms
and are therefore being missed when studying one mechanism at a time when using a conservative
measure of adverse effect such as mortality. Given that scholars are currently split on whether
or not hospital closures have any adverse impact on patients, the paper furthers policy efforts by
helping to reduce this divide.

2.2      Estimation Strategy
A "staggered" difference-in-difference (DID) approach, or DID with multiple time periods (Steven-
son and Wolfers, 2006), is used for estimating the impact of closures. This study design is useful
when the same policy is implemented in different regions non-concurrently, or staggeringly. It mea-
sures the effect of a policy, hospital closure in this case, which is constant across time, reasons of
closure, and geographical units. We compare patient mortality in hospital service areas (HSAs)
with and without closure(s), before and after the closure year. The estimate of interest is the
difference between the pre- to post-treatment period change in outcomes for the treatment group
and the pre-to post-treatment period change in outcomes for the control group. This methodology
allows for the treatment and control groups to have different levels of mortality, but assumes that
the treatment and control groups would have followed a similar mortality trend or trajectory in the
absence of treatment. As the control group is never affected by closures, it is randomly assigned to
treatment years for the purposes of the analysis.6
    Two types of effects were estimated: 1) The general impact of closures and 2) the differential
impacts of rural and urban closures.

2.2.1      General Impact of Closures
A general impact of hospital closures, in which no distinction is made between patients who expe-
rience a rural closure vs. those who experience an urban closure, is estimated first. We estimate
   5
     Note that overcrowding and overburdening may lead to negative outcomes at hospitals outside the affected HSA.
Such spillover effects from and on patients that travel outside their residential HSA to seek care post-closure would be
included in the treatment effect. However, spillover effects that negatively affect patients of unaffected HSAs would
be part of the control group effect. Thus, any adverse treatment effect due to spillovers would be conservatively
estimated.
   6
     We also run analyses without such random assignment of control groups to treatment year. This implies there is
no P ostt variable, as shown in Eq. 1. The results are very similar.




                                                           4
the following probability:

   P (Y = 1|g, t) = F (0 + 1 (T reatg ) + 2 (P ostt ) + 3 (T reatg  P ostt ) + 4 Xigt + Hi + Tt )                 (1)


where F is a logit function and 0  F  1. Yigt is a binary variable indicating whether an admission
resulted in death at the hospital. T reatg indicates whether or not the admitted patient's HSA was
ever affected in the 1995-2011 period. P ostt indicates whether an admission occurred prior to or
after the closure. T reatg  P ostt indicates whether the admission is from an affected HSA and
occurs in that HSA's post-closure period. Xigt are admission-level and hospital-level covariates
that can impact inpatient mortality. Hi are hospital fixed effects and Tt are year fixed effects. 3
is the parameter of interest.

2.2.2    Differential Impacts of Rural and Urban Closures
As mentioned earlier, this paper allows for potentially different effects of rural vs. urban hospital
closures, which also provides adequate controlling of one type of closure while examining the impact
of the other. A staggered DID approach with two treatment groups is used: 1) admissions affected
due to a rural hospital closure, and 2) admissions affected due to an urban hospital closure.
    We estimate the following:


 P (Y = 1|g, t) =F (0 + 1 (RuralT reatg ) + 2 (RuralP ostt ) + 3 (RuralT reatg  RuralP ostt )
                  +4 (U rbanT reatg ) + 5 (U rbanP ostt ) + 6 (U rbanT reatg  U rbanP ostt )+                     (2)
                    7 Xigt + Hi + Tt )

    Equation 2 above is similar to Equation 1, except in its treatment variables. RuralT reatg
indicates whether or not the admitted patient's HSA was ever affected by a rural hospital clo-
sure in the 1995-2011 period. RuralP ostt indicates whether the admission occurred prior to or
after a rural closure. RuralT reatg  RuralP ostt indicates whether the admission is from such
an HSA and occurs in that HSA's post-rural closure period. U rbanT reatg indicates whether or
not the admitted patient's HSA was ever affected by an urban hospital closure in the 1995-2011
period. U rbanP ostt indicates whether the admission occurred prior to or after an urban closure.
U rbanT reatg  U rbanP ostt indicates whether the admission is from such an HSA and occurs in
that HSA's post-urban closure period. 3 and 6 are the parameters of interest.

2.2.3    Exogeneity of Treatment
Concerns may arise that the impact of hospital closure is endogenous to hospital behavior or hospital
quality (Carroll, 2019). That is, hospitals of lower quality or hospitals with worse behavior may
be more likely to close. In such cases, HSAs affected by closure may exhibit worse outcomes due
to worse hospitals in those areas, and not because of closure. To address such concerns, we exploit
the variation in timings of and reasons for closures. This makes it highly unlikely that results are
due to changes in hospital quality or behavior (unrelated to closures) that coincide perfectly with
time of closure of various hospitals. Additionally, we include hospital fixed effects, which control
for any time-invariant hospital-specific effects, including time-invariant hospital quality.7
   7
    Note also that there is no evidence that affected HSAs or closing hospitals provide lower quality of care (even
though patients may perceive certain rural hospitals to be of poor quality based on anecdotal evidence (Wishner
et al., 2016; Escarce and Kapur, 2009)); instead, the bulk of the literature points to differences in financial health


                                                          5
    Next, there may be concerns that hospital closures occur in HSAs where individual patients are
relatively older, sicker, poorer, more likely to be racial minorities, and more likely to be uninsured,
and that the outcomes observed are a result of these characteristics rather than due to closing of
hospitals. Thus, to control for disease severity and poverty status, we include in our estimation
patient characteristics such as age, Elixhauser co-morbidities (Stagg, 2015), admission source vari-
ables, insurance status and an indicator for whether an admission is from a rural or urban zip code
are used. Lastly, it is important to note that the DID methodology allows for level differences in
covariates across treatment and control groups and is sensitive to trend differences in unobserved
covariates linked to increased treatment exposure. To that effect, we observe the relevant variables
and show that trends for these variables do not differ between treatment and control groups prior
to closure (see Appendix A.2), making it unlikely that trends of unobserved variables exhibit dif-
ferential trends. However, if hospital closures were occurring due to unobserved trend changes in
covariates, the results presented in this paper would not be interpreted causally. We also conduct
analyses using event study specifications, which confirm a lack of pre-trends that re-affirm the
validity of the DID methodology (See Appendix A.3).

2.3     Data
A list of closed hospitals in the 1995-2011 period was developed using OSHPD discharge data,
1995-2011, and confirming this list of potential closures against multiple other sources.8 Patient
characteristics and the outcome variable indicating inpatient mortality were obtained from OSHPD
patient discharge data, 1995-2011, and hospital characteristics were obtained from corresponding
OSHPD Hospital Financials Data. The Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care crosswalks was used for
matching zipcodes to HSAs and USDA ERS RUCA codes 2004 were used for assigning rurality
status to patient residential zipcodes and to hospitals.9 Zipcode population density was obtained
from the 2000 decennial census maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau. Annual county-level unem-
ployment data were obtained from California Economic Development Departments "Labor Force
Data."

2.3.1    Variables
The outcome variable, inpatient mortality, is a binary variable created using the "disposition [at the
end of the hospital stay]" variable in OSHPD discharge data, which includes in-hospital death as one
of the values. Patient characteristics include age, gender, race, diagnostic condition co-morbidities,
admission source variables, insurance status, and the rurality status of patients residence. Hospital
characteristics include hospital ownership type, number of medical staff, number of hospital beds,
bed availability ratio, proportion of Medi-Cal patients, and hospital fixed effects. Area and market
characteristics include county-level unemployment rate, zipcode-level population density from the
year 2000, and market concentration/competition (calculated for each patient's HSA for hospitals
that never closed) associated with each patient admission.


3     Results
Sections 3.1 and 3.2 present descriptive results, which are followed by estimates of the general
impact of hospital closure and the differential impacts of rural and urban closures in 3.3 and
and efficiency of treated vs. non-treated facilities (a point also noted by Carroll (2019)).

3.1      Common Trends
As mentioned earlier, the DID methodology assumes that treatment and control groups would have
followed similar mortality trends in the absence of treatment. As shown in Figure 1, the treatment
and control groups follow a roughly similar mortality trend prior to the year for all three types
of treatment groups: general (i.e. all hospital closures without distinguishing whether rural or
urban), rural closures, and urban closures. Furthermore, such visual evidence is useful for setting
expectations for the potential impacts to be discovered in the estimation (Wing et al., 2018). As can
be seen, while there appears to be no difference in mortality post-closure for the general and urban
treatment (Figures 1a and 1c, respectively), rural closures appear to increase mortality (Figure 1b).

group vs. control group over time



3.2      Baseline Characteristics
In this section, we present baseline characteristics of control and treatment groups, which help
demonstrate that control and treatment groups are well-balanced and further assure that control
and treatment groups are unlikely to have differential trends for unobserved characteristics. Table
1 presents proportions (for dichotomous variables), means (for non-dichotomous variables) and the
standardized differences10 between treatment and control groups. Although there is no universally
agreed upon criterion regarding what constitutes important imbalance between treatment and
control groups, a standardized difference less than 0.1 is considered negligible (Austin, 2011). It
can be seen that there are no meaningful differences between the proportions of patients presenting
with AMI, stroke, and asthma/COPD in control vs. treatment groups for both rural closures
treatment and urban closures treatment. Treatment areas are slightly less likely to have sepsis
admissions. Differences between control and treatment groups are also negligible for most of the
Elixhauser co-morbidities and for many of the remaining covariates.
    We do note some expected differences across control and treatment groups. Rural closures
treatment group is much more likely to include patients from rural zipcodes compared to the
control and urban closures treatment group is much less likely to have patients from rural zipcodes
compared to the control. Urban treatment group admissions are slightly more likely to be seen
at hospitals that were investor hospitals and slightly less likely to be seen at district hospitals.

Rural closures treatment admissions are more likely to occur at hospitals with higher percentage
of Medi-Cal days and with higher availability of beds, and more likely to be from areas with
lower population density and higher unemployment, compared to control. Urban treatment group
admissions exhibit roughly opposite patterns with respect to these latter variables, and additionally
are more likely to occur at hospitals with a much larger number of beds. For the DID estimation
to be valid, such differences between treatment and control groups must be stable over time and
changes in treatment exposure should not be linked to changes in the distribution of covariates
(Wing et al., 2018). Differences noted here are consistent with several previous studies examining
hospital closures using different data sets from different time periods. As the distributions of
the covariates appear consistent with expectations from prior work and as trends of key observed
variables do not appear different (see Appendix A.2), there is sufficient confidence that differences
in trends of unobserved variables are not driving the estimation results in this paper.

Asterisks indicate a standardized difference of magnitude greater than 0.1.
Baseline values for closures occurring in 1995 could not be observed in the data.


3.3    General and Differential Impacts
In this section, we present the main results estimating the impact of closures. As can be seen by
the marginal effects presented in Table 2, when no distinction is made between HSAs affected due
to rural closures vs. due to urban closures, there is no statistically significant impact of hospital
closure on inpatient mortality, i.e. there is no discernible general impact of closures on inpatient
mortality. In contrast, when examining the impacts of rural and urban closures differentially, it can
be seen that rural hospital closures have a statistically significant impact; they increase inpatient
mortality by 0.78% points (an increase of 8.7%) whereas urban closures have no measurable impact
on inpatient mortality. These differential impacts are consistent with our hypotheses that rural
closures are likely to have larger adverse patient-level impacts than urban closures. These results
offer one possible explanation for a lack of published evidence on adverse patient-level impact of
hospital closures. That is, combining rural and urban closures as one treatment group can mask
harmful impact of certain types of closures.

3.4       Subgroup Analyses & Robustness Checks
We now present subgroup analyses that provide robustness checks on the results presented and
shed additional insight into the potential mechanisms underlying the observed results. A results
summary is presented in Table 3 and details are presented in Appendix A.6. Table 3 shows that
when the analysis sample is restricted to patients from urban zipcodes, the adverse impact of
rural closures persists, albeit slightly smaller at 7.6%, compared to the overall effect of 8.7%.
This suggests that the effects observed are not driven from rural zipcodes alone, confirming that
differential unobserved trends of rural zipcodes are not driving the results observed, and indicating
that rural closures affect neighboring urban zipcodes. Next, concerns may arise that rural closure
treatment areas follow differential trends than control areas, which include HSAs that have no
rural hospital. To address this concern, we restrict the sample to patients from HSAs that had at
least one rural hospital, and find that the effect of rural closures persists; rural closures increase
mortality by 8.8% for this subgroup.
    As can be seen in Table 3, rural closures increase inpatient mortality for Medicare patients by
7.3% and for Medicaid patients by 11.3%. This larger adverse effect for Medicaid patients compared
to that for Medicare patients is consistent with the hypothesis that access issues are likely greater
for the non-Medicare population, leading to worse outcomes for these populations. Rural closures
increase mortality for White patients by 7.4% and for Non-White patients by 12.6%, despite the
fact that rural closure treatment group has a higher proportion of White patients, compared to
the control group. Again, this suggests that racial minorities, who may face larger health access
barriers, may be disproportionately affected by hospital closures. These results emphasize concerns
that hospital closures can exacerbate existing health care access issues for vulnerable populations
and potentially worsen health outcome disparities.
    Owing to smaller sample sizes when examining subgroups by condition, we group together
conditions that are relatively most time-sensitive.11 Combining AMI and stroke admissions, we
  11
       Summarized results for each diagnostic condition are also presented in Table 3, with related details presented in



                                                            11
find both a general impact on mortality, an increase of 4.4%, and a differential impact of rural
closures, an increase of 10%, and no measurable impact of urban closures. When analyzing sepsis,
stroke, and AMI patients (and excluding the least time-sensitive condition of asthma/COPD), we
find that rural closures increase mortality by 10% (larger than the overall increase of 8.7% for
all conditions). When studying asthma/COPD, we find no impact of hospital closures, general or
differential. This null result for asthma/COPD is consistent with prior studies of hospital (and ED)
closures (Buchmueller et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2014) and suggests that relatively more time-sensitive
conditions are likely to exhibit larger adverse patient-level effects (Buchmueller et al., 2006). We
do find a somewhat surprising result for sepsis patients; while rural closures increase mortality by
10.6%, as is consistent with Mohr et al. (2017), urban closures decrease mortality, i.e. improve
patient outcomes, by 4.4%. Additional research mapping the effect of closures across various
diagnostic categories and research examining potentially positive, i.e. patient outcome-improving,
mechanisms post-closures will be helpful for further understanding.
    Next, we examine the impact of hospital closures on length of stay (LOS) as LOS can provide
an additional signal of quality of care and can shed light on burdened utilization. We find that
rural closures increase LOS by 5.2% or 6.6 hours. Although the link between LOS and quality of
care can be debated,12 increases in LOSs can contribute to significant overcrowding (Henneman
et al., 2010). As shown in Table 3, when examining various subgroups, the adverse mortality
impact of rural closures is always accompanied by an increase in LOS. As is the case with rural
closures' impact on mortality, the impact of rural closures on LOS is larger for racial minorities,
compared to Whites and larger for Medicaid populations, compared to Medicare populations. This
pattern of alignment between rural closures' impact on LOS and on mortality suggests potentially
decreased quality of care post-closures or increased complications underlying the observed increase
in mortality, while also suggesting hospital overcrowding due to longer LOSs.
Table 9 of Appendix A.6.
  12
     While shorter LOSs can indicate poor quality of care if hospitals respond to financial pressures by reducing service
durations and discharge patients earlier than appropriate, longer LOSs can indicate poor quality of care or of ED
crowding that can result in complications that lead to longer LOSs. Despite the recent trend of shortening LOSs,
recent body of evidence favors the link between increased LOS and poor quality/mortality (Tran et al., 2018; McRae
et al., 2017; Chaou et al., 2016; Pines et al., 2010; Thomas et al., 1997).

4    Discussion
To summarize, the paper finds no measurable impact of hospital closures when all closures are
considered alike, i.e. no distinction is made between a rural vs. urban hospital closure. When
examining the differential impact of hospital closures, rural closures increase inpatient mortality
by 8.7%, whereas urban closures have no measurable impact.
    The lack of a measurable general impact of hospital closures is a finding consistent with Joynt
et al. (2015); Hsia et al. (2012); Rosenbach and Dayhoff (1995), which also do not find any mea-
surable impact of hospital (or ED) closures on mortality.As noted in Hsia et al. (2012), a majority
of patients in California experience a less than 10 minutes increase in driving time and a median
increase of 0.8 miles post-ED closures. If changes in distance and driving times post-hospital clo-
sures are similar, then detecting a general impact of closures on mortality through this particular
mechanism would be difficult. As mortality may capture only relatively worse effects, smaller effects
of closures may be better captured using measures such as readmissions or morbidity (Hsia et al.,
2012). Additionally, our analysis does not study out-of-hospital mortality, implying that patients
who may have died before generating a hospital admission would be missed (similar to (Liu et al.,
2014; Hsia et al., 2012)). As such, the results of this paper are conservative estimates of the impact
of hospital closures on patient outcomes. Furthermore, recall that the methodology used allows for
theoretically possible mechanisms, such as improved efficiency and quality at surrounding hospitals,
which can improve patient outcomes and could offset some of the adverse effects of closures, leading
to an overall null result.
    The estimated differential impacts of rural and urban closures are consistent with our hypoth-
esis that rural closures likely have larger adverse impacts on patients than urban closures. That
is, given that there are baseline differences and post-closure differences between rural and urban
health care markets, it is reasonable that the overall effect of a rural hospital closure, which in-
cludes transportation delays and related spillover effects, differs from that of urban closures. Our
results emphasize that combining rural and urban closures as one treatment group can mask the
detrimental impact of rural closures.
    Additional subgroup analyses presented in the paper suggest that time-sensitivity of the diag-
nostic conditions likely influences the presence of adverse patient outcomes. These analyses also
show that the adverse impact of rural closures is larger for Medicaid populations and racial mi-
norities, suggesting that existing health access issues experienced by these subgroups might worsen
post-closures. This is consistent with expectations emphasized in prior hospital and ED closure
literature that post-closures health outcomes may be disproportionately worse for lower-income and
other vulnerable subgroups that are most affected by health access barriers (Song and Saghafian;
Hsia and Shen, 2011; Buchmueller et al., 2006). We also find evidence of spillover effects; when the
analysis sample is restricted to urban patients, we find that rural closures increase mortality by
7.6%, i.e. rural closures increase mortality also for patients that reside in urban zipcodes. Addi-
tionally, rural closures increase length of stay for emergency conditions by 5.2% or about 7 hours,
and this can cause significant overcrowding (Henneman et al., 2010). Substantial spillover effects
of hospital (and ED) closures are also noted in Song and Saghafian; Liu et al. (2014).
    As mentioned earlier, although this paper's approach captures multiple mechanisms through
which hospital closures can impact patient mortality and estimates net impacts of closures across
these mechanisms, it is unable to distinguish between them. Further research is needed for un-
derstanding each individual mechanism, keeping in mind that adverse effects on mortality may
be sparsely distributed across these channels. Using an intermediate measure of adverse patient
outcomes, such as readmission or co-morbidity instead of mortality, may be particularly helpful
for studies attempting to isolate the impact of a given mechanism. Additional research tracing the

                                                 14
impact of closures across all diagnostic categories will also shed light on important post-closure
mechanisms. Nevertheless, this paper contributes to the emerging concord in very recent studies
(Carroll, 2019; Song and Saghafian; Liu et al., 2014) that hospital (and ED) closures do lead to
increased patient mortality which may be distributed across various channels. This helps comple-
ment and extend earlier understandings of the effect of closures on patients. These results warrant
serious consideration by hospital administrators and policymakers. While policy instruments that
tackle root causes for closures appear less straightforward, there is a need to pay closer attention to
rural closures, to ensure emergency transportation and health care accessibility post-closures, espe-
cially for vulnerable populations, and to manage increased and potentially differential health-care
demands post-closures at surrounding hospitals, particularly if there are simultaneous reductions
in the long-term supply of health care professionals.

A.1    Appendix: Map: Zip-Level Rurality, Closures, and HSA Boundaries
The maps in Figure 2 below show the classificaiton of zipcodes into rural and urban (in colors
grey and tan, respectively), zipcodes where rural and urban closures occurred (in colors orange and
purple, respectively), and the boundaries for affected HSAs (in dark brown outline). The zoomed in
version of the map shows that within an HSA, there are both rural and urban zipcodes surrounding
a rural hospital closure. Thus, note that a rural hospital closure can affect both rural and urban
zipcodes.

A.2    Appendix: Control vs. Rural Treatment Trends for Relevant Observed
       Variables
The DID methodology is sensitive to unobserved differential trends across treatment and control
groups that may be linked to increased treatment exposure. Note, we observe relevant variables, i.e.
variables that may be linked to increased treatment exposure, and we present trends comparing the
rural treatment group and the control group for these variables. As can be seen in Figure 3, trends
for rural treatment and control appear roughly similar prior to closure. This provides confidence
that our estimation results are unlikely to be driven by differential trends of unobserved variables.

A.3    Appendix: Event Study Specifications
We additionally run event study specifications to visually test for pre-trends. Given that our
empirical approach includes two treatment groups, we run two separate event study specifications;
one for rural closures treatment and another for urban closures treatment, as shown in Equations
3 and 4:
                        10
 P (Y = 1|g, t) =F (           m (RuralT reatg  1(RuralP ostY eart = m)) + 21 (RuralT reatg )
                       m=-10
                                                                                                     (3)
                   + 22 (U rbanT reatg ) + 23 (U rbanP ostt ) + 24 (U rbanT reatg  U rbanP ostt )
                   + 25 Xigt + Hi + Tt + 0 )


                         10
  P (Y = 1|g, t) =F (          n (U rbanT reatg  1(U rbanP ostY eart = n)) + 1 (U rbanT reatg )
                       n=-10
                                                                                                     (4)
                    + 22 (RuralT reatg ) + 23 (RuralP ostt ) + 24 (RuralT reatg  RuralP ostt )
                    + 25 Xigt + Hi + Tt + 0 )

where 1(RuralP ostY ear = m) indicates whether or not an admission occurred in m years relative
to a rural closure and similarly, 1(U rbanP ostY ear = n) indicates whether or not an admission
occurred in n years relative to an urban closure. m and n are the parameters of interest, estimating
the impacts of rural closures in each mth year relative to rural closure and estimating the impacts
of urban closures in each nth year relative to urban closure, respectively. Two separate event study
specifications are run because if an admission occurred in an HSA that experienced a rural closure,
but did not experience an urban closure, there is no appropriate value to use for the relative year
to urban closure, or n. Thus, Equation 3 provides event study estimates only for patients that were
affected by rural closures (while controlling for the effects of urban closures, i.e. 22 - 24 , for those
patients), and Equation 4 provides event study estimates for patients that were affected by urban
closures (while controlling for the effects of rural closures, i.e. 22 - 24 , for those patients).
    Figure 4 below presents coefficients from the logit models, i.e. Equations 3, and 4 and shows a
lack of pre-trends for both rural closures estimates and urban closures estimates. It also shows an
increase in mortality due to rural closures and no measurable impact of urban closures, confirming
the findings of the DID analysis presented in the main text of this paper. As there may have been
an anticipatory effect in the year just prior to closure, this potential anticipatory effect, although
statistically insignificant, has been removed from Figure 4a for the purposes of showing pre-trends.

A.4     Appendix: Closed Hospitals Data
Recent working papers have pointed to the lack of a centralized list of hospital closures and some
data issues in identifying closures (Song and Saghafian; Carroll, 2019), and thus, in this section, we
provide a detailed description of the the development and verification of the list of closed hospitals
used for our analysis.
     OSHPD patient discharge data from 1995 to 2011 is used for identifying hospital closures with
a process comparable to that used in Song and Saghafian. A hospital is defined as "closed" if its
general acute care admissions dropped to 10 or less in a given year (and remained so in subsequent
years) from 1995 to 2011.15 "Closure year" was defined as the year prior to the year in which
hospital admissions dropped to 10 or less.16
     To distinguish appropriately between closed hospitals and hospitals that may exhibit 10 or fewer
admissions due to a name/hospital identifier change (owing to a merger or ownership change not
resulting in closure), additional sources were consulted for confirming closures. Sources consulted
include government reports (OIG, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999), closed hospitals list from the LA
Times (LA Times Data Desk, 2019), and academic publications and reports (Hodgson et al., 2015;
Buchmueller et al., 2006; Nicholas C Petris Center, 2001).17 , 18 After the confirmation process, a
list of 139 potential closures identified using admissions data was reduced to a list of 99 hospital
closures.19 Seven of the 99 hospitals, which closed and re-opened in the same year and in the
same zip code, were excluded from the list of closed hospitals. The resulting 92 hospitals are the
confirmed closures used for this analysis.20
     Next, using 2004 data from United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Economic Re-
search Service (ERS), hospitals were assigned a rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) code based
on the hospital's zip code. RUCA codes were used for classifying hospitals as rural or urban (con-
sistent with Holmes et al. (2017)). Rural classifications were further confirmed using other sources
where hospital closures were reported and using additional internet search.21 The 92 hospitals were
thus classified as follows: 16 rural and 76 urban.
     Some discrepancies across other sources of hospital closure lists are worth mentioning here.
Hospitals appearing in one data source for a given time period were sometimes entirely excluded
from other sources reporting closures in the same period. Additionally, there were some discrep-
ancies regarding the exact year of closure, where the margin of error was typically a year, but in a
few cases, this error margin ranged from 3 to 9 years. Because of these discrepancies, the present
method for identifying closures has been explicitly outlined, and the resulting list is compared to
the primary sources consulted.
  15
     Additional sources mentioned in the next paragraph are used for identifying closures in 2011, as admissions data
for 2012 were not available and thus a potential drop in admissions in 2012 cannot be identified.
  16
     Alternate analyses using a modified definition of "closure year" were also conducted. That is, instead of using
the year prior, "closure year" was defined as the very year in which a hospital's admissions dropped to 10 or less,
and results of this analysis were very similar to the results presented in the paper.
  17
     Closed hospitals data, not used in the published version of Hodgson et al. (2015), was also obtained from the
authors.
  18
     Numerous other sources, such as non-profit organization reports (CHCF, 2015; HASC, 2010) and news articles
announcing individual hospital closures (or suggesting lack thereof), were also used, but are not all listed here. A
complete list of these sources can be provided upon request.
  19
     Note that this confirmation process may have resulted in excluding real but under-publicized closures, and thus
remains a conservative list of closures. Nevertheless, as will be discussed later in this section, this paper ensures
inclusion of the largest number of closures in California, and potential exclusion of a few such hospitals is unlikely to
be a problem.
  20
     A complete list of these closures is provided in supplemental materials.
  21
     Only one hospital, which was classified as urban using RUCA codes, was updated to being "rural" based on other
reporting.


                                                           25
    Table 4 compares the number of closures in each year with those reported in four of the primary
sources consulted. As can be seen, there are discrepancies in number of closures per year across
the sources consulted. Nevertheless, the closure list by year is largely consistent with that of the
LA times. It also picks up the largest or second largest number of hospital closures in most years.
However, as closure year definitions across sources vary slightly, lists by year appear less compatible
than comparisons of exact hospitals in each list. Thus, Table 5 compares the actual hospitals in
the closure list to each of the four primary sources consulted, disregarding the year of closure for
this exercise. 77%-91% of hospital closures reported by other sources are included in this analysis.
The remaining 29 excluded hospitals (i.e. 9%-13% of unmatched hospitals implicit in Table 5) are
listed in Table 6 alongside the reason for their exclusion.
    Direct comparisons of California's closed hospitals, which are part of national studies, were not
possible, as California-specific hospital counts or names were not reported in Song and Saghafian;
Carroll (2019), and the study period does not overlap with that in Troske and Davis (2019).
Nevertheless, a map provided in Joynt et al. (2015) appears to suggest a similar number of closures
in California from 2003-2011.
    Note that the methodology used in this paper for identifying closures through admissions data
picks up most missed closures across the various lists, providing a more reconciled and complete
list of closures in California from 1995 to 2011. An added advantage of this approach is the
reliance on year-to-year comparisons of admissions data vs. on mere year-to-year comparisons
of hospital listings (which do not include admissions information). The latter approach may be
more susceptible to data reporting issues, as it is easier to wrongly include or exclude one hospital
identifier in a given year than it is to wrongly include or exclude several admissions for a given
hospital and year.
    A few factors contributing to "closure year" discrepancies are also noted here. When a hospital
retains its license, but has ceased to admit new general acute care patients, reported closure years
may be later than years in which access to care was actually interrupted (also pointed out by
Nicholas C Petris Center (2001)). When parts of the hospital remain open (e.g. ambulatory
care or EDs), or when hospitals convert to entities providing outpatient or specialty care, official
closure years reported may be later or different than years in which general acute care access
was interrupted. Definitions of "closure year" should thus be explicitly noted in literature, and
appropriate definitions must be adopted depending on the purpose of analysis. The "closure year"
definition in this paper is well-aligned with the paper's intention to capture the very first instances
of interruptions in general acute care. In cases of closure year discrepancies, closure year in this
paper is always earlier than in other reports. Thus, if a hospital stopped providing general acute
care services, but was still providing some or other aspects of care, the reduction or interruption in
care due to closure, i.e."treatment", would be smaller than if all services were completely shut off.
This implies that the paper's estimates are conservative (similar to Troske and Davis (2019)).

The second column from the left indicates the number of closures in our analysis by year. The columns to the right
of it indicate the number of closures identified by year in other sources. As neither of the other sources report
closures for the entire period between 1995-2011, dashes are used to indicate missing values. Note that in some
cases, a closed hospital identified by a source may occur in the following or preceding year for a different source.

A.5     Appendix: Data Used for Constructing the Analytic File
The final admission-level analytic file was assembled using publicly available OSHPD patient dis-
charge data, 1995-2011, for admissions with 5-digit residential zip codes,27 OSHPD Hospital Finan-
cials Data, Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care crosswalks, USDA ERS RUCA codes 2004, and closed
hospitals list. Table 8 presents the ICD-9 diagnostic codes used for identifying the time-sensitive
conditions analyzed: sepsis, stroke, asthma or COPD, and AMI.
