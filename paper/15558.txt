Greater historical perspective is needed to enlighten current debate about future human responses to
higher temperatures and increased precipitation variation. We analyze the impact of climatic conditions
and variability on agricultural production in five semi-arid western states. We assemble county-level
data on dams and other major water infrastructure; agricultural crop mixes and yields; precipitation
and temperature; soil quality, and topography. Using this extensive data set, we analyze the impact
of water infrastructure investments on crop mix and yields in affected counties relative to similarly-endowed
counties that lack such infrastructure. We find that water infrastructure smoothes agricultural crop
production and increases the likelihood of a successful harvest, especially during times of severe drought
or excessive precipitation.

I. Introduction

       There is a large and rapidly growing literature on climate change (Stern, 2007; Nordhaus,

2007; Weitzman, 2007 and references therein). Agriculture is particularly vulnerable to the

impacts of climate change. For the U.S., the estimated impacts are often mixed, with findings of

nonlinearities in key commodity yields beyond threshold temperatures; predictions of higher

profitability for US agriculture; and reports of high adjustment costs (Mendelsohn, Nordhaus,

and Shaw, 1994; Cline, 1996; Kelly, Kolstad, and Mitchell, 2005; Schlenker, Hanemann, and

Fisher, 2006; Deschenes and Greenstone, 2007; Schlenker and Roberts, 2008). These climate

change studies generally rely upon contemporary data or simulations. Greater historical

perspective, however, would enlighten current debate about the effects of climate change and

future human responses to it. Indeed, the expansion of agriculture across North America in the

19th and 20th centuries encountered greater climatic variation than is predicted under the current

climate change models (Olmstead and Rhode, 2008). Accordingly, analysis of how those

conditions were addressed historically and their impacts on crop mixes and agricultural

production can provide valuable information for addressing current climate variability. This

study adds to the literature on adaptation to climate fluctuation and change.

       Much academic and policy concern has been focused on the mitigation of potential

climate change through international efforts to control greenhouse gas emissions. Examples

include the Kyoto Protocol and other national policies to implement cap and trade programs, as

well as the shifting of energy production toward less-polluting sources, such as wind and solar

power. Adaptation has received somewhat less attention. Yet, it is increasingly evident that

adaptation must be given more consideration because the stock of greenhouse gasses may result

in climate change regardless of mitigation efforts and because of the vulnerabilities of many of




                                                 2
the world’s poorest societies. As Nordhaus observed, “mitigate we might; adapt we

must.”(Pielke, 1998).

       The IPCC (2001) defines adaptation as the “adjustment in natural or human systems in

response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits

beneficial opportunities.” In our study, we examine planned adaptation that involves deliberate

policy decisions. Our specific concerns are water resources and the investment in infrastructure

dedicated to irrigation that could help to mitigate the effects of more variable precipitation levels

and periods of drought on agricultural production.

       Agriculture is particularly sensitive to changes in water supplies. Water infrastructure

investments in the United States in the 20th century, designed to address semi-arid conditions and

drought (as well as flooding), provides a natural experiment to assess the impacts of such

policies on agricultural production. The land west of the 100th meridian is North America’s driest

and has its most variable climate (Lettenmaier, et al., 2008). Further, there is an indication of

increases in the duration and severity of drought in western regions (Andreadis and Lettenmaier,

2006). Concerns about the variability of water supplies in the West are not new – much of the

present water supply infrastructure was constructed in the late 19th and early to mid 20th centuries

due to historical demand for agricultural irrigation, flood protection, drinking water, and

hydroelectric power. The extent to which this investment assuaged the impacts of climate

instability is a focus of this study. Using historical county-level data for five western states, we

examine if and how the water supply infrastructure stabilized agricultural production during

droughts (and provided flood protection during periods of increased precipitation).

       We construct an integrated dataset on water supply and water infrastructure in the states

of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming and Idaho.                This county-level water




                                                 3
infrastructure dataset is spatially linked to topographic characteristics, historical climate data,

and historical agricultural data. We use these data to analyze the impact of the water

infrastructure on agricultural production, especially during times of drought or flood.

       We find that counties that had water storage and distribution facilities were generally

better able to deal with climatic variability. Farmers with access to more consistent water

supplies were more likely to smooth their agricultural production (crop mix and yields) and had a

higher likelihood of successful harvest, especially during periods of severe droughts and/or

floods. Counties with water supply control were better able to mitigate losses in agriculture

relative to similar counties without such infrastructure. Thus, our results indicate that the

presence of major water infrastructure has helped to mitigate the damages of periodic droughts

and floods, and will likely continue to do so in the future.

       The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows: Section II provides a brief

background on the origins of the water infrastructure in the western U.S., and lays out the

questions examined in the paper. Section III describes data sources and the empirical strategies

that were employed. Section IV summarizes the results of the empirical analysis, and section V

concludes.



II. Origins and Impact of Western Water Infrastructure

       During late 19th century, as agricultural settlement of North American moved into the

Great Plains and beyond, irrigation expansion and flood control became crucial issues. The

agricultural techniques and practices settlers brought with them from the humid East were not

applicable in the arid or semi-arid West. Institutions such as the 1862 Homestead Act that

created 160 to 320 acre small farms were not appropriate in the region (Libecap and Hansen,




                                                  4
2002). As early as the 1870s John Wesley Powell was promoting the organization of autonomous

irrigation districts to promote cooperation among farmers and to cope with the externalities

associated with each individual farmer’s decision on water storage and distribution.

       Interest in federal reclamation programs to construct dams and canals to store and

distribute water developed after individual, corporate and state attempts to deliver such

infrastructure was found to be inadequate. Many state attempts, such as the 1887 Wright Act of

California, faced problems ranging from poor construction to the creation of fraudulent irrigation

districts and the huge debts that ensued (Robinson, 1979). Most private irrigation projects failed,

and those that succeeded were of small size due to problems of free-riding.

       After much debate and failed attempts to develop water infrastructure in the West, the

Federal Reclamation Act was passed in June 1902, and a revolving Reclamation Fund was

created to finance water infrastructure projects. The Reclamation Fund was financed through the

sales of public lands and through cost-sharing agreements by recipients (Pisani, 2002). The title

for the water infrastructure remained with the federal government, state and territorial agencies;

local water supply organizations, such as irrigation districts, governed the use and the

distribution of water (Robinson, 1979). This structure mostly remains in place today.

       In this chapter, we analyze the impact of this federal and related state and private water

infrastructure on agricultural production and flood control over time using historical agricultural

and climatic data. The specific research questions we seek to answer are:

   •   Were counties that had irrigation water supply and distribution infrastructure better able

       to cope with the problems of short-term climatic variability (either due to natural

       variability in the hydrologic cycle or due to disruptions of the cycle), relative to those

       similar counties without such infrastructure?




                                                5
   •   Did cropping patterns (measured in area of irrigated and harvested land, relative to total

       agricultural land) change after the construction of irrigation water supply and distribution

       infrastructure?

   •   Did agricultural productivity (measured in crop-specific tons/acre or bushels/acre,)

       change after the construction of irrigation water supply and distribution infrastructure?

   •   Was the impact of water infrastructure on agricultural productivity and cropping patterns

       different (especially important) during periods of climate shocks of severe droughts and

       floods?

       To address these questions, we examine the variation in agricultural production before

and after dam and canal construction at the county level as well as across counties with and

without such infrastructure. Counties with access to water infrastructure are likely to experience

fewer agricultural production failures after unfavorable climatic conditions, all else equal. We

also examine the variation in agricultural production in periods of normal precipitation and in

times of droughts (and floods), across time.



III. Data and Empirical Model

       In order to analyze the impact of dams on agricultural activities, we have compiled the

most detailed data available on major water infrastructure, historical agricultural productivity and

other relevant data, including the climate and geographic characteristics of our study area. Our

empirical strategy focuses on five north-central states: Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota

and South Dakota (see: Map 1). Although there is variation within them, these five states are

quite similar in annual temperature trends, precipitation, crops grown and soil types. However,

within these states, the availability of irrigation water varies widely. Our sample includes all




                                                 6
counties in these states that are located west of the 100th meridian, generally considered the

boundary between the dryer and wetter Great Plains; these counties, all of which are considered

“arid” or “semi-arid”, require additional irrigation in order to grow crops in a water-intensive

fashion. We have 181 counties and a total of 3,620 observations, measured across 20 years

(1900-2002) from the agricultural census.

         The following sections describe our data sources, discuss the mechanisms that were used

to assign non-uniform counts and averages to the counties, and present summary statistics on

trends in major water infrastructure, agriculture, and climate characteristics.



Major Water Infrastructure

         Our primary source for the major water infrastructure is U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’

National Inventory of Dams (NID). The data include information on the location, owner, year of

completion, the primary purposes, capacity and height characteristics for major dams in the U.S.1

The primary purposes of construction include flood control, debris control, fish and wildlife

protection, hydroelectric generation, irrigation, navigation, fire protection, recreation, water

supply enhancement, and tailings control. Figure 1 shows the major dams in our five-state

sample, based on the NID.

         As shown in Table 1, approximately 22 percent of the water captured by dams in our

five-state sample has irrigation listed as the primary purpose and 83 percent of the water has

irrigation listed as a purpose. Dam construction in the west peaked in the post-WWII period –

with the vast majority of dams constructed during the 1950s, 60s and 70s. Over 55 percent of the


1
 “Major dams” refers to any dams that exceed 25 feet in height with more than 15 acre-feet in total storage; any
dams that exceed 6 feet in height with more than 50 acre-feet in storage; or any dams that maintain a “significant”
hazard-mitigation classification.



                                                          7
total dam capacity in the Western United States was added during the 1950s and 1960s alone,

and over 73 percent was added over that same time-frame in our five-state sample (see Table 2).

        Because we are concerned with the impact that dams had on agricultural productivity,

correctly connecting the available water supply with agricultural demand is essential. In order to

do so, all of the major dams in and around our five-state sample have been spatially merged with

the county-level agricultural census data. Therefore, if a county has a major dam located within

its boundaries or nearby, it has been assigned access to the supply of dam water (measured in

both volume of water and the number of irrigation dams that the county has access) for all

subsequent years after dam completion.

        Unfortunately, assigning water allocation based solely on the location of the dam itself

ignores those counties that are connected to the dam via canals, aqueducts or major river

systems. Many major water infrastructure projects are shared by multiple counties and multiple

states. In situations where river systems and aqueducts are many hundreds or thousands of miles

in length and have multiple dams on the same river, the water supply accordingly is assigned to

those counties that are down-stream from the dam, before any subsequent dam. In order to

accomplish this adjustment and to create a robustness check for our empirical models, we have

contacted and surveyed the operators or management agencies for each of the 475 major dams in

our five-state sample. With this survey we are able to determine the actual allocation of water

from each dam to the different counties in our study.2 This survey does not address any temporal

 A questionnaire was administered via telephone to all major dam operators in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, North
Dakota and South Dakota. The information collected through these questionnaires includes whether water is
withdrawn onsite, downstream or both, the counties (and the acreages) that dams supply irrigation water, and
primary method of withdrawing water (pump or canals).

changes in the supply of water from major dams, but it does provide a more accurate

representation of the spatial distribution of water from major dams.3



Census of Agriculture Data

         Historical agriculture data from the U.S. Census of Agriculture have been collected and

inputted manually from hard-copy historical agricultural census records. The data include 20

yearly observations for each county in the sample, assembled between 1900 and 2002. The first

few years of the agricultural census were decennial and aligned with the population census, but

after 1920 the agricultural census was conducted every 5 years, with a reorganization in 1978 so

that the data were collected at two points before the next decennial population census.4

         From the agricultural census data several different measures of agricultural composition

and production have been constructed, including: total planted acreage, total failed acreage, total

fallow or idle acreage, and total harvested acreage by crop (measured in tons or bushels per

acre). We have collected major crop variables that are found in all five of our sample states,

including wheat, barley and hay, as well as major crop variables that are more state/region

specific in the west, such as potatoes and corn.

         Figures 1 and 2 present the historical trends in agricultural composition and productivity,

respectively, in our five sample states. The average trends in agricultural composition presented

in Figure 1 indicate that large decreases in hay acreage were experienced throughout the first 25

years of the 20th century, followed by a general decline in average acreage after 1925.

3
  We were able to collect data on the total number of wells providing water to agriculture in our sample states (see
Table 1), but the data is measured in 2009 and therefore doesn’t reflect the changing availability of well water over
time, nor does it represent the volume of well water available. We acknowledge that the availability of well water
and the electrification of the farm increased the agricultural potential of many western counties.
4
 Our yearly observations include 1900, 1910, 1920, 1925, 1930, 1935, 1940, 1945, 1950, 1955, 1960, 1965, 1970,
1975, 1978, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997, and 2002.



                                                          9
Conversations with research hydrologists justify this decline as a function of hay being a prime

input to production for all agriculture prior to the mass availability of internal combustion power,

but just an input to livestock agriculture after the arrival of heavy planting and harvesting

machinery.5 Wheat acreage increased until the 1950s, and then experienced relatively stagnant

growth. What becomes very apparent in Figure 1 is the impact of the mid-1930s dustbowl era

droughts – the spikes in failed and idle acreage, and the associated declines in wheat, barley and

all of the other major crops.

        Figure 2 presents the average trends in agricultural productivity, as measured by output

per acre, per crop. All crops experienced increased productivity throughout the 20th century,

with relatively larger gains made by corn, barley and wheat. Hay productivity was relatively

stagnant, however.

        Two issues arise when integrating agricultural data into the analysis: the changing shape

of counties over time, and the changing measures or definitions within the agricultural data set.

First, because the agricultural census is provided at the county level, and county boundaries have

changed over time, we have normalized the agricultural census data to current 2000 census

county boundaries. In order to do so, we multiply the historical census count data (measured in

acres or volume of output,) by the fraction of the county that lies in the current 2000 census

county boundary definition (measured as the percentage of the total land area). In almost all

cases the historical county boundaries were subdivided into current boundaries, with very few

modifications.6

  For example, in Idaho, Alturas County, which existed from 1864 to 1895, was divided over the years into 8
separate counties. The transition to 8 counties was not instantaneous – therefore the number of counties is often
different across different Agricultural Census periods. By limiting our period of analysis to the 1900-2002
Agricultural Censuses, we avoid much of the redistricting of county areas that took place in the western United


                                                       10
        Second, the crop acreage and harvest data within the census has changed over time. For

example, in the early years of the agricultural census, certain forage crops were listed as a single

entry, but in later years the forage crops were split into multiple categories. We are limited by the

lowest common denominator in these cases. In the models in which we are interested in

individual crops that have been further divided into sub-crops, we aggregate so that the unit of

measure is consistent across all of the years of our sample.



Climate Data

        The U.S. Climate Division Dataset (USCDD) provides averaged climate data based on

344 climatic zones, covering 1895 to present.7 The USCDD provides temperature and

precipitation measures, including the monthly maximum, minimum, mean temperatures and total

monthly precipitation levels. In addition, it includes other climate-related variables such as

Palmer drought severity indices and standardized z-scores of temperature and precipitation. The

Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) is a long-term drought measure that is standardized to the

local climate so that it shows relative drought and rainfall conditions in a region at a specific

time. It uses temperature and rainfall information in a formula to determine relative wetness or

dryness. The Palmer Index is most effective in determining long term drought—a matter of

several months. It uses a 0 as normal, with drought periods shown in terms of negative numbers

and flood periods shown in terms of positive numbers.8

 The five-state sample includes 45 distinct climate zones in Idaho (10), Montana (7), North Dakota (9), South
Dakota (9), and Wyoming (10).

Systems (QRS) under contract to the Office of Research and Planning, Bureau of Health Professions, within the
Health Resources and Services Administration.

        The USCDD is zonal in nature: dividing each state into similar climate zones. Unlike

monitor-level temperature and precipitation data, the zonal climate data utilize all of the monitor

readings within a zone to arrive at zone-averaged temperature and precipitation measures. In

addition, there are no missing observations for the zonal climate data, so from year to year the

same zones’ climate data can be used. Unfortunately, the zones reflect topographic and

meteorological uniformities, and therefore don’t conform to sociopolitical county boundaries.

For this reason, in order to assign zonal climate data to counties that overlap multiple zones, the

zonal climate data must be averaged across the overlapping counties.9



Topography and Soil Quality Data

        We utilize a general topography classification from The National Atlas (USGS), which

identifies counties according to their major landform types. The variable we use is the “Land

Surface Form Topography code”, which identifies 21 different classifications, including plains,

tablelands, open hills and mountains. This topography type allows us to group counties

according to similar landforms – and the likelihood that they have land that is suitable for

growing certain crops. Similarly, the topography type reflects the likelihood that a county has the

potential of having a major dam in place: the major western dams are much more likely to occur

in the more mountainous counties, or those with open hills, than they are in tablelands or plains.

        In addition to landform type, we have collected county-level soil quality (soil type)

information from the Natural Resources Conservation Service’s (NRCS) Soil Survey Geographic



9
  We use an evenly weighted average – so if a county falls in two zones, the temperature and precipitation values
that are assigned that that county would be 50% of the first zone and 50% of the second zone. As an example, of the
44 counties in Idaho, 28 are contained in a single climate zone, 9 overlap with 2 climate zones, 5 overlap with 3
climate zones, 1 overlaps with 4 climate zones, and 1 overlaps with 5 climate zones. As a robustness check, we will
run models with only those counties that are contained in a single climate zone.

(SSURGO) database. The SSURGO database provides a national-coverage of soil quality

measures, according to the non-irrigated Land Capability Classification System (LCC). The

LCC includes eight classes of land, derived from a series of soil qualities, including percent

slope, erosion potential, rooting depth, drainage class, composition, salinity, growing season,

average annual precipitation and surface textures. The coverage of each LCC in each county is

weighted by total area to arrive at a county-averaged LCC that is time-invariant.



Econometric Model

        In this section we describe the econometric strategy used to estimate the impact of major

water infrastructure on cropping practices and on crop outcomes (harvest per acre, crop failure,

etc.), using the data sources outlined in the previous sections. It is important to note that any

empirical exercise that models the impact of water provided by dams on agricultural composition

or output may suffer from spurious positive correlation: counties that have the natural amenities

present, and thus anticipate a larger productivity gain from an increased volume of irrigation

water, may be more likely to invest in a major water infrastructure project. Thus, traditional OLS

analyses may be biased. In addition, water supply infrastructure could have brought agricultural

production to areas where it was not possible without irrigation, and therefore introduce a

potential endogeneity problem. To overcome these issues, we present two different, but related

identification strategies.

        First, we cluster similar counties based on topographic and climatic types. Identification

therefore comes from the within-cluster differences in availability of irrigation water over time.

In this case, counties within clusters are very similar in agricultural potential (soil type, annual

precipitation total, annual temperature average,) as well as the potential for having a major water




                                                13
infrastructure project (topography classification), and we estimate the treatment effect of having

irrigation water. To cluster counties, we use a definition of “arability” based on possible

profitable production of crops without irrigation on land with low, average and highly variable

rainfall, and match counties in our sample accordingly. We then exclude all counties in our

sample where profitable agricultural production without irrigation would not be possible. The

definition of arability used includes a minimum average rainfall of 10 inches per year;

sufficiently deep soil with no clay and sand; and no excessive evaporation due to wind and heat

during critical stages of plant growth. We further differentiate the cluster by the topographic

characteristics of the county, and therefore control for counties that have similar potential for

major water infrastructure.

         We let Hi,g,t denote the agricultural outcome in county i, in cluster g, in year t. Di,g,t is an

indicator variable that equals one when county i has access to irrigation water provided via a

major water infrastructure project in year t, and zero otherwise.10 Our basic econometric model is

equation (1) below:



                      H i , g , t = αDi , g , t + βI i , g , t + X i , g ,tϕ + Z i , g μ + θ g , t + δ g , j + ηi , g ,t   (1)



where α is the parameter of interest, and measures the difference in the dependent variable

between counties with and without major water infrastructure projects.11 Ii,g,t represents the


10
   We begin with a 50,000 AF cutoff to construct the indicator variable for irrigation water provided by dams, but
relax this cutoff as a robustness check. As expected, as the cutoff level decreases, so does the magnitude of the
coefficient on the dam indicator variable.
11
  We constrain the major water infrastructure binary variable so that it represents only projects with a dedicated
purpose of irrigation. In these cases, dams that were constructed for hydroelectric, recreation or other purposes
without any indication that they will provide irrigation water are not included as dams in our analysis of agricultural
impacts.

vary over time at the county level, and includes the annual rainfall and temperature measures.12

Zi,g is a vector of controls that are continuous across time, but vary at the county level. This

vector includes the non-irrigated soil capability classification of the county. θg,t is a year fixed

         We allow Hi,g,t to represent: 1) percentage measures of agricultural mix (changes in

composition), or 2) the successful harvest per acre before and after a major water infrastructure

project is completed.13 To further test whether major water infrastructure provides security

during times of drought or flood, we utilize a difference-in-difference model, presented in

equation (2) below, where we interact Di,g,t with the indicator variables for those periods in

which agriculture experienced droughts and severe floods ( Ii,g,t)14:



                                                          [                   ]

12
  We also include non-linearities in the precipitation and temperature variables in all of our models. As a robustness
check, we alter the months that are used to calculate precipitation and temperature totals, including adding the winter
(wetter) months in the year prior to the agricultural census, or limiting the climate averages to the summer months
during the growing season (to account for dry-cropping or those operations that rely solely on rain and snowfall for
crop irrigation). These modifications do not have noticeable effects on our variables of concern.
13
   It is worth noting that in most cases, the dependent variable (be it harvest per acre or the composition (%) of
different crops produced,) is not biased by the size of the county. In models in which the total land area of the
county may affect results the treatment variable will need to be normalized by the total land area or the size of the
county.
14
  We use two cutoffs for to construct the drought and flood dummy variables: with a drought condition represented
by PDSI <=-2, and a flood condition represented by PDSI>=2. These cutoffs are considered “moderate to severe
droughts/floods” within the PDSI literature. See Palmer (1965) and discussion in the U.S. Department of Commerce,
National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (2009) website regarding “moderate drought” versus “moderate
rainfall” and other categorizations. http://www.drought.noaa.gov/palmer.html




                                                                        15
       Our second strategy to account for the spurious positive correlation, follows Duflo and

Pande (QJE 2007), and takes advantage of the topography classifications of each county as

instruments for the likelihood of dam construction. Specifically, we estimate a fixed effects two

stage least squares panel regression of the form:



                         Di , t = [τTi * θ t ] + β I i , t + X i , tϕ + Z i μ + [θ t * δ i ] + ηi , t       (3)



The notation follows from equation (1), with the following exceptions: the topographic

classification (Ti) has been interacted with the year fixed effects; the panel fixed effect is now

represented by an interaction between the year fixed effect and the state fixed effect to arrive at a

state-year fixed effect. To generate instruments for Di,t, we utilize the parameter estimates from

(3) to predict the likelihood of a dam being constructed ( Dˆ i ,t ) in our first-stage equation. Our

final instrumental variables estimation is therefore equation (4):



                                                                                          [

using instruments for Di,t from the parameter estimates from (3).



IV. Results

       The objective of this chapter is to examine the impact of major water infrastructure on

agricultural composition and productivity. We hypothesize that counties with access to water

supply infrastructure are better able to deal with the problems of short-term climatic variability

(either due to natural variability in the hydrologic cycle or due to disruptions of the cycle) in


                                                             16
terms of smoothing out agricultural production over time relative to those similar counties

without such infrastructure.

       It is important to note that the temperature variability and average levels of precipitation

are very similar across the five states in our sample, and unlike more temperate western states,

the year-to-year water availability is not a significant factor in determining annual crop mix

changes. Because of the climate extremes (traditionally represented by very hot summers and

very cold winters,) the presence of irrigation water is less essential in our sample states than in

states that grow crops that are much more dependent on irrigation water. Many of the crops that

we analyze are field crops that can be dry-farmed, unlike row crops that require intensive

irrigation to produce any output. For these reasons, we anticipate that the impacts of dam-

provided irrigation water are likely to be less significant in states in our sample than in those

states that grow crops that are much more dependent on it for their agricultural practices. Thus,

we expect that our results likely underestimate the true benefit of the major water infrastructure

projects, particularly in those states that have more crop variability, and that are more dependent

on dam-provided irrigation water.

       Tables 3 through 9 show results from our clustered sample presented in equations (1) and

(2) from Section III. Our sample counties are clustered based on similarities in topographic and

climatic characteristics; thus, identification in our models comes from the within-cluster

differences in availability of irrigation water over time.

       Table 3 presents the impact of dams on agricultural composition, shares of total cropland

dedicated to certain crops as well as fallow and failed crop acres, controlling for precipitation,

temperature, soil quality, and state and year fixed effects, measured within clusters of counties.

In our sample counties, annual water variability, and hence, dam-provided irrigation water




                                                 17
availability is not expected to be a significant determinant of crop mix changes. As anticipated,

in these models we see that the indicator variable for dams has only a small, insignificant impact

on agricultural composition. The indicator variable for droughts, however, which is constructed

using PDSI cutoff of “moderate to severe droughts,” shows a shift away from wheat and corn

during drought periods, and an increase in failed acreage.

        When we interact the indicator variables for dams and droughts, in Table 4, we see that

the counties that have dams experienced an increase in wheat acreage (+2.46 percent) and a

decrease in failed acreage (-4.41 percent) during drought periods relative to those drought areas

without dams present.15

        According to these results, dams had very little impact on the agricultural practices

during normal precipitation years, but had a much more significant impact during drought years.

Relative to similar counties that did not have dam-provided irrigation water available, counties

with the dams were much more successful during difficult growing years—they were able to

plant more of their total acreage and they lost less of the crop that was planted.

        The results are economically significant. The average aggregate annual wheat acreage

across the five states in our sample was 10.2M acres, and the average aggregate annual failed

acreage was 1.8M acres. The coefficient on our drought-dam interaction term from Model (2) in

Table 4, a 2.46% increase in wheat acreage, is equivalent to an average increase of over 251,000

acres dedicated towards wheat, in aggregate across all states, averaged across all years.

Similarly, the coefficient on our drought-dam interaction term from Model (6) in Table 4, a




15
   We estimated our models using all dams as well as irrigation dams only. Results are qualitatively similar although
more significant when we use irrigation dams. We also estimated models showing the impact of dam not only where
it is located, but from various distances from dam and again find similar results.



                                                        18
4.41% decrease in failed acreage, is equivalent to an average decrease of approximately 80,000

failed acres, in aggregate across all states, averaged across all years.

        Tables 5 and 6 present similar models to Tables 3 and 4, but measure agricultural

productivity as opposed to agricultural composition. Agricultural productivity is measured in

bushels per acre for wheat, barley and corn; in tonnage per acre for hay and in 100 pounds per

acre for potatoes. In these models we see an across-the-board increase in productivity during

drought periods, even when total cropland harvested may be declining. For example, we observe

a 0.12 ton/acre increase in hay productivity and a 2.96 bushel/acre increase in wheat

productivity. Conversations with water resource managers indicate that these results are not all

that surprising—when farmers are faced with decreased water availability, they are very careful

with their overall water management, thus applying the water that they do have to their most

productive acreage. This application practice results in an increased productivity per acre across

the fewer acres that are planted.16

        Similar to Tables 3 and 4, the dam indicator variables have a positive, but insignificant

effect on agricultural productivity. This is again due to fact that the presence of irrigation water

is likely less essential in our sample states that mostly grow field crops that can be dry-farmed,

than in states that grow crops that are much more dependent on irrigation water. When we

interact the indicator variables for dams and droughts, in Table 6, we see that the presence of

dams in areas that are suffering from droughts has a positive, significant impact on wheat

productivity (+3.16 bushels/acre) and barley productivity (+2.61 bushels/acre).

        These effects also are economically significant. They are roughly 13 percent and 8

percent, respectively, of the annual mean productivity per acre in our sample. In terms of the

Services Division, Idaho Department of Water Resources, November 2009.


                                                    19
total harvest, an increase of 3.16 bushels/acre of wheat translates into an average output increase

of approximately 182,000 bushels per county, per year.17 At the current commodity price for

wheat, this is equal to almost a $1M increase in annual revenue, per county (National

Agricultural Statistics Service, 2009). To put these results in context, we estimate that the

average acres of wheat harvested per county, per year were 57,500 across our study sample. With

an average of 23.8 bushels/acre, and an average 2009 commodity price of $5/bushel for wheat,

the total revenue per county from wheat is $6.8M per year.

         Tables 7 and 8 present similar models to those presented in Tables 5 and 6, but are altered

to account for periods of excessive precipitation, as opposed to periods of drought. We want to

test for the impact of dams on agricultural productivity during periods of potentially damaging

flooding. We use a flood condition represented by PDSI >=2 to create the flood dummy variable

indicating “moderate to severe floods / precipitation levels” within the PDSI literature.

         Increased levels of precipitation, of course, may have other effects, such as greater

opportunity to hold more water behind dams and have water available for even more irrigation to

positively impact agricultural productivity of those crops that benefit from extra water

availability. On the other hand, increased water availability may also increase the use of marginal

land for some crops where output per acre is lower. In addition, damaging levels of precipitation

and flooding may decrease overall agricultural productivity levels.

         We find that periods of excessive precipitation (shown as the flood indicator variable in

the tables) result in a significant positive effect on agricultural productivity of wheat and hay, the

two dry-farmed crops in our sample. These results are presented in Models 1 and 2 on Table 7.


17
  The mean harvest, measured at the county level between 1900 and 2002, was 57,500 acres of wheat, 41,700 acres
of hay, 12,400 acres of barley, 3,300 acres of corn, and 1,370 acres of potatoes. These numbers are larger (with the
exception of hay) for the latter half of the 20th century than the first half, but had more variation across counties in
the latter years.


                                                           20
Extra water storage and the availability of more water for irrigation to be applied to lands that are

typically cultivated by using dry-cropping techniques is the likely explanation for the positive

and significant effect on the total productivity of wheat and hay, ceteris paribus.

       The general precipitation variable for wheat has a negative effect for wheat productivity.

This result, combined with agricultural composition results presented in Tables 3 and 4 that show

that share of total cropland in wheat declines when there is increased precipitation. This result

indicates that some of the most productive lands are shifted away from wheat production during

wet seasons to alternative crops, especially more water-intensive potatoes.

       Although the presence of a dam alone has a limited impact on agricultural productivity in

our sample states, when this effect is interacted with the presence of a period of excessive

precipitation (and increased likelihood of flooding), we find a positive impact for all agricultural

productivities studied. Results, shown in Table 8, indicate that the productivity of wheat (+2.14

bushels/acre) and corn (+4.52 bushels/acre) are statistically significant and positive. These

effects are roughly 9 percent and 13 percent of the annual mean productivity per acre in our

sample. The overall increased productivity impact of dams during periods of excessive

precipitation may be due to the prevention of damaging flooding when a dam is present, plus the

availability of greater irrigation water held behind dams.

       Table 9 presents the results of the empirical models outlined in Model (4) of Section III.

In these models, we use a two-staged fixed effects process, following Duflo and Pande (2007), in

which we instrument for the likelihood of a county having a dam, using topographic

characteristics of counties (interacted with year effects) in addition to all of the independent

variables that we use to explain the variation in crop composition and productivity. This is

another econometric strategy we implement to address the likely spurious positive correlation




                                                 21
and endogeneity problems we face in our econometric identification: those counties that have the

natural characteristics for dam presence, and thus anticipate a larger productivity gain from

dams, are also more likely to invest in a major water infrastructure project.

         The results of instrumental variable approach, presented in Table 9, are in general

consistent with our previous results. However, unlike our findings in Tables 3 through 8, the

fixed effects instrumental variables results suggest that the presence of a dam has a large,

positive impact on all crops, and a significant impact on hay productivity (+0.94 tons/acre),

wheat productivity (+7.1 bushels/acre), and barley productivity (+22.90 bushels/acre). 18 We also

continue to find positive impacts of droughts on productivity, but these effects are only

marginally significant.19

         All told, our results from the various estimation strategies indicate that the availability of

water infrastructure increases agricultural productivity and the likelihood of successful harvest as

measured by harvested cropland as a share of total cropland. Although dams, in our sample, may

have had little impact on agricultural composition and agricultural productivity during normal

precipitation years, when we interact the indicator variables for dams and droughts, however, we

find that the counties that have dams experienced an increase in wheat acreage (+2.46 percent)

and a decrease in failed acreage (-4.41 percent). Relative to similar counties that did not have


18
  Given our concern with spurious positive correlation, we had expected to find reduced magnitude in the estimated
coefficients and possibly improved standard errors when we use a two-staged fixed effects process. We instead find
increased coefficient estimates. This may be due to the weakness of our main instrument for dams: topography of
counties. For broader work on this topic, we are exploring alternative instruments, such as river gradient, details on
reservoir site (wide or narrow valley), county elevation and length of rivers.
19
  As noted earlier, we were able to collect data on the total number of wells providing water to agriculture in our
sample states, but the data is measured in 2009 and therefore doesn’t reflect the changing availability of well water
over time, nor does it represent the volume of well water available. As a robustness check, we introduce the well
availability as both a time invariant indicator variable and as a dummy variable (which is in turn instrumented for
endogeneity) for all years after 1950, when most western farms uniformly had access to electricity. The inclusion of
these well variables slightly reduces the magnitudes of our variables of concern, but doesn’t alter their significance,
signs or their general magnitudes.

dam-provided irrigation water, counties with the dams were able to have more of their total

acreage planted and lost less of the crop that was planted. Similarly, the results presented in

Table 6 show that the presence of dams in areas that are suffering from droughts has a positive,

significant impact on wheat productivity (+3.16 bushels/acre) and barley productivity (+2.61

bushels/acre).

       In addition, our results also indicate that the presence of major water infrastructure helped

to mitigate the damages of periodic floods. As shown in Tables 7 and 8, periods of excessive

precipitation result in a significant positive effect on agricultural productivity of wheat and hay,

the two dry-farmed crops in our sample. Again, the presence of a dam alone only has a limited

impact on agricultural productivity, but when this effect is interacted with the presence of a

period of excessive precipitation, we find a positive impact for all agricultural productivities

studied. Results presented in Table 8 indicate that the increased productivity of wheat (+2.14

bushels/acre) and corn (+4.52 bushels/acre) are statistically significant and positive.


V. Summary and Conclusions

       Climate change is a major issue and much of the scientific focus is on its likely impact

and the costs of various paths of mitigation. Less attention has been directed towards adaption—

of how policies and markets have addressed past climate shocks. This is vital information

because adaptation to climate change can influence both its effects and the costs of addressing it.

The empirical evidence on past adaptation policies is limited. This chapter examines the impact

of one of the most extensive water infrastructure investments ever made—the “reclamation”

systems of the U.S. West— to determine their impact on agricultural production in the face of

severe drought or flooding. Water infrastructure is particularly important as a long-term

adaptation strategy to climate change because dams and associated canals are among the longest-



                                                 23
lasting infrastructures in agriculture, and investment in them differs from most other agricultural

adaptation strategies available to farmers (Reilly, 1999).

       Analysis of historical data from the western U.S., where temperature and precipitation

differences relative to the eastern part of the country are greater than those predicted from

climate change models, allows for assessment of adaption policies. We present a large-scale time

series analysis of historical data on mitigation of the impact of climate change on agricultural

production. Because there is evidence that mean changes in temperature may have less impact on

agricultural production, our focus is on extremes of precipitation levels that are likely to cause

significant negative agricultural outcomes. This approach follows the recommendation of Reilly

(1999) and others regarding analysis of the impact of climate change on agricultural production.

Our results indicate that historical water supply investments have increased agricultural

productivity and improved the likelihood of successful harvest during times of climatic shocks—

droughts and floods. These are characteristic of the semi-arid west and may become more so if

climate projections of greater swings in drought and flooding come to pass.
