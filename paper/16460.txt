                                             ABSTRACT

Scholars differ on whether Federal Reserve intervention mitigated banking panics during the Great
Depression and in recent years. The last panic prior to the Depression sheds light on this debate. In
April 1929, a fruit fly infestation in Florida forced the U.S. government to quarantine fruit shipments
from the state and destroy infested groves. When Congress recessed in June without approving compensation
for farmers, depositors in citrus growing regions began withdrawing deposits from banks, culminating
in runs on institutions in the financial center of Tampa and surrounding cities. Using archival evidence,
we describe how the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta halted the spread of the panic by rushing currency
to member banks. Analysis based on a new micro-level database of commercial banks in Florida shows
that bank failures would have been twice as high without the Fed’s intervention. The policy response
of the Fed ended the panic and suggests that similar interventions by the Fed may have been useful
during the Great Depression, even in cases where banks faced questions about their solvency.

    ARRESTING BANKING PANICS: FED LIQUIDITY PROVISION AND
                THE FORGOTTEN PANIC OF 1929


I. Introduction


        The financial crisis of 2008-9 saw markets and institutions suffer from illiquidity and

insolvency. These factors can interact and feed off of each other. For example, if market

participants lower the valuations of the assets on financial intermediaries’ balance sheets, it may

call into question the solvency of these firms, prompting collateral calls and a flight by suppliers

of short-term funds. An inability to obtain accurate information on the fundamental values of

assets on balance sheets might also lead intermediaries to become unwilling to lend to each other.

As institutions worry about their own need for capital and their ability to meet investor

withdrawals, they may retrench, hoard liquid assets, and fail to provide funds to other distressed

financial institutions; in extreme conditions, the need to raise cash can result in asset sales at

depressed prices (a “fire sale”) so that liquidity problems can accentuate solvency concerns

(Brunnermeier and Pederson 2009, Diamond and Rajan 2005). In addition, worsening concerns

over solvency can increase the likelihood of a liquidity crisis or a run on a financial institution

(Morris and Shin 2000, Diamond and Rajan 2005). The response of a central bank or lender of

last resort to banking crises often involves gauging the relative importance of illiquidity and

insolvency. The larger role that illiquidity plays in the crisis, the more vigorously a lender of last

resort may deem it necessary to extend credit in order to quell a panic.1 For example, during the

recent financial crisis, the Federal Reserve introduced a host of lending programs to provide

substantial liquidity support to financial markets and institutions (Bernanke 2009).

        The recent crisis is hardly the first time that illiquidity and insolvency have severely

damaged the U.S. financial system. Indeed, the financial history of the United States is replete

 Summers (2000) emphasizes that preventing banking crises depends on avoiding “situations where the
bank run psychology takes hold.”

with major banking panics that swept the nation as well as more localized episodes. This paper

investigates a previously neglected panic that occurred just prior to the onset of the Great

Depression, one which sheds light on how panics develop and spread and how different lender-

of-last-resort actions can contribute to ending them. In April 1929, a Mediterranean fruit fly

epidemic struck the citrus crop in Florida (a remarkably clear shock that started this episode). In

order to prevent its spread to other states, the government quarantined Florida citrus shipments

and destroyed infested groves. Over the course of that spring, it seemed increasingly unlikely that

farmers would be able to repay their crop loans when they came due during the fall. Congress

considered compensating Florida farmers for their losses, but recessed at the end of June without

taking action.

        The size of losses that farmers would suffer, the effectiveness of the eradication

campaign, and whether the government would compensate growers were all unknown. This

created uncertainty over the health of bank balance sheets. In July 1929, depositors responded by

withdrawing funds from banks, culminating in bank runs in citrus growing areas and the failure of

a key correspondent group headquartered in Tampa, Citizens Bank and Trust Company (hereafter

Citizens Bank), which served as a financial center for these citrus-growing areas. The solvency

shock of the fruit fly infestation had developed into a liquidity crisis as well. To halt the panic,

the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta shipped large sums of currency to the vaults of the two

remaining large correspondent banks in Tampa on July 17 and 18, and publicly promised to

provide enough cash to cover all deposits at member banks. By July 20, the run had subsided.

        We have assembled a new micro-level database on commercial banks in Florida that

allows us to show that deposit outflows prior to the banking panic in July were heaviest in areas

subjected to the quarantine –     evidence consistent with concerns that the fruit fly and the

eradication program were directly affecting banks. Data on Florida’s bank correspondent

networks allows us to then demonstrate how the panic then spread. Deposit withdrawals at banks

in the citrus growing areas put pressure on major correspondent banks. Correspondent banks were


                                                 2
important liquidity providers, and we show how pressure on the major correspondent banks

impacted other banks. The evolution and nature of the Florida banking panic is consistent with

models emphasizing how factors affecting the asset side of bank balance sheets, such as

uncertainty over payoffs or delays in investment projects, can trigger bank runs (Morris and Shin

2000, Diamond and Rajan 2005) as well as those emphasizing linkages through bank networks

(Allen and Gale, 2000).

        This response of the Atlanta Fed demonstrates how bold, transparent, and targeted

liquidity support by central banks can be vital in halting the spread of a panic and altering

depositor confidence during a crisis even when the root of the crisis is clearly a solvency shock.

Archival evidence from the minutes of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (the Atlanta Fed)

shows that officials at the reserve bank were concerned with the panic spreading to institutions

they viewed as solvent after 8 percent of the state’s banks failed within 48 hours of the closure of

Citizens National Bank. Officials rapidly provided unconventional liquidity support in Tampa to

key banks whose closure they believed would result in a further wave of bank failures. We show

that the response by the Atlanta Fed appears to have successfully stemmed the banking panic,

changed depositor expectations, and prevented other institutions from failing.

        To get a sense of the importance of the intervention by the Atlanta Fed, we use individual

bank balance sheet data on the population of Florida banks to construct several counterfactuals.

We estimate that bank failure rates would have been twice as high in Florida without the Atlanta

Fed’s decision to provide funds to the key correspondents in Tampa that were facing runs.

Additional results suggest that the intervention likely prevented banks from exhausting their

liquid reserves, again helping to arrest the panic.

        Finally, the Atlanta Fed’s response to the panic in Florida illustrates some of the tools

that were available for responding to liquidity crises on the eve of the Great Depression, and how

policymakers at one of the regional Federal Reserve Banks viewed their role as a lender of last

resort. The Atlanta Fed’s response is particularly noteworthy since the Federal Reserve has been


                                                  3
criticized for not responding to the banking panics of the 1930s and for having little or no

experience acting as a lender of last resort during the Great Depression (Friedman and Schwartz

1963). Given the actions of the Atlanta Fed in 1929, the response by the Federal Reserve to the

banking panics in the 1930s, or lack thereof, is that much more intriguing.

        The next section of the paper describes the events that triggered runs on the Florida

banking system in the summer of 1929 and relates it to the theoretical literature on banking crises.

Section III then describes the policy response of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta after the

failure of Citizens Bank. Section IV analyzes of the causes of bank distress and the effects of

lender-of-last-resort intervention. Section V concludes.



II. The Fruit Fly Infestation and Bank Runs

        To understand how a solvency shock associated with the quarantining of fruit-fly-infested

areas spread into a mid-1929 banking panic in Florida, we first discuss the Mediterranean fruit fly

infestation that began in April of that year. We then provide an accounting of the bank runs and

the response of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta to the banking distress.



A. Florida Citrus and the Mediterranean Fruit Fly Infestation: The Real Shock

        In 1929, Florida’s groves contained nearly 9 million orange and 3.5 million grapefruit

trees. Revenues from fruit sales totaled $46 million, or 51.7 percent of the state’s revenue from

crop sales. The largest groves grew in the central peninsula, where the climate protected crops

from freezing weather and transportation networks linked orchards to worldwide markets

(Figures 1 and 2).

        On April 2, 1929, an inspector for State Board of Agriculture discovered grapefruits

containing larvae of the Mediterranean fruit fly. Scientists at the USDA Headquarters in

Washington, D.C. confirmed the diagnosis on April 10 (Los Angeles Times, May 26, 1929).

Florida’s agricultural authorities reacted rapidly. Emergency inspections discovered fruit fly


                                                 4
infestations in Lake, Orange, and Seminole counties (Figure 3), with particularly dense

concentrations around the city of Orlando. The infestation later spread as far north as Ocala

County and as far south as Osceola County (Figure 4). By July 1929, the Department of

Agriculture estimated that approximately 34 percent of the state’s land, containing nearly 75

percent of all the citrus growing trees in Florida, had been infested.

        The Mediterranean fruit fly posed a serious threat to agriculture throughout the United

States. Although it preferred to consume fruit, the Mediterranean fruit fly ate a wide array of

crops, including 72 of the 80 principal fruits and vegetables grown commercially in North

America in the 1920s. Its lifecycle allowed it to spread rapidly once it gained a foothold.

Generations matured in two to four weeks and the fly had no natural predators or parasites in the

U.S. In regions where the fly had become endemic, including Australia, Bermuda, Brazil, South

Africa, Spain, the West Indies, Hawaii, and nations around the Mediterranean, farmers were

forced to abandon commercial cultivation of most fruits and vegetables.

        State and federal governments therefore reacted swiftly to the outbreak. Florida

immediately quarantined areas around infected orchards and prohibited shipments of fruits and

vegetables. Florida’s governor mobilized National Guard troops to enforce the quarantine. All

vehicles passing out of the quarantine area were disinfected by washing the exterior and spraying

insecticide in the interior of them. The federal government imposed a broader quarantine,

including inspections of all trains leaving the state. The United States Department of Agriculture

dispatched 20 scientists and several hundred workers to aid the eradication effort. California, the

other major citrus growing state, also dispatched a contingent. Eventually, more than 5,000

people worked in the eradication campaign (Los Angeles Times, July 21, p.1 and July 22, p.1).

        Officials devised a multilayered defense. Zone 1 was the territory one mile around an

infested orchard, and within this area, authorities destroyed all orchards, crops, and wild plants in

which the fly might reside. To kill the larvae, laborers burned all fruit found on the ground or

buried the fruit at least three feet deep and covered it with motor oil and disinfectant. To kill adult


                                                  5
flies, workers fumigated infested areas with arsenic sprays or mercury smoke. Authorities

imposed Zone 1 restrictions on over 400 independent infestations, mainly in the center of the

state, encompassing over 17,000 acres of citrus groves (Figure 4 shows counties with orchards

designated Zone 1). Zone 2 stretched for a radius of nine miles outside Zone 1. All fruit on the

vine was destroyed and previously picked or processed fruit could not leave Zone 2 without

rigorous inspection and certification as pest free. Zones 1 and 2 covered half of the citrus-growing

acreage of the state. Zone 3, encompassing most of the rest of the state, required inspections of all

fruits and vegetables prior to harvesting and/or shipment.

        Neighboring states also reacted rapidly to the fruit fly infestation. Eight southern and ten

western states banned the importation of fruit and vegetables from Florida (Los Angeles Times,

June 23, 1929, p.5) as did many foreign nations – including Canada, Chile, Cuba, Jamaica,

Mexico, Spain, the Dominican Republic, and the Bahamas.

        The embargoes, eradication, and quarantine took its toll on Florida’s agricultural

industry. Fruit production in the affected areas fell by sixty percent. Growers suffered devastating

losses, including years of investment in trees and infrastructure. Congressional contingents from

Florida and California therefore proposed Federal relief for farmers forced to destroy crops and

trees. Under this plan, the federal government would pay part of the losses of the growers. The

state government would contribute a similar portion, and the farmer would absorb a smaller

amount. Secretary Hyde of the Department of Agriculture endorsed the plan and recommended

that Congress appropriate $10 million for the task with the provision that the Federal government

pay at most half of the amount given to growers (Los Angeles Times, June 21, 1929, p. A20).2

        Agricultural committee’s in the House and Senate debated the issue in April, May, and

June. Congressmen from states in the Great Plains opposed compensating Florida’s farmers

2
 The proposed $20 million of total aid to growers ($10 million from the federal government and $10
million from the state government) would have amounted to nearly 40 percent of owners’ equity in
Florida’s commercial banks (using data from the end of June, 1929). As we describe later, Florida’s citrus
growers never received this money.



                                                     6
unless the government considered similar compensation for losses that grain farmers incurred

from recent infestations of other pests. In the last week of June, with the issue unresolved,

Congress adjourned for the summer recess. A newspaper columnist observed that “there is much

disappointment … at the failure of Congress to grant a relief appropriation before it went into

recess. Many growers will find it extremely difficult to hold out during the interim until August

when Congress will reconvene. Nor is it certain that an appropriation will be made then (Los

Angeles Times, June 28, 1929, p. 1).”

        Reimbursement for losses, however, did not materialize in the month of July, which

created uncertainty as to whether citrus farmers would be able to repay their loans and stoked

fears that banks that lent heavily to growers and processors were insolvent and become so.

Congress continued to debate restitution to growers for more than a decade; the Senate was still

holding on the issue in 1940.



B. Florida Bank Suspensions in 1929 and the July Banking Panic

        Florida’s commercial banks had weathered three severe shocks in the 1920s. First, crop

prices fell dramatically after World War I, and many farmers who had expanded production

during the war, defaulted on real estate loans. Then, in 1925, Florida’s real estate bubble burst;

property values plummeted and deposits at banks declined by fifty percent. Finally, Florida was

hit by two severe hurricanes – one in 1926 and another in 1928 – which resulted in significant

property damage (more than $1.28 billion in 2008 dollars) and loss of human life. While these

financial and meteorological storms affected the balance sheets of some banks, some

commentators suggested that by 1929 Florida’s banking system had fully recovered. “The banks

of Florida have increased their capital and surplus by 35 percent [as compared to the peak of the

boom in 1925], have charged off all losses, and regularly have paid dividends … Florida banks




                                                7
[are] in a more liquid condition, having more cash as compared with total resources, than … any

other banks in the nation (Wall Street Journal, January 19, 1929, p. 11).”

           It was with these initial conditions that the Florida banking system entered 1929 and

subsequently experienced 64 bank suspensions. The 1929 Annual Report of the Federal Reserve

Board (p.22) stated that the Atlanta Fed had the largest number of suspensions and fastest growth

rate in suspensions in the country for that year. It further reported that the increase in failures in

the Atlanta region was almost entirely driven by a surge in bank failures in Florida and concluded

that: “In Florida, the suspensions were due largely to the inability of the banks to realize on slow

assets acquired in prior years, apparently aggravated by heavy withdrawals brought about by the

disturbance in the fruit industry resulting from the destruction wrought by the Mediterranean fruit

fly.”3

           Figures 5 and 6 show the timing and geographical distribution of commercial bank

failures in Florida. The first batch of bank failures occurred in February. Between the 11th and

18th of the month, the state comptroller closed six banks after examiners detected problems due

to financial improprieties. These banks shared common management and all of the institutions

had loaned large sums to the managers and directors of this “group bank.” These individuals were

unable to repay and the banks were closed. The second cluster of bank failures occurred one

month after the fruit fly invaded Florida’s orange groves. Between May 15 and 18, seven banks

failed in the citrus-growing region.

           The third and largest cluster of bank failures occurred in July (Figure 5). The Federal

Reserve Bank of Atlanta became increasingly concerned with the possibility of widespread

distress in Florida by June. Discussions of these concerns and the actions taken are described in

the minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank (hereafter

Atlanta Board Minutes). By the middle of June, the Atlanta Fed received a request from Citizens



3

                                                      8
Bank, which was a correspondent to many other banks in the citrus growing center of the state, to

rediscount eligible and acceptable paper from certain nonmember banks that were a part of its

banking group for a period of six months “…as a result of the unsettled conditions in Florida, and

particularly in those sections affected by the Mediterranean fruit fly.” The Board of the Atlanta

Fed, concerned that a banking panic could spread through correspondent networks, of which

Citizens’ Bank was a key part of, quickly approved Citizens’ Bank request at their June 14

meeting, and sent it on for Federal Reserve Board approval, which granted it on June 17 (Atlanta

Board Minutes, June 14, 1929, p. 1597 and July 12, 1929, p.1607).4

         Nevertheless, withdrawals from banks in the center of the state are described as

accelerating at the end of June after Congress adjourned without indemnifying losses caused by

the fruit-fly infestation. Delaying the decision crimped growers’ cash flows, raised the possibility

that growers might not repay their crop loans, and threatened the viability of financial institutions

that loaned large sums to citrus growers.5 Bank directors closed two banks on June 28, the day

that Congress adjourned.6 Six other banks closed in the following week. According to materials

from the Federal Reserve archives, all of these banks had frozen loans.7 Five had experienced

heavy withdrawals. Two of the six had faced financial difficulties after their correspondent bank

closed its doors. In comparison to one year earlier, deposits of Fed member banks in Florida had

fallen by $38.5 million as of June 30, a decline of 16 percent (Atlanta Board Minutes, August 9,

1929, p. 1616). Recognizing that the position of commercial banks was worsening in Florida and

anticipating that it could grow more serious, on July 12, the Board of Directors of the Atlanta

4
  Citizens Bank was also the head of a group of banks in which the majority shareholders in Citizens also
owned controlling shares in these other banks. There also appear to have been other linkages, such as
correspondent relationships, among these institutions. Unless otherwise noted, the banks that were part of
the Citizens Bank group (but not Citizens Bank) are dropped from the sample as their failure is not likely to
be independent of the failure of the lead bank.
5
  Although it is impossible to measure the direct effect of this on the banking system, the value of the citrus
crop was equivalent to about 22 percent of the value of all commercial bank loans in Florida.
6
  Neither of these banks received injections of capital from investors to keep them solvent (Federal Reserve
of Atlanta archives, Minutes of the Board of Directors, July 12th, 1929, p.1606.)




                                                      9
passed a resolution authorizing “revolving currency funds” or “currency depots” in Miami and

Tampa for six months or “for as much time as deemed necessary” to “relieve emergency

situations as may occur”:

        Whereas the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta believe that the
        present emergent conditions in the State of Florida make imperative the
        establishment of currency revolving funds of $1,000,000 each to be placed
        respectively in the cities of Miami and Tampa, to the end that member banks in
        the said two cities, or in the vicinity thereof, may readily obtain supplies of
        currency as urgent need therefore may arise. (Atlanta Board Minutes, July 12,
        1929, p. 1607)

Currency funds were established by the Federal Reserve to permit banks quick access to

currency—typically in areas were large numbers of cash payments needed to be made or in areas

where financial distress was anticipated—and the Federal Reserve expected it would take too

long to ship currency from the Reserve Bank. The proposed currency revolving funds entailed

placing large amounts of currency at “custodian banks,” with the Federal Reserve maintaining

legal possession of the currency. In return, the custodian banks would provide the Federal

Reserve with collateral, in this case, U.S. government securities. Currency could be withdrawn

from the funds by Federal Reserve member banks in cases where cash was being sent to that bank

through the Federal Reserve—such as via wire transfer administered by the Federal Reserve or as

part of a discount window loan—but the currency had not yet arrived when it was needed. Once

the currency arrived it would be used to replenish the fund (Federal Reserve Board of Governors

1938).8 The Atlanta Fed’s resolution authorizing these funds was immediately sent to the Federal

Reserve Board of Governors for approval. The Board of Governors replied on July 16, stating

that the revolving currency funds could be established once the Board received the names of the

Operations, which provide information on the reasons that banks were closed. We describe these reports in
detail below.

  Federal Reserve approval was needed to before funds could be withdrawn. The custodian banks were
liable for losses associated with the revolving currency fund.


                                                   10
member banks, which would serve as custodians of the funds (Atlanta Board Minutes, August 9,

1929, p.1626).9

        Despite the Atlanta Fed’s initial attempts to alleviate distress by allowing nonmember

banks to rediscount through member banks, the withdrawals proved too great for key

correspondents in the citrus areas to handle on their own. Steady withdrawals by country banks

were straining correspondents in Tampa, the financial hub of the citrus industry. 10 The large

correspondent banks in Tampa held reserves of smaller country banks operating in the citrus-

growing regions. Country banks had to draw down their reserves as depositors steadily withdrew

funds. Country banks were likely unable to raise cash by selling assets because most of their

assets were loans to local farms and businesses and were frozen by the fruit-fly situation. On July

17, 1929, country-bank withdrawals forced the directors of the Citizens Bank, an institution with

deposits of $13,695,871, to suspend operations. Citizens Bank had lost a substantial share of its

deposits in the previous three weeks and had discounted most of its eligible assets ($1,884,051) at

the Federal Reserve discount window. The suspension of the Citizens Bank triggered runs at

banks throughout Tampa and nearby municipalities as well as at institutions belonging to the

Citizens Bank Group. Newspaper accounts stated that “frozen assets from the Florida real estate

boom and the inability of citrus growers and truck farmers to meet their obligations after the

invasion of the Mediterranean fruit fly, and the quarantine against the State, are blamed for the

closing of the banks (Financial Chronicle, Saturday, July 20, 1929, p.422).”

        While the runs were in progress, lines of panicked depositors grew outside of all banks

and “business was practically at a standstill in Tampa” (New York Times, July 18, 1929, p.1).

Within 48 hours, 18 banks closed their doors (8 percent of the state’s banks). Many were either

  One could think of rediscounting paper for Citizens Bank and its Bank Group as an effort to provide
support to a particular institution while the revolving currency fund was a general program that could
provide liquidity support to a number of institutions.
10
   A 1939 WPA study of 67 medium-sized bank suspensions suggests that correspondent banks were
particularly vulnerable to deposit outflows. During the banking panics of 1930 and 1931, interbank deposits
declined precipitously. “In most of the banks demand deposits showed somewhat larger percentage

members of Citizens Bank Group or respondents of Citizens Bank, but several nonaffiliated

institutions closed as well. Florida Banking Superintendent Amos stated on July 17 that the

causes of the failures were “unnecessary withdrawals, propaganda, and the mental attitude of the

people. There is a financial depression to a certain degree everywhere in the State which has been

accentuated by the effect of the Mediterranean fruit fly and quarantine. I regard this as the

darkened hour just before the dawn, however, if the people will not tear down the temple upon

their own hands. This is what they are doing now” (Financial Chronicle, Saturday, July 20, 1929,

p.422). During the next week, runs forced seven more banks out of operations. Runs spread

throughout the state, striking the cities of Gainesville, St. Augustine, St. Petersburg, and Orlando,

where, in the latter two cities, banks invoked their right to require 60-day notice for withdrawals

from savings accounts. Further, the Atlanta Fed noted that the runs were affecting banks they

considered sound; “That the loss of confidence is not confined to depositors of the weak banks in

Florida is evidenced by the runs upon the St. Augustine National Bank and the First Bank of

Gainesville” (Atlanta Board Minutes August 9, 1929, p. 1621). What had started as a concern

over the solvency of banks appears to have added a severe liquidity dimension by mid-July.



C. Closing Banks during the Panic

        During the summer of 1929, nearly all the bank suspensions resulted in banks being put

into liquidation by regulators, and hence were classified as bank failures. The primary reason for

the banks being put into liquidation had to do with the procedure used by Florida bank regulators

to deal with banks that closed their doors, even temporarily. Florida’s banking law required

examinations of all banks that ceased making payments to depositors (or other creditors). Banks

that could demonstrate solvency, sound reasons for suspending payments, and the ability to

reopen when the crisis passed were permitted to keep their doors closed temporarily. Banks that


reductions than time deposits, and interbank deposits showed much sharper reductions than either demand
or time.” (Federal Reserve Bulletin, March 1939, p.178.)


                                                  12
could not prove these points were placed in receivership. Since Florida banks had trouble proving

the first two points in the spring and summer of 1929, they were liquidated.11

        The typical Florida bank placed half of its assets in loans and discounts, most of which

financed the revolving credit needs of local businesses. The fruit fly infestation reduced the value

of these loans since the likelihood of repayment depended on the success of the eradication

campaign and on the potential for growers’ to be compensated for their losses, neither of which

was certain during the spring and summer of 1929. Examiners marked most of these loans at their

liquidation value, which under the circumstances fell far short of book value.

        The typical Florida bank placed about one-fifth of their assets into bonds. Banks used

bonds to diversify their portfolio, and usually purchased obligations from governments and

corporations outside of their vicinity. While the fruit fly infestation had little impact on the value

of this portion of Florida’s bank’s portfolios, economic events conspired to drive down bond

prices at this time. As the stock market soared in 1928 and 1929, money flooded into equities and

out from other investments. Bond prices fell and yields rose with the yield on short-term U.S.

government rising from 3.09% in January 1928 to 5.09% in May 1929.

        So, banks that suspended operations during the fruit-fly panic faced scrutiny of their

balance sheets at a time when the bulk of their assets had depreciated in value. Rules required

examiners to mark these assets at their market or liquidation value. These markdowns turned

almost all suspensions into bankruptcies when bank regulators turned their charges over to the

courts, the agency which supervised receiverships and liquidations of banks in Florida.




11
  Upham and Lamke (1934) note that regulators of both state and national banks required banks to mark
bonds and securities to market. Rigorous evaluation of closed banks was especially likely to have been the
case in Florida where Dovell (1955) reports legislation had been passed in 1927 and 1929 at the behest of




                                                   13
D. Discussion

        The evolution of the Florida banking panic appears consistent with some recent

theoretical models. In Morris and Shin (2000) and Goldstein and Pauzner (2002), depositors

receive a noisy signal regarding the health of a financial institution. Based on this signal and their

beliefs about the actions that other depositors might take, depositors decide whether to withdraw.

The distribution of signals determines whether a bank experiences a run. A unique run/no run

equilibrium outcome is determined by the distribution of signals. In these models, there are levels

of signals where the bank clearly survives or fails, but also a region where the equilibrium is self-

fulfilling in the sense that a bank would be forced to liquidate assets inopportunely and become

insolvent if there is a run or remain solvent if there is no run.

        During the Florida panic, there appear to have been signals that caused depositors to

withdraw their funds. In citrus growing areas, the signal was the potential losses due to the

infestation and the lack of government reimbursement following the eradication. For Tampa, the

signal appears to have been the closure of Citizens Bank, which was an indication that banks with

strong ties to the citrus growing region or with large correspondent networks were vulnerable. As

the panic dissipated in the face of liquidity rather than solvency support, it suggests that there

may also have been some self-fulfilling aspects to the runs.

        Some theoretical work building on Morris and Shin (2000), such as Atkeson (2002) and

Hellwig, Mukherji, and Tsyvinski (2006), argue that, in some situations, it is possible for multiple

equilibria to emerge if there is something that generates common knowledge, like an interest rate

that can act as a coordinating mechanism. The panic episode studied in this paper points to some

reasons why a coordination mechanism might not emerge. Banks in Tampa suffered withdrawals

from both their respondents and local depositors, groups with very different information sets that

were geographically segmented. These features would likely have made information gathering


the State Banking Comptroller to strengthen the ability of the Comptroller to close banks and oversee the
liquidation process.


                                                    14
and sharing quite costly and time consuming, so it is unlikely that the deposit rate acted as a

coordinating device. Individual depositors were likely focused on getting their cash out of bank

and were preoccupied with bank survival. Even during this time period, the run seems to have

occurred with considerable speed.

        The spread of the crisis through the correspondent networks is similar to some of the

recent theoretical work by Allen and Gale (2000), who emphasize linkages that can transmit

panics. They show that if bank networks are incomplete, then solvency shocks in one area can

generate liquidity problems and then solvency problems in other areas. This idea matches the

observation that runs spread from banks in the citrus growing areas to Tampa where the focus of

concern appears to include the potential impacts from the failure of other banks.



III. The Atlanta Fed’s Response following the failure of Citizens Bank

        The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta responded quickly to the failure of Citizens Bank

and the subsequent bank runs. The New York Times reported that the Atlanta Fed flew $1,000,000

in cash to Tampa on July 17 and delivered an additional $5,000,000 the next morning. This

currency was likely connected with the establishment of the revolving currency fund. Federal

Reserve officers reportedly delivered the funds to the First National Bank and Exchange National

Bank, the two institutions named as custodians of the currency fund, which remained open but

faced runs in the wake of the closing of Citizens Bank.12 These two institutions had significant

correspondent networks, maintaining correspondent relationships with 31 and 19 other banks,

respectively. At both of these institutions, long lines of customers were waiting to empty their

accounts. “Both [banks] withstood the runs, but when they closed their door this afternoon

throngs were still around the buildings seeking to get to the tellers’ windows to make

withdrawals” (New York Times, July 18, 1929, p. 1). Creed Taylor, Deputy Governor of the




                                                15
Atlanta Reserve Bank arrived in the afternoon of July 17. The Fed official was quoted by the

newspapers as stating that the reserve bank was “prepared to send enough money to pay every

depositor of the First National and the Exchange National if necessary,” that the reserve bank

“would send addition millions if needed and will be used to establish a currency depot” in Tampa

(New York Times, July 18, 1929, p. 1).

        According to newspaper accounts, when the second shipment of Fed money arrived, the

runs on the two Fed member banks in Tampa subsided: “while a number of depositors withdrew

their money, the bank officials reported, at closing time, that the deposits during the day had

exceeded withdrawals…Indications were that confidence had been restored and that in the next

few days most of the money withdrawn yesterday and today will be returned to the vaults of the

banks. The arrival of $5,000,000 here today and yesterday from the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank

and the sight of the money in huge stacks in the cages of the bank tellers had a reassuring effect.

Crowds about the banks were much smaller than yesterday and were there out of curiosity…a run

continued in Ybor City, but officials were able to meet all demands by depositors” (Financial

Chronicle, Saturday, July 20, 1929, p.422).

        The intervention in Tampa illustrates the bold response of the Atlanta Fed to a run on the

banking system. First, the Bank’s policy was highly visible and transparent: high-ranking Reserve

Bank officials came to the scene of the panic to reassure depositors that their accounts were safe.

Second, the policy response was overwhelming rather than incremental in the sense that large

amounts of cash made were immediately made available. The board minutes of the Atlanta Fed

indicate that between the start of the crisis in July and the second week in August, more than $25

million of currency was shipped to Florida to deal with the banking crisis (Atlanta Board

Minutes, August 9, 1929, p. 1624). Third, the response was direct and targeted to the institutions



12
  The minutes of the Atlanta Fed’s discount window committee indicate that Exchange National borrowed
a bit over $1,000,000 on July 20, 1929 through the discount window. It is possible that the cash related to
this loan was drawn from the revolving currency fund.


                                                    16
at the center of the crisis. Comments from Governor Black in the August board minutes make the

Atlanta Fed’s strategy clear:

        Attention should be called to the runs upon the First National Bank of Tampa and
        the Exchange National Bank of Tampa, as reflecting the loss of confidence of the
        citizens of Tampa following the closing of Citizens Bank and Trust Company.
        There were large runs upon both the First National Bank of Tampa and the
        Exchange National Bank of Tampa. Deputy Governor Taylor was present during
        these runs and aided in every way that he could in supplying necessary currency.
        Large sums were sent by airplane by the Jacksonville Branch and large shipments
        were made by mail. On the first day of the run upon these two banks $1,700,000
        was withdrawn from the First National Bank and approximately $1,200,000 from
        the Exchange National Bank. It is gratifying to note that both of these good
        [italics added] banks remained open and that their deposits have been flowing
        back to them. (Atlanta Board Minutes, August 9, 1929, p. 1621..13

        The Atlanta Fed’s actions in Tampa seemed to have been perceived by investors to have

been credible as the bank runs were arrested. The liquidity support provided by the Atlanta Fed in

this episode appears to have had some local precedent. Garrett (1956) describes a crisis of

confidence following the collapse of the Manly-Witham chain during which the Atlanta Fed in

1926 lent heavily to support Polk County National Bank of Bartow, Florida; this bank was

reportedly seen as a “key bank” whose failure might trigger other failures (Garrett, 1956, Chapter

15). The actions taken in Florida in 1929 were also similar to its response to a bank run in Cuba

in 1926 (where the Atlanta Fed operated an agency). In that instance, the Atlanta Fed, in

conjunction with the Board of Governors and the Boston Fed, rushed over $30 million in cash to

Havana, and helped member banks extend credit to correspondents. Newspaper accounts credited

this intervention with stopping depositor withdrawals.14

        Compensation for growers never materialized, but optimistic prognostications concerning

cultivation eventually bore fruit. Before the panic in July, newspaper accounts had predicted the

widespread destruction of groves, massive losses to citrus growers, a multiyear effort to eliminate

the pest, and the wholesale destruction of the citrus industry. The eradication campaign

intensified over the spring and into the summer as additional resources reached the region and

experience gained over the preceding months on how to destroy the pest increased the efficiency

of those on the front lines. After July 15, “no trace of the pest [was] found in Orange county, Fla.,

the territory most heavily infested,” and new methods of eradication enabled “the destruction of

the fly without the loss of valuable groves” (Los Angeles Times, August 8, 1929, p. 11). After

September 1, 2009, the Federal Government eased the quarantine and allowed fruit to be shipped

from orchards more than 10 miles from the nearest infestation.

          Even though the call money market remained tight in the last week of July, the New York

Times reported that the Florida banking crisis had hit rock bottom by the end of the month (New

York Times, July 25 and 28). Evidence from our bank failure series suggests it took until the end

of August for the solvency shock associated with the fruit fly to work its way through the banking

system.



IV. Empirical Analysis of the Florida Panic

          In order to understand the effects of the real shock on the Florida banking system, the

subsequent liquidity crisis, and the Fed’s response, we assemble a new micro-level database on

commercial banks and bank failures in Florida for 1929. We construct a data panel consisting of

all banks that operated in Florida between January and December 1929, which follows individual

bank performance over the year. Our panel contains standard information about bank

characteristics (such as balance sheet information) and economic conditions (such as levels of

farm indebtedness and the condition of the citrus crop) as well as measures of financial distress

(suspensions and liquidations), all changes in bank status (mergers, consolidations forced by

financial difficulties, and voluntary liquidations), and paths of contagion (correspondent linkages,

runs on banks, and geo-coded data showing banks in counties impacted by the quarantine).

Balance sheet data, correspondent relationships, Federal Reserve membership and other

individual bank characteristics comes from the Rand McNally Bankers’ Directory and Polk’s


                                                 18
Bankers Encyclopedia. Rand McNally is published biennially January and July and Polk’s is

published biennially in March and September. Data on Florida and the characteristics of its

counties, which we link to individual bank data, comes from the United States Censuses of

Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Population.

        Three independent sources enable us to determine the dates and the nature of Florida’s

banking crisis. The Board of Governors’, Division of Bank Operations on Form St. 6386b,

reports individual bank suspensions and their causes. Form St. 6386c reports changes in bank

status, such as re-openings of suspended institutions and voluntary liquidations, a category of

closures in which banks ceased operations and arranged to repay depositors the full value of their

deposits without the intervention of courts or receivers. These data distinguish between temporary

and permanent closures of banks. A temporary suspension occurred when a bank closed its doors

to the public for at least one business day even if the bank later reopened for business. Permanent

liquidations were the subset of suspensions where insolvent banks permanently ceased operations,

surrendered charters, sold assets, and repaid creditors under the auspices of a court appointed

officer called a receiver. The second source is the narrative description of events contained within

the biennial reports of Florida’s state banking department. The third is articles in newspapers and

periodicals including the Atlanta Journal, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Wall Street

Journal, and the Commercial and Financial Chronicle.

        The correspondent networks play an important role as the transmission mechanism and

Table 1 provides some summary statistics of these relationships. We define a major

correspondent as any hub institution that had at least seven respondents (banks that received

clearing, liquidity, and other services from the correspondent). There are nine such institutions in

Florida at the start of 1929, located in a few major cities. All but a handful of banks had

relationships with at least one of these institutions and many had multiple relationships. The table

also shows that about half of the banks that used Citizens bank as a correspondent also had a

relationship with at least one other institution, suggesting how the failure of Citizens Bank could


                                                19
have been a source for contagion and bank runs. Many of the major correspondent banks had

respondents located in the areas subject to the quarantine, although Citizens Bank had the largest

share of respondents in these areas.



A. Deposit Analysis

        To provide some insight into the evolution of the crisis, we make use of the unique data

we collected on deposits and correspondent relationships. We first document that deposit

outflows are most significant in areas that were clearly affected by the quarantine. As banks in

these areas were exposed to the initial solvency shock, it would be natural for risk-averse

depositors or other banks to remove some of their funds from these banks. This is what we

observe. Table 2 shows that deposit outflows from March until June were much greater in areas

where the eradication efforts were centered than in other areas.

        The historical record suggests that these country banks began drawing down reserves in

Tampa banks as depositors in citrus-growing areas steadily withdrew funds. As described above,

Citizens’ Bank, with deposits of more than $13 million, suspended operations on July 17, 1929 as

a result of deposit withdrawals, which then triggered runs on other banks in Tampa and the

surrounding areas.

        Deposit data again shed light on the pressure that the key correspondent banks in Tampa

were facing. Table 3 shows that the Citizens Bank Group faced a large drain on its deposits

between March 1929 and either June 1929 or the date member of the bank group closed (the

interval for which we have data). Correspondents of Citizens Bank that were not a part of the

group also saw sharp declines in deposits, though not as large as members of the group. These

declines were much more pronounced than declines at banks not affiliated with Citizens Bank,

showing that the pressure this institution was facing and suggesting why it sought succor from the

Atlanta Fed. Even prior to the failure of Citizens, the two other major national banks in the city,




                                                20
Exchange National of Tampa and First National of Tampa, and their correspondents also faced

significant depositor withdrawals (Table 4).

        Another type of financial institution that existed in Florida in 1929 provides additional

perspective on the spread of the panic. During the crisis, Florida’s 68 building and loan societies

(B&Ls) experienced few withdrawals and no failures. Nevertheless, B&Ls faced substantial

exposure to agricultural shocks because the majority of their investments were tied to local real

estate, whose value would decline if farmers could not sell crops. However, B&Ls lacked

exposure to contagion since they did not rely on the commercial banking system’s correspondent

network in a significant way. B&L deposits at correspondent banks were small and they did not

rely on them for check clearing. B&Ls also lacked exposure to sudden depositor withdrawals

because they did not possess demand deposits. They offered only time deposits, in the form of

mutual shares or certificates of deposit, and these required 30-days’ notice prior to withdrawal.

Shocks which might have forced building and loans to cease operations would have thus resulted

in lower share prices for all members (Comptroller of Florida, 1929 to 1931).

        Newspaper accounts and the minutes of the Atlanta Fed indicate that pressure on

Exchange and First National increased substantially following the failure of Citizens Bank.

Calculations based on figures from the Atlanta Fed’s minutes suggest that Exchange National and

First National saw their deposits decline by 11 and 12 percent, respectively, on the first day of the

panic.15 If deposit withdrawals had continued at this rate, Exchange National Bank would have

exhausted its ready reserves (cash plus bankers’ balances) on the second day of the panic, and it

would have run out of securities that could have been sold and loans that could have been

discounted on the fifth or sixth day of the panic. First National Bank would have lasted almost as

long. It would have run out of ready reserves just after lunchtime on the second day, and would

have exhausted liquid assets three days later.


15
  These calculations compare the declines of $1,200,000 and $1,700,000 in deposits for Exchange National
and First National, respectively, with March (pre-panic) values of deposits.


                                                  21
         The Atlanta Fed intervened on July 17 by shipping currency to Tampa and publicly

announcing support for institutions under pressure. These efforts appear to have successfully

restored confidence in these banks. As shown in Table 4, deposits from June (prior to the panic)

through September were little changed at banks having correspondent relationships with the two

remaining key banks in Tampa.



B. Did the Fed’s Intervention Prevent Solvent Banks from Failing?

         The historical narrative and data on deposits suggests that a banking panic occurred in

Tampa in mid-July 1929 and was spreading throughout the Florida banking system. A key

question is whether the Federal Reserve’s intervention in Tampa mattered such that otherwise

solvent banks were able to survive the panic. 16 We address this question using several

counterfactual scenarios.

         To construct these counterfactuals, we first determine the probability of failure of

individual banks over different time horizons.17 We divide 1929 into four periods:

     •   Period 1: June 26-July 16 – after Congress adjourns with no compensation to citrus

         growers;

     •   Period 2: July 17-July 19 – Citizens Bank in Tampa fails, Tampa panic occurs;

     •   Period 3: July 20-August 5 – following the Fed intervention with support to two Tampa

         national banks; and

     •   Period 4: August 6 until the end of the year – the period after last bank fails due to

         deposit losses and the panic subsides.




16
   Records of the Discount Window Committee from the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank list discount loans
made by the Atlanta Fed in 1929. Regression analysis does not find a systematic relationship between
discount window loans to banks in Florida in the weeks leading up to Citizens Bank’s failure and a change
in the failure/survival outcome during the panic period.
17
   We drop banks that were members of Citizens Bank Group from the analysis from here forward as their
fate was dependent on that of the main bank.


                                                   22
We estimate a logit regression using individual bank data that includes information regarding the

correspondent relationships (which we argue served to transmit the shock), exposure to the fruit

fly eradication program, and the expected probability of survival from a first-stage regression

using pre-crisis period characteristics. The second-stage logit regression takes the form:

    (1) Fail/No Fail = f (period, major correspondent in Jacksonville, period*major Florida non-

        Jacksonville correspondent, period*major Florida non-Jacksonville correspondent fails,

        other bank in county experiences a run in current or preceding period, quarantine zone

        county, period*expected survival probability from first stage.

We divide the major correspondents into those in Jacksonville and outside Jacksonville because

there was a branch of the Atlanta Fed located in Jacksonville, so concerns about liquidity issues

and the response to Federal Reserve liquidity provision programs may have operated differently

there. Since we are interested in estimating the effects of the major correspondents on

respondents, we exclude these 9 banks from the estimation. Of the major Florida correspondents,

Citizens Bank is the only one that failed in 1929.

        To construct the first-stage regression, we use balance sheet information from all Florida

commercial banks in existence in January 1929 to examine whether these bank characteristics

were good predictors of failure in the pre-crisis period. Our predictors for suspension are (log)

total assets, interest-earning assets as a share of total assets, bonds and securities’ share of

interest-earning assets, net worth to total assets, liquid deposits, the (log) age of the bank, and the

population of the town where the bank is located. Table 5 shows logit (maximum likelihood)

estimates of the probability of suspending prior to June 26 (just before Congress adjourns without

appropriating funds to reimburse orange growers and before the banking panic begins) based on

1929:Q1 characteristics.

        Generally consistent with previous studies, the results from the first-stage regression

show that that, all else equal, banks were less likely to suspend when they held more bonds

relative to loans (bonds tended to be less risky and more liquid), were older, and were located in a


                                                  23
larger town. Banks with more cash on hand relative to deposits were also less likely to close.

These regressions reveal that measures of bank health (reflecting solvency, liquidity, portfolio

risk, and owner’s exposure among other factors) were correlated with failure in much the same

way as other studies of bank failures during this period (Calomiris and Mason 1997, 2003; White

1984; Carlson 2010).

        These failure regressions establish a baseline that we use in the second stage to provide

an indicator of the health of each bank coming into the banking panic. That is, since these

regressions use balance sheet data and failure information from the period prior to the panic, we

use the predicted probabilities of survival from them as ex ante measures of the condition of each

bank on the eve of the panic.

        Regression results estimating equation (1) are shown in Table 6. As one would expect,

given the source of the shock, being in a county in which the infestation occurred increased the

likelihood of failure. The expected survival probability from the first-stage regression also tends

to decrease the likelihood of failure, suggesting that banks that were healthier before July were

less likely to fail. We find that being in the vicinity of bank runs is associated with an increased

likelihood of failure. Overall, the regression reasonably predicts failure over the year. The

average predicted probability of failure conditional on the banks failing is 15 percent whereas the

average predicted probability of failure conditional on having survived the panic is 3 percent.

        We find that having a major correspondent bank fail notably increased the odds that its

respondents would fail. There are a few potential reasons for this finding. First, the major

correspondents served as a source of liquidity for their respondents and having this source dry up,

especially during a panic, may have prompted some banks to close their doors. Correspondents

also provided important clearing services for their respondents and the loss of the correspondent

may have negatively affected the business prospects of these institutions. Also, during a panic,




                                                24
being a respondent of a failing correspondent bank may have caused concern among other banks

or depositors about the health of the respondent and prompted withdrawals.18

         To consider what would have happened if the banking panic had gone unchecked, we

calculate failures for several different scenarios. The first row of Table 7 shows actual failures

during the period July 20 to August 5, 1929. The second row shows failures in this period

predicted by our regression. The third row considers a scenario where the two key correspondent

banks in Tampa (Exchange National and First National) failed. We do this by changing the

indicator variable for having a large non-Jacksonville correspondent bank fail from zero to one

for banks that used Exchange National or First National as a correspondent and recalculating the

expected probability of failure of each bank. (Thus, we assume that the impact of the failure of

Exchange National or First National has the same impact on likelihood of failure of their

respondents as the failure of Citizens Bank had on its respondents.) We estimate that 14 banks

would have failed if the Fed had not intervened – nearly doubling the failures that actually

occurred during the crisis period.19 Having all non-Jacksonville correspondents fail, the fourth

row of Table 7, would have increased failures slightly more. The last row of Table 7 shows the

results from a counterfactual scenario where all major correspondent banks—those in

Jacksonville and outside Jacksonville—failed, assuming that the impact of a failure of a

Jacksonville correspondent would have had the same impact as the failure of other banks. We

construct this “upper bound” estimate of the impact of the crisis in a manner similar to the

previous counterfactual only with the indicator of a large correspondent failing equal to one for a



18
   Others, such as Carlson (2004), have found that the loss of a correspondent bank increases the likelihood
that a smaller “downstream” bank will close.
19
   Although we are able to provide some plausible estimates as to how much worse the situation would
have been without the policy intervention, we are not able to identify the exact channel by which the
Federal Reserve liquidity support mattered. One possibility is that the intervention prevented fire sales
and/or mitigated depositor concerns that the banks would be unable to meet deposit withdrawals when
needed. A second possibility is that the intervention may have bought depositors time, allowing them to
evaluate the quality of banks during periods when asset values were less uncertain and reduce the
information problems that can generate runs (Morris and Shin 2000). One might also imagine other
channels.

larger set of institutions. Under this extreme scenario, we calculate that 30 percent of all banks in

Florida would have failed.

        The counterfactuals provides some estimates of further banking distress in Florida absent

Fed intervention; however, it is likely that they fail to capture some of the effects that the

intervention had on restoring confidence in Florida’s banking system. We know from historical

accounts that runs occurred in other cities like St. Augustine and Gainesville, and these ended

when the Atlanta Fed intervened (Atlanta Board Minutes, August 9, 1929, p.1621). To what

extent, then, did the Fed’s action halt deposit withdrawals that would have otherwise led to a fire

sale of assets, additional suspensions, and a broader banking crisis? Such a calculation would be

straightforward if it were possible to count how many banks ceased having runs after the Fed

intervened. Since we cannot determine this figure, we instead compute estimates of banks that

would have exhausted cash and liquid reserves for deposit withdrawals of various magnitudes.

Once liquid reserves are exhausted by depositor withdrawals, banks might have been forced to

call in loans or attempt to dispose of less liquid assets at fire sale prices. However, many of the

banks facing runs in July 1929 may have had significant exposure via loans to citrus growers, and

since the valuations on these loans was uncertain, it is likely that many if not all of the banks

facing deposit withdrawals greater than their liquid reserves would have been forced to suspend.

        Table 8 indicates the suspensions or fire sales that would have resulted from deposit

losses of various sizes. The calculations are based on June 30 call-report data for state banks and

July 1 data for national banks. Banks typically held less than 35 percent of their assets as liquid

reserves, so we use this as the highest value in the table: values above this would have resulted in

the closure of all banks. Although we present a range of deposit withdrawals in the table, it may

be fruitful to think about what value is most plausible. As we have noted above, the key event of

the panic was the failure of failure of Citizens Bank Group, which saw deposits fall by 30 percent




                                                 26
before suspending.20 So, assuming deposit declines of 30 percent in our “stress test,” we find that

more than 50 percent of all banks would have been in a “fire sale” situation or suspended if they

only had access to cash. Roughly 6 percent of banks would have suspended or invoked a “fire

sale” if they could use all their liquid reserved to fight deposit withdrawals. This means that, even

in cases where banks could have drained all their liquid reserves to fight off a run, the number of

failures in the panic period would have roughly doubled.

        As might be expected, experiences on how quickly banks shut down appear to have

depended on how severe deposit losses were prior to the panic in July. Institutions that

experienced deposit losses during the spring quarter (after the discovery of the fruit fly and before

Congress adjourned at the end of June) closed their doors rapidly once runs began. Others were

reported to have closed their doors to forestall runs that they feared would materialize.

Institutions whose deposits remained stable in the spring sustained larger losses of deposits before

closing their doors. If we use the rate of withdrawals from banks in Tampa on July 16th and 17th

(as reported in the minutes of the Board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta) as a benchmark,

then we can approximate how many days banks stayed open before closing. Using this metric,

more than half of all banks closed on the first day that they were run. Most remaining banks

suspended on the second day that they were run. A few opened on the third morning, but none

survived three full days.

        Of course, once runs spread more widely and a fire sale begins, spillovers to otherwise

solvent institutions are likely to occur and a vicious cycle can develop which would push failures

notably higher (Summers, 2008). These findings are consistent with the evidence from the

Atlanta Fed’s archives in that it suggests that the Fed’s intervention played an important role in

stopping the panic and from preventing an even more severe crisis from occurring.

20
  Two other examples support the 30 percent drop as a reasonable benchmark. Mississippi experienced a
banking panic in November –December 1930 where the Fed did not intervene; in this episode the gross
outflow of deposits was also approximately 30 percent. The WPA study of 67 medium-sized banks that

V. Conclusion

        Just as the Federal Reserve took emergency measures to respond to the financial crisis of

2008 and 2009, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta was willing to undertake extraordinary

measures in the summer of 1929 to prevent a meltdown of Florida’s financial system. After the

failure of Citizens Bank group, the Atlanta Fed responded to the panic taking place in key

correspondent banks in Tampa by shuttling cash from its headquarters to the scene of banking

distress, and by publicly pronouncing that it would take all means necessary to ensure the safety

of depositors. Without this intervention, we estimate that bank failures would otherwise have

been twice as high as what they turned out to be.

        The response by the Atlanta Fed stands out for two reasons. First, it suggests that prior to

1930 the Federal Reserve had the knowledge and experience to calm anxious depositors and

bankers during a panic. Federal Reserve officials demonstrated that they could effectively

leverage their discount window lending capability with public announcements. This raises

intriguing questions about the Federal Reserve’s response to Depression-era bank panics where

the Federal Reserve has been criticized as not responding forcefully enough. Scholars have put

forth a number of potential reason why this might have been the case, though the matter is far

from resolved. Friedman and Schwartz (1963) argued that the Fed was either unwilling or unable

to provide support. Wood (2005) argues that the Federal Reserve was more focused on the New

York financial markets, especially the money markets, for signs of panics. Eichengreen (1992)

and Temin (1989) emphasized that the Fed was constrained in its ability to respond as long as it

stayed on the gold standard. Given that considerably more control over policy was given to the

regional Federal Reserve Banks at that time, and, as pointed out by Wood (2006) and Meltzer

(2003), there was considerable disagreement among the Reserve Banks and between the Reserve


suspended during the Great Depression finds that average deposits declined by 37 percent prior over a
period of two years prior to suspension (Federal Reserve Bulletin, March 1939, p. 178).

Banks and the Board of Governors about the cause and appropriate response to the economic

stresses during the 1930s, formulating a strong response to the more widespread Depression-era

banking panics might have been difficult. This challenge may have provided a further impetus for

the strengthening of the Board of Governors during the financial reform acts of the 1930s.

        Recent scholarship has provided evidence that more activist lender of last resort policies

during panics might have helped moderate the number of banking failures during the 1930s.

Carlson (2010) argues that panics can be disruptive because the increased difficulty obtaining

accurate information during such periods combined with an elevated number of banks needing

assistance during these periods can reduce the number of banks able to recapitalize or merge with

other institutions and thus raise the number of failures. Further, Richardson and Troost (2009)

find that active lending by the Federal Reserve during the panics of the Depression helped reduce

bank failures.

        This brings us to the second reason why the episode is important. The Florida banking

panic illustrates how an insolvency shock (in this case the potential losses stemming from the

destruction of the citrus crop) can induce runs on banks and a precipitate a liquidity crisis. We

also describe how correspondent banking networks can transmit shocks from the smaller

institutions to the main liquidity providing banks. We demonstrate that problems at these

correspondents can then spread back out to other banks and provide a channel for contagion.

        The Florida banking panic nevertheless shows how central bank policy interventions can

be successfully used to respond to shocks of this nature as the intervention by the Atlanta Fed

appears to have contributed importantly to ending the liquidity crisis and our estimates suggest it

kept some otherwise solvent banks from being closed.

Note: The table shows how many banks that would have exhausted various liquid assets given the decline
in deposits shown in column 1. 13.2 percent is the deposit loss before suspension (from June 30 until mid-
July) experienced by banks that failed during the July panic. 22 percent is the deposit loss before
suspension (from January until suspension) for all banks that failed during the year of 1929.
