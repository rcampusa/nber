        A free trade agreement supports global free trade since trade barriers tend to divert trade

in favor of members, but not reduce imports. The tam: mutual assured deterrence' is used to

refer to a regional free trade association that has the feature that no member can gain individually

from the imposition of a barrier against a non-member. Mutual assured deterrence is shown to

be possible for a surprisingly rich set of partners.

       A customs union is compatible with global free trade if the vast majority of trade takes

place naturally within the confmes of the association. A customs union that is likely to have this

property would combine countries to form a nearly exact economic replica of the globe.

       The economic combination of Mexico and the United States doesn't form a replica of the

global economy because, compared with Asia, North America has relatively high capital per

worker even after adding the Mexican workforce. However, NAFTA does seem to have the

property of mutual assured deterrence, and may for that reason amount to a commitment to global

free trade as well as regional free trade.

I. INTRODUCTION

      There is an eerie sense of deja vu that accompanies the splitting

of the world into three regional trading blocs organized around the

principal protagonists of a drama of another sort: the United States,

Japan and Germany.

      But regionalism can be compatible with globalism. Indeed

regionalism may be the only route by which a global economy can be

achieved because of the political constraints and complexities that make

global trade agreements like GAfl difficult to craft and even wore

difficult to enforce.

      Regionalism implies globalism when regional trading associations

are formed that minimize the incentives for erecting barriers against

non-members. Krugman(199la) observes that if customs unions seek to

exploit monopoly power in their external markets then it is undesirable

to have either too many or too few customs unions. As the number of

customs unions (including separate countries) diminishes, each gets
                                                                           2



 larger and the degree of monopoly power in the external markets

 increases, as do tariff levels. But also as the number of customs

unions diminishes, more and more trade is internal to the blocs and not

 subject to barriers. These offsetting forces can produce a complicated

relationship between world welfare and the number of customs unions, but

Krugman offers a provocative example in which the worst number is three!

Krugman(1991b) has a different tone, emphasizing the substantial effect

of distance on trade patterns. If most trade is naturally among close

neighbors, and if associations are formed on a regional basis, then

these associations may protect most of world trade from government

interference.

      This paper presents another argument why a free trade agreement

may be very supportive of globalism. A free trade agreement allows

members to select their own barriers against non-members. Barriers that

are raised by one country alone may only divert trade away from non-

members toward other members but not protect the market of the country

that erects the barrier. Such a country would have a reduced incentive

to impose barriers, whether the barriers are intended to exploit

external monopoly power or to redistribute income.

      The two-good model of Vanek(1965) captures the spirit of the

deterrence idea being discussed here.2 Suppose that C is a large

country that determines the world terms of trade, that B is a smaller

version of C with the same autarchic price ratios, and that A has

different factor supplies and different autarchic price ratios. If A

and 3 form a free trade agreement, and A imposes barriers against

imports from C, A's trade is diverted away from C in favor of B. This

good and three-good customs unions.
                                                                          3



benefits B, the country that does not trade with the outsider, at the

expense of A, the country imposing the barriers. The benefits to A in

terms of income redistribution may be worth the cost, even with this

trade diversion effect. However, since the costs are higher with the

free trade agreement than without, we may conclude that the barriers

against C imposed by A will be less if the free trade agreement is in

place.

         More explicitly, if there is a free trade agreement between Mexico

and the United States, barriers to imports of apparel, for example, into

the United States from Asia might primarily divert trade from Asia in

favor of Mexico but have little protective effect in the U.S.

marketplace. In that event, the free trade agreement between the United

States and Mexico greatly reduces the benefits to U.S. apparel

manufacturers that come from trade barriers erected against Asian

products and these barriers are much less likely to be erected. After

all, why should U.S. manufacturers go to all the trouble to petition for

protection from Asian products, when all that protection does is to

increase competition from Mexico? Generally, U.S. barriers against

Asian products are likely to be lower with the North American Free Trade

Agreement than without. Offsetting that effect from the Asian

perspective is the preferential treatment given to Mexican products.

         1 propose to borrow from another literature the term: "mutual

assured deterrence" to refer to a regional free trade association that

has the feature that no member can gain individually from the imposition

of a barrier against a non-member. You may suspect that mutual assured

deterrence is very difficult to achieve, but your thinking probably does

not take into account the fact that a barrier erected by one member
                                                                            4


 creates an incentive for other members to ship all of their production

 to the protected, high-priced marketplace, and to import from non-

 members low-priced goods for consumption purposes. When this effect is

 properly taken into account, mutual assured deterrence is possible for a

 surprisingly rich set of partners.

       If the regional association is a customs union, with common

 external barriers, the concept of mutual assured deterrence is

 inapplicable. For customs unions, two arguments are presented why

 regional associations may promote globalism. One possibility is that

 the customs union is formed in a way such that the vast majority of

 trade takes place naturally within the confines of the association.

Then there is very little reason to erect barriers against non-members

because the barriers would have little effect. A customs union that is

likely to have this property would combine countries to form a nearly

exact economic replica of the globe, thereby eliminating most of the

reason for external trade. Incidentally, as Krugman(l99lb) observes,

the regional aspect of "regionalism" is an important feature since most

trade naturally takes place over fairly short distances. A customs

union between the United States and Mexico is much more likely for this

reason to be supportive of globalism than is an association between the

United States and Russia, since the later will encompass a much smaller

share of the members trade.

      Another reason why a customs union may be less likely to erect

barriers against non-members is that members may have conflicting

interests that tend to offset each other. In the EEC, apparel sold in

the United Kingdom will come from Portugal or from Asia but will not be

produced much in the U.K. The EEC debate over the erection of barriers
                                                                          5


against Asian apparel thus pits U.K. consumers against Portuguese

producers, which may be more of a standoff than a watch between U.K.

consumers and U.K. producers.

      Two intellectual tools are helpful in elucidating these ideas.

First there is the Stolper-Sanuelson theorem which maps changes in goods

prices induced by trade barriers into changes in factor earnings. The

traditional Stolper-Sainuelson theorem is not perfectly suited to the

study of regional associations because it is based on an implicit

assumption that earnings come entirely from the supply of labor services

or entirely from the supply of capital earnings. It is not difficult to

adopt the result to deal with regions with mixed ownership of capital

and labor. Not surprisingly, regions with relatively large supply of

labor prefer high prices for labor intensive goods. Regional Stolper-

Samuelson theorems are the subject of the next section.

         Sections III, IV and V examine regional associations using several

different kinds of economic models including partial equilibrium, one-

cone Heckscher-Ohlin general equilibrium and multicone Heckscher-Ohlin

general equilibrium models, with and without internal factor mobility.

It will be shown that if association members are large enough to satisfy

the demand for imports from third countries, then the discriminatory

barriers are completely ineffective since they divert but do not destroy

trade.

         After all this heavy-duty economic theory, Section VI wraps up

with some empirical evidence regarding the propÃ¼sed North American Free

Trade Agreement. The economic combination of Mexico and the United

States doesn't seem to form a replica of the global economy because,

compared with Asia, North America has relatively high capital per worker
                                                                            6



even after adding the Mexican workforce. However, Mexico does seem

large enough to satisfy a substantial share of U.S. demand for labor

intensive manufactures and for that reason the NAFTA may serve as a

major deterrent to the erection of U.S. barriers against Asia.

II. STOLPER-SMUELSON WITH MIXED OWNERSHIP

      The Lerner-Pearce diagram in Figure 1 is a standard graphical

setting in which to demonstrate the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem. On this

figure are drawn unit-value isoquants for two products. These unit-

value isoquants are combinations of capital and labor that are required

to produce a unit value of output. For ease of graphing primarily,

these are drawn as right angles indicating that there are no

substitution possibilities in either sector. Machinery is assumed to be

the capital intensive sector with a fixed capital per worker which is

higher than textiles. Also on this diagram is drawn a unit cost line

through the corners of the two unit-value isoquants. This is the only

unit cost line that is compatible with the production of both goods at

zero profits. The equation for this isocost line is 1 â€” w L-t. r K, where

w is the wage rate and r is the capital rental rate. This line

accordingly crosses the labor axis at 1/v and the capital axis at hr.

both of which are labelled in the figure.

      The Stolper-Samuelson theorem postulates an increase in the price

of textiles, for example, and computes the induced changes in the factor

earnings. In Figure 1, the increase in the price of textiles shifts the

unit-value isoquant for textiles inward to the dotted right-angle,

indicating that it takes less capital and labor to produce a unit value

of textiles after the price goes up. This is accompanied by a shift in
                                                                          7



the unit isocost to the dotted line, which can be seen implies a higher

wage rate( w'>w) and a lower return on capital. Thus;

The Stolyer-Samuelspn Theorem: A rise in the price of a product gives

      rise to an increase in the (real) earnings of the factor used

      intensively in that product and a reduction in the (real) earnings

      of the other factor.

      The Stolper-Samuelson result implicitly is based on the assumption

of pure ownership; An individual either supplies only labor services or

only capital services. It is not difficult to amend the result to deal

with mixed ownership. The unit cost lines can be interpreted as the

combinations of factors that can earn enough to purchase either a unit

value of machinery or a unit value of textiles. The solid line unit

cost line thus represents combinations of factors that can purchase

either a unit of machinery or a unit of textiles at the original prices.

Since the price of machinery is unchanged1 the initial and final unit

cost lines represent ownership needs for the purchase of a like amount

of machinery. These two lines have one point in cÃ mmon: the point

labelled H where the ownership ratio is equal to the input ratio in

machinery. Thus a person who consumed only machinery and who owned a

combination of factors that were just suited to machinery production

would be unaffected by this price increase in textiles. If this

machinery-consuming individual owned more capital, she could buy less

machinery after the price increase in textiles. If this individual

owned more labor, then she could buy more machinery after the price

change.

      Another line is necessary to discuss the factor needs to purchase

the original amount textiles because the new unit cost line refers to
                                                                             8



 textiles that are sold at higher prices. To determine the ownership

needs to purchase the old quantity of textiles it is necessary to draw a

 line parallel to the new unit cost line through the corner of the old

textiles unit value isoquant. This line is labelled "Ownership Needs

for Textile Consumption.     This line crosses the original unit cost line

at the point T. Thus a person who consumed only textiles and who owned

a combination of factors that were just suited to textile production

would be unaffected by this price increase in textiles. If this

textile-consuming individual owned more capital, she could buy less

textiles after the price increase. If she owned more labor, then she

could buy more textiles.

      Incidentally, the Stolper-Samuelson theorem refers to the points

where these two consumption lines cross the two axes: If only labor is

owned, the price increase in textiles leaves one better off regardless

of the consumption good, but relatively better off in machinery

consumption than textile consumption.

      The following results come straightforwardly from Figure 1:

StolDer-Samuelson Theorem with Extreme Ownershin:     If ownership of the

      factors lies outside the interval between the capital/labor ratios

      of the two industries, an increase in the price of the labor

      intensive good increases the real earnings of labor abundant

      individuals and reduces the real earnings of capital abundant

     individuals, regardless of the good consumed.

Stoloer-Samuelson   Theorem with Intermediate Ownershiv:   If ownership of
     the factors lies between the intensity ratios in the two
     industries,    then an increase in the price of the labor-intensive
     good increases the real consumption power in terms of the labor-
                                                                          9



      intensive good but lowers the real consumption power in terms of

      the capital-intensive good.

III. A PARTIAL EQUILIBRIUM MODEL OF A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT

      A  second tool for studying regional associations is the partial
equilibrium diagram, Figures 2 and 3, which indicate the effect of a
free trade agreement between the United States and Mexico in a setting

in which the United States has an external barrier but Mexico has none.

These figures convey the important message that the effect of the PTA on

the United States depends critically on the economic size of Mexico.3

Figure 2 indicates the effect of a ETA when the form of the U.S.

protection is a tariff. In this figure the world price and the U.S.

protected price are illustrated with horizontal lines. The downward

sloping curve is the U.S. import demand and the two upward sloping lines

are alternative Mexican supply curves. If Mexico is small and has the

supply curve close to the vertical axis, then, prior to the

establishment of the FTA, Mexican production would be AR and U.S. import

demand would be CE. A portion of the Mexican supply would go to

satisfying home demand and, if there is any left over, the rest might

find its way to the U.S. market. After the ETA, all the Mexican output

is sold at the high U.S. prices and Mexican demand is satisfied at the

world price from third sources. The Mexican supply to the U.S. market

increases to CD which crowds out third country exports to the U.S. The

total trade diversion is between CD and CD- AD, the latter figure

applicable if all the Mexican product were sold in the U.S. market prior

to the PTA. The facts are that very little of Mexican product is


  Discussion like this can be found in McCulloch and Pinera(1977) who
offer a partial equilibrium treatment of the tariff case. Gardner and
Kimbrough(1990) do the general equilibrium case.
                                                                           10


 currently sold in the U.S. and the larger figure CD seems applicable.

On the other hand, the simple diagram includes no transportation and

marketing costs which would encourage home sales and which would prevent

all the Mexican product from being sold in the U.S.

      If this first supply curve is applicable, then the PTA would not

affect the prices at which goods sell inside the United States. Rut now

move the Mexican supply to the right. At some point it will intersect

the U.S. demand at the point E where all U.S. import demand is satisfied

from Mexican sources. Further increases in Mexican supply will drive

down the U.S. internal price. If the Mexican supply curve goes through

the point F on the U.S. import demand curve then the world price would

prevail in the U.S. markets. Further increases in Mexican supply would

not cause further reductions in the U.S. price since Mexican suppliers

would not sell at any price lower than the one prevailing in the world

market. The dashed line in the lower right of Figure 2 illustrates this

case. Total Mexican supply is AG. The amount Al is sold in the U.S.

market at world prices and the remainder FC is sold partly at home and

partly in third markets. From this figure we derive the following

important conclusion: If Mexico is large enough that she can conDletely

satisfy inciient import demand of the U.S. that would occur at world

parket prices, then an PTA would completely dismantle U.S. Drotection.

     A substantially different description applies to the quota case

illustrated in Figure 3. Here the quota is assumed to be quantity EG

and prices inside the U.S. market are adjusted so that import supply and

import demand are equalized. This quota level is selected to create an

initial equilibrium equivalent to the tariff equilibrium depicted in

Figure 2. With the formation of the PTA, the equivalence of the quota
                                                                           11



and tariff breaks down. The smallest amount of Mexican supply

supplements the quota-restricted imports and puts downward pressure on

U.S. prices. The flA price can be found in Figure 3 by defining U.S.

import demand net of Mexican supply and then selecting a U.S. price that

equates net demand to the quota level. This import price is lower than

the U.S. protected price, even though Mexico is too small to satisfy

total U.S. import demand. Note that by moving the Mexican supply to the

right, one may conclude that the U.S. price reverts to the unprotected

world market price if Mexican supply Is enough to make up the difference

between the U.S. import demand that would occur at the world price and

the quota level of imports. In the extreme, if the quota level is zero,

then we revert to the tariff conclusion: The world price prevails if

Mexico is large enough to satisfy completely U.S. import demand at the

world market price.

IV. REGIONAL ASSOCIATIONS; ONE CONE HECKSCItER-OHLIN MODEL

      The partial equilibrium analysis of the effect of a free trade

agreement can be interestingly introduced into the "one-cone" Heckscher-

Ohlin model depicted in Figure 4. This "one-cone" model uses the

assumption that all countries have endowment supplies falling between

the capital/labor ratios in the two industries. In this model, a

regional association that had a combined supply of capital and labor

with exactly the same capital/labor ratio as the world totals would be a

holographic replica of the world's economy and would not need to engage

in trade with any non-members, provided of course that taste differences

are not a source of trade. Since the autarchic prices of this regional

association are the same as the world's prices, there would be no trade

external to the association and no effect of trade barriers. If
                                                                           12



barriers were already in place before the regional association were

formed, the barriers might remain, although they would have the effect

only of hastening the adjustment to the new equilibrium in which there

is substantial trade among the members of the association and very

little trade otherwise. Incidentally, just as openness is not properly

measured by trade dependence1 globalism is not properly measured by the

amount of extra-association trade, which in the case just considered

would be zero even if the association were completely open.

      A. Customs Union

      If the combined regional factor supply were not a replica of the

world's total factor supply, then the regional association would have a

demand for imports from non-members. The two tools that were discussed

in the previous two sections would then became applicable, first the

Stolper Samuelson Theorem and then the analysis of trade diversion. If

the association is a customs union with common external barriers then

the regional Stolper Samuelson theorem indicates the conditions under

which the trade barriers have the greatest effect on redistributing

income between regions, namely when the factor ownership patterns are

very different among regions. It seems natural to surmise that

disparity in regional effects tends to reduce barriers since it

encourages regional coalitions in opposition. Of course, it is possible

that this would work in the opposite way: The greater the regional

redistributive effect of the barrier, the more likely that it will be

erected.

      B. Free Trade Agreement

      If the association is a free trade agreement, barriers erected by

one member against non-members may only divert trade in favor of members
                                                                          13


but have no protective effect. This was discussed using partial

equilibrium models in the context of Figures 2 and 3. Figure 4 is a

general equilibrium analog of these two diagrams. Here we have the

United States and Mexico both with factor supplies located inside the

cone swept out by the expansion vectors for machinery and for textiles.

On this diagram is drawn also a line representing the world's ratio of

capital to labor. The vector connecting the U.S. factor supply point

with this world factor supply line is the tJS. net imports of factor

services. As drawn, the U.S. is abundant in capital, exports capital

services and imports labor services. This service flow is accomplished

by exporting the capital intensive good, machinery, and importing the

labor intensive good, textiles.

      Suppose now that the United States were to impose trade barriers

against the imports of textiles from Asia. This would tend to divert

textile trade toward Mexico. Is the diversion effect enough to

completely undo the U.S. protectionism? The answer is yes if Mexican

total supply of textiles is enough to satisfy the U.S. import demand.

The U.S. import demand for textiles can be found by transferring the

U.S. net factor import vector to the origin and by expressing this

vector   as a combination of the two industry expansion vectors.4 This
 In terms of algebra, the production side of the Reckscher-Ohlin-Vanek
model takes the form AO.. â€”V   where A is the matrix in input vectors,
    is the Mexican factor supty vector and     is the corresponding
level of outputs. This express the factor sup).y V as a combination
of the columns of A with weights equal to the output levels Q,_.
Another way of saying this is that the total factor supply V is
allocated between the two industries with each industry capital/labor
ratio given. This produces the allocation of Mexican capital and labor
to the Textile sector as illustrated in Figure 5. The analogous
equation for U.S. trade is AT â€” V         where T is the trade vector,
s is the consumption share and    vj.sthe world's factor supply. The
excess factor supply vector V -sV, is depicted in Figure 5 linking the
U.S. endowment point with theUline representing the world's factor
ratios. Trade balance is implicitly being assumed since the U.S. factor
                                                                              14


 allows us to find in the figure the supply of factors that could produce

 U.S. textile imports. The same kind of vector addition allows us to

 find the allocation of Mexican factors to the production of textiles.

 In Figure 4 Mexican production of textiles is larger than U.S. textile

 imports, and U.S. barriers would accordingly be completely circumvented

 by Mexican supply.

       In figure 5 this construction is extended to identify the kinds of

U.S. partners that would render completely ineffective any barriers that

 the U.S. might   erect   against non-members. The shaded region represents

 the factor endowments of all countries that have enough production of

 textiles to fully satisfy U.S. import demand. It should be noted that

this set includes countries that, absent any trade barriers, would be

importers, not exporters of textiles. In a free trade agreement with

the United States, these countries would export enough of their own

textile product to satisfy U.S. demand and would import that amount and

more from non-members to satisfy local consumption needs. Of course,

local content restrictions would prevent simple transhipment of product

through association members into to the United States, but these local

content restrictions do not limit imports for local consumption.

Accordingly the set of partners that would undo U.S. protectionism seems

very large indeed.

      This deterrence works in the other direction also. The

possibility of U.S. exports to its partners deters their use of

barriers, provided that the partner's trade is less than U.S. productiÃ n

supply point and the U.S. consumption point sV are on the same cost
line: w'(Vsv) â€” 0 where v is the vector of factor rewards. Just as
in the case of outputs, the U.S. excess factor supply is decomposed into
the sum of two vectors, one representing the factors needed to produce
the textile imports and the other representing the factors need to
produce the machinery imports.
                                                                          15


levels. For example, in Figure 5 the usual vector addition is used to

find the level of U.S. production of machinery and the corresponding

partner net trade in factor services that is associated with this level

of imports. The partner's factor supply must be at least this close to

the world factor supply line in order to assure a smaller partner level

of machinery imports than U.S. production. Similarly, if the partner is

an importer, of textiles, its factor supply vector must be not so far

above the world factor supply line that its imports of textiles exceed

the U.S. supply.

      The shaded region in Figure 6 is found by intersecting the (Figure

4) set of partners that deter U.S. barriers with the set of partners

that are deterred by the U.S. from imposing barriers. This identifies a

set of regional free trade agreements that have the property of "mutual

assured deterrence", to borrow from another literature that has now lost

its relevance. This set of U.S. partners for mutual assured deterrence

seems very large. A partner cannot be too small. A partner has to be

more labor abundant than the United States. If the partner is much

smaller than the U.S., then it must be very labor abundant. If the

partner is large compared with the U.S., then it must be moderately

endowed in factors: not too labor abundant nor too capital abundant.

V. REGIONAL ASSOCIATIONS: A MULTI- CONE HECKSCHER-OHLIN MODEL

      The one-cone Heckscher-Ohlin model leaves a very optimistic view

of the effect of free trade agreements on global efficiency. Other

models may suggest different conclusions. In this section, we explore

the two-factor four-good multi-cone Heckscher-Ohlin model depicted in

Figure 7. Here it is assumed that there are three kinds of countries:

(1) Low-wage countries produce a labor-intensive mix of products,
                                                                           16


apparel and textiles. (2) Moderate wage countries produce an

intermediate mix of products: textiles and machinery. (3) High-wage

countries produce a capital intensive mix of products: machinery and

chemicals. In the figure are drawn arrows representing the factor

endowments of Mexico and the United States. Mexico is placed in the

low-wage cone and the United States is placed in the high-wage cone.

      What happens when Mexico and the United States are combined into a

regional trade association that imposes trade barriers against the

products imported from non-members? Under what conditions do these

barriers have absolutely no effect? Does the regional association make

it more or less likely that its members will impose barriers against

non-members? The answers to these questions implied by the multi-cone

}-ieckscher-Ohlin model depend on whether the regional association

increases the mobility of factors among its members. Regional

associations with and without factor mobility.

A. Associations with Internal Factor Mobility

      In Figure 7, Mexico and the United States are located in different

cones of diversification with different wage rates and different

compensation rates for capital. If the free trade agreement eliminates

the barriers to capital or to labor flows between these two countries

then Mexico and the United States form a new economic unit that lies in

one cone or the other. This regional associatIon cannot be a

holographic image of the world's economy and trade with non-members will

occur and may even be more than before the agreeuent. Barriers that are

erected against third country imports thus still have an effect after

the agreement is fully in place. But there are circumstances in which

these barriers might not be erected because they divert but do not
                                                                          17



protect or because they cause politically unacceptable regional income

redistribution.

        In Figure 7 the arrow representing the U.S. and Mexico combined is

placed in the intermediate cone which is suited to the production of

textiles and machinery. This integrated equilibrium is created by a

combination of capital movements into Mexico from the United States

and/or labor migration into the United States from Mexico. Enough

factor flows have to occur to drag both the U.S. endowment point and the

Mexican endowment point into the intermediate cone. This factor

mobility thus implies lower wages in the United States and the loss of

its capital-intensive chemicals sector, possibly replaced by textiles if

the flow of Mexican migrant labor is great enough. Mexico ends up with

higher wages but loses the apparel sector. Mexico may produce textiles

if the capital flow from the United States is great enough. The figure

illustrates the more probable case of a capital flow out of the U.S.

that terminates when the U.S. endowment point just gets into the central

cone.

        In the integrated equilibrium that is depicted in this figure,

both the United States and Mexico gain from the factor mobility. The

original US endowment point is located on the cc unit cost line,

indicating that the initial US GDP (and CR) is one unit. In the

integrated equilibrium, factor earnings equal one when the factor

combination lies on the bb unit cost line. You can see that in the

figure the dark arrow depicting the US total factor supply extends

beyond this bb line, the amount that it does so indicating the gain in

US factor earnings (GNI') as a result of the free trade agreement. If

the integrated equilibrium is accomplished by a capital flow out of the
                                                                              18


U.S., the GOP cannot rise however. The figure depicts this with U.S.

resident factor supplies earning less than one unit after integration.

Of course this reduction in resident earnings is more than offset by the

earnings of capital located in Mexico. Perhaps it bears repeating for

emphasis: The gains to the U.S. from the agreement are greater, the

farther is the U.S. endowment point from the integrated cone of

diversification (the machinery expansion ratio). But this additional

gain in CliP comes necessarily with a smaller CDP, with more and more

U.S. earnings coming in the form of repatriated capital earnings.

      Mexico also gains overall from the association. The original

Mexican endowment point is not enough to produce a unit     value   of CDP

since it falls short of the aa curve defining the original Mexican unit

cost line. But in the integrated equilibrium, the Mexican total

earnings (CliP) jumps up to one unit,   since   the Mexican endowment point

is located on the bb curve. Mexican COP is even higher, but all those

additional earnings are owed to owners of U.S. capital.

      The message here seems pretty accurate: Although both countries

will gain overall, U.S. labor and Mexican capital stand to lose from a

free trade agreement. Until the product mix is similar in Mexico and

the United States, we should be expecting capital flows south and labor

flows north.

      1. Free Trade Agreement

      Now consider the impact of trade barriers after achievement of the

integrated equilibrium depicted in Figure 7. In the integrated free-

trade equilibrium both the United States and Mexico have to import

chemicals and apparel from third sources. Either machinery or textiles

might be imported as well. The impact of barriers on machinery and
                                                                           19


textiles is similar to the two-product model discussed in the previous

section. The difference is that in this four-good model the import

levels of machinery and textiles are likely to be less since both

chemicals and apparel are necessarily imported and must be paid for with

exports of either machinery or textiles or both. Because the import

levels are less, the region of mutual assured deterrence depicted in

Figure 6 gets even greater, at least as it relates to protection of

machinery and textiles.

      SThat about barriers against the other imports: Apparel and

Chemicals?   With low barriers there is no internal production at all

and these low barriers can only raise the prices that U.S. and Mexican

consumers have to pay. Suppose instead that the United States were to

impose barriers on imports of apparel that are great enough to justify

production and great enough possibly to raise wages. In the figure,

this means that the apparel isoquant is shifted inward to the point that

it touches the unit-isocost line. If it shifts in further, then the

Stolper-Samuelson effect would kick in and wages would go up in both the

United States and Mexico. With the higher wages, textile producers

would be forced out of business and production would concentrate on

machinery and apparel. There is a force, however, that works against

this outcome. All the apparel production of the association has to be

sold in the U.S. protected marketplace. If the U.S. demand at the high

price is not as high as the total association prduction, then it is

impossible to raise the price of apparel high enough to raise U.S. wages

unless protection were also granted to the textile sector.
                                                                           20


      The bottom line here is that a free trade agreement implies

globalism, more strongly in the multi-product model with internal factor

flows than in the two-product one-cone model.

      2. Customs Union

      Next consider the case of a customs union with a common set of

external barriers. A tariff wall imposed on textile imports by both

Mexico and the United States must of course raise the price of textiles

in both countries and set in motion the identical Stolper-Samuelson

response in both locations. But the mixed regional incentives to impose

trade barriers may lower their chances of making it through the

legislative process. The reason there are mixed regional incentives is

that Mexico, even after factor migration, is relatively well endowed in

labor and has a relatively great incentive to seek measures that raise

the price of the labor intensive product.

B. Associations without Internal Mobility

      Next consider the case without factor flows between Mexico and the

United States. Suppose as in Figure 7 that Mexico and the United States

are located in different cones of diversification. In the absence of

protection, neither textiles nor apparel are produced in the United

States and neither chemicals nor machinery are produced in Mexico.

Unlike the case with factor mobility, it is possible that Mexico and the

United States do not need to trade with third parties to reap completely

the gains from international exchange. One possibility is that Mexico

and the United States form an exact replica of the world economy. Even

if they do not, they may be able together to satisfy perfectly the

combined demand for all products at world prices.
                                                                           21



       If the association does have external trade, then trade barriers

can have an effect. Barriers to imports of textiles and apparel may

raise the U.S. price high enough to support U.S. production of these

products. If both textiles and apparel are protected, the U.S. factor

prices apply to Mexican production. This represents a big gift to

Mexico from U.S. consumers. The size of this gift is measured in Figure

7 by the difference between the Mexican factor supply vector along the

bb cost line and along the cc cost line.

       These high prices are sustainable only if Mexico is so small that

the marginal suppliers of textiles and apparel are third countries

subject to the trade barriers. If the association is a free trade

agreement, Mexico will export all product to the high-priced U.S.

marketplace and import for consumption purposes from cheap third

suppliers. All this output and more has to be absorbed by U.S.

consumers to sustain the prices in the U.S. If the association is a

customs union, then part of Mexican output is absorbed for Mexican

consumption purposes and less is available for the U.S. marketplace.

       The cases in which oÃ¼ly one of the products is protected are lift

as ext exercise.

VI. EVIDENCE

       A small    amount of   evidence is provided in this final section

concerning the possibility of Mutual Assured Deterrence in the proposed

North American Free Trade Agreement. Figure 6 suests that MAD occurs

when   a   smaller partner of the United States is not too small nor too

similar to the U.S. Figure 8 is intended informally to indicate if this

seems in fact to hold between the United States, Mexico and Canada.

This figure indicates the percentages of world totals of various factor
                                                                           22


supplies for various countries and regions. GDP figures are included as

an (imperfect) proxy for physical capital.

      The United States is indicated by the darkest bars at the top of

the figure. The relatively long dark bars identify factors of

production in which the United States is abundantly supplied. Energy

leads the list with consumption slightly larger than production. After

that is the proxy for physical capital: GDP. Another abundant factor is

managers though the distinction between technical, managerial and

skilled workers may have more to do with job descriptions than with

skill differences. The relatively short dark bars identify factors of

production in which the United States is poorly supplied. According to

these data the U.S. is scarce in population, and in unskilled workers.

      A partner for the United States that would be supportive of

globalism would tend to make up these labor scarcities without

exacerbating the energy and physical capital abundance. Mexico is

helpful in that regard, but is not large enough to increase the share of

population or the share of unskilled workers to the combined level of

the GDP share or the shares of several of the other abundant resources.

Canada seems too similar to the United States to offer much deterrent to

the U.S. barriers against labor-intensive products.

      Although this figure makes Mexico seem small, the discussion

surrounding Figure 5 indicates that a partner that deters U.S. barriers

can be much smaller than the U.S. if its factor supply is very

different. The most direct way of determining if Mexico is large enough

to deter U.S. protectionism is to compare Mexican output levels with

U.S. import levels as is done in Table 1 using 1984 data. The first

column contains the 1984 Mexican share of U.S. imports. In none of
                                                                           23


these sectors does this current trade share exceed 10 per cent. The

next column, however, contains the relevant ratio: Mexican output

divided by U.S. imports. Here there are quite a few sectors which even

in 1984 there is enough Mexican production to satisfy U.S. import

demand.

      The Mexican liberalization that began in 1985 should eventually

generate a substantial increase in productivity and greatly increase the

levels of Mexican output. To get a very rough sense of the potential

effects of productivity increases, data on Italian productivity are used

to compute hypothetical output levels for a liberalized Mexico. These

are reported in the last column of Table 1. With this adjustment there

are many more sectors for which Mexican output would exceed U.S. imports

and therefore deter U.S. protectionism. Two glaring exceptions are

apparel and footwear.

      This quick look at some data doesn't allow any strong conclusions,

but that won't hold me back. The North American Free Trade Agreement is

very compatible with global free trade. Indeed if it is not ratified,

we can expect very substantial increases in barriers erected by the

United States especially against Asian products. If it is ratified, the

protective effect of U.S. barriers against Asian products would be

greatly reduced, and these barriers would be less likely to be erected.
