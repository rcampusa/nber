                                           ABSTRACT

This paper investigates the behavior of investors in the equity option market using a unique and

detailed dataset of open interest and volume for all contracts listed on the Chicago Board Options

Exchange over the 1990 through 2001 period. We document major stylized facts about the option

market activity of three types of non-market maker investors over this time period and also

investigate how their trading changed during the stock market bubble of the late 1990s and early

2000. Our key findings are: (1) non-market maker investors have about four times more long call

than long put open interest, (2) these investors have more short than long open interest in both calls

and puts, (3) each type of investor purchases more calls to open brand new positions when the return

on underlying stocks are higher over horizons ranging from one week to two years into the past, (4)

the least sophisticated group of investors substantially increased their purchases of calls on growth

but not value stocks during the stock market bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000, and (5) none

of the investor groups significantly increased their purchases of puts during the bubble period in

order to overcome short sales constraints in the stock market.

1. Introduction



        The seminal work of Black and Scholes (1972) and Merton (1973) generated an

explosion of research into methods for computing theoretical option prices and hedge ratios. By

contrast, relatively little is known about the trading of this important class of securities. This

paper uses a unique option dataset to investigate investor behavior in the equity option market.

There are two main goals. The first is to document major empirical facts about the option market

activity of different types of investors. The second is to investigate changes in option market

activity during the stock market bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000.

        The dataset contains detailed daily open interest and volume information for each equity

option listed at the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) from 1990 through 2001. All of

the data are broken down by different types of investors: firm proprietary traders, customers of

full-service brokers, and customers of discount brokers. The open interest data provide both long

and short positions for each investor type. The volume data are classified according to whether

an investor type is buying or selling and also according to whether the investor type establishes

brand new option positions or closes existing ones. Most other datasets, by contrast, provide

only aggregate daily open interest and volume for each option.1

        Our analysis begins by determining the average daily long and short, put and call open

interest for different types of investors and various categories of stocks such as large

capitalization stocks and value and growth stocks. We also compute for the different investor

types and categories of stocks average daily volume of purchases and sales of both calls and puts

1
  The Berkeley Options Database and the CBOE MDR data provide time-stamped trade-by-trade information on
option transactions. They do not, however, break down option volume by different investor types or according to
whether it is being used to open a new option position or close an existing one. They also do not indicate whether
option transactions are buyer or seller initiated – although an approximate classification into buyer and seller
initiated can be achieved through the use of the Lee and Ready (1991) algorithm.


                                                         1
that open new positions. Next, each of these four volume categories is regressed on the

underlying stock returns over various past horizons, underlying stock book-to-market (BM)

ratios, and underlying stock volatilities in order to understand the factors that drive option market

activity. We also use the regression results to investigate the impact on daily option volume of

shocks to the independent variables. The analyses are first performed over our entire sample

period from 1990-2001 and then over subperiods to see how option trading changed over time.

We are especially interested in changes in the behavior of the different investor types during the

stock market bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000.

       Our first set of finding about option market activity pertains to the entire sample period

from 1990 through 2001. We summarize several of them here. First, non-market maker

investors have about four times more long call than long put open interest. Second, for both calls

and puts the three investor types in aggregate have more short than long open interest. Third, the

differences in open interest and trading volume across options with underlying growth and value

stocks are small. Fourth, all investor types buy more calls to open new positions after positive

returns on underlying stocks at horizons from one week to two years in the past. For the most

part, a similar relation also holds between past returns and the selling of new calls and the buying

and selling of new puts. A noteworthy exception, however, is that sales of puts to open new

short positions are negatively related to returns on the underlying stock for short horizons up to

one quarter in the past.

         Given the diversity of the participants and the complexity of the instruments in the

option market, there are surely a number of factors which yield the empirical regularities that we

document. Although formal testing for the contributions of various factors lies beyond the scope

of this paper, when presenting our findings we do make some suggestions about what might be




                                                 2
generating them. For example, behavioral factors may play an important role in producing

greater short than long open interest for calls and puts. As we explain below, the high level of

short call open interest is consistent with loss-averse investors who focus on individual

investments rather than their aggregate portfolios preferring covered calls (which consist of long

stock positions combined with short call positions) to long stock positions. Regret avoidance

might partially explain the high level of short put open interest. This would be the case if

investors sell out-of-the-money puts on stocks that they believe are trading at attractive prices,

reasoning that either the stock will sink below the strike price and they will buy the stock even

more cheaply or the stock will remain above the strike price and they will just keep the put

premium. As another example, trend-chasing may account for the fact that all three investor

types buy more calls to open brand new long positions after positive returns on the underlying

asset over a variety of past horizons.

          We also establish a number of key facts about option market activity during the stock

market bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000. First, the volume of calls purchased by

customers of discount brokers to open brand new positions was highly elevated for underlying

growth stocks, but there was no corresponding increase for underlying value stocks. Second, in

contrast to the discount customers, there was no increase in call purchases to open new positions

for firm proprietary traders or customers of full-service brokers. Third, even though open buy

call volume did not increase for the full-service customers, the positive relationship between

open buy call volume and past returns strengthened for this group of investors. Finally, the

purchase of puts to open new positions did not increase for any of the investor classes during the

bubble.




                                                  3
       We will argue below that discount customers are probably the least sophisticated of the

three groups of option investors. Consequently, our results from the bubble period suggest that

the least sophisticated investors were speculating that the price of growth stocks would continue

to rise and that their speculation contributed to the bubble. More sophisticated investors, by

contrast, at most had a mild bet that the price of the growth stocks would continue to go up. The

fact that the open buy put volume did not increase for any of the investor groups during the

bubble is consistent with there having been little appetite for betting against the bubble, even

though it would have been easy to do so by purchasing puts. Hence, our results provide a

different perspective on the bubble than Ofek and Richardson (2003) which argues that the

existence of short sales constraints contributed to the development of the bubble and that the

loosening of those constraints played a role in deflating it. At the same time, our results tend to

reinforce Brunnermeier and Nagel’s (2003) finding that hedge funds rode rather than attacked

the bubble. It seems that even sophisticated investors do not want to take contrarian positions

during a bubble.

       In addition to other research on the bubble, our paper is also related to a broader literature

that studies investor behavior in the stock market. In a recent paper Barber, Odean, and Zhu

(2003) investigate the stock market activity of investors at a discount and full-service brokerage

house. They find that discount and full-service customers are contrarians over short horizons but

trend-chasers over longer horizons. Although broadly consistent with these findings, our result

on the relationship between option activity and past returns on the underlying stock differ along

several important dimensions. Beyond the obvious fact that we study the option rather than the

stock market, our results may also have greater generality since they are derived from all

discount and full-service traders in the market rather than from those at a single discount or full-




                                                  4
service brokerage house.2 It is also important to note that since the supply of stock is fixed (at

least in the short-run), stock market studies provide information on the relative desire of different

groups of market participants to trend-chase or act as contrarians. For example, if both

individuals and institutions become more positive on stocks after price increases but the

institutions become more bullish than the individuals, then the institutions will buy stock from

the individuals. In this case, the individuals will appear to be contrarians, even though price run-

ups make both parties more positive about stocks. In the option market, on the other hand, it is

easy to create and destroy contracts, so we can get a clearer picture of different groups’ absolute

desire to trend-chase or act as contrarians. That is, in the option market it is possible to find that

both individuals and institutions act as either trend-chasers or contrarians. Consequently, the fact

that in Barber, Odean, and Zhu (2003) discount investors act as contrarians with respect to

returns over the most immediate past two quarters but in our work they act as trend-chasers is

consistent with discount customers becoming more bullish on stocks that have done well over the

last six months (and hence buying brand new calls on them) but not becoming as bullish as other

investors (and hence selling stock to the more bullish stock market participants.)3

        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the data. The

third section defines our measures of option market activity. Section 4 investigates the level and

cross-sectional determinants of option market trading over our entire sample period. The fifth

section examines changes during the bubble period, and Section 6 concludes.

 In addition, we present results for firm proprietary traders.

 There also have been a number of papers that investigate whether institutions and individuals are trend-chasers or
contrarians in the stock market (e.g., Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1992), Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers
(1995), Nofsinger and Sias (1999), Wermers (1999), and Grinblatt and Keloharju (2001).) These papers also
measure relative rather than absolute trend-chasing and collectively have yielded inconclusive results.

2. Data



        The main data for this paper were obtained from the CBOE. The data cover option open

interest and trading volume broken down by different types of investors from the beginning of

1990 through the end of 2001. The open interest data provide a daily record of closing short and

long open interest for all CBOE listed options. When a CBOE listed option is also listed on

other exchanges, the open interest data is inclusive of all exchanges at which it trades. Options

that trade only at exchanges other than the CBOE, however, are not included in the dataset. The

trading volume data consists of daily information for all trades that actually occur at the CBOE.

It is broken down into four categories: volume from buy orders that open new long positions

(open buy volume), volume from sell orders that open new short positions (open sell volume),

volume from buy orders that close existing short positions (close buy volume), and volume from

sell orders that close existing long positions (close sell volume).

        The Option Clearing Corporation (OCC) assigns one of three origin codes to each option

transaction: F for firm proprietary traders, C for public customers, and M for market makers.

An example of a firm proprietary trader would be an employee of Goldman Sachs trading for the

bank’s own account. An analyst at the CBOE further subdivided the public customer data into

orders that originated from discount customers, full-service customers, or other customers.

Clients of E-Trade are an example of discount customers, and clients of Merrill Lynch are an

example of full-service customers. The other customers category consists of all OCC public

customer transactions that are not designated by the CBOE analyst as originating from discount

or full-service customers.4 In the empirical work below, we study option activity on individual


4
 The other customer category includes option activity from transactions that originated from registered broker-
dealer’s personal accounts, foreign broker-dealer accounts, CBOE floor broker error accounts, and specialist


                                                         6
equities from the firm proprietary trader, discount customer, and full-service customer

categories.

        We maintain that among the three groups of option investors, the firm proprietary traders

have the highest level of sophistication, the full-service customers have an intermediate level of

sophistication, and the discount customers have the lowest level of sophistication. Evidence that

the firm proprietary option traders have the highest level of sophistication is provided in

Poteshman and Serbin (2003) which demonstrates that firm proprietary traders never engage in

irrational early exercise of stock options while the full-service and discount customers do so with

some regularity. One reason to believe that full-service option traders are on average more

sophisticated than discount option traders is that most hedge funds trade through full-service

brokerage houses. In addition, Pan and Poteshman (2003) find that full-service option traders

have a greater propensity than discount option traders to open new long call (put) positions

before stock price increases (decreases). Further evidence that full-service option customers are

more sophisticated than discount option customers is provided in Mahani and Poteshman (2003)

which shows that discount customers have a greater propensity for entering option positions that

load up on growth stocks relative to value stocks in the days leading up to earnings

announcements despite the fact that at earnings announcements value stocks outperform growth

stocks by a wide margin. (LaPorta, Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1997)

        We obtain return, price, and number of shares outstanding data for the stocks that

underlie the options from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). We use data from

CRSP as well as COMPUSTAT to classify underlying firms into value and growth categories

based upon their book-to-market (BM) equity ratios. In order to ensure that we are not using BM


accounts as well as customers of brokerage houses that were not classified as discount or full-service by the CBOE
analyst.

values before the data were actually available to investors, we assume a four month reporting lag

for accounting data. Book value of equity is obtained from COMPUSTAT annual data item

number 60. Market value of equity is computed by multiplying the CRSP share price and the

number of shares outstanding. When calculating BM, the most recently available market value

of equity is used.



3. Measuring option market activity



        We define a quantity that measures on a trade date the open interest on an underlying

stock (delta-adjusted, so that we can compare option positions to stock positions) by one of the

investor types as a percentage of the shares of the underlying stock outstanding. We denote this

quantity, OpenInterestPercentageSharessk,,t i , where s is an underlying stock, t is a trade date, k is

a kind of open interest, and i is an investor type. The open interest kind k is either long call, long

put, short call, or short put. The investor type i is either firm proprietary traders, discount

customers, or full-service customers. Let N sCall
                                              ,t  be the number of different call contracts listed

on stock s on trade date t, ∆ Call
                              s , j ,t be the delta of the jth call on underlying stock s on trade date t,



and N sShares
        ,t    be the number of shares of stock s outstanding on trade date t. In addition, let

OpenInterestsk,,ji,t be the number of contracts of open interest of kind k for investor type i on the

jth call on underlying stock s on trade date t. We then define OpenInterestPercentageSharessk,,t i

by

                                                             Calls


                                                          ∑ 100 × OpenInterests , j ,t × ∆ s , j ,t 
                                                                                k, i        Call


              OpenInterestPercentageSharessk,,t i      ≡  j =1                                       × 100.          (1)
                                                                     N sShares
                                                                          ,t
                                                                                                     
                                                                                                   
                                                                                                     

In this expression, the factor of 100 and the delta in the numerator convert the open interest into

an equivalent number of shares of the underlying stock.5 The final factor of 100 converts the

quantity into a percentage.

           We measure option volume in a similar way. For example, let OptionVolsk,,ji,t be the

option volume of kind k by investor type i on the jth call on underlying stock s on trade date t.

Now k is either open buy call volume, open buy put volume, open sell call volume, or open sell

put volume. We then define OptionVolPercentageSharessk,,t i by

                                                          N s ,t                                 
                                                             Calls


                                                          ∑ 100 × OptionVols , j ,t × ∆ s , j ,t 
                                                                              k, i       Call


                 OptionVolPercentageSharessk,,t i      ≡  j =1                                    × 100.             (2)
                                                                      Shares
                                                                    N s ,t                        
                                                                                                
                                                                                                  

           To illustrate the computation of these measures, suppose that on June 1, 1998, XYZ has

23,000,000 shares outstanding and that firm proprietary traders have 120 contracts of long open

interest in XYZ calls that expire in June 1998 with a strike price of $130 and 35 contracts of long

open interest in XYZ calls that expire in July 1998 with a strike price of $125. Suppose further

that on June 1, 1998 the Black-Scholes deltas of the June 1998 strike $130 call and the July 1998

strike $125 call are, respectively, 0.55 and 0.60. Then for firm proprietary traders, the long call

5
    Each option contract is written on 100 shares of stock. In the empirical work we use Black-Scholes deltas for
∆ Call
  s , j ,t . The volatility of the underlying asset for the Black-Scholes delta computation is set to the annualized
sample volatility from its weekly log returns over the last 52 weeks excluding the two most extreme values. The
assumptions of the Black-Scholes model are violated in a number of ways (e.g., the options are American rather than
European and the volatility of the underlying stocks is not constant.) However, since our main results are not altered
if we do not delta adjust at all, we believe the Black-Scholes model provides an adequate approximation to delta for
our purposes.

Finally, it should be noted that (holding other things fixed) stock price changes will not

substantially impact our measures, but stock price changes would have an important impact on

variables defined to gauge option market activity in dollar terms.



4. Investor behavior in the option market: 1990-2001



        This section of the paper characterizes option market activity over our entire data period

from 1990 to 2001. We begin by examining option open interest and trading volume by different

types of investors for options on various categories of underlying stocks. We then investigate

some cross-sectional determinants of option market trading.



4.1. Levels of option open interest

        Table 1 presents average daily long and short, put and call open interest as a percentage

of shares of underlying stock outstanding over the 1990-2001 period. These averages are

computed for four groups of underlying stocks: all those in the database, large stocks, large

growth stocks, and large value stocks. Large stocks are defined as those in the top 500 by market

capitalization in the CRSP universe as of the end of the previous calendar quarter. Large growth

and large value stocks are defined at the end of each quarter as, respectively, the lowest and

highest BM quartile of the 500 largest stocks by market capitalization. We focus on large stocks



                                                    10
which account for the bulk of the market capitalization and most of the option activity. The

results for smaller companies are similar. In order to prevent the statistics from being too

heavily influenced by smaller companies with fewer options or by periods of unusually high

option activity, we use the following procedure to compute averages. First, for each trade date

we use equation (1) to compute the delta-adjusted open interest for each underlying stock. Next

for each calendar month we compute a market capitalization weighted average of the delta-

adjusted open interest for each underlying stock on each trade date. Finally, we calculate a

simple average over the months. All averages reported in the paper are computed in this way.6

         We note first that option market activity represents a reasonably large fraction of activity

in the underlying asset. For example, for large underlying stocks the average open interest

aggregated across types of open interest and types of investors is about 0.56% of the shares

outstanding. Although this may initially seem like a small quantity, the contracts are actively

traded, and the annual option market turnover corresponds to contracts on about 6% of the

underlying shares.7 Since the turnover in the market for the underlying shares is on the order of

60% a year and the three investor types that we examine do not comprise the entire option

market, the option trading is appreciable when compared to the direct trading in the underlying

stock.

         We next evaluate whether investors take more long call or long put positions. For

concreteness, in the discussion we focus on options on large underlying firms, but the findings

are not much different for options on smaller stocks. On an average trade date for large



6
  The results are not sensitive to reasonable variations in the procedure for computing the averages.
7
  We calculate this percentage in the following way. We first multiply the average daily open interest aggregated
across types of open interest and types of investors for large stocks (i.e., 0.56%) by two, since there are two
transactions for a given amount of open interest (one to open the position and the other to close it.) We then
multiply this number by 5.3 (= 252/47.5), where 47.5 is the open interest-weighted average trade dates to turnover
for large stocks which implies that 5.3 is the average number of times new positions are opened in a year.


                                                        11
underlying stocks, full-service customers have long call open interest that controls 0.126% of the

underlying shares while they have long put open interest that controls only 0.029% of the

underlying shares. Discount customers have an even stronger relative preference for long call

positions. Their long call open interest controls 0.031% of the underlying shares while their long

put open interest controls only 0.004% of the underlying shares. Overall, across our three types

of investors, the long call open interest is about four times larger than the long put open interest.8

         This finding is somewhat surprising, because it is more costly and difficult to go short

than long in the stock market. For example, retail customers receive low interest rates on the

proceeds from their short sales, and short stock positions can only be established on an uptick.

In addition, it is sometimes difficult to borrow stocks to short, and this was especially true during

the stock market bubble. At the same time, the difference between the cost or difficulty of taking

short and long positions in the option market by buying puts or calls is not as large.9 Since we

have seen that for a typical firm open interest in the option market is quite small in comparison to

the number of shares of stock outstanding, it is easy to imagine that the difficulty of establishing

short positions directly in stocks would result in a meaningful increase in the demand for long

put relative to long call positions. However, as the results indicate, other forces, perhaps more

behavioral in nature, make calls more attractive than puts. For example, financial analysts issue

far more positive than negative recommendations on stocks. Insofar as investors want to follow

these recommendations by taking positions in the option market, they will be inclined to buy

8
  For each type of investor and for each type of underlying stock the long call open interest is statistically greater
than the long put open interest at the one percent level using either a t-test for the difference in means or a Wilcoxon
signed-rank test for the difference in medians.
9
  It might be thought that the obstacles to shorting in the stock market will be transferred to the option market
through the following mechanism. When an investor buys a put to take a short position on a stock, the market
maker who sells the put will typically hedge his position by shorting the stock. Consequently, it might appear that
any obstacles to shorting the stock will be transmitted through the market maker to an option market investor who
wants to buy a put. This is not the case, however, because option market makers earn higher interest rates on the
proceeds from their short sales and are able to short shares without actually locating anybody who is willing to lend
them. On the latter point see Evans, Geczy, Musto, and Reed (2003).


                                                          12
calls rather than puts. Another factor that makes it more likely that investors will buy calls rather

than puts is that long call positions are easier to understand and manage than long put positions.

Since listed options on individual equities have an American style exercise feature, investors

holding these options must continually evaluate whether they should be exercised. This decision

is far easier for calls than puts, because it is never optimal to exercise calls early, except possibly

just before the underlying stock goes ex-dividend. There is no such simplifying rule for deciding

whether to exercise a put early.

         We next examine the extent to which investors short call options. Table 1 reports that

over the 1990-2001 period the three types of investors in aggregate have more short call open

interest (an average of 0.245%) than long call open interest (an average of 0.199%) on large

underlying stocks.10 Although the difference in long and short call open interest is not as great as

that between long call and long put open interest, it should be noted that to some extent market

makers manage risk by setting prices to balance the long and short demands of non-market

maker investors for each type of option. Consequently, when considering the difference between

long and short open interest for calls (or puts), it should be understood that the difference which

is observed is that which survives market maker efforts to balance the demand for long and short

positions. On the other hand, any impact of this effect is moderated by the fact that market

makers can hedge any net option positions which they hold by buying or selling the underlying

stock.

         The greater propensity to sell calls short is due to the full-service customers. Since

covered call positions (i.e., long stock combined with short call positions) are heavily promoted

by the brokers who work at the full-service investment firms, the elevated level of short call open


10
  This difference is statistically significant at the one percent level using either a t-test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank
test.


                                                           13
interest may be generated from the sale of covered calls. That is, an important source of the

short call open interest may be investors selling calls on stocks they already own or

simultaneously selling calls and buying the underlying stock. Brokers do not typically frame the

call sale as taking a short position in the stock. Instead, it is marketed together with the stock

position as a conservative way to take or maintain a long position or as a way for investors to

enhance the income generated from their portfolios. Brokers argue that it is conservative,

because part of the cost of buying the stock is offset by the premium received from selling the

call, or, alternatively, because any loss suffered in the stock position is wholly or partially offset

by the call premium. Brokers typically suggest that clients enter into covered call positions by

shorting calls that are 10 to 15 percent out-of-the-money. Consequently, relative to owning the

stock alone, a covered call position results in an inferior payoff only if the underlying stock

increases in value substantially. However, even in this case investors will not be losing money.

This is illustrated in Figure 1 which depicts the profit to long stock and covered call positions.

Figure 1 makes it clear that in comparison to a long position in the stock, covered call positions

(1) lose money in fewer states of the world, (2) when losing, lose less than the stock, and (3)

underperform the stock only when the stock and the covered call both have large gains. Hence,

if the elevated level of short calls for the full-service customers is largely the result of covered

call positions, the behavior of the full-service customers is consistent with loss aversion and

mental accounting which have been identified by the behavioral finance/economics literature as

important determinants of investor decision-making (see Thaler (1980), Kahneman and Tversky

(1979), Benartzi and Thaler (1999), Rabin and Thaler (2000), Barberis and Huang (2001),

Barberis, Huang, and Thaler (2003), Thaler and Johnson (1990), and Barberis, Huang, and

Santos (2001).)




                                                  14
       Table 1 also reveals that over our entire time period of 1990-2001 there are no major

differences in open interest for value and growth stocks. This is true for all investor types. For

example, for the full-service customers, the average daily short call open interest as a percentage

of shares outstanding is 0.211% and 0.190%, respectively, for growth and value underlying

stocks. It is interesting to note, however, that the largest percentage difference is observed for

the short put open interest of full-service customers on growth and value stocks. In this case, the

average daily short put open interest for growth and value stocks are, respectively, 0.047% and

0.068% which corresponds to full-service customers selling relatively more puts on stocks which

might be perceived as relatively undervalued. Our discussions with option market participants

suggest that one factor that may help explain this difference is that some investors like to sell

out-of-the-money puts on stocks which they consider to be cheap. They view it as a win-win

situation which will minimize regret. These investors apparently reason that either the buyer will

not exercise and they will just keep the put premium or the buyer will exercise in which case

they will keep the premium and buy the stock at a price lower than the current price which they

already perceive to be attractive. Hence, behavioral considerations may explain the relatively

elevated level of put sales on value stocks.

       We will see below that even though the open interest is similar across different types of

underlying stocks over the entire sample period, during the stock market bubble of the late 1990s

and early 2000 there were large differences in option market activity on growth and value stocks

for some investors.




                                                 15
4.2. Levels of option volume

         Panels A-C of Table 2 report the average daily open volume as a percentage of shares

outstanding over the 1990-2001 period for the three investor classes and four groups of

underlying stocks. The four columns list this average for, respectively, buy call volume, buy put

volume, sell call volume, and sell put volume. The first two columns represent options bought to

establish brand new long positions (and not to close out existing short positions), while the last

two columns represent options sold to establish brand new short positions (and not to close out

existing long positions.) The first thing to note about Table 2 is that across all participants and

groups of underlying stocks there is more opening volume on the buy side than the sell side for

both calls and puts.11 At least for the calls for the full-service customers, this finding is

somewhat unexpected, since Table 1 indicates that on average there is more call short open

interest than long open interest. These findings imply that on average the full-service customers

hold long call positions for substantially less time than short call positions.

         Panels D-F of Table 2 report the average number of trade days the various investor

classes hold long and short, call and put positions. Panel F of Table 2 shows that on average the

full-service customers do hold their short option positions substantially longer than their long

option positions. For example, they hold their short call positions on large stocks an average of

56 days and their long call positions on large stocks an average of only 33 days. Panel E shows

that discount customers also hold their short positions longer than their long positions, while

Panel D indicates that firm proprietary traders hold their long and short positions for roughly the

same amount of time. These findings suggest that the full-service and discount customers use

their long option positions more heavily for short-term speculation, whereas their short option

11
   All of these differences are significant at the one percent level except for the cases of large value calls for firm
proprietary traders and large value puts for full-service customers. In these two cases, the differences are close to
statistically significant for both the t-test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.


                                                           16
positions are used more for hedging or as part of longer-term investment strategies. Once again,

no major differences are seen across growth and value stocks in the statistics reported in Table 2.

However, differences will emerge when we focus on subperiods, especially the bubble period.



4.3. Cross-sectional determinants of option market activity

       We turn next to an investigation of cross-sectional determinants of option market trading.

We focus on past returns on the underlying stock over various horizons but also consider book-

to-market ratios and volatility as control variables.

       We want to know what motivates different types of investors to open brand new option

positions. As a result, the dependent variables that we study are open buy call volume, open sell

call volume, open buy put volume, and open sell put volume. These variables are computed by

aggregating the respective option volume type on each underlying stock on each trade date for

each investor class. As in the previous subsections, these variables are normalized so that they

represent the equivalent percentage of shares of the underlying stock traded in the option market.

The first set of explanatory variables are based on returns from the underlying stock: the same

day return (Rsameday), the return from trade dates –1 through –5 (Rweek), from trade dates –6

through –21 (Rmonth), from trade dates –22 through –63 (Rquarter), from trade dates –64

through –252 (Ryear), and from trade dates –253 through –504 (R2years). The log of the BM

ratio and the volatility of the underlying stock are also used as explanatory variables. The

volatility is computed as the annualized sample standard deviation of weekly log returns over the

last 52 weeks excluding the two most extreme values.

       Although we present results for all three classes of investors, we focus our discussion on

the discount and full-service customers. We do this because it is not uncommon for firm




                                                 17
proprietary traders to place orders to facilitate the trades of their customers. Hence, it is more

difficult to interpret the results for this class of investors. For example, suppose that a client of

an investment bank wants to sell 10,000 IBM calls. It would not be unusual for one of the

bank’s proprietary traders to call the designated primary market maker for IBM options to learn

how much of the order can be filled at reasonable prices. If the firm proprietary trader discovers

that only a portion of the order can be executed, he might facilitate the execution for the client by

placing an order to buy some IBM calls.

         Table 3 reports time-series averages of the intercept and slopes from daily Fama-

MacBeth regressions of the cross-section of option volume on the explanatory variables for large

underlying stocks over the 1990-2001 period. Autocorrelation adjusted t-statistics are provided

in parentheses.12 Panels A-C report the regression results for, respectively, firm proprietary

traders, discount customers, and full-service customers. Panel D shows the time-series average

of the daily cross-sectional standard deviations of the explanatory variables. Table 4 reports the

percentage impact on daily activity for the four types of open option volume from a positive one

standard deviation shock to all of the return variables, to the short-term return variables, and to

the long-term return variables.



4.3.1. Cross-sectional determinants of open buy call volume

         For open buy call volume, discount and full-service customers have significantly positive

coefficients on the return variables for all past horizons from one week to two years.13 It appears

that these option market investors develop positive sentiment on stocks that have done well over



12
   The autocorrelation adjustment is made using the method in Chopra, Lakonishok and Ritter (1992).
13
   For the discount customers, the coefficient on the past week return is positive but only marginally significant with
a t-Statistic of 1.83.


                                                          18
the past and bet in the option market that the stocks will continue to increase in value.14 That is,

discount and full-service customers appear to be trend-chasers. Moreover, the impact is

economically very large. Table 4 indicates that a one standard deviation increase in past returns

at all of the past horizons increases daily open buy call volume for discount and full-service

customers by 78% and 57%, respectively. Investors are influenced not only by returns in the

past quarter, but are significantly impacted by longer horizon returns up to two years in the past.

This suggests that the sentiment about a stock developed over extended periods of time

influences investment decisions. The discount customers seem to be especially sensitive to

sentiment developed over longer horizons. A one standard deviation shock for the longer

horizons (Ryear-R2years) increases the open buy call volume of discount customers by 55%.

The response of full-service customers is milder, 24%. In summary, higher past returns increase

the willingness of individual investors to buy calls.

         Consistent with our results, Barber, Odean, and Zhu (2003) show that discount and full-

service investors are also generally trend-chasers in the stock market over the past 12 quarters.

They do find, however, that full-service and discount customers are contrarians over the first

couple of quarters in the past. This finding in Barber, Odean, and Zhu (2003) might suggest that

we should also find contrarian behavior with respect to returns over the past couple of quarters.

In fact, we find trend-chasing at these horizons. There is not, however, necessarily a conflict

between the results. As explained above, since stocks are in fixed supply (at least in the short-

run), stock market studies measure relative trend-chasing among different types of investors.




14
  Of course, some of the new long call positions are part of larger strategies that include other options or the
underlying stock. We doubt, however, that this is a major factor in the positive coefficient estimates. Covered calls
are the most common hedged positions involving call options, and these involve short, not long, call positions.
Therefore, hedging is not likely to have much of an impact on the results for open buy call volume.


                                                         19
Option contracts, on the other hand, can be easily created and destroyed. As a result, our

findings document absolute trend-chasing by the various investor groups.

        The open buy call volume of firm proprietary traders is also positively impacted by past

returns. It does not, however, appear to be influenced by returns from the second year in the

past. As discussed above, the motivations of firm proprietary traders are more difficult to pin

down.



4.3.2. Cross-sectional determinants of open sell call volume

        As was evident from Tables 1 and 2, short calls are especially important for full-service

customers. Table 3 indicates that for the full-service customers, all of the coefficients on past

returns from the open sell call volume regression are positive and significant. The coefficients

on longer term returns are highly significant. The overall impact of a one standard deviation

increase in returns is a very large 63%.

        Several factors may be contributing to the positive relationship between past returns and

open sell call volume for the full-service customers. First, full-service investors may be placing

contrarian bets by selling calls on stocks that have had high past returns. We are somewhat

skeptical, however, that this is an important explanation. Since the profit to selling calls cannot

exceed the call premium, buying puts would be a more natural way for investors to make

contrarian bets. In addition, Table 2 shows that full-service customer hold their short call

positions twice as long as their long call positions. This fact suggests that, relative to long call

positions, short call positions are in general not being entered into for the purpose of short-term

speculation.




                                                  20
       A second possibility is that the positive relationship between open sell call volume and

past returns comes from the full-service customers selling calls on stocks in their portfolios that

have gains. Behavioral considerations suggest that investors have stronger incentives to write

calls on stocks they hold which have gains than those they hold which have losses. Specifically,

prospect theory maintains that a gain made on an investment that has already done well does not

provide as much of an increase in utility as an equivalent gain on an investment that has done

relatively poorly. Consequently, prospect theory predicts that investors are more likely to sell

calls on their stocks that have done well than to sell calls on their stocks that have done poorly.

Indeed, selling a call on a stock that has decreased in value is particularly unattractive to a

prospect theory investor if the strike price is below the price that was originally paid for the

stock, since such a sale guarantees that the investor will end up losing money on the position.

Hence, our finding of a positive impact of past stock returns on the sale of call options is

consistent with prospect theory. Brokers also aggressively market covered calls as a

conservative way to take a long position in a stock. As a result, some of the trading behind the

positive coefficients probably comes from investors who purchase stock to bet that prices will

continue to increase while offsetting part of the purchase price by simultaneously selling calls.

       In Barber, Odean, and Zhu’s (2003) sample, the average discount customer account holds

25% fewer individual stocks than the average full-service customer account. Consequently,

prospect theory would suggest a weaker relationship for the discount customers. Table 3

indicates that the relationship for the discount customers is indeed weaker. In fact, some of the

coefficients of past returns are negative for the discount customers, and the overall impact of a

one standard deviation shock to past returns is less than half of the impact for full-service

customers.




                                                  21
         A third factor that may contribute to the positive relationship between open sell call

volume and past returns for the full-service customers is the desire of market makers to avoid

large inventories of either short or long call positions. If positive returns cause the full-service

customers to trend-chase by buying calls, then market makers may raise the prices of the calls in

order to avoid building up too large of an inventory of short calls. The higher call prices might

in turn induce some full-service investors to sell calls. The similarity between the regression

coefficients on the returns at various past horizons for the full-service customers in the open buy

call volume and open sell call volume regressions is consistent with the market maker price

adjustment mechanism contributing to the positive relationship between open sell call volume

and past returns. Since the full-service customers constitute the largest part of the market, the

market maker inventory mechanism described here is likely to show its effect most clearly for

the full-service customers. It should be kept in mind, however, that any impact of the

mechanism on the regression coefficients will be moderated by the fact that market makers can

manage the risk they face when holding non-zero net option positions by hedging with the

underlying stock.15



4.3.3. Cross-sectional determinants of open buy put volume

         In general, the activity in puts is not very large. Recall that Table 1 indicates that for

discount and full-service customers the open interest in long puts is smaller than for any of the

other three categories. Table 3 reports that discount investors buy more (fewer) new puts on

underlying stocks that have increased (decreased) in value in the past. This is expected from


15
  It should also be noted that even if the mechanism were very powerful and forced the regression coefficients to be
the same in the open buy call volume and open sell call volume regressions, it would not force the coefficients to
any particular positive or negative values. Consequently, the fact that the coefficients are reliably positive suggests
that the trend-chasing and covered call factors may be important.


                                                          22
prospect theory insofar as investors are insuring (i.e., locking in) gains on stocks that have

increased in price and refraining from insuring stocks that have losses.16 Full-service customers

also buy more (fewer) new puts on underlying stocks that have increased (decreased) in value in

the past, although clear evidence for this effect is limited to returns that are more than three

months in the past. Since discount customers are more likely to be buying naked long put

positions, it appears that there is a stronger strain of contrarian investing among them. It should,

however, be remembered that despite the cost and difficulty of shorting stocks directly, buying

puts, surprisingly, is a relatively unpopular activity.



4.3.4. Cross-sectional determinants of open sell put volume

         Relative to buying puts, there is a lot of activity in selling puts. Indeed, Table 1 shows

that the discount and full-service investors have more short than long put open interest. Table 3

reveals that for these investors the coefficients for returns on the underlying stock through the

past quarter are negative while the coefficients for longer term returns are positive. This finding

is consistent with these investors believing that weakness in an underlying stock in the past

quarter is temporary. The results in Table 4 also illustrate that investors sell puts on stocks that

performed poorly in the last quarter but had strong performance in the more distant past. The

investors may be selling the puts reasoning that if the stock price increases they will just keep the

premium while if it declines further and the puts are exercised, they do not mind buying the stock

at an even lower price.17




16
   This is akin to Odean’s (1998) finding that in the stock market discount customers sell winners to lock in gains
and hold losers to avoid realizing losses.
17
   The purchase price for the stock will be lower if the puts are sold out-of-the-money which is typically the case.


                                                          23
4.3.5. Other variables

       Finally, we note that higher volatility for the underlying stock is positively related to

more opening of all types of option positions by all types of investors. This is not surprising,

because higher volatility stocks tend to get more attention and because option premia are

increasing in volatility. Indeed, a one standard deviation shock to underlying stock volatility

increases the open buy call volume for full-service customers by 97%. Since returns over the

past two years are present in the regressions, we are hesitant to make any strong interpretation of

the coefficients on the BM variable which is highly correlated with past returns. We think it is

perhaps best simply to regard BM as a control for past returns that are not explicitly included in

our list of explanatory variables.



5. Investor behavior in the option market during the stock market bubble



       This section of the paper explores changes in option market activity over time by the

three classes of investors with a special emphasis on the stock market bubble of the late 1990s

and early 2000. We will compare option market activity by the different investor classes during

the bubble period with their activity before and after the bubble. This will enable us to explore

how investors changed their behavior during the bubble and to see how different investor classes

might have contributed to the bubble. In order to simplify the discussion, we define 1990-1994

as the pre-bubble period, 1995-1997 as the beginning of the bubble, 1998-March 2000 as the

height of the bubble, and April 2000-2001 as the post-bubble period. Figure 2 plots the price to

book ratio of the Russell 1000 growth stocks divided by the price to book ratio of the Russell

1000 value stocks from 1990 through 2001. This ratio peaked at the height of the bubble,




                                                 24
suggesting excessive valuation of growth stocks relative to value stocks. This plot can be seen to

increase throughout the bubble and to peak at the end of the period which we have defined as the

height of the bubble. It then declines sharply in the post-bubble period.



5.1. Option market activity through time

       Table 5 reports the average daily open volume as a percentage of shares outstanding for

each of the three investor types and subperiods of 1990-2001. The open buy call volume for the

discount investors approximately doubles from the pre-bubble period to the beginning of the

bubble and increases by about another 50 percent from the beginning of the bubble to the height

of the bubble. It then falls by a factor of three from the height of the bubble to the post-bubble

period. This pattern suggests that the least sophisticated investors in the market substantially

increased their option market speculation that stock prices would rise throughout the bubble and

then dramatically cut their option market bets that stock prices would increase after the bubble

burst. This evidence is consistent with these investors acting as trend-chasers rather than

contrarians. By contrast, the full-service customer open buy call volume is stable from the pre-

bubble to the beginning of the bubble period and then falls a bit at the height of the bubble and

more substantially in the post-bubble period. Hence, it appears that the full-service customers

did not increase their option market speculation that stock prices would increase during the

bubble period, but that they may have scaled back their normal level of positive option market

bets during the post-bubble period. Finally, the bubble appears to be essentially a non-event for

the firm proprietary traders. Their open buy call volume gradually decreased throughout the four

subperiods.




                                                 25
          The discount customers increased their activity across the other types of option positions

as well. They increased their selling of calls to open new positions. This may correspond to an

increase in covered call positions which can be viewed as a conservative way of taking a long

position on a stock. However, the main interest of the discount customers is in buying calls

which constitutes 56% of their option activity during the bubble. We conjecture that this activity

of discount customers contributed to an increase in stock prices as market makers who sold the

calls to the discount customer hedged their positions by buying stocks. It may well be the case

that discount customers were buying stocks directly as well, thus contributing further to the

bubble.

          One of the most interesting results in Table 5 relates to the put activity of full-service

customers. There is a large literature on the difficulties of establishing short positions in the

stock market. Ofek and Richardson (2003) even suggest that short sales constraints were a major

contributor to the stock market bubble. Our results, however, reveal that at the height of the

speculative bubble option market investors had no special appetite for short positions. We see no

major increase in volume that opens long put positions. Apparently, in such unique periods it is

not easy to be contrarian.

          The regressions reported in Table 3 above indicate that when the entire sample period

from 1990-2001 is studied all three investor classes appear to be trend-chasers insofar as they

initiate more (fewer) new long call positions when the underlying stock price increases

(decreases). Table 6 re-runs the open buy call volume regressions for the three investor groups

for each of the four subperiods of 1990-2001, and Table 7 reports the percentage impact of

positive one standard deviation shocks to past returns of different horizons.




                                                    26
       For the discount and full-service investors (Panels B and C of Table 6) the results for the

various subperiods are less consistent than the results for the entire sample. Many of the

coefficients on past returns are negative. For example, in the last subperiod just the coefficients

for the longer horizons, Ryear and R2years, are positive. Table 7 shows that overall, a one

standard deviation shock to past returns had a positive impact on activity. However, for the non-

bubble subperiods, this result is for the most part driven by investor trend-chasing longer horizon

returns. For shorter horizon returns, investors sometimes are contrarian.

       The results for the height of the bubble period definitely stand out. The coefficient on

past returns are all positive and highly significant for discount and full-service customers.

Discount customer showed especially strong trend-chasing behavior. For them, the magnitude of

the coefficients are quite a bit larger than when the regression is run for the entire period, and a

one standard deviation shock to past returns during the bubble period resulted in an 154%

increase in trading activity. Noteworthy, is the huge impact on activity related to longer horizon

returns (Ryear-R2year), where a one standard deviation shock resulted in almost doubling the

activity. The results strongly suggest that the least sophisticated investors contributed to the run-

up in prices of stocks that performed well in the past, which during this period of time happened

to be growth companies.

       The full-service customers, based on the results in Table 5, did not increase their activity

in options during the bubble. However, Table 6 and Table 7 reveal that these more sophisticated

investors did not escape the frenzy of the bubble completely. The full-service customers

definitely chased the better performing stocks and a one positive standard deviation shock to past

returns resulted in almost a doubling of their buys of calls to open new positions.




                                                 27
         A dramatic change in the behavior of the discount and full-service investors is observed

after the bubble. The overall impact of past returns is relatively small, and investors became

somewhat contrarian with respect to short term returns (up to one quarter in the past.)

Interestingly, the impact of longer term returns is still significant and relatively large, although

much smaller than during the bubble period.

         The motives of firm proprietary traders are more difficult to sort out. As discussed above

part of their activity is related to facilitating the trades of their larger clients. The results in Table

6 and Table 7 show that the bubble did not impact their behavior in terms of chasing past

winners.

         Table 8 runs regressions like those in Table 6 but with open sell call volume rather than

open buy call volume as the dependent variable. For the discount and full-service customers the

coefficients on the past return variables are substantially larger during the height of the bubble

than during any of the other three subperiods. This may be due to investors writing calls on

appreciated stocks that they already owned or opening “conservative” new long positions by

buying the underlying stock and covering it by simultaneously shorting calls.18 It is interesting

to note that there is much more consistency in the positive sign for the coefficients of the return

variables in Table 8 than in Table 6. This is probably because full-service customers, due to

behavioral influences such as caring about the price at which they bought an underlying stock,

like to write call options on appreciated stocks. Therefore, the willingness of full-service

customers to write call options is less period specific than buying call options. For example,

whereas (from Table 7) a one standard deviation positive shock to returns results in only a 15%

increase in open buy call volume for full-service customers during the post bubble period, such a


18
  It is possible that another factor is market makers raising call prices in order to manage inventories which results
in call sales.


                                                          28
shock produces a 46% increase in open buy sell volume for these customers after the bubble.

The long call results in Table 6, on the other hand, are probably more closely tied to the

sentiment of the full-service customers which varied over the subperiods. On the other hand, in

Table 8 we see less consistency in the positive signs for the coefficients for the return variables

for the discount customers. This may be because discount customers are relatively less likely to

own the underlying stock, and, thus are less affected by the past performance of the stock. For

the firm proprietary traders there is no clear difference between the coefficients on the past return

variables during the height of the bubble and during the other periods.



5.2. Value versus growth

       Since the speculation during the stock market bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000

was concentrated in growth stocks, we next investigate the trading by the three investor classes

of options written on large growth and large value stocks in the four subperiods from 1990-2001.

As above, large growth stocks are defined as those in the bottom BM ratio quartile among the

500 largest market capitalization firms. Large value stocks are defined as those in the top BM

ratio quartile among the 500 largest market capitalization firms.

       Table 9 contains for each investor group and each of the four subperiods the average

daily open volume as a percentage of shares outstanding separately for underlying growth and

value stocks. Panels B and E of Table 9 shows that for the discount customers, for all of the

subperiods, the most important activity is buying calls. The activity in the other three types of

option positions is much smaller. Discount customer open buy volume for calls on growth

stocks doubled from the pre-bubble to the beginning of the bubble periods and doubled again

during the height of the bubble. It then dropped by nearly a factor of four from the height of the




                                                 29
bubble to the post-bubble period. These results are consistent with discount customers chasing

returns and perhaps contributing to the bubble. Interestingly, their activity drops substantially

when the markets start to correct. A natural way to interpret this behavior is that the discount

customers are strategy-chasing as in Barberis and Shleifer (2003). That is, they buy calls on

growth stocks as long as this produces profits, but switch away from the strategy once it becomes

unprofitable.

       Panel E of Table 9, on the other hand, indicates that discount customers did not increase

their activity in value stocks during the bubble period. As can be seen in Panel D of Table 5,

according to the Russell indexes, value stocks suffered their worst performance relative to

growth stocks during the bubble period. Thus, the option market evidence is that during the

bubble period discount customers dramatically increased their speculation that underlying

growth stocks would increase in price without increasing at all their speculation that underlying

value stocks would increase in price. This activity probably contributed to mispricing of value

stocks relative to growth stocks and to the bubble. It is also interesting to note from Panel B of

Table 9 that during the height of the bubble discount customers markedly increased their selling

of calls on growth stocks. Some of these call sales may correspond to covered calls which, as

discussed above, are marketed as conservative long positions in stocks. However, the main

activity of discount customers during the bubble was in buying calls. Their call selling activity

was small on a relative basis. Although not of great economic significance, a small population of

discount customers behaved as contrarians as evidenced by the small jump in put buying activity

on underlying growth stocks during the bubble. However, it seems clear that overall discount

customers were not betting that stock prices would decline.




                                                 30
       Full-service customers, at least relative to discount customers, show a relatively mild

increase in buy call activity on underlying growth stocks during the bubble. The volume

increased from 0.00382% in the pre-bubble period to 0.00482% during the height of the bubble.

The increase in the activity in other options was even smaller. The results for options on value

stocks are quite different. Relative to the earlier periods, there is a noticeable reduction in buy

call activity during the bubble. A similar pattern is observed for other options as well. However,

for options on both value and growth stocks, there is much less activity in the post-bubble period

when the market underwent a substantial correction.

       Contrary to the behavior of discount and full-service customers, for firm proprietary

traders the bubble period seems to be a non-event in terms of their option activity. In summary,

discount customers were most impacted by the dramatic rise in the stock market and

substantially increased their activity in growth stocks which performed especially well during

that period. Full-service customers responded in a similar fashion to discount customers,

although their response was much milder. Neither of these investors types found value stocks of

interest during the bubble, and, thus, decreased their activity in this segment of the market.



5.3. Cross-sectional determinants

       We have seen that the activity in options on value stocks dropped for full-service

customers during the bubble and showed little change for discount customers. Tables 10 and 11

report the results of regressions run during the bubble period for underlying value and growth

stocks when open buy call volume is the dependent variable. These tables enable us to judge the

extent of trend-chasing of value and growth companies. The coefficients in Table 10 are positive

and generally highly significant for open buy call volume on growth stocks for both discount and




                                                 31
full-service customers for past returns of all horizons. The results for value stocks are in general

similar, although the coefficients are less significant and sometimes even negative.

       Table 11 shows that a one standard deviation shock to past returns had a huge impact on

the activity of options on growth stocks for discount customers with a jump of 211% in open buy

call volume. The corresponding statistic for options on value companies is 50%. Full-service

customers also showed substantial trend-chasing activity on options of growth stocks, 109%,

whereas the impact on options of value stocks was 51%. These results are consistent with the

notion that individuals were engaged in substantial trend-chasing across the board. This trend-

chasing, however, was not homogenous across investor types and stock characteristics. Trend-

chasing was much more pronounced by discount customers who tend to be less sophisticated on

average. In addition, past price changes have a bigger impact on growth companies which in our

study are defined by book-to-market (BM). According to Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny

(1994) companies with low BM are companies that had excellent past performance over a long

period of time. They excelled in their operating performance as well as the returns they

generated for their shareholders. The group also includes companies with shorter records and

extreme growth expectations. Thus, BM can be viewed as a sentiment proxy. Investors during

the bubble were chasing the past returns of companies with positive investment sentiment.

       Finally, firm proprietary traders, unlike the other investors, did not particularly favor

growth stocks with high returns. The coefficients for both growth and value stocks are in general

positive and significant in Table 10. Table 11 reveals that if anything firm proprietary traders

were chasing to a greater extent value companies with positive past returns. So, at least relative

to the other investors, the firm proprietary traders exhibited somewhat contrarian behavior –

although, as discussed above, their motives are difficult to judge.




                                                 32
       We also run regressions with open sell call volume as the dependent variable, and the

results are reported in Table 12. From our previous results we know that full-service customers

are particularly active in selling calls, and they tend to sell calls on stocks that have increased in

price. Hence, we do not expect to find a big difference in sensitivity to past returns for call

options written on value versus growth stocks. We conjecture that what counts more is whether

an investor’s stock holding resulted in a gain or loss and not so much the overall market’s

perception about the stock. The results in the table are consistent with this conjecture. When the

coefficient estimates reported in the table for full-service customers are converted into impacts

on trading activity from shocks to the return variables, we find that a one standard deviation

shock to all past return variables results for the full-service customers in a 104% versus a not

much different 84% change in call options sold for, respectively, growth and value stocks.



6. Conclusion



       Despite the tremendous amount of research over the past three decades into methods for

computing the prices and hedge ratios of stock options, very little is known about how investors

actually trade these securities. This paper takes advantage of a unique and detailed data set of

open interest and volume for all CBOE traded options to investigate the option market behavior

of firm proprietary traders, customers of discount brokers, and customers of full-service brokers.

We examine both the entire period covered by the data set, 1990-2001, and also subperiods with

a focus on the stock market bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000. Although we do not

formally investigate the factors that produce the empirical regularities that we document, we do

make some suggestions about what might be lying behind our results.




                                                  33
       We find that long put positions are comparatively unimportant. In particular, long put

open interest is only one quarter as large as long call open interest. We expected to see relatively

more long put positions because of the cost and difficulty of taking short positions directly in

individual stocks. We also find that long call positions are less prevalent among our three

investor types than short call positions. The popularity of short calls may result from their use in

covered call position in which they are held together with long positions in underlying stocks.

Covered call positions are heavily promoted by brokers as a conservative way to undertake or

maintain long stock positions. Typically, the investor shorts a call that is 10 to 15 percent out-of-

the-money. In this case, relative to owning the stock alone, a covered call position produces a

better outcome when the stock price declines or increases modestly. It yields an inferior

outcome only when the underlying stock increases in value substantially. As a result, the large

number of observed short call positions is consistent with loss aversion and narrow framing

which have been identified by the behavioral finance and economics literature as important

aspects of investor behavior.

       Another interesting finding is that for discount and full-service investors short put open

interest is at least 50% higher than long put open interest. Furthermore, short put open interest is

especially high for value stocks. This result is consistent with some contrarian investors being

attracted to short put positions on stocks that they believe are trading at attractive prices. Short

put positions are typically established out-of-the-money, so that the strike price is below the

current stock price. Investors who undertake these short put positions may view them as a win-

win situation. If the stock stays above the strike price, the seller just keeps the put premium. If

the stock goes below the strike price and the counter-party exercises the put, then the seller keeps

the premium and acquires the stock by paying the strike price which is lower than the price of the




                                                 34
stock at the time the short put position was established. Being forced to buy the stock at this

lower strike price, however, is not painful for the investor, because he already believed the stock

was attractive at the higher price at which it was trading when he originally sold the put.

       We also find that firm proprietary traders, customers of discount brokers, and customers

of full-service brokers all display trend-chasing behavior in their purchases of calls to open new

positions. That is, all three types of investors purchase more calls to open new positions when

the past returns on the underlying stocks are higher. Furthermore, the trend-chasing behavior is

not only in response to returns over the last few weeks or months but rather extends as far back

as two years into the past. This fact suggests that investor sentiment about stocks is established

over long horizons. Our results also provide an interesting complement to stock market studies,

both because our tests measure absolute rather than relative trend-chasing and also because the

stock market studies have been inconclusive.

       Finally, we assess option trading during subperiods of 1990 through 2001. We find that

the volume of calls purchased to open new positions by our least sophisticated investors

increases substantially during the stock market bubble from 1998 through March 2000.

Furthermore, this increase was a result of flocking to options on growth stocks. In fact, these

investors increased their option volume on growth stocks by a factor of four at the height of the

bubble but did not increase their activity in value stocks at all. In addition, during the bubble

period discount customers became much more sensitive to past price changes and thus exhibited

much stronger trend-chasing behavior than in other periods. The more sophisticated full-service

customers, on the other hand, did not increase their overall activity in options during the bubble,

although they did moderately increase their activity in call options on growth companies and

decrease their activity on value companies. Despite the fact that the bubble had little impact on




                                                 35
the overall level of full-service customer option activity, it did significantly alter the trend-

chasing behavior of these investors. Specifically, their appetite for buying calls on strongly

performing stocks increased substantially. In contrast to the other investors, the bubble was a

non-event for the firm proprietary traders in terms of their option market activity. Finally, it is

quite interesting that none of the investor groups showed any substantial increase in put

purchases during the bubble period. Such purchases would have been expected if short sales

constraints in the stock market were preventing investors from betting against stocks which they

viewed as overvalued. It appears that even when appropriate securities are available, investors

have a hard time mustering the courage to bet against a stock market bubble.

       Average Daily Open Interest as a Percentage of Shares Outstanding, 1990-2001

This table reports the average daily open interest of individual stock options traded at the Chicago Board Options
Exchange (CBOE) during 1990-2001. The data were obtained directly from the CBOE and include information on
the type of investor behind each transaction. Here, three types of investors, firm proprietary traders, customers of
discount brokers and customers of full-service brokers, are analyzed. All refers to all stocks with CBOE traded
option contracts and available stock price data on CRSP. Large refers to the largest 500 market capitalization stocks
in the CRSP universe at the end of the previous calendar quarter. Large growth (value) stocks are those in the
lowest (highest) book-to-market equity ratio quartile of the 500 largest stocks based on the ratios at the end of each
quarter. For the calculation of average, average daily delta-adjusted open interest as a percentage of shares
outstanding is first calculated for each underlying stock. Then, for each calendar month, market capitalization
weighted average daily open interests are calculated over each group for each investor type. Finally, the average
across all calendar months during 1990-2001 is calculated and reported in this table.

Average Daily Open Volume as a Percentage of Shares Outstanding and Average Turnover
                              Time in Trade Dates, 1990-2001

This table reports the average daily trading volume and average turnover time of individual stock options traded at
the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) during 1990-2001. Only those transactions that are used to open new
positions are included in this table. The data were obtained directly from the CBOE and include information on the
type of investor behind each transaction. Here, three types of investors, firm proprietary traders, customers of
discount brokers and customers of full-service brokers, are analyzed. All refers to all stocks with CBOE traded
option contracts and available stock price data on CRSP. Large refers to the largest 500 market capitalization stocks
in the CRSP universe at the end of the previous calendar quarter. Large growth (value) stocks are those in the
lowest (highest) book-to-market equity ratio quartile of the 500 largest stocks based on the ratios at the end of each
quarter. For the calculation of average, average daily delta-adjusted open trading volume as a percentage of shares
outstanding is first calculated for each underlying stock. Then, for each calendar month, market capitalization
weighted average daily open trading volumes are calculated over each group for each investor type. Finally, the
average across all calendar months during 1990-2001 is calculated and reported in this table. The average trade
dates to turnover is calculated by simply dividing the average daily open interest by the average daily open trading
volume.

                                    Large Stock Regressions 1990-2001

This table reports the time-series average coefficients from Fama-MacBeth cross-sectional regressions of daily
trading volume on various independent variables for large underlying stocks during 1990-2001. Large underlying
stocks are the largest 500 market capitalization stocks in the CRSP universe at the end of the previous calendar
quarter. Explanatory variables are returns of underlying stocks, the same day return (Rsameday), the return from
trade dates –1 through –5 (Rweek), from trade dates –6 through –21 (Rmonth), from trade dates –22 through –63
(Rquarter), from trade dates –64 through –252 (Ryear), and from trade dates –253 through –504 (R2years). In
addition, the log of the book-to-market equity ratio and the volatility of the underlying stock are also used as
explanatory variables. Autocorrelation adjusted t-statistics are provided in parentheses. In Panels A-C, the
regression results for, respectively, firm proprietary traders, customers of discount brokers and customers of full-
service brokers, are reported. In Panel D, the time-series average of the daily cross-sectional standard deviations of
the explanatory variables is reported.

   Large Stock Average Daily Open Volume as a Percentage of Shares Outstanding and
                   Stock Index Returns for Subperiods of 1990-2001

Panels A through C of this table reports the average daily trading volume of individual stock options traded at the
Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) for large underlying stocks during subperiods of 1990-2001. Only those
transactions that are used to open new positions are included in this table. The data were obtained directly from the
CBOE and include information on the type of investor behind each transaction. Three types of investors, firm
proprietary traders, customers of discount brokers and customers of full-service brokers, are analyzed. The large
underlying stocks are the largest 500 market capitalization stocks in the CRSP universe at the end of the previous
calendar quarter. For the calculation of average, daily average delta-adjusted open trading volume as a percentage of
shares outstanding is first calculated for each underlying stock. Then, for each calendar month, daily market
capitalization weighted average open trading volumes are calculated over each group for each investor type. Finally,
the average across all calendar months during each subperiod is calculated and reported in this table. Panel D
reports the annualized return for the S&P 500 index, the Russell 1000 growth index, and the Russell 1000 value
index for the subperiods. The data on the S&P 500 index are from Standards and Poor’s, and the data on the Russell
indexes are from the Frank Russell Company.

 Large Growth (Low BM) and Large Value (High BM) Stock Average Daily Open Volume
          as a Percentage of Shares Outstanding for Subperiods of 1990-2001

This table reports the average daily trading volume of individual stock options traded at the Chicago Board Options
Exchange (CBOE) for large growth underlying stocks during subperiods of 1990-2001. Only those transactions that
are used to open new positions are included in this table. The data were obtained directly from the CBOE and
include information on the types of investor behind each transaction. Three types of investors, firm proprietary
traders, customers of discount brokers and customers of full-service brokers, are analyzed. Large growth (value)
stocks are those in the lowest (highest) book-to-market equity ratio quartile of the 500 largest stocks based on the
ratios at the end of each quarter. For the calculation of the averages, daily average delta-adjusted open trading
volume as a percentage of shares outstanding is first calculated for each underlying stock. Then, for each calendar
month, daily market capitalization weighted average open trading volumes are calculated over each group for each
investor type. Finally, the average across all calendar months during each subperiod is calculated and reported in
this table.

             Regressions with Open Buy Call Volume as Dependent Variable, 1998-3/2000

    This table reports the time-series average coefficients from Fama-MacBeth cross-sectional regressions of daily open
    buy call option trading volume on various independent variables for large underlying stocks during the stock market
    bubble period of 1998-March 2000. Large underlying stocks are the largest 500 market capitalization stocks in the
    CRSP universe at the end of the previous calendar quarter. Large growth (value) stocks are those in the lowest
    (highest) book-to-market equity ratio quartile of the 500 largest stocks based on the ratios at the end of each quarter.
    Explanatory variables are returns of underlying stocks, the same day return (Rsameday), the return from trade dates
    –1 through –5 (Rweek), from trade dates –6 through –21 (Rmonth), from trade dates –22 through –63 (Rquarter),
    from trade dates –64 through –252 (Ryear), and from trade dates –253 through –504 (R2years). In addition, the log
    of the BM ratio and the volatility of the underlying stock are also used as explanatory variables. Autocorrelation
    adjusted t-statistics are provided in parentheses. In Panels A-C, the regression results for, respectively, firm
    proprietary traders, customers of discount brokers and customers of full-service brokers, are reported.

 Percentage Impact on Daily Open Buy Call Volume of One Standard Deviation Shock to
      Independent Variables for Different Types of Underlying Firms, 1998-3/2000

This table reports the percentage impact on daily open buy call option volume of one standard deviation shocks to
independent variables. The numbers in this table are based on the Fama-MacBeth regressions results reported in
Table X. The impact is calculated as the sum of the products of coefficients and standard deviations for all relevant
independent variables divided by the daily average trading volume for each type. Large underlying stocks are the
largest 500 market capitalization stocks in the CRSP universe at the end of the previous calendar quarter. Large
growth (value) stocks are those in the lowest (highest) book-to-market equity ratio quartile of the 500 largest stocks
based on the ratios at the end of each quarter.

             Regressions with Open Sell Call Volume as Dependent Variable, 1998-3/2000

  This table reports the time-series average coefficients from Fama-MacBeth cross-sectional regressions of daily open
  sell call option trading volume on various independent variables for large underlying stocks during the stock market
  bubble period of 1998-March 2000. Large underlying stocks are the largest 500 market capitalization stocks in the
  CRSP universe at the end of the previous calendar quarter. Large growth (value) stocks are those in the lowest
  (highest) book-to-market equity ratio quartile of the 500 largest stocks based on the ratios at the end of each quarter.
  Explanatory variables are returns of underlying stocks, the same day return (Rsameday), the return from trade dates
  –1 through –5 (Rweek), from trade dates –6 through –21 (Rmonth), from trade dates –22 through –63 (Rquarter),
  from trade dates –64 through –252 (Ryear), and from trade dates –253 through –504 (R2years). In addition, the log
  of the BM ratio and the volatility of the underlying stock are also used as explanatory variables. Autocorrelation
  adjusted t-statistics are provided in parentheses. In Panels A-C, the regression results for, respectively, firm
  proprietary traders, customers of discount brokers and customers of full-service brokers, are reported.
