                                         ABSTRACT

We use ten years of California administrative data with a regression kink design to estimate the
causal impacts of benefits in the first state-level paid family leave program for women with
earnings near the maximum benefit threshold. We find no evidence that a higher weekly benefit
amount (WBA) increases leave duration or leads to adverse future labor market outcomes for this
group. In contrast, we document that a rise in the WBA leads to an increased likelihood of
returning to the pre-leave firm (conditional on any employment) and of making a subsequent paid
family leave claim.

1    Introduction

A vast body of research has documented a persistent “motherhood wage penalty” that can
last 10 to 20 years after childbirth. Mothers earn lower wages, work fewer hours, and are
less likely to be employed than fathers or childless women and men (see, e.g.: Waldfogel,
1998; Lundberg and Rose, 2000; Blau and Kahn, 2000; Anderson et al., 2002; Molina and
Montuenga, 2009; Angelov et al., 2016; Chung et al., 2017; Kleven et al., 2018, 2019), and
these differences are particularly pronounced for highly-educated women at the top of the
female earnings distribution (Anderson et al., 2002; Bertrand et al., 2010; Hotchkiss et al.,
2017; Chung et al., 2017). Paid family leave (PFL)—a policy that allows working mothers to
take time off work to recover from childbirth and care for their newborn (or newly adopted)
children while receiving partial wage replacement—may be a tool for reducing this penalty
if it facilitates career continuity and advancement for women. However, opponents of PFL
caution that it could have the opposite effect: by allowing mothers to have paid time away
from work, PFL may lower their future labor market attachment, while employers could face
substantial costs that lead to increased discrimination against women.1 These discussions
are especially fervent in the United States, which is the only developed country without a
national paid maternity or family leave policy.
    In this paper, we use administrative data from California—the first state to implement a
PFL program (hereafter, CA-PFL)—and use a regression kink (RK) design to identify the
effects of the benefit amount on leave duration, labor market outcomes, and subsequent leave-
taking among high-earning mothers.2 Isolating the effect of the benefit amount is critical
for informing debates about payment during leave. Since the vast majority of American
workers already have access to unpaid leave through their employers and the federal Family

     As we detail in Section 2, most women in California are eligible for a total of up to 16 weeks of paid
leave.


                                                    1
and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), the wage replacement rate is arguably the most salient
parameter under debate.3 A long literature on other social insurance programs—including
unemployment insurance (UI) (Baily, 1978; Chetty, 2008; Card et al., 2012; Landais, 2015;
Card et al., 2015a,b, 2016; Schmieder and Von Wachter, 2016; Schmieder and von Wachter,
2017), Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) (Gelber et al., 2016), and the Workers’
Compensation program (Hansen et al., 2017)—finds a positive relationship between the
benefit amount and program participation duration, with elasticities ranging between 0.3
and 2 in the case of UI (Card et al., 2015a).4 As such, a higher PFL benefit may increase
maternity leave duration, which could in turn adversely affect women’s subsequent labor
market trajectories.5
    Since the leave benefit amount is not randomly assigned, it is challenging to disentangle
its causal impact from the possible influences of other unobservable differences between
individuals. To circumvent this issue, we make use of a kink in the PFL benefit schedule
in California: during our analysis time frame, participants get 55 percent of their prior
earnings replaced, up to a maximum benefit amount.6 Intuitively, we compare the outcomes
of mothers with pre-leave earnings just below and just above the threshold at which the
maximum benefit applies. These women have similar observable characteristics, but face
dramatically different marginal wage replacement rates of 55 and 0 percent, respectively.
   3
     Data from the 2016 National Compensation Survey show that 88 percent of civilian workers have access
to unpaid leave through their employers (see: https://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs/benefits/2016/ownership/
civilian/table32a.htm. The FMLA was enacted in 1993 and provides 12 weeks of unpaid job protected
family leave to qualifying workers. To be eligible for the FMLA, workers must have worked at least 1,250
hours in the preceding year for an employer with at least 50 employees (within a 75 mile radius of the
employment location). According to most recent data from 2012, about 60 percent of American private
sector workers are eligible for the FMLA (Klerman et al., 2012).
   4
     A recent paper on the elasticity of injury leave duration with respect to the benefit amount provided
under Oregon’s Workers’ Compensation program finds an elasticity estimate in the range of 0.2 to 0.4 (Hansen
et al., 2017).
   5
     If higher benefits increase maternity leave duration, the impacts on women’s future labor market out-
comes are theoretically ambiguous (Klerman and Leibowitz, 1994; Olivetti and Petrongolo, 2017). Increased
time away from the job may be detrimental to future labor market success as a result of human capital
depreciation or employer discrimination. Alternatively, if a higher benefit encourages a longer leave for a
mother who would have otherwise quit her job, then there may be a positive effect on her future labor market
outcomes through increased job continuity.
   6
     More details on the program are in Section 2.



                                                     2
The RK method identifies the causal effect of the benefit amount by testing for a change
in the slope of the relationship between an outcome and pre-claim earnings at the same
threshold (Card et al., 2016).
      While a key advantage of the RK method is that it can account for the endogeneity
in the benefit amount, the primary limitation is that the RK sample is not representative
of the population of leave-takers. The kink is located around the 92nd percentile of the
California female earnings distribution, and women in the vicinity of the kink point are
older and work in larger firms than the average female program participant. That being said,
high-earning women’s careers may be especially sensitive to employment interruptions—for
example, Stearns (2016) shows that access to job protected paid maternity leave in Great
Britain reduces the likelihood that high-skilled women are promoted or hold management
positions five years after childbirth. In the U.S., Hotchkiss et al. (2017) document that the
motherhood penalty for college graduates is approximately double that of women with only
a high school degree.
      Additionally, RK estimates provide information about the implications of benefit changes
around the maximum benefit threshold. These are highly policy relevant because all existing
state PFL programs, as well as the current national PFL proposal (the Family and Medical
Insurance Leave Act, or FAMILY Act), feature similar kinked benefit schedules, but have
different kink point locations.7
      Our results show that higher benefits do not increase maternity leave duration among
women with earnings near the maximum benefit threshold. Our RK estimates allow us to
rule out that a 10 percent increase in the weekly benefit amount (WBA) would increase leave
  7
    The states with PFL policies are: California (since 2004), New Jersey (since 2008), Rhode Island
(since 2014), New York (since 2018), Washington state (will go into effect in 2020), Washington D.C.
(will go into effect in 2020), and Massachusetts (will go into effect in 2021). In all states, benefits
are paid as a percentage of prior earnings, up to a maximum benefit amount. The wage replacement
rates are: 55 percent (California), 66 percent (New Jersey), 60 percent (Rhode Island), 67 percent
(New York). D.C.’s marginal replacement rates vary with prior earnings. The maximum weekly benefit
amounts as of 2018 are: $1,216 (California), $637 (New Jersey), $831 (Rhode Island), and $652.86 (New
York). More information is available here: https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44835.pdf. For informa-
tion on the FAMILY Act, see: http://www.nationalpartnership.org/research-library/work-family/

duration by more than 0.3 to 2.1 percent (i.e., we can reject elasticities higher than 0.03 to
0.21), depending on the specification. Our results underscore the notion that PFL provides
a distinct type of social insurance and targets a unique population of parents and caregivers,
making the (much larger) elasticities from the prior social insurance literature less relevant
for PFL (Krueger and Meyer, 2002).
    We also find no evidence that PFL benefits have any adverse consequences on subsequent
maternal labor market outcomes for high-earning women in our sample. A higher benefit
amount does not have a significant effect on the likelihood of returning to employment
following the end of the leave. However, conditional on returning to work, we find that
women who receive a higher benefit during leave are more likely to return to their pre-leave
employers rather than find new jobs: a 10 percent increase in the WBA raises the likelihood of
return to the pre-leave firm (conditional on any employment) by 0.3 to 4.2 percentage points
(0.3 to 5 percent), depending on specification. While our data do not allow us to observe
the exact mechanisms underlying this result, it is possible that higher benefits during leave
improve worker morale or promote firm loyalty (even if she recognizes that her employer is
not paying her benefits directly), similar in spirit to efficiency wage models (Akerlof, 1984;
Stiglitz, 1986; Katz, 1986; Krueger and Summers, 1988).8
    Lastly, we provide novel evidence that the benefit amount predicts repeat program use.
We find that an additional 10 percent in the benefit received during a mother’s first period
of leave is associated with a 0.8 to 1.6 percentage point higher likelihood of having another
PFL claim within the following three years (a 3 to 7 percent increase), depending on the
specification. This effect may in part operate through the positive impact on the likelihood
of return to the pre-leave employer after the first period of leave. As shown in Bana et al.
(2018b), firm-specific factors (potentially including workplace culture and information provi-
sion) explain a substantial amount of the variation in CA-PFL take-up. Our results suggest
   8
     By contrast, our results are inconsistent with prior evidence of an income effect that reduces employment:
Wingender and LaLumia (2017) find that higher after-tax income during a child’s first year of life reduces
labor supply among new mothers.



                                                      4
that a higher benefit amount causes mothers to return to the firms where they took their first
period of leave instead of switching to different firms, which could have lower leave-taking
rates. It is also possible that women who get more wage replacement during leave may
simply have a better experience and are therefore more likely to participate in the program
again than those with lower benefits. Indeed, a similar relationship between current benefits
and future claims has been found in the context of the Workers’ Compensation program in
Oregon (Hansen et al., 2017).9
       Our study builds on several recent papers that use survey data to analyze the labor
market effects of CA-PFL with difference-in-difference (DD) designs (Rossin-Slater et al.,
2013; Bartel et al., 2018; Das and Polachek, 2015; Baum and Ruhm, 2016; Stanczyk, 2016;
Byker, 2016). Our analysis of administrative data can overcome several limitations of these
studies, which include small sample sizes, measurement error, non-response bias, lack of panel
data, and missing information on key variables such as PFL take-up and leave duration.10
       We also contribute to a body of research set outside the U.S., in which studies have an-
alyzed the impacts of extensions in existing PFL policies (or, less frequently, introductions
of new programs) on maternal leave-taking and labor market outcomes, delivering mixed re-
sults (see Olivetti and Petrongolo, 2017 and Rossin-Slater, 2018 for recent overviews).11 The
   9
      It is also possible that the increase in repeat leave-taking arises due to a change in fertility behavior,
although past research offers mixed evidence on the relationship between PFL and fertility. For example,
Dahl et al. (2016) find no effects of Norwegian maternity leave extensions on mothers’ completed fertility.
By contrast, Lalive and Zweimüller (2009) find that an extension in parental leave in Austria increased
subsequent fertility rates among mothers. In the case of CA-PFL, Lichtman-Sadot (2014) finds some evidence
that disadvantaged women re-timed their pregnancies to become eligible for CA-PFL in the second half of
2004. However, we are not aware of any studies documenting effects of CA-PFL on subsequent fertility.
   10
      In an ongoing study, Campbell et al. (2017) use administrative data from Rhode Island to study the
effects of paid maternity leave provided through Rhode Island’s Temporary Disability Insurance system on
maternal and child outcomes, exploiting the earnings threshold for TDI eligibility. Our focus on high-earning
women in California is complementary to their evidence on women at the low end of the earnings distribution.
   11
      For example, some studies find either positive or zero effects on maternal employment in the years after
childbirth (Baker and Milligan, 2008; Kluve et al., 2013; Bergemann and Riphahn, 2015; Carneiro et al., 2015;
Dahl et al., 2016; Stearns, 2016), while others document negative impacts, especially in the long-term (Lalive
and Zweimüller, 2009; Lequien, 2012; Schönberg and Ludsteck, 2014; Bičáková and Kalíšková, 2016; Canaan,
2017). Cross-country comparisons suggest that provisions of leave up to one year in length typically increase
the likelihood of employment shortly after childbirth, whereas longer leave entitlements can negatively affect
women’s long-term labor market outcomes (Ruhm, 1998; Blau and Kahn, 2013; Thévenon and Solaz, 2013;
Olivetti and Petrongolo, 2017).



                                                       5
substantial cross-country heterogeneity in major policy components—the benefit amount,
statutory leave duration, and job protection—generates challenges for comparing policies
and likely contributes to the lack of consistency in the literature.12
         Additionally, we bring the novel RK research design to isolate the effect of the PFL benefit
amount.13 To the best of our knowledge, the only existing study that isolates the effect of the
maternity leave wage replacement rate while holding constant other policy parameters is set
in Japan and finds no impact on maternal job continuity or leave duration (Asai, 2015).14
This evidence may not be readily applicable to the U.S. setting, however, since Japanese
mothers are guaranteed one year of job protected paid maternity leave. By contrast, U.S.
maternity leave durations are much shorter and often not job protected, and even among the
highest-wage workers, less than a quarter have access to any employer-provided paid leave.15
         The rest of the paper unfolds as follows. Section 2 provides more details on the CA-PFL
program and the benefit schedule. Section 3 describes our data, while Section 4 explains our
empirical methods. Section 5 presents our results and sensitivity analyses, while Section 6
offers some conclusions.


2         Background on CA-PFL and the Benefit Schedule

Californian mothers have been eligible for several weeks of paid maternity leave to prepare
for and recover from childbirth through California’s State Disability Insurance (CA-SDI)
    12
      See Addati et al. (2014) and Olivetti and Petrongolo (2017) for more information on maternity and
family leave policy details in countries around the world.
   13
      Less relevant to the topic of this paper, the RK research design has also been used in studies of student
financial aid and higher education (Nielsen et al., 2010; Turner, 2014; Bulman and Hoxby, 2015), tax behavior
(Engström et al., 2015; Seim, Forthcoming), payday lending (Dobbie and Skiba, 2013), and local government
expenditures (Garmann, 2014; Lundqvist et al., 2014).
   14
      We are also aware of two other studies that isolate the impacts of other PFL policy parameters in
countries outside the U.S.: Lalive et al. (2014) separately estimate the labor market impacts of the duration
of paid leave and job protection for Austrian mothers, while Stearns (2016) distinguishes between access to
any paid leave and job protection in Great Britain.
   15
      Data from the 2016 National Compensation Survey show that 14 percent of all civilian workers have
access to PFL through their employers. Among those in occupations with wages in the highest decile, 23
percent have access to employer-provided PFL. With regard to leave duration, Rossin-Slater et al. (2013)
estimate that California mothers took an average of about three weeks of maternity leave prior to the
implementation of CA-PFL.


                                                      6
system since the passage of the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act. In 2004, most working
mothers also became eligible for 6 weeks of leave through CA-PFL, which they can take
anytime during the child’s first year of life.16 In total, women with uncomplicated vaginal
deliveries can get up to 16 weeks of paid maternity/family leave through SDI and PFL.17
Paid leaves under SDI and PFL are not directly job protected, although job protection is
available if the job absence simultaneously qualifies under the federal Family and Medical
Leave Act (FMLA) or California’s Family Rights Act (CFRA).18
    The CA-PFL/SDI benefit schedule is a piece-wise linear function of base period earnings,
which is defined as the maximum quarterly earnings in quarters 2 through 5 before the claim.
Figures 1a and 1b plot the WBA as a function of quarterly based period earnings in nominal
terms for the years 2005 and 2014, the first and last years in our data, respectively. These
graphs clearly show that there is a kink in the relationship between the WBA and base
                                                                                        0.55
period quarterly earnings—the slope of the benefit schedule changes from                 13
                                                                                               = 0.04 to 0 at
the maximum earnings threshold. Note that the replacement rate is divided by 13 to convert
to a weekly amount since there are 13 weeks in a quarter. The location of this kink varies
over time (i.e., both the maximum benefit amount and the earnings threshold change).19
These graphs highlight that individuals with earnings near the kink point—who form the
basis for our RK estimation—are relatively high earners. We describe the characteristics of
  16
     To be eligible for CA-SDI and CA-PFL, an individual must have earned at least $300 in wages in a
base period between 5 and 18 months before the PFL claim begins. Only wages subject to the SDI tax are
considered in the $300 minimum. California’s PFL and SDI programs are financed entirely through payroll
taxes levied on employees.
  17
     Women who have a vaginal delivery can get up to four weeks of leave before the expected delivery date
and up to six weeks of leave after the actual delivery date through CA-SDI. A woman’s doctor may certify
for her to obtain a longer period of SDI leave if the delivery is by Cesarean section, or if there are medical
complications that prohibit her from performing her regular job duties.
  18
     The CFRA is nearly identical to the FMLA in its provisions and eligibility criteria. There are mi-
nor differences between the two laws: for example, women who have difficult pregnancies can use FMLA
prior to giving birth, but CFRA leave can only be used after childbirth. See: https://www.shrm.org/
resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/hr-qa/pages/californiadifferencecfrafmla.aspx.
  19
     The nominal quarterly earnings thresholds for 2005 and 2014 were $19,830 and $25,385, respectively.
In $2014 dollars, the 2005 threshold is $23,461.09. Figure 1c plots the maximum WBA in nominal terms
in each quarter during our sample time frame. The maximum WBA has nominally increased from $840 in
2005 to $1,075 in 2014. In $2014 dollars, this translates to an increase from $1,018.22 to $1,075 during this
time period.

our analysis sample in more detail in Section 3 below.
         Finally, although the state pays PFL and SDI benefits according to the schedule just
described, individual employers are able to supplement these benefits, making it possible for
an employee to receive up to 100 percent of her base period earnings. To the extent that this
phenomenon occurs, it diminishes the strength of the first stage relationship in our analysis,
since some employees effectively do not face a kinked benefit schedule. While we could find
no anecdotal evidence suggesting that this practice is common, we also have no data on
such supplemental payments, and are therefore unable to precisely assess the magnitude of
any attenuation. We can, however, focus on sub-samples of the data where this issue is
least likely to be important: employees who made claims soon after the implementation of
CA-PFL (2005-2010), employees who are not in the information/technology industry, and
employees at firms with fewer than 1,000 workers. In all three cases, the pattern of findings
remains the same, although the estimates are less precise (see Section 5 for more details).


3         Data and Sample

We use two administrative data sets available to us through an agreement with the California
Employment Development Department (EDD).
         First, we have data on the universe of PFL claims from 2005 to 2014. For each claim,
we have information on the reason for the claim (bonding with a new child or caring for an
ill family member), claim effective date, claim filed date, the total benefit amount received,
the authorized weekly benefit amount, the employee’s date of birth, the employee’s gender,
and a unique employee identifier.20 For women, we also have an indicator for whether there
was an associated transitional SDI claim (i.e., an SDI claim for the purposes of preparation
for and recovery from childbirth), along with the same information for SDI claims as we do
for PFL claims.
    20
    The employee identifiers in our data are scrambled. Thus, we cannot actually identify any individual in
our data set, but we can link information across data sets for each employee using the unique identifiers.



                                                    8
       Second, we have quarterly earnings data over 2000-2014 for the universe of employees
working for an employer that reports to the EDD tax branch.21 For each employee, we have
her unique identifier, her earnings in each quarter and in each job, a unique employer iden-
tifier associated with those earnings, and a North American Industry Classification System
(NAICS) industry code associated with that employer.


Sample construction and key variables. For our main analysis sample, we begin with
the universe of female PFL claims for the purpose of bonding with a new child (hereafter,
“bonding claims” or “bonding leave”) over 2005-2014.22 We then merge the claims data
to the quarterly earnings data using employee identifiers, and limit our sample to the first
bonding claim observed for each woman.23 Next, since the location of the kink changes over
our sample time frame (recall Figure 1), we drop women who make their first bonding claim
in quarters during which these changes happen.24
       For each claim, we assign the relevant base period earnings by calculating the maximum
quarterly earnings (summing over all earnings each quarter for workers holding multiple
jobs) in quarters 2 through 5 before the claim effective date. We also obtain information on
the size and industry code associated with the most recent employer prior to the claim. For
workers who have multiple jobs, we use the employer associated with the highest earnings.
Employer size is calculated by adding up all of the employees working at that firm in that
quarter.
       Next, in an effort to create a sample that is reasonably homogeneous and most likely
  21
      Employers that employ one or more employees and pay wages in excess of $100 in a calendar quarter
are required to report to the EDD according to California law. See http://www.edd.ca.gov/pdf_pub_ctr/
de44.pdf.
   22
      In previous versions of this paper, we had also reported results for male bonding claimants. However,
since there are substantially fewer men than women in our claims data, the RK analysis yields imprecise
results for fathers, and we have opted to focus our current analysis on mothers.
   23
      Note that the first bonding claim may not necessarily be for the firstborn child. Some mothers may
have chosen not to claim PFL for their firstborn child (but do claim for a later-born). Additionally, many
mothers had lower parity children before CA-PFL existed. Unfortunately, we cannot link our EDD data to
information on births, and we therefore cannot focus on claims for firstborns only.
   24
      We do so because we observe that in these quarters some individuals get assigned their WBA according
to the old schedule, while others according to the new schedule. Women with first bonding claims in the
following quarters are dropped: 2005q1, 2007q4, 2009q1, 2010q1, 2012q1, 2013q1, and 2014q1.


                                                    9
to be affected by the kink variation, we make the following sample restrictions: (1) We
only include women who are aged 20-44 at the time of the first bonding claim; (2) We only
keep female workers with base period quarterly earnings within a $10, 000 bandwidth of the
kink point; (3) We drop women employed in industries in which employees are least likely
to be subject to the SDI tax—private household workers, elementary and secondary school
teachers, and public administration.
      We then create a variable measuring the duration of leave in weeks by dividing the total
benefit amount received by the authorized WBA. Since PFL does not need to be taken
continuously, this duration measure accounts for possible gaps in between periods of leave.
For women who make both bonding and transitional SDI claims, we add the two durations.25
We analyze the natural log of leave duration in all of our specifications.
      In addition to studying leave duration, we examine several post-leave labor market out-
comes. We create indicators for being employed in the two, three, and four quarters after the
quarter of the initiation of the claim (as measured by having any earnings in those quarters).
We also create indicators for working at the pre-leave employer in quarters two, three, and
four post-claim, which take the value 1 for mothers whose highest earnings in those quar-
ters come from their pre-claim firms and 0 otherwise. We create these indicators separately
conditioning and not conditioning on any employment in the respective quarters. We also
calculate the change in the log of total earnings (in $2014) in quarters 2 through 5 post-claim
relative to quarters 2 through 5 pre-claim. Lastly, we create an indicator for any subsequent
PFL bonding claim in the 12 quarters after the first bonding claim.


Summary statistics. Table 1 presents the means of key variables for women in the $10,000
bandwidth sample, as well as for women in narrower ($2,500, $5,000, and $7,500) bandwidths
of base period quarterly earnings surrounding the kink point. As we zoom in closer to the
threshold, women in our sample become slightly older, work in somewhat larger firms, and
have higher base period earnings.
 25
      We cap the maximum combined duration on SDI and PFL at 24 weeks (the 99th percentile).


                                                  10
       For descriptive ease, the following discussion focuses on the $5,000 bandwidth sample.
About 32 percent of the women are employed in the health industry before the claim, which
is the top female industry in our data. The average weekly benefit received is $933 (in $2014),
while average leave duration is almost 12 weeks, which is consistent with most women filing
both transitional SDI and PFL bonding claims. When we consider subsequent labor market
outcomes, we see that on average, 87, 86, and 85 percent of women are employed in quarters
two, three, and four post-claim, respectively. Conditional on any employment, 88, 83, and
80 percent of women are employed by their pre-leave firms in these quarters, respectively.
We also see that women have 10 percent lower earnings post-claim than they did pre-claim.
Lastly, 23 percent of women make a subsequent bonding claim in the next three years.
       Lastly, to provide more information on characteristics of women included in our analysis
sample that are not available in the EDD data, we use data from the 2005-2014 American
Communities Survey (ACS) on comparable Californian mothers of children under age 1.26
We use each woman’s prior year earnings to calculate her average quarterly earnings (by
dividing by four), and then use them to find her place in the prior year’s benefit schedule.27
Appendix Table A1 reports means of characteristics of women in the same bandwidths as in
Table 1. In the $5,000 bandwidth sample, 48 percent of mothers are non-Hispanic white, 4
percent are non-Hispanic black, while 12 percent are Hispanic. The vast majority of these
women—91 percent—are married, and average spousal annual earnings (including zeros for
women who are not married) are $90,712 (in $2014).
  26
      For comparability with the EDD data, we make similar restrictions to the ACS sample: (1) We only
include women who are aged 20-44; (2) We drop women employed in industries in which employees are least
likely to be subject to the SDI tax—private household workers, elementary and secondary school teachers,
and public administration; (3) We drop women with zero reported earnings in the previous year.
   27
      This procedure generates measurement error in assigning women to the benefit schedule, which, as we
explain above, uses women’s maximum (not average) quarterly earnings in quarters 2 through 5 before the
claim. Unfortunately, we do not have information on quarterly earnings in the ACS.

4         Empirical Design

We are interested in identifying the causal impacts of PFL/SDI benefits on mothers’ leave
duration, labor market outcomes, and subsequent claiming. To make our research question
more precise, consider the following stylized model:


                                           Yiq = γ0 + γ1 ln(biq ) + uiq                              (1)


for each woman i who makes a benefit claim in year by quarter (year×quarter) q.28 Yiq is an
outcome of interest, such as log leave duration or an indicator for returning to the pre-leave
firm. ln(biq ) is the natural log of the WBA (in $2014), while uiq is a random vector of
unobservable individual characteristics. We are interested in estimating γ1 , which measures
the effect of a 100 percent increase in the WBA on the outcome of interest. The challenge
with estimating equation (1) using an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is that there
are unobserved variables that are correlated with the benefit amount that may also affect
our outcomes of interest, making it difficult to separate out the causal effect of the benefit
from the influences of these other factors.
         To overcome this challenge, we leverage quasi-experimental variation stemming from a
kink in the CA-PFL/SDI benefit schedule. The benefit function can be described as follows:
For each individual i who files a claim in quarter q, biq (Ei , bmax
                                                                 q   , Eq0 ) is a fixed proportion,
          0.55
τ =        13
                 = 0.04, of an individual’s base period earnings, Ei , up to the maximum benefit in
quarter q, bmax
            q   , where Eq0 denotes the earnings threshold that corresponds to the amount of
base period earnings above which all employees receive the maximum benefit amount:

                                                           
                                                            τ · Ei
                                                           
                                                           
                                biq (Ei , bmax
                                           q   , Eq0 ) =
                                                            bmax     if Ei ≥ Eq0
                                                           

    28
    Throughout the paper, we use the terms “year×quarter” and “quarter” interchangeably. We are referring
to each distinct quarter over our analysis time frame, i.e., 2005q1 through 2014q4.




                                                            12
Put differently, there is a negative change in the slope of biq (·) at the earnings threshold,
Eq0 , from 0.04 to 0. The RK design, described in detail by Card et al. (2012), Card et al.
(2015b) and Card et al. (2016), makes use of this change in the slope of the benefit function
to estimate the causal effect of the benefit amount on the outcome of interest. Intuitively,
the RK method tests for a change in the slope of the relationship between the outcome and
base period earnings at the earnings threshold. Assuming that—in the absence of the kink
in the benefit function—there would be a smooth (i.e., non-kinked) relationship between
the outcome and base period earnings, evidence of a change in the slope would imply a
causal effect of the benefit amount on the outcome. The RK design can be thought of as
an extension of the widely used Regression Discontinuity (RD) method, and Card et al.
(2016) provide a guide for practitioners on how local polynomial methods for estimation
and inference (Porter, 2003; Imbens and Lemieux, 2008; Imbens and Kalyanaraman, 2012;
Calonico et al., 2014, 2016) can be applied to the RK setting.
   More formally, the RK estimator identifies:

                                                                                     
                                       ∂Y |E=Eq0 +                       ∂Y |E=Eq0 +
                              lim↑0       ∂E
                                                            −   lim↓0       ∂E
                                                                                       

                    γRK =                                                                     (2)
                                       ∂ln(b)|E=Eq0 +                      ∂ln(b)|E=Eq0 +
                            lim↑0                       − lim↓0                          
                                             ∂E                                   ∂E


In words, the RK estimator is a ratio of two terms. The numerator is the change in the
slope of the outcome as a function of base period earnings at the earnings threshold. The
denominator is the change in the slope of the benefit function at the earnings threshold.
   In theory, if benefit assignments followed the formula exactly and our data contained no
measurement errors, then the denominator in the ratio in equation (2) would be a known
constant. In practice, as in many other policy settings, there may be small deviations from
the benefit formula due to non-compliance or measurement error. Additionally, in our setting,
only base period earnings subject to the SDI tax are used to calculate SDI and PFL benefits,
but we cannot distinguish between earnings that are and are not subject to this tax in our


                                                   13
data. As such, we must estimate the slope change in the denominator of equation (2) in a
“fuzzy” RK design.29
       For estimation, we follow the methods outlined in Card et al. (2015b) and Card et al.
(2016). In particular, the slope changes in the numerator and denominator in equation (2)
are estimated with local polynomial regressions to the left and right of the kink point. Key
to this estimation problem are choices about the kernel, the bandwidth, and the order of the
polynomial. We follow the literature by using a uniform kernel, which allows us to apply
a simple two-stage least squares (2SLS) method (i.e., the denominator is estimated with a
first stage regression).30
       There is an active econometrics literature on optimal bandwidth choice in RD and RK
settings. For all of our outcomes, we first present estimates using all possible bandwidths in
$500 increments from $2,500 to $10,000 of quarterly earnings. Additionally, we implement
three different algorithms proposed in the literature: a version of the Imbens and Kalya-
naraman (2012) bandwidth for the fuzzy RK design (hereafter, “fuzzy IK”),31 as well as
a bandwidth selection procedure developed by Calonico et al. (2014) (hereafter, “CCT”)
with and without a bias-correction (“regularization”) term.32 Moreover, following other RK
studies, we try local linear and quadratic polynomials.
       We estimate the following first stage regression:

                   p
                       [ψp (Ei − Eq0 )p + θp (Ei − Eq0 )p · Di ] + ωq + αw + ρ0 Xi + eiqw   if |Ei − Eq0 | ≤ h
                   X
ln(biqw ) = β0 +
                   p=1
                                                                                                          (3)
for each woman i with a first bonding claim in year×quarter q that was initiated in week
  29
     The “fuzzy” RK design is formally discussed in detail in Card et al. (2015b).
  30
     Card et al. (2016) note that while a triangular kernel is boundary optimal, the efficiency losses from
using a uniform kernel are small both in actual applications and in Monte Carlo simulations. Results from
using triangular kernels are similar and available upon request.
  31
     Specifically, Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012) proposed an algorithm for computing the mean squared
error (MSE) optimal RD bandwidth, while Card et al. (2015b) proposed its analog for the fuzzy RK setting,
using asymptotic theory from Calonico et al. (2014).
  32
     Both IK and CCT procedures involve a regularization term, which reflects the variance in the bias
estimation and guards against the selection of large bandwidths.

of quarter w and with base period earnings Ei in a narrow bandwidth h surrounding the
threshold Eq0 . The variable Di is an indicator that is set equal to 1 when earnings are above
Eq0 and 0 otherwise: Di = 1[Ei −E0q >0] . As noted above, we control for normalized base period
earnings relative to the threshold (Ei − Eq0 ) using local linear or quadratic polynomials (i.e.,
p is either equal to 1 or 2). To account for any effects of the business cycle and the Great
Recession, we control for year×quarter fixed effects, ωq , in all of our models. We also control
for fixed effects for every week of each quarter (1 through 13), αw , to account for the fact that
subsequent labor market participation in post-leave quarters may differ depending on when
during a particular quarter a leave claim is initiated (recall that we have exact claim effective
dates, but observe employment and earnings at a quarterly level). The estimated change in
the slope in the denominator of the ratio in equation (2) is given by θ1 . We show results with
and without a vector of individual controls, Xi , which includes indicators for employee age
categories (20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44), pre-claim employer industry (NAICS industry
groups), and firm size (1-49, 50-99, 100-499, 500+). eiqw is the unobserved error term, and
we use heteroskedasticity robust standard errors, following Card et al. (2015a).
   The second stage regression is:



                            p
                                  λp (Ei − Eq0 )p + δq + ηw + ζ 0 Xi + εiqw   if |Ei − Eq0 | ≤ h

Yiqw is an outcome, and ln(b
                          d ) is instrumented with the interaction between D and the
                             iq                                             i

polynomial in normalized base period earnings. The remainder of the variables are as defined
before. The coefficient of interest, π1 , measures the effect of a 100 percent increase in the
WBA on the outcome, and provides an estimate of γRK defined above.


Identifying assumptions. The identifying assumptions for inference using the RK design
are: (1) in the vicinity of the earnings threshold, there is no change in the slope of the

                                                  15
underlying direct relationship between base period earnings and the outcome of interest,
and (2) the conditional density of base period earnings is continuously differentiable at the
earnings threshold. These assumptions imply that individuals cannot perfectly sort at the
earnings threshold (i.e., they cannot manipulate their earnings to end up on one or the other
side of the threshold).
       Importantly, since we only use data on women who make a bonding claim, differential
selection into program take-up across the threshold would violate our identifying assump-
tions.33 Lack of data on individuals who are eligible for a social insurance program but do
not take it up is a common feature of RK studies (e.g., Landais, 2015, Card et al., 2015a,
and Card et al., 2015b only use data on UI claimants, while Gelber et al., 2016 and Hansen
et al., 2017 use data on SSDI and Workers’ Compensation program claimants, respectively).
Following the literature, we conduct standard tests of the identifying assumptions to address
concerns about differential selection into take-up.
       First, we show the frequency distribution of normalized base period earnings around
the earnings threshold in Figure 2a. This graph uses $100 bins and a $5,000 bandwidth.34
The histogram looks reasonably smooth, and we also perform formal tests to support this
assertion. Specifically, we conduct a McCrary test (McCrary, 2008) for a discontinuity in the
assignment variable at the kink, reporting the change in height at the kink and the standard
error. We also test for a discontinuity in the first derivative of the p.d.f. of the assignment
variable, following Card et al. (2012), Landais (2015), and Card et al. (2015b): we regress
the number of observations in each bin on a 3rd order polynomial in normalized base period
earnings, interacted with D, the indicator for being above the threshold. The coefficient on
the interaction between D and the linear term, which tests for a change in the slope of the
  33
     While our quarterly earnings data include many individuals who are not PFL claimants, these data
contain no demographic information, preventing us from identifying sub-groups who are plausibly eligible
for PFL (i.e., mothers of infants or even women of childbearing age). Our calculations based on aggregate
births data and employment estimates from the American Communities Survey (ACS) suggest that between
40 and 47 percent of all employed new mothers used CA-PFL bonding leave during 2005-2014 (Bana et al.,
2018a). See also Pihl and Basso (2016) for similar estimates on program take-up.
  34
     The results presented in Figure 2a are similar under alternative bandwidths.



                                                   16
p.d.f., is reported in each panel, along with the standard error.
         We do not detect any statistically significant discontinuities in either the frequency dis-
tribution or the slope change at the threshold.35 Additionally, we have conducted separate
McCrary tests for each distinct kink over our analysis time frame, and found that out of
16 possible coefficients, only two are statistically significant (for the last two kinks in the
data). As we show below, our results are similar if we limit our analysis to claimants in 2005-
2010, where we do not observe any significant discontinuities or slope changes at kink points.
Thus, we do not think that differential sorting over time presents concerns for interpreting
our main estimates.
         Second, we check for any kinks in pre-determined covariates around the threshold. In
Appendix Figure A1, we use $100 bins of normalized base period earnings and plot the
mean employee age and firm size as well as the number of women in the health industry (the
top industry in our data) in each bin. Results from regressions testing for a change in the
slope of the relationship between the covariate and the running variable yield insignificant
coefficients for employee age and firm size. The coefficient for the number of women in the
health industry is statistically significant, but very small in magnitude.36
         These figures provide support for the validity of the RK research design: We do not ob-
serve any evidence of sorting or underlying non-linearities around the kink point, which also
argues against any differential selection into CA-PFL take-up across the earnings threshold.

Main results. Figure 2b plots the empirical relationship between the natural log of the
authorized WBA and normalized quarterly base period earnings. The empirical distribution

     We follow Card et al. (2015b) to choose the order of the polynomial. We fit a series of polynomial models
of different orders that allow for a discontinuity at the threshold and also allow the first and higher-order
derivatives to vary at the threshold, and then select the model with the smallest Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) value (3rd order in our case).
  36
     Specifically, the kink coefficients and standard errors are as follows: mean age −0.00002 (SE= 0.00002);
mean firm size 0.04667 (SE= 0.0581); number in health industry −0.0073 (SE= 0.0029).



                                                     17
of benefits is very similar to the benefit schedules depicted in Figure 1, with clear evidence
of a kink at the threshold at which the maximum benefit begins. The first stage F −statistic
is 2634.5.
       Figure 3 shows graphs using our main outcome variables on the y−axes; we use $100 bins
in the assignment variable and plot the mean outcome values in each bin. In Figure 4, we also
graphically present the 2SLS estimates of π1 and the 95% confidence intervals from equation
(4), using specifications that implement different optimal bandwidth selection algorithms and
controlling for first or second order polynomials in the running variable. We show results from
models without and with individual controls (all models control for year×quarter and week
of quarter fixed effects). The specifications are: (1) fuzzy IK bandwidth with local linear
polynomials, (2) fuzzy IK bandwidth with local quadratic polynomials, (3) CCT bandwidth
with regularization and local linear polynomials, (4) CCT bandwidth with regularization
and local quadratic polynomials, (5) CCT bandwidth without regularization and with local
linear polynomials, and (6) CCT bandwidth without regularization and with local quadratic
polynomials. Appendix Tables A2 through A6 present the corresponding point estimates
and standard errors in table format, along with the first stage coefficients and standard
errors (multiplied by 105 to reduce the number of leading zeros reported), the bandwidths,
and the dependent variable means.37 While the estimates just discussed report results from
specifications that use the natural log of the benefit amount (as written in equation (4)),
we show estimates from models that use the benefit amount in levels in Appendix Figure
A2.38 Lastly, Figure 5 plots the coefficients and 95% confidence intervals from local linear
specifications that use all possible bandwidths in $500 increments of normalized quarterly
base period earnings from $2,500 to $10,000.
       Across the multiple RK specifications we consider, we find no evidence that a higher
WBA increases maternity leave duration among new mothers. The upper bounds on the
  37
     We report the main and pilot bandwidth, as in Card et al. (2015b). The pilot bandwidth is used in the
bias estimation part of the bandwidth selection procedure. See Card et al. (2015b) for more details.
  38
     Note that the sample sizes differ across the outcomes we consider because we use different sets of years
for estimation; see Section 3.


                                                     18
95% confidence intervals of the estimates in Appendix Table A2 allow us to rule out that a
10 percent increase in the WBA would increase leave duration by more than than 0.3 to 2.1
percent (or, elasticities from 0.03 to 0.21). Importantly, this finding is not explained by a
highly skewed distribution of leave duration in which most women are “maxing out” their
leave. In Figure 6, we plot the distribution of leave duration for women near the kink point
($5,000 bandwidth sample). We show the distribution of SDI leave, PFL leave, and combined
SDI+PFL leave. About 16 percent of women take zero weeks of SDI leave (sub-figure a),
which likely explains the mass at 6 weeks in the distribution of combined leave (sub-figure
c). Conditional on taking PFL, about 80 percent of women use the entire 6 weeks (sub-figure
b). But most women use both SDI and PFL to take less than the maximum amount of leave
allowed on the two programs (16 weeks for women with uncomplicated vaginal deliveries).39
       It also does not appear that leave benefits have any adverse consequences for subsequent
maternal labor market outcomes. The estimates for the likelihood of employment in quarter
2 after the claim and on the change in log earnings are insignificant in nearly all of the
specifications (Appendix Tables A3 and A5). When we consider employment in the pre-
leave firm conditional on any employment in quarter 2 post-claim, however, we find robust
and consistently positive treatment coefficients, which are significant at the 1% level in 8
out of the 12 models (Appendix Table A4). The range of estimates suggests that a 10
percent increase in the WBA raises the likelihood of return to the pre-leave firm by 0.3 to
4.2 percentage points (0.3 to 5 percent at the sample mean).40
       On the whole, the evidence on post-leave labor market outcomes is inconsistent with
an income effect channel (which would reduce maternal labor supply; see Wingender and
LaLumia, 2017). Instead, these results suggest that higher pay during leave might improve
employee morale and possibly promotes firm loyalty, such that a mother is more likely to
return to her pre-leave firm rather than search for a new employer.
  39
     There is no statistically significant kink in the relationship between the share of women taking SDI and
base period earnings (results available upon request).
  40
     We have also examined unconditional employment in the pre-leave firm, finding no significant impacts
(results available upon request).


                                                     19
   Further, when we examine subsequent bonding claims, we find a robust positive effect.
Our estimates in Appendix Table A6 indicate that a 10 percent increase in the WBA raises
the likelihood of a future bonding claim by 0.8 to 1.6 percentage points (3 to 7 percent
at the sample mean). This effect, combined with evidence on the increased likelihood of
return to the pre-leave firm, echoes conclusions in Bana et al. (2018b), who document that
firm-specific factors drive a large share of the variation in PFL use. Our results suggest that
a higher benefit amount leads mothers to return to the employers at which they make their
first bonding claims instead of switching to other firms which may have lower leave-taking
rates.
   It is also possible that the increase in repeat claiming could operate through an effect
on subsequent fertility, which we do not observe in our data. However, past research from
other countries offers mixed evidence on the relationship between PFL and maternal fertility
(Dahl et al., 2016; Lalive and Zweimüller, 2009), so we do not believe this to be the primary
channel. A third possibility is that even in the absence of changes to employment or fertility,
mothers with a higher benefit have a better experience during leave and are more likely to
use the program again than those with lower payments.


Timing of effects. In Appendix Figure A3, we examine how the impact of the WBA
evolves over the quarters following the claim. The graphs show the coefficients and 95%
confidence intervals from separate regression models that use the fuzzy IK bandwidth with
a local linear polynomial specifications. In sub-figures (a) and (b) we consider as outcomes
indicators for employment and employment in the pre-leave firm (conditional on any em-
ployment) in quarters 2 through 5 after the claim, respectively. In sub-figure (c), we use an
indicator for any subsequent bonding claim by the quarter listed on the x-axis (4 through
20).
   We find no significant effects on the likelihood of any employment in quarter 2, 4, or 5
after the claim. The effect on employment in quarter 3 post-claim is statistically significant,



                                              20
but we note that this is largely due to the wide bandwidth chosen by the fuzzy IK algorithm
(the effect is not significant in any of the other specifications). When we consider the effect
on employment in the pre-leave firm conditional on any employment, we find that it is large
and statistically significant in both quarters 2 and 3 post-claim, becoming insignificant in
the subsequent quarters. The impact on subsequent bonding materializes in quarter 8 after
the claim, which is consistent with mothers returning to their pre-leave employers in quarter
2, working for the next four quarters to set the base period earnings for their next claim,
and then making a subsequent claim 3 quarters later, which is the approximate duration of
a pregnancy.


Heterogeneity and subsample analysis. We have analyzed heterogeneity in the effects
of benefits across employee and employer characteristics (age, firm size, and industry groups),
finding no consistent patterns. The lack of significant heterogeneity across women in firms
that have 50 or more employees and their counterparts in smaller firms is notable in light
of the fact that workers in the former group are more likely to be eligible for job protec-
tion through the FMLA or the CFRA. Our results suggest that eligibility for government-
mandated job protection does not contribute to differences in the impacts of PFL benefits,
at least in our high-earning RK sample.
   Additionally, as discussed in Section 2, one might be concerned that some employers are
undoing the CA-PFL benefit cap—and thereby weakening our RK design—by supplementing
PFL benefits so that employees on leave receive 100 percent of their salary (or at least more
than 55 percent of their salary). Unfortunately, our data do not report such payments, nor
could we locate any external evidence that such practices are common. Instead, to assess
whether this issue may be impacting our main results, we examine subsamples where it is
least likely to be important. First, employees who made claims soon after the implementation
of CA-PFL (in 2005-2010) are less likely to have received such payments as it takes time
for new programs to be incorporated in firm benefit plans, and media coverage of existing



                                              21
employer-provided paid leave policies (mostly at tech companies in California) suggests that
such policies were rare prior to 2010.41 Second, workers in smaller firms are less likely to have
access to such generous supplemental funds, as these employers tend to have more modest
human resource infrastructures. We therefore replicate Figure 5 for the following subsamples:
claimants in 2005-2010, claimants in non-tech companies (we drop NAICS industry code 51,
Information), and claimants in firms with less than 1,000 workers. The results are reported
in Appendix Figures A4, A5, and A6, respectively. In all cases, the pattern of findings for
these subsamples are similar to those for the entire sample, although the estimates are less
precise. Put differently, we find no suggestion that supplemental payments that remove the
kink are driving the main results.


Permutation tests. An important concern for the RK design is the possibility of spurious
effects resulting from non-linearities in the underlying relationship between the outcome and
the assignment variable. To address this concern, we perform a series of permutation tests,
as proposed in recent work by Ganong and Jäger (2017). The idea is to estimate RK models
using placebo kinks at various points in the distribution of base period earnings. Specifically,
we use a sample of women making their first bonding claims with base period earnings within
a $40,000 window of the true kink point, and estimate 150 RK models for each outcome,
using a $4,000 bandwidth surrounding each placebo kink point. All regressions include
year×quarter and week-of-quarter of the claim fixed effects, as in the main specifications
without individual-level controls.42 Note that the permutation tests are estimated as reduced
form models. As such, the placebo kink coefficients are of the opposite sign from those in
our main IV models (which are scaled by negative first stage coefficients).
       Figure 7 presents the results, where the placebo kink points are denoted on the x−axis
normalized relative to the true kink point (i.e., the true kink point is at 0). For log leave
duration and change in log earnings, we do not find any statistically significant estimates
  41
    See, for example: https://tcf.org/content/report/tech-companies-paid-leave/.
  42
    We have also estimated the permutation tests with individual-level controls, which yield similar results
and are available upon request.


                                                    22
using any of the placebo kinks that we consider. For employment in quarter 2 post-leave, we
do observe significant coefficients when we use placebo kinks $2,000 to $4,000 less than the
true kink, suggesting that there may be non-linearities in this outcome function that may
bias the results. By contrast, when we consider the outcomes for which we find the most
robust effects—indicators for employment in the same firm conditional on any employment
and for a subsequent bonding claim—we do not observe any significant placebo coefficients,
while the coefficients in close vicinity to the true kink point are consistently statistically
significant, as in our main results.


Difference-in-difference models. As an alternative to the RK design, we examine es-
timates from difference-in-difference models, which leverage non-linear variation over time
in benefit amounts. Specifically, we use our baseline analysis sample of women with base
period quarterly earnings within a $10, 000 bandwidth of the kink point in every year, and
split them into groups defined by $1,000 bins of real ($2014) base period earnings. We then
estimate versions of the following model:


                         Yiqw = ς0 + ς1 ln(biq ) + %q + ϕEiq × q + ϑw + υiqw                          (5)

for each woman i with a first bonding claim in year×quarter q in week of quarter w. ϕEiq
are fixed effects for the $1,000 base period earnings bins, which in some specifications we
interact with linear trends in q. As before, we include year×quarter and week-of-quarter
fixed effects. The coefficient ς1 represents the effect of a 100 percent increase in the WBA
on the outcome of interest, and is identified using variation in benefit amounts within $1,000
bins of women’s base period quarterly earnings.
       Appendix Table A7 presents the results from these models, for each of our five main
outcomes.43 Broadly speaking, these results—which are based on a different identification
strategy that uses a sample of women with a wider range of base period earnings than
  43
     We have also estimated analogous difference-in-difference models, using the WBA in levels rather than
in logs. Results are similar and available upon request.


                                                   23
our primary RK specifications—are consistent with our main findings. The coefficient for
the effect of the WBA on leave duration is now statistically significant, but the magnitude
is small and comparable to the RK estimates: a 10 percent increase in the WBA increases
maternity leave duration by only 0.2 percent. We also find that a 10 percent rise in the WBA
is associated with a 0.5 percentage point decline in the likelihood of employment in quarter
2 post-claim, which is very small relative to the 87 percent mean (see column (4) of Table 1).
Consistent with the RK results, we further show that the WBA is positively associated with
the likelihood of return to the pre-leave employer conditional on any employment, with a 10
percent increase in the WBA leading to a 2 percentage point rise in this outcome (which is in
the range of estimates suggested by the RK models). We also now find that a 10 percent rise
in the WBA results in a significant 1.5 percent increase in the earnings change from before
to after the leave, an estimate that is larger than those suggested by the RK specifications.
Lastly, we see that a 10 percent higher WBA leads to a 0.8 percentage point higher likelihood
of having a subsequent bonding claim; this estimate is comparable to those from the RK
models. In sum, our results are robust to using an alternative empirical strategy to the RK
method.


6         Conclusion

According to the most recent statistics, only 14 percent of American workers have access to
paid family leave through their employers.44 The fact that the U.S. does not provide any paid
maternity or family leave at the national level—and, in doing so, is an outlier when compared
to other developed countries—has received substantial attention from politicians, policy
advocates, and the press. There exists, however, some access to government-provided unpaid
family leave through the FMLA, implying that understanding the specific consequences of
monetary benefits during leave is of first-order importance to both researchers and policy-
makers. In this paper, we attempt to make progress on this question by estimating the
    44

causal effects of PFL wage replacement rates on maternal leave duration, labor market
outcomes, and future leave-taking among high-earning mothers in California, the first state
to implement its own PFL program.
   We leverage detailed administrative data on the universe of PFL claims linked to quarterly
earnings records together with an RK research design. Comparing outcomes of mothers with
base period earnings below and above the maximum benefit threshold, we find that higher
benefits have zero impacts on leave duration, a result that contrasts sharply with prior evi-
dence from other social insurance programs. We also find some evidence of positive impacts
on the likelihood that mothers return to their pre-leave employers instead of switching to
new firms: conditional on any employment in quarter 2 post-claim, a 10 percent increase in
the WBA raises the likelihood of employment at the pre-leave employer by 0.3 to 5 percent,
depending on specification. Further, benefits during the first period of paid family leave
predict future program use. An additional 10 percent in benefits is associated with a 3 to 7
percent increase in the probability of having a subsequent PFL claim in the following three
years.
   The results reported in this paper serve as an important step toward understanding the
influence of benefit levels on leave duration, subsequent labor market outcomes, and fu-
ture leave-taking for high-earning women in the United States, who are disproportionately
affected by the “motherhood wage penalty” (Anderson et al., 2002; Bertrand et al., 2010;
Hotchkiss et al., 2017; Chung et al., 2017). Our results assuage concerns that wage replace-
ment during family leave may have unintended negative consequences for mothers’ future
labor market outcomes through an increase in time away from work, at least among these
women. Of course, it is important to recognize that these findings may be specific to the
relatively short statutory leave duration permitted under CA-PFL; benefits provided in the
context of much longer leaves—such as those in many European countries—may have differ-
ent effects. Our RK estimates also generate insights on the implications of benefit changes
around the maximum benefit threshold. This evidence is valuable because all existing state


                                             25
PFL programs, as well as the national FAMILY Act proposal, feature similar kinked benefit
schedules. As other jurisdictions have opted for different replacement rates and benefit caps
than California, future research on these other policies will further contribute to our under-
standing about the relationships between PFL benefits and outcomes across the earnings
distribution.

Notes: Sub-figure (a) shows the frequency distribution for women. The x−axis plots normalized base period quarterly
earnings (relative to the earnings threshold in each year) in bins, using $100 bins, and with a $5,000 bandwidth. We display
two tests of the identifying assumptions of the RK design. The first is a standard McCrary test of the discontinuity of the
p.d.f. of the assignment variable (“Discontinuity est.”). The second is a test for discontinuity in the first derivative of the
p.d.f. (“Kink est.”). For both, we report the estimate and the standard error in parentheses. We follow Card et al. (2015b) to
choose the order of the polynomial in these tests. We fit a series of polynomial models of different orders that impose
continuity but allow the first and higher-order derivatives to vary at the threshold, and then select the model with the
smallest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value (3rd order in our case). Sub-figure (b) shows the empirical relationship
between the log weekly benefit amount received and normalized base period earnings for women. The x−axis plots normalized
base period quarterly earnings (in terms of distance to the earnings threshold) in bins, using $100 bins.

Notes: The x−axis plots normalized base period quarterly earnings (relative to the earnings threshold in each year) in bins,
using $100 bins. The y−axis plots the mean of the outcome in each bin. The outcomes are: (1) natural log of leave duration
in weeks, (2) an indicator for the woman being employed in quarter 2 after the claim, (3) an indicator for the woman being
employed in her pre-claim firm in quarter 2 after the claim, conditional on any employment in that quarter, (4) the change in
log earnings from quarters 2-5 before the claim to quarters 2-5 after the claim, and (5) an indicator for any subsequent
bonding claim in the 12 quarters following the first claim.

Notes: These figures show the coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (as horizontal bars) from different RK specifications,
estimated separately with and without individual-level controls. The coefficients and standard errors from these regressions
are reported in Appendix Tables A2, A3, A4, A5, and A6. See notes under Figure 3 for more details about the outcomes. All
regressions include year×quarter and week-of-quarter of the claim fixed effects. The specifications with individual controls
include the following variables: indicators for employee age categories (20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44), dummies for
pre-claim employer industry (NAICS industry groups), and dummies for employer size (1-49, 50-99, 100-499, 500+). The
specification models are: (1) fuzzy IK bandwidth with local linear polynomials, (2) fuzzy IK bandwidth with local quadratic
polynomials, (3) CCT bandwidth with regularization and local linear polynomials, (4) CCT bandwidth with regularization
and local quadratic polynomials, (5) CCT bandwidth without regularization and with local linear polynomials, and (6) CCT
bandwidth without regularization and with local quadratic polynomials. The optimal bandwidths from each specification are
listed.

Notes: These figures show the coefficients (as dark gray triangles) and 95 percent confidence intervals (as light gray triangles)
from RK specifications that use different bandwidths in increments of $500 of normalized quarterly base period earnings
(denoted on the x−axis) and local linear polynomials. All regressions include year×quarter and week-of-quarter of the claim
fixed effects. See notes under Figure 3 for more details about the outcomes.

Notes: These figures show the coefficients (as dark gray lines) and 95 percent confidence intervals (as light gray lines) from
placebo RK specifications with a placebo kink specified in terms of distance from the true kink point (i.e., the true kink point
is at 0 on the x−axis). To estimate the placebo RK specifications, we use a sample of women making their first bonding
claims with base period earnings within a $40,000 window of the true kink point, and estimate placebo RK models for each
outcome, using a $4,000 bandwidth surrounding each placebo kink point. All regressions include year×quarter and
week-of-quarter of the claim fixed effects, as in the main specifications without individual-level controls.

Notes: This table presents the means and standard deviations (in parentheses) of some of the key variables for women making
their first PFL bonding claims during 2005-2014 with base period earnings within the bandwidths listed at the top of each
column. We make the following sample restrictions: (1) We only include women who are aged 20-44 at the time of the first
bonding claim; (2) We drop women employed in industries in which employees are least likely to be subject to the SDI tax—
private household workers, elementary and secondary school teachers, and public administration; (3) We drop women with zero
total earnings in the base period quarters.

Notes: The x−axis plots normalized base period quarterly earnings (relative to the earnings threshold in each year) in bins, using $100
bins. In sub-figures (a) and (b), the y−axis plots the mean of the covariate in each bin. In sub-figure (c), the y−axis plots the count of
women in the health industry in each bin.

Notes: These figures show the coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (as horizontal bars) from different RK specifications, estimated
separately with and without individual-level controls. The coefficients and standard errors are for the effect of a $100 increase in the
WBA. See notes under Figure 3 for more details about the outcomes. All regressions include year×quarter and week-of-quarter of the
claim fixed effects. The specifications with individual controls include the following variables: indicators for employee age categories
(20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44), dummies for pre-claim employer industry (NAICS industry groups), and dummies for employer size
(1-49, 50-99, 100-499, 500+). The specification models are: (1) fuzzy IK bandwidth with local linear polynomials, (2) fuzzy IK bandwidth
with local quadratic polynomials, (3) CCT bandwidth with regularization and local linear polynomials, (4) CCT bandwidth with
regularization and local quadratic polynomials, (5) CCT bandwidth40    without regularization and with local linear polynomials, and (6)
CCT bandwidth without regularization and with local quadratic polynomials. The optimal bandwidths from each specification are listed.

Notes: These figures show the coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (as vertical bars) from separate regression models that use the
fuzzy IK with a local linear polynomial specification. As outcomes, sub-figures (a) and (b) use indicators for employment and
employment in the pre-claim firm (conditional on any employment) in quarters 2 through 5 post-claim, as listed on the x−axis.
Sub-figure (c) uses indicators for any subsequent bonding claim by the quarter listed on the x−axis. All regressions include year×quarter
and week-of-quarter of the claim fixed effects.

Notes: These figures show the coefficients (as dark gray triangles) and 95 percent confidence intervals (as light gray triangles) from RK
specifications that use different bandwidths in increments of $500 of normalized quarterly base period earnings (denoted on the x−axis).
The sample is limited to claims made in 2005-2010 only. All regressions include year×quarter and week-of-quarter of the claim fixed
effects.

Notes: This table uses data from the 2005-2014 American Communities Survey (ACS) and presents means and standard deviations (in
parentheses) of characteristics of mothers who are comparable to our main analysis sample of female bonding claimants in the EDD data.
We limit to mothers of children under age 1 in California and make restrictions similar to those that we make in the EDD data: (1) We
only include women who are aged 20-44; (2) We drop women employed in industries in which employees are least likely to be subject to the
SDI tax—private household workers, elementary and secondary school teachers, and public administration; (3) We drop women with zero
reported earnings in the previous year. We use each woman’s prior year earnings to calculate her average quarterly earnings (by dividing
by four), and then use that to find her place in the prior year’s benefit schedule (and assign her to the appropriate kink point). We report
statistics for women with earnings in the bandwidths listed at the top of each column. All statistics are weighted using ACS person weights.

     bottom panel includes the following controls: indicators for employee age categories (20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44), dummies for pre-claim employer industry (NAICS
     industry groups), and dummies for employer size (1-49, 50-99, 100-499, 500+). The specifications are: (1) fuzzy IK bandwidth with local linear polynomials, (2) fuzzy
     IK bandwidth with local quadratic polynomials, (3) CCT bandwidth with regularization and local linear polynomials, (4) CCT bandwidth with regularization and local
     quadratic polynomials, (5) CCT bandwidth without regularization and with local linear polynomials, and (6) CCT bandwidth without regularization and with local
     quadratic polynomials. We also report the first stage coefficients and standard errors, the dependent variable means, and the main and pilot bandwidths. The pilot
     bandwidth is used in the bias estimation part of the main bandwidth selection procedure. Robust standard errors are in parentheses.

     Notes: Each coefficient in each panel and column is from a separate regression, using the change in log earnings from quarters 2-5 before the claim to quarters 2-5 after
     the claim. The WBA is expressed as the natural log of $2014 dollars. The top panel only includes year×quarter and week-of-quarter of the claim fixed effects and
     no individual controls, while the bottom panel includes the following controls: indicators for employee age categories (20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44), dummies for
     pre-claim employer industry (NAICS industry groups), and dummies for employer size (1-49, 50-99, 100-499, 500+). The specifications are: (1) fuzzy IK bandwidth
     with local linear polynomials, (2) fuzzy IK bandwidth with local quadratic polynomials, (3) CCT bandwidth with regularization and local linear polynomials, (4) CCT
     bandwidth with regularization and local quadratic polynomials, (5) CCT bandwidth without regularization and with local linear polynomials, and (6) CCT bandwidth
     without regularization and with local quadratic polynomials. We also report the first stage coefficients and standard errors, the dependent variable means, and the main
     and pilot bandwidths. The pilot bandwidth is used in the bias estimation part of the main bandwidth selection procedure. Robust standard errors are in parentheses.
